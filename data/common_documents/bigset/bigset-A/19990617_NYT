SWAT TEAM: SPURS' TWIN TOWES MAUL THE KNICKS

   SAN ANTONIO _ The San ntonio Spurs flaunted their good health,
depth and size until the patchwork Knicks frayed at the edges and
came undone Wednesday night at the Alamodome, 89-77, in Game 1 of
the National Basketball Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Knicks have lost a Game 1 through four
series of their improbable playoff run, but this was also their
first glance at the Spurs' David Robinson and Tim Duncan, a mighty
pair of 7-footers. Duncan finished with 33 points and 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, who pulled to within 6 points of the Spurs with 8
minutes left before folding under foul trouble, were led by Allan
Houston and Latrell Sprewell, both with 19 points. But Sprewell had
six turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have to shake off their miseries and play the Spurs
in Game 2 Friday night at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were in dire need of manpower before the game began
and received a lift when Johnson determined that he could at least
provide a presence. It was a limited version of Johnson due to the
sprained right knee he has been nursing for five days, but he
started and was able to absorb some fouls for a Knicks team that
was vulnerable to the attrition factor with an injured Patrick
Ewing on the bench in a suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same as when Patrick was playing hurt, and he was
doing what he could to help us win,'' said Van Gundy, referring to
how Ewing played with a sore Achilles' tendon until it tore two
weeks ago. ``Even if Larry can't look as good as he would like,
that unselfishness goes a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Unselfishness was the mantra of a Knicks team that stepped on
the court undaunted by the looming Twin Towers and the ominous odds
it was facing. Even in pre-game warm-ups, there was a sense that
their us-against-the-world mentality was in the air _ literally _
as Sprewell was exploding for vicious dunks and landing with a
snarl on his face.
</P>
<P>
   He was ready, but so was the low-key Houston and the unlikely
menace in the paint, Chris Dudley. But the adrenaline rush that
kept the Knicks with the Spurs in the first half began to get
undermined by foul trouble as the break neared. The deep Spurs were
just getting warmed up. Leaning on Duncan and Robinson, they went
on a 14-2 run to take a 45-37 lead at the half. The Knicks were
going to have to gamble with their foul trouble. At the break,
Johnson, Houston and Camby had three fouls each.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs knew who was who. They drove right at Houston _ who
had 14 first-half points _ to start the third quarter. Mario Elie
slipped by him for a layup to put the Spurs up by 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio held that edge as Duncan took the game over. If he
wasn't fading away for jumpers over Johnson, he was the receiver of
a lob pass from Robinson and popping up between two defenders for a
layup. The latter left Van Gundy calling a timeout with 4:43 left
in the third, and the Knicks down, 60-50.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs went up by 12 points, but then Camby made an impact.
He darted in for a tip-in and then stripped Robinson on a play that
led to a fast-break basket by Sprewell. On the next possession,
Sprewell, beating Sean Elliott down the floor, hit an off-kilter
jumper and pulled the Knicks within 7, at 67-60. A 3-point play by
Jaren Jackson gave the Spurs some separation and helped them take a
71-63 lead into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were staying within range. Their strategy all along
was to keep themselves in the game just long enough to give
themselves a chance for a clutch finish.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks began with the right mentality. All or nothing. After
the Spurs pounded the ball inside to Robinson to grab a 5-point
lead in the opening minutes, Dudley emerged and turned the tempo of
the game around. He blocked shots, forced turnovers and came up
with rebounds to feed the fast-break hungry Knicks. Sprewell and
Houston took it from there and tied the game with four minutes left
in the first.
</P>
<P>
   As the aggressors, the Knicks drove into the paint for layups
when Robinson was resting. When Robinson's wingspan was in play,
the Knicks drove and kicked the ball out to the perimeter. By the
end of the first quarter, the Knicks were eating away at the
league's best defense by shooting 52 percent, ignoring the size
differential with nine more rebounds, and took a 27-21 lead on the
heels of a 16-6 run.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a joint packed with people _ some sitting on an angle
behind the curtain that divided the dome _ could see the favored
Spurs were up against a team that wasn't about to back down.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks watched as the Spurs went on a 10-3 lead to regain
the lead while Camby picked up his third foul and went to the bench
five minutes into the second quarter. Once again, Dudley _ playing
smart and foul free for most of the half _ came up with the
rebounds to start the Knicks back on the fast break. Sprewell
pulled up for a jumper over a soft defender, Elliott. Then Houston
slipped past an overeager Mario Elie and knocked down a jumper
after the Knicks got the ball back when the diminutive Childs stood
in front of Robinson and drew a charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks held a 35-31 lead and threatened to pull ahead at the
break. But the Spurs went back to Robinson and Duncan, both of whom
bludgeoned the Knicks inside to give the Spurs a 39-35 lead. The
Knicks were floating into choppy waters now. Foul trouble was
gaining on them, leaving Van Gundy to insert the 41-year-old Herb
Williams into the game for a clumsy last 1:30 of the half.
</P>
<P>
   In that span, the assertive Spurs _ who were creating their own
fast-break attempts off blocked shots and Knicks misses _ finished
the half with a 6-0 run and took a 45-37 lead at halftime. The
Knicks scored just one field goal in the last 4:12 of the first
half. At this point, Duncan had a quiet 19 points around the
defense of Kurt Thomas and Johnson, while Robinson added 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, whose gaudy field-goal percentage plummeted in the
second quarter, finished the half shooing 38.6 percent with Houston
leading the team with 14 points, while Sprewell added 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   This was part of what the Knicks feared. They were playing all
out, and still the Spurs were able to go to their big men inside
and make up for any runs the Knicks could pull out of their hat.
This is what the Knicks had to do, create something from nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were the underdogs in this series for a reason. The
Spurs had all the size, health and depth. And they had almost
40,000 fans on their side. The Knicks had a lot of work to do if
they were going to take their fourth Game 1 of the playoffs on the
road and put the pressure on the Spurs. The Spurs had a 10-day
layoff, but after stumbling around a bit in the face of a
determined opponent, they were showing why so many wondered if
destiny was still on the side of the Knicks.

SOME OLD DIFFERENCES ON KNICKS RESURFACE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Beneath the feel-good atmosphere created by the
New York Knicks' opportunity to play for the NBA championship,
there is lingering uncertainty over coach Jeff Van Gundy's future
and the impact his strained relationships with Latrell Sprewell and
Marcus Camby may have on it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Knicks' 89-77 Game 1 loss to San Antonio Wednesday,
they were greeted with questions about a report in the current
issue of Sports Illustrated. Sprewell, the magazine reported, has
told teammates that he does not want to play for Van Gundy next
year and that if Van Gundy returns, he wants to be traded to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where that came from but it's not true,''
Sprewell said before the Knicks' shoot-around this morning. ``I
never said it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was asked if at any point during the season _ perhaps
when his frustration with his sixth-man role was at its peak _ he
indicated a desire to be traded should Van Gundy return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I've ever said was that I prefer starting,''
Sprewell said. ``That wasn't really a problem with Jeff, it was
something I preferred. It took me a while to adjust. That was the
only thing that was ever there between him and I.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, that issue is dead. As a result of Patrick Ewing's
injury diagnosis after Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals
against Indiana, Van Gundy placed Sprewell in the starting lineup.
Sprewell has continued to play well and appears happy, basking in
the glow of a comeback from his tarnished image in the nation's
largest market. Add to that his flair for the dramatic dunk, and
companies are knocking down his door to be their pitchman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of offers,'' his agent, Robert Gist, said
Wednesday. ``And some of them ask, `Is he going to be with the
Knicks next year?' He wants to be back. He loves the fans there.
There are a lot of reasons for him to stay. I'm optimistic that
everything will work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, next year has entered our minds. But we'll take a step
back and watch and see how things evolve. Everything will be taken
into consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes Sprewell's role when Ewing comes back from his
injury. Will Ewing's return mean that Sprewell will go back to
sixth man in his contract year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we don't go back and repeat history,'' Gist said. ``How
could anyone want to change what has taken place and go back to the
old way of doing things? As a result of what's happened this year,
all Latrell has done is increase his value. There could be 16 to 18
teams in line for him. I don't think the Knicks want to lose him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a way to get Latrell and the Knicks on the
same page. When this team is on the same page, they're an awesome
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point after the season, Sprewell and Camby are expected
to express their views on Van Gundy to Dave Checketts, the
president of Madison Square Garden. Although Camby has publicly
kept his feelings about Van Gundy quiet, he has privately expressed
dismay over what one friend described as Van Gundy's early personal
bias against him after he came to the Knicks in the emotional trade
of Charles Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be helpful if Jeff tried to establish some
relationship with Marcus, like he has built with Larry Johnson and
Patrick Ewing over the years,'' the friend said, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ``Right now, there's no relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it would seem that Van Gundy, who has already earned an
automatic $3.5 million extension beyond the $2 million he has left
on his contract next year, has all the leverage to return as coach
of the Knicks if that is what he wants after dealing with the
cloak-and-dagger operations of the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Typically focused on the task at hand, Van Gundy shrugged off
the Sports Illustrated article.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only thinking about this year,'' Van Gundy said. ``I'm
sure Latrell is only thinking about this year. Next year will work
itself out. It always does. And sometimes it does so in unexpected
ways. But I'll say this, I have no problem with Latrell at all,
never have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Latrell has had a problem not starting. I understand
that. Any great player would have a problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsolicited, Van Gundy then dropped Camby's name into his
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Marcus and I, or Latrell and I having a problem?
No,'' he said. ``I think they have been unhappy at times. With
Latrell, it has been more about how he's been used, as far as not
starting. And Marcus, it's with not playing as much as he would
like. But it's never been a problem at practice where they've been
uncoachable or been less than anything about the team. They've been
all about the team. They've been great.''
</P>
<P>
   All is well for now.

SPORTS COLUMN: COMBATANTS A MYSTERY UNTIL NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It took too long, but Game 1 arrived at last,
along with the news that Tim Duncan is as good as advertised. No
surprise, really. Or that Larry Johnson's sprained knee ligament
had miraculously healed. If we'd waited much longer for the finals
to begin, Phil Jackson would've found a cure for Shaquille O'Neal's
free-throw shooting disease, or the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   Sit around long enough, you start to believe anything. The Spurs
were even suspicious that Patrick Ewing was taking limping lessons
in case he is needed to make the first two jump shots of Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the guys around here, we joke that Patrick's going to
do the Willis Reed thing,'' said the Spurs' Jaren Jackson, who made
his own opening impression with fourth-quarter shooting as San
Antonio defeated the Knicks, 89-77, kicking off the finals that
should have begun last Sunday night when most Eastern time zone
children weren't asleep. One would think that the league would want
the first post-Jordan finals to get maximum exposure, especially to
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Tell it to the Commissioner, Dick Ebersol.
</P>
<P>
   David Stern, the NBC honcho's partner-in-patronage, once said
that no finals game should ever end after anyone's late-night news.
That strategy has apparently gone the way of the 100-point offense,
with the games beginning after most East Coast kids and even a few
working parents have gone to bed. Had the series commenced last
Sunday and not skipped next Sunday, three of the possible seven
games could have begun at 7:30 in the East and finished at 7:30 in
the West. Something for the fans, to conclude a season that began
three months late. Does anyone even remember the lockout?
</P>
<P>
   Stern has always wanted his championship series to develop the
cachet of the World Series and, by golly, it has. His first
showcase flirted dangerously with spilling into the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. This series actually has a quaint, old World Series
feel to it. The Knicks and Spurs did not meet during the 50-game
regular-season contrivance. It felt as if the teams were from rival
leagues, the establishment Knicks against the first descendants of
the old American Basketball Association to advance this far.
</P>
<P>
   Before baseball panicked into interleague play, the Series was
always guaranteed to contain a freshness other sports lacked in
their championship events. It was a novelty to see the Yankees
confront the Braves in 1996. It was a pleasure to have Tony Gwynn
walk into Yankee Stadium and get caught up in its history, like
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks fans were waiting Wednesday night with their
sophisticate's curiosity and provincial dread to find out about
Duncan. It took one night, as Duncan quietly torched the
stressed-out Knicks front line for 33 points and 16 rebounds,
leading a 14-2 run that gave the Spurs a 45-37 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen the Knicks, but the good thing is that they
haven't seen us either,'' Duncan said. ``By the time the teams are
used to each other, the series will be coming to a close.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't saying it was going to be short or sweet, because
there was just no way to know anything until these teams finally
hit the Alamodome court. Only then could the Knicks know that
Duncan is poised beyond his years. On the other hand, they quickly
and happily discovered that the Spurs are awfully thin beyond
Duncan and David Robinson. When one was on the bench, Allan Houston
and Latrell Sprewell were every bit as dangerous as they were in
the three series' past.
</P>
<P>
   Don Chaney, the Knicks' assistant coach, once traded Dennis
Rodman for Sean Elliott when he was coaching in Detroit. He
received an injured player who did not appear to be tough enough to
play in the more physical East. Was it Elliott's bad back, or was
he also too soft? Elliott's scoreless first half on one shot was a
good Knick omen.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to know if Marcus Camby could soar over the
Spurs' front line as he did Indiana's, but Camby's no-rebound first
half and gamelong foul trouble suggested a quick adjustment was in
order. Larry Johnson actually looked pretty limber, but was
overmatched guarding Robinson in the first half and Duncan in the
second. A very bad Knick omen, and, for Jeff Van Gundy, the
anticipated matchups nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was decided Wednesday night, but the first impression
was that the eighth-seeded Cinderella may be coming to the end of
the ball. A few strokes, unfortunately, before midnight back home.

JACKSON MAKES GOOD IMPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ If Phil Jackson's first day on the job
with the Los Angeles Lakers is any indication of what will unfold
in upcoming seasons, then this troubled team might be destined to
once again become the dominant NBA presence it was during the
Showtime era.
</P>
<P>
   In his Laker coming out press party staged Wednesday in the
International Ballroom at the Beverly Hilton, Jackson worked the
large gathering of sportswriters, sportscasters, agents, attorneys,
photographers, hangers-on, Howard Stern props, sports talk radio
buffoons and the usual gate-crashers with a practiced smoothness
that his Laker coaching predecessors, Del Harris and Kurt Rambis,
never were able to display.
</P>
<P>
   ``After listening to Phil talk, I now know why he's a great
coach and why the Bull players loved him and why the Bulls won six
world titles,'' said an admiring spectator, Mr. Magic Johnson,
after Jackson had concluded his session with the media. ``In the
past, the Lakers could lay the blame on their coach for their
failures. No more. Now it's up to the Lakers to shut up and play
because I think they have one of the greatest coaches in NBA
history coaching them now.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm still uncertain about that, but the Lakers indisputably now
have a man leading them with almost a Churchillian facility with
the English language, a true Zen master at rhetorical acrobatics in
which he leaves you shaking your noggin in admiration of his
eclectic mixture of sly locutions, deft euphemisms, wry humor and
florid asides.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Michael Jordan loved this guy!
</P>
<P>
   After listening to his eloquent blarney for more than 30
minutes---had I closed my eyes, I could have sworn it was William
Jefferson Clinton without the Arkansas drawl---I loved the guy,
too!
</P>
<P>
   And here's wagering that Shaquille O'Neal also will love him and
actually do what Jackson will want him to do---play sounder
defense, practice harder on his free throws, cease with the cloying
excuses for his teams' annual failures, lose all those unflattering
pounds and get in legitimate shape.
</P>
<P>
   I also have an overwhelming feeling that Kobe Bryant will do
something he's never done before, either---actually listen to his
coach and actually subordinate his vast skills for the overall good
of his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling that Jackson will make a huge impact on the
Lakers,'' said Magic Johnson. ``How's any player going to argue
with this guy with six rings on his fingers? There's a commanding
presence about him. I'm excited for the team. This is just what it
has needed. A guy who's been there, and knows the game
thoroughly.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about Jackson's X's and O's expertise---Michael
Jordan's heroics seem to supply him with all the X's and O's
knowledge he ever needed---but I now know first hand about his
oratory skills that border on grandiloquence.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, he said all the right things during the interview
ritual without offending anyone in the process---yes, the Lakers
were the right team for him because they had a potential MVP in
Shaquille O'Neal and a Michael Jordan-like player in Kobe Bryant,
yes, it would be just great to work with Jerry West and Mitch
Kupchack, yes, it was nice to be in sunny Southern California and
by the beaches, yes, he expects the Lakers to become a serious NBA
title threat immediately, no, he wouldn't compare West and Jerry
Krause (Bulls' GM), etc.
</P>
<P>
   When Joe McDonnell asked Jackson if it were ethical of him to be
interviewed by the New York Knicks' boss, Dave Checketts while Jeff
Van Gundy still was coaching the team, he rambled on for a minute
and a half without answering the question. But he sounded terrific
doing it, and you weren't aware of his evasive tactics until you
checked your notes.
</P>
<P>
   He took a similar filibustering tack when someone asked him who
he thought would win the NBA finals between the Knicks and San
Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about what a wonderful storybook story the Knicks were
and how powerful the Spurs were, but slyly failed to offer a
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   When the Howard Stern stooge, Melrose Larry Green, asked him if
he were going to rise at 3 a.m. to catch Stern's show live, he
replied coolly, ``I don't deign to listen to Howard Stern, although
I catch (Don) Imus once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about bringing a couple of his former Bull players
like Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, to the Lakers, he said,
``Probably not. Scottie's got his own thing going, and Dennis is I
think in another ozone.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that this Phil Jackson is a slick one, a
immensely intelligent fellow who reportedly could have made twice
as much money---he signed a five-year contract with the Lakers for
a reported $30 million---had he accepted an offer with the New
Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson is quite aware that the New Jersey Nets have no one
who faintly resembles Shaquille O'Neal, or even Kobe Bryant---and
that the Nets aren't anywhere near being a formidable team and that
his legacy of coaching greatness would be seriously tarnished at
such a place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers are much like the Bulls were when he took over in
Chicago in 1989---just on the verge of being champions,'' said
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson knows the Lakers are only a sound point guard, a
reliable power forward and a change in outlook by Shaquille O'Neal
and Kobe Bryant away from being serious NBA title threats.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson knows that coaches in the NBA don't win championships
without talented personnel, and he knows the Lakers have a solid
enough foundation in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have to make a few roster adjustments,'' he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson was flawless in his Laker debut.
</P>
<P>
   The Laker owner, Jerry Buss, finally has snapped out of his
strange administrative slump with this surprising hiring of
Jackson, surprising in that Buss was willing to spend so much money
to secure Jackson's services.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Jerry Buss who did everything it took to make the
Lakers a championship team throughout the 1980s, not the Jerry Buss
who dragged out contract negotiations needlessly with Jerry West
and nixed West's trade for Mitch Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excuses are now over for the Lakers,'' observed Magic
Johnson. ``If Phil Jackson can't win with the team, no one will.''

SPREWELL AND HOUSTON SENDING OUT AN SOS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ When they were finding seams in the defense in the
first half of Game 1 Wednesday night and knocking down jump shots,
Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston were exploiting the one clear
mismatch the Knicks have over the Spurs in the National Basketball
Association finals.
</P>
<P>
   They can't do anything about Tim Duncan; he is simply too good.
And David Robinson is going to eventually get to the free throw
line, so the Knicks can forget about completely neutralizing him,
too. So much for the frontcourt matchup. That the Knicks would
concede.
</P>
<P>
   But on the perimeter, it was different. They had scorers and
creators, players who could get to the basket and draw a foul. It
was thought to be their one great chance at upsetting the
multifaceted Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as the Chicago Bulls learned over the last decade,
two potent scorers on the perimeter can compensate for any quality
dropoff at point guard or center. And for the Knicks to not only
compete, but to pull off a monumental upset, they need Sprewell and
Houston to play extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   They had combined for 33 points through three quarters on
Wednesday night, with Sprewell going on a third-quarter binge and
Houston often making a gambling Mario Elie pay. That kind of
productivity should have been a harbinger of great things to come
for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But when your other offensive options have trouble producing,
it's tough to keep pace with a good team like San Antonio. Charlie
Ward, Chris Dudley, a gimpy Larry Johnson and Kurt Thomas did not
give the Knicks enough offensively to seize Game 1 at the
Alamodome, and an 89-77 loss left the Knicks wondering what they
could do to stop the Spurs over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have caught too many bounces and good breaks this
post-season to fold easily in the finals. Even in the fourth
quarter Wednesday night, they were within striking distance of at
least making it interesting.
</P>
<P>
   But after Sprewell and Houston essentially had to monopolize the
basketball because no one else could score, you half-expect the two
natural shooting guards to send out an SOS to their Knick brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell and Houston each scored 19 points, combining for nearly
half of the Knicks' total points. They kept New York in the game in
the first half and were relied upon exclusively in the final
quarter to help bring the Knicks out of a deep rut.
</P>
<P>
   But they need help. That much is clear.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three rounds of the playoffs, the Knicks found ways
to win on the road in Game 1. They did it by moving the ball around
and finding the open man. No matter who that player was, he would
usually knock down an open shot with the game in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs get a lot of credit for their defense, which was
menacing and impenetrable at the ends of the second and fourth
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was Elie bodying up Houston or Sean Elliott flailing
his arms to disrupt Sprewell, they put serious kinks in the Knicks'
game. Chris Childs and Ward never really made themselves serious
threats, either.
</P>
<P>
   This was more about the Knicks' inability to generate points at
crucial moments of the game than any tremendous defensive stop by
Duncan or Robinson. Thomas began to show signs of life near the
end, scoring on his patented arching jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson, who surprised everyone by rehabilitating his knee
injury in five days and starting on Wednesday night, gets a pass.
He did all he could given the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing he is not completely healthy and that his performance
might suffer, Johnson could have easily have taken this week to
rest the aching knee and play in Game 3 in New York on Monday. But
Johnson, realizing perhaps that playing in the league championship
series only comes around once for many star-crossed souls, saw the
chance to play and seized it. He made the most of a fleeting
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their contributions and those of Sprewell and Houston,
though, the rest of the Knicks have 48 hours to fix their broken
offensive games. Going home to Madison Square Garden in an 0-2 hole
would be rough.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks should not take their own opportunity for granted.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand scheme, they might not be a contending team for the
millennium. Instead, they may be a combustible bunch of veterans
and role players who have ridden an unpredictable tsunami of
momentum into the championship round.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, two months before New York was joyfully celebrating
this team, it was uniformly denigrating it. Somewhere between San
Antonio, Here We Come, and Back Up the Truck, there is a middle
ground.
</P>
<P>
   If this wacky lockout season proves anything, it's that you
can't be too sure of your franchise's future today because tomorrow
it may headed toward destruction through free agency, turmoil or
both. Treasure the good times, because lean days may not be far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   As the Knicks take the court Friday night for Game 2 of their
implausible run, they should be mindful of that.

DUNCAN TOO MUCH, AS KNICKS DISCOVER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ By halftime, he had already recorded an entire
game's worth of statistics, already established himself as the man
who would control this NBA championship series, already shown why
this San Antonio Spurs team might not lose another game this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan, the quiet and unassuming 7-footer, was simply too
much for the Knicks to handle, especially with Patrick Ewing
cheering from the sidelines in a suit. Scoring on jump shots from 9
to 20 feet out, layups off offensive rebounds, and one wicked
finger roll, Duncan finished with 33 points and 16 rebounds in the
Spurs' 89-77 victory over the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The calm and efficient showing was a glimpse into the future of
the N BA, the league Duncan, 23, will likely dominate for years to
come. Wednesday night, he was the youngest starter on the court yet
at the same time, the most collected.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, when his teammates were struggling and the
undermanned Knicks were playing beyond themselves, he almost
single-handedly kept the Spurs from falling into a hole as
cavernous as the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   After the Knicks jumped to a surprising 27-21 lead after one
quarter, Duncan put his club on his back, outscoring the Knicks by
himself in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   His 11 points was one more than the Knicks managed in the entire
quarter. He scored nine of them in the final four minutes to lift
the Spurs to a 45-37 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   His solo run started when he lofted a driving finger roll over a
falling Chris Dudley with 3 minutes 54 seconds left. Moments later,
he drew a foul, then sank the ensuing free throws. Next, he
finished a pass from David Robinson with a soft layup. After
baskets by Robinson and Antonio Daniels, he sank a jumper from the
top of the key, then hit one of two fouls shots.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not just Duncan's scoring that turned the tide of
this game and enabled the Spurs to build their cushion. With Kurt
Thomas grabbing seven rebounds, the Knicks dominated the backboards
in the first quarter, outrebounding the Spurs by 15-7, including
5-1 on the offensive glass.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, however, put an end to the Knicks' fun by equaling their
rebounding total in the second quarter with seven. His board work
allowed the Spurs to outrebound the Knicks by 14-7. Duncan's
splendid quarter gave him 19 points and 10 rebounds by halftime.
More impressively, he did it on just 10 field goal attempts,
hitting seven of them.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliance of Duncan was that he did his damage in the flow
of the Spurs offense. In fact, early on San Antonio looked like it
wanted to feature Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly trying to get Larry Johnson in foul trouble, Robinson
relentlessly drove the ball at the basket to draw two fouls on
Johnson within the game's first three minutes. The Spurs' never
seemed to force the ball to Duncan, but with the Knicks' covering
him one-on-one with Dudley, Thomas and Camby, the ball found its
way to him.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a good thing for the Spurs because besides Robinson,
who scored 11 of his 13 points in the first half, no one else in a
white and black uniform was doing anything. That changed in the
second half, though, when the Knicks were forced to pay more
attention to Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Sending another defender at Duncan once he got the ball, the
Knicks left the perimeter open and Spurs like Jaren Jackson and
Sean Elliott began finding the range. Duncan, who is not a great
passer out of double teams _ yet, proved more than adequate in the
second half, kicking out assists to both Elliott and Jackson for
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the reserve guard, was also outstanding, hitting 5 of
10 3-pointers, including four in the second half, to finish with 17
points. With any one of the Spurs' wing players shooting like that,
and Duncan playing his typically remarkably game, San Antonio will
be incredibly tough to beat.

KC SCHOOL BOARD TO INTERVIEW FOUR CANDIDATES FOR SUPERINTENDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR 
and TANIKA WHITE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four finalists for Kansas City school superintendent will
interview privately with the Board of Education on Friday, but
members say a selection probably will not be made for several
weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board members received the resumes of four candidates in a
closed meeting late Tuesday. A candidate screening committee said
it may submit additional names to the school board next week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board members declined to release the names of the finalists,
citing instructions from U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple to keep
the candidates confidential. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   School board President John Rios confirmed that Pascal Forgione
Jr., currently a U.S. education commissioner, is among the four. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board members and others familiar with the candidates said two
have nontraditional backgrounds for an urban superintendent. One is
a former high-ranking officer in the military. Another has a law
degree and does not work in public education. The fourth is a
longtime educator. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several large urban districts, including Seattle, San Diego,
Chicago and Washington, D.C., have turned to nontraditional
superintendents in recent years with mixed success. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to look at all of them,'' board member Sandy Mayer
said Wednesday. ``I'm pleased with what I've seen. I think we have
a good selection to choose from. And there may be some more.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The interviews will be held at offices of Blackwell Sanders
Peper Martin, one of the district's legal counsels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several school board members said it could be the end of the
month before all interviews are completed. At that point, district
lawyers will conduct a background check on the finalist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some board members and Whipple said they wanted to avoid a
repeat of the haste that led to the hiring of Henry Williams in
August 1996. Williams clashed almost immediately with some board
members and eventually took a buyout with a year remaining on a
three-year contract. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, the school board voted to give the district's
current instructional leader, Phyllis Chase, a 90-day extension on
her contract, which expires June 30. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mayer and Helen Ragsdale voted against the extension. Board
member Fifi Wiedeman abstained. The board did not discuss a similar
extension for Bonnie McKelvy, who oversees the district's business
and finances. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Desegregation Monitoring Committee still must approve
Chase's contract extension, which calls for her to continue at her
$125,000 salary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, several board members said they discussed removing
Rios as president. Member Lance Loewenstein said he asked Rios to
step down during a break in the school board meeting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loewenstein and other board members said they were angered and
embarrassed by comments Rios made during a court hearing Tuesday
with Whipple. Some members said Rios' comments were only the latest
evidence of his inability to lead the board. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Rios criticized the DMC. Whipple, who
appointed the three-member panel, said Rios lacked evidence to back
up the allegation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rios said Wednesday that he had no intention of stepping down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way,'' Rios said. ``I'm board president and expect
to be board president until my term ends.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forgione also can expect some pointed inquiries about his
leadership. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several board members have expressed concern about his failure
to file his tax returns in a timely way for eight consecutive
years. Officials in the Clinton administration have cited the tax
issue as the reason Forgione was not reappointed as the
commissioner overseeing the National Center for Education
Statistics, which collects, analyzes and disseminates education
data. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forgione has acknowledged he missed the filing deadline but said
he was always due a refund and violated no federal tax laws. Other
educators contend Forgione was not reappointed as punishment for
criticizing Vice President Al Gore over the release of test score
data. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forgione could not be reached Wednesday for comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other board members also were angered that Arthur A. Benson II
had met with Forgione before some board members even knew he was a
candidate. Benson is the attorney for the plaintiff schoolchildren
in the federal desegregation case, &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forgione interviewed last Friday with the Austin Board of
Education in Texas but was not chosen as a finalist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the monitoring committee considered but rejected
sending only Forgione's name to the school board for consideration.
That led Rios to question whether Forgione is the favored
candidate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to review (the other candidates) and see exactly if
they're qualified candidates or just individuals thrown out there
for us to sort through to get the other guy,'' Rios said. &QL;

 Maurice Greene tramples world 100-meter record  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM PEDLEY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maurice Greene carried the title of ``World's Fastest Human''
into Wednesday's running of the 100 meters in Athens, Greece. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greene carried the title of ``History's Fastest Human'' out of
the meet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old sprinter from Kansas City, Kan., covered the
distance in 9.79 seconds. That trashed the 3-year-old record of
9.84 set by Canadian Donovan Bailey in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greene said in a telephone interview late Wednesday night that
as he crossed the finish line, he was not thinking about the
record. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, Ato (Boldon, his teammate, training partner and friend)
came over and said, `It's legal, it's legal,' '' Greene said.
``That's when I looked up at the scoreboard.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And smiled. ``Very excited,'' he said. ``I was very excited.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And then, he celebrated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who attended Schlagle High in Kansas City, Kan., looked
for an American flag to wave, but couldn't find one. So, he grabbed
the banner of his track club _ Handling Speed Intelligently _ and
basked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of his coaches, Darrell Smith, said that when the scoreboard
flashed the news, ``the place exploded.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There were upward of 40,000 people there,'' Smith said. ``When
he crossed the finish line and everybody looked at the clock, it
became a madhouse. There were television people and photographers
running all over the place.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in Kansas City, Kan., Greene's first call to his mother
went unanswered. Nobody home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A second call a while later got through. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said, Jackie Greene was ``very excited'' too. &QL;

JACKSON IN, EXCUSES OUT FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ A fawning crowd gathered in the hotel
ballroom to fete its candidate. When he arrived, flanked by
security men wearing earpieces and scowls, the applause that
welcomed him left no doubt he was the people's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson received a reception fit for a presidential
candidate Wednesday when he was introduced as the L.A. Lakers' 15th
coach. About the only thing missing was a high school band
serenading him with ``Hail to the Chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's buddy, Bill Bradley, whose quest to become the 43rd
president of the U.S. facilitated the ex-Bulls coach's date with
destiny, would be buoyed beyond belief to feel such love when he
addresses local supporters tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity that Jackson created with his acceptance speech
left one admirer, ex-Lakers great Magic Johnson, gushing, ``I was
sitting there with chills, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind all the goose pimples and applause, beyond the obnoxious,
obsequious blathering of a New York radio-show bozo and the camp
characters trying to pass themselves off as journalists and the
clicking of the cameras, one issue sat unaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   History suggests Jackson has only a slightly better chance of
going all the way with the Lakers than a former NBA player does of
ascending to the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Many fine coaches have drawn X's and O's for more than one NBA
team; Pat Riley, Chuck Daly, Lenny Wilkens, Jack Ramsey and Bill
Fitch, to name just a few. But only one coach has guided two
franchises to the NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. product Alex Hannum coaxed St. Louis to the championship in
1957-58 and cajoled Philadelphia to the crown nine seasons later.
Reached at his home in San Diego Wednesday, Hannum, a product of
Hamilton High and USC, said it's an awfully tall order for anyone,
puncturing the ``superstar aura'' that covers the L.A. basin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole aura of L.A., with its spotlight on superstars, it
hasn't been the right formula,'' Hannum said. ``Personnel-wise, I
think the Lakers have had the players to win (an NBA title) the
last two years. If any coach can get them (over the hump), Phil
Jackson can. He can communicate with the modern athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the Zen master with the Midas touch, can tilt a room
toward him as easily as Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe Bryant. His star
appeal gives him a foot in the door of the Lakers dressing room,
which never opened even a crack for diligent but dull Del Harris or
sassy but suspicious Kurt Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has an edge on his two immediate predecessors in that he
has been the subject of more books than Bryant and he speaks with
as much authority as O'Neal's stepfather, ``Sarge.'' So words
aren't likely to get in the way when he addresses the Lakers' two
young and stubborn stars.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant braved traffic to get here in time to greet Jackson on
Wednesday. He enjoyed a private audience with his new coach before
Jackson met with the press. It was an eloquent gesture by the
20-year-old who is maturing by the minute.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson would later say he is ``intrigued'' by Bryant, who
reminds him ``a lot of Michael Jordan.'' Jackson suggested Bryant
has the same work ethic and competitive spirit as the former Bulls
icon. All he's lacking is experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe is a player still uneducated in basketball and in life,''
Jackson said of the guard who jumped directly from high school to
the NBA in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal didn't make it, but what else is knew?. The Lakers' team
captain also was a no-show for the final team meeting of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably just as well that O'Neal found better things to do
Wednesday. Had he been at the Beverly Hilton, he would have heard
the echoes of Bill Russell in Jackson's observation that the
7-foot-1 center ``can be better, I feel, than he has shown the past
couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   And he would have heard Harris and Rambis being parroted in
Jackson's pronouncement that how well Tex Winter's pass-predicated
triangle offense works for the Lakers will depend on ``how willing
Shaq will be to make his offense not primary but secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannum employed a similar offense in Philadelphia in 1966-67. It
worked like a dream because his big man, Wilt Chamberlain, was
comfortable passing the ball in critical situations. Chamberlain
also switched on defense when he was supposed to, stepping out into
the high post if need be. Indeed, he was a thorn in San Francisco
shooter Nate Thurmond's side throughout the 1967 NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain won two of his four league MVP titles before
Philadelphia's championship season. In one of the 76ers' four
victories in their six-game championship series against San
Francisco, Chamberlain took only six shots. Rick Barry heaved 41 in
the losing effort, leading Chamberlain to note wryly, ``Sometimes
it is actually easier to play against a team that has one man do
most of the shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is _ and this should give Lakers fans a glimmer of
hope _ Chamberlain didn't arrive at that conclusion without a
fight. He and Hannum nearly came to blows in the early 1960s while
arguing the merits of Chamberlain's occasionally serving as a
decoy, the better to involve all of his San Francisco teammates in
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the two men went at each other and had to be
separated by the other players. By the time they were reunited in
Philadelphia a few years later, Chamberlain was wiser and also
wearier, having been denied time and again the NBA's ultimate
prize.
</P>
<P>
   In his desperation he recognized the point that Jackson raised
Wednesday when he said, ``Basketball is not putting your own self
ahead of the team.'' Wherever O'Neal was, Johnson hopes he got the
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq says he wants to win a championship. Kobe has been saying
the same thing,'' Johnson said. ``OK. We're going to find out if
that's all true. It's all on them now. There are no more
excuses.'' &QL;

ITALY'S PANICO AVOIDS LEGEND'S SHADOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CULVER CITY, Calif. _ Throw a United States uniform on her, take
a quick glance and you might mistake Italy's Patrizia Panico for
one of her famous American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   But Panico has more in common with Mia Hamm than merely a slight
facial resemblance. She also has developed into the Italians' best
goal scorer and is labeled as the country's next great player
following the retirement of Carolina Morace two years ago. Panico
makes it clear she is her own player without the pressure of living
in another's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy when they compare me to Carolina,'' Panico said
through an interpreter at the team's hotel Wednesday, ``but I am
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Panico will lead Italy into Sunday's 4 p.m. Women's World Cup
game against Germany at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Panico knows Morace well, having played with the Italian legend
for a year on the national team and later being coached by her on a
Rome-based club team. Morace is one of the world's all-time leading
scorers with 105 international goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being coached by someone who has played in your position,''
Panico said, ``she teaches you all the tricks of the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   But Panico uses quickness and a sly nature in the penalty area
to get the job done, in contrast to Morace, who was more of an
opportunist around the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for her,'' Panico said, ``and what she
did (in her career) is really unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Panico seems poised, however, to pick up where Morace left off.
</P>
<P>
   __ Team to watch: When it comes to Nigeria, much of the
attention has been placed on striker ``Marvelous'' Mercy Akide, who
scored 10 of the team's 28 goals during qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   But as evidenced by the Super Falcons' 4-3 friendly win against
China on Saturday followed by Tuesday's 9-0 rout of a
Torrance-based club team, there is plenty more to consider.
</P>
<P>
   One clear advantage for Nigeria is its speed down the wings and
an ability to run onto through balls with a precision unlike many
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest weapons on every team is speed,'' said
Nigeria coach Ismaila Mabo. ``That is one thing we have been
working on and it is paying dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   An emerging talent is Patience Avre, who scored three goals
against China and created numerous scoring chances Tuesday from the
right wing.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mysterious: North Korea, Nigeria's first opponent Sunday, has
earned the reputation of not being cooperative with the media. It
doesn't seem to be any easier for its foes to find out about the
team's tactics, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know much about them and we haven't watched
any film yet,'' Mabo said. ``But we hope to.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Local outing: Italy's only scheduled scrimmage will take
place this afternoon at Loyola Marymount against a collection of
local players, according to press officer Laura Folchi.
</P>
<P>
   __ Going fast: The World Cup opener between the United States
and Denmark on Saturday at East Rutherford, N.J., is approaching a
sellout.
</P>
<P>
   More than 74,000 tickets have been sold for the doubleheader,
which also features Brazil against Mexico. The stadium seats about
77,000 for soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, more than 460,000 tickets have been sold for the
32-game event that concludes in the Rose Bowl on July 10. If the
U.S. team gets that far, the tournament is likely to break a
half-million in attendance.

 Report cites four lingering faults with B-2 bombers  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fresh from its widely praised missions to
Yugoslavia, the Missouri-based B-2 bomber is still taking hits from
government reports. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office says testing indicates the B-2
meets most of its operational requirements but still has four
``significant deficiencies that will limit or under some
circumstances slow its pace in flight.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone ought to tell those people sitting behind the desk
that the B-2 won the air war,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton, a Democrat
from Lexington, Mo., whose district encompasses Whiteman Air Force
Base, where the stealth bomber is based. ``It did the job. You
can't top what it did.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office's study is its sixth in five years on the
expensive and complex B-2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The findings are not new or major, Skelton said Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skelton, ranking Democrat on the House National Security
Committee, joined President Clinton and others at Whiteman last
week to commend the B-2 and its crews for successful bombing
missions over Yugoslavia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report was completed before the air campaign ended. The
B-2 flew only about 1 percent of the missions flown over Yugoslavia
but accounted for 11 percent of the weapons dropped, military
records show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The four deficiencies cited in the report: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Incomplete development of the ground mission planning system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Limited ability of the crew to be aware of enemy threats to
the plane. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Questionable durability of materials intended to keep the
aircraft undetectable to radar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Difficulty operating the plane anywhere but out of Whiteman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A March 1999 Air Force assessment of progress on correcting
the deficiencies confirmed that three of the four had not been
remedied but that one _ development of the ground mission planning
system _ was nearly corrected,'' the report said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the GAO, a Defense Department official concedes
that more work lies ahead in meeting the performance levels desired
for the B-2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``However, the department believes that more progress has been
made in some areas than indicated in the GAO report,'' wrote George
R. Schneiter, director of strategic and tactical systems. Schneiter
also disputed the estimated cost of up to $155 million to make
necessary improvements. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schneiter said mission plans can be developed within an
eight-hour goal using new hardware and software, but the GAO said
that had not been accomplished as of April 20 this year. Further
progress was later reported but not tested, the GAO said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schneiter acknowledged problems in technology that tells air
crews about threats, but he said it results in limited or reduced
capability, not ``insufficient'' capability as the GAO said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Insufficient implies an inability to perform the mission,
whereas the B-2s are currently participating in combat
operations,'' Schneiter wrote on April 28. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schneiter said improvements to the durability of the
radar-deflecting skin of the plane are being pursued. The need for
repairs diminishes the available flying time, the GAO report said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth problem mentioned in the report, efforts are being
made to acquire maintenance shelters so the planes can stop at
places away from Whiteman if necessary, Schneiter said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report said ``the Air force cannot sustain operations at
the level required for eight aircraft over a 14-day period without
shelters'' for indoor maintenance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ten B-2s are at Whiteman, and 11 more are in production. Under
the 1994 National Defense Authorization Act, the GAO is required to
make periodic reports on the B-2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A defense consultant said the latest report on the B-2
deficiencies should not be a surprise, ]given the aircraft's
complexity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound like there is anything there that is
unsolvable,'' said Bill Dane, senior aerospace analyst for Forecast
International in Connecticut. ``It sounds to me like normal
teething. There are always things that turn up.'' &QL;

TV PROGRAM, REWARD LED TO FUGITIVE'S ARREST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE AND BHAVNA MISTRY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fugitive Kathleen Soliah was living a normal life
in Minnesota _ a mother of three, doctor's wife, part-time actress
_ when FBI agents arrested her Wednesday for her role in the
Symbionese Liberation Army, the radical group that kidnapped
Patricia Hearst 25 years ago. &QL; 
Soliah, a 52-year-old Palmdale native accused of trying to kill Los
Angeles police with pipe bombs a year after six SLA members were
killed in an LAPD assault, was arrested by FBI agents as she drove
away from her home in St. Paul, Minn., authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She seemed surprised and relieved at the same time,'' Los
Angeles police Detective Tom King said during a news conference.
``She was living somewhat a high-profile life in Minnesota. She was
an actress and was a member of an acting troupe.''
</P>
<P>
   Soliah had been living as Sara Jane Olson with her doctor
husband and three daughters, the FBI said. Neighbors said she had
starred in local theater productions of ``The Lion in Winter'' and
``King Lear.''
</P>
<P>
   Soliah was featured on ``America's Most Wanted'' on the 25th
anniversary of the shootout in Los Angeles that left six SLA
members dead. The show and a $20,000 FBI reward prompted tips about
her to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Her family in Palmdale took news of her arrest hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so stupid,'' said her father, Martin Soliah. ``My
daughter was not involved in this group.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Soliah said his daughter was in Guatemala in August 1975,
when authorities say she tried to blow up two police cruisers by
placing pipe bombs beneath them. The bombs did not go off. He said
he has had little contact with her since she left Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a family, we're going to stand beside her and always
will,'' said Martin Soliah, 81. ``We're going to back her all the
way. We love our daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Soliah's son, Steven _ a former lover of Hearst _ also
has been accused of being an SLA member. He was acquitted in
federal court in 1978 of involvement in a 1975 bank robbery in
Carmichael. A woman depositing her church's money was killed by a
shotgun blast. Hearst said SLA member Emily Harris fired the
shotgun while Steven Soliah waited outside; however, only Soliah
was charged.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Soliah could be returned to Los Angeles within six
weeks to face a five-count grand jury indictment issued in Los
Angeles in February 1976. A hearing to confirm her identity and
begin extradition was set for Thursday, King said.
</P>
<P>
   She is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit murder,
two counts of possessing explosive devices and two counts of
attempted murder of police officers. If convicted, she faces life
in prison with the possibility of parole, said Los Angeles County
District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons.
</P>
<P>
   Other captured radicals from the 1960s and 1970s have received
lighter sentences. Bernadine Dohrn, accused of conspiracy in a
series of bombings by the Weather Underground, spent 11 years as a
fugitive. The conspiracy charges against her were dropped, although
she pleaded guilty to lesser counts stemming from anti-war
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Ann Power, an anti-war radical implicated in a fatal
bank robbery in Boston in 1970, surrendered in 1993 and pleaded
guilty to manslaughter. With continued good behavior in prison, she
can be freed in January.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Soliah claims he had a deal with the FBI to drop charges
against his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago they said there were no charges,'' said Martin
Soliah. ``Now a new (FBI) guy comes in and changes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police Chief Bernard C. Parks said detectives still
believe Soliah was responsible for placing the bombs, possibly as
revenge for the shootout with police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking this case step by step with the development of
her arrest, and the DA will have to judge the integrity of their
23-year-old evidence,'' Parks said. ``But we strongly believe she
is responsible for those two bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   The first bomb was found under a squad car parked at an
International House of Pancakes on Sunset Boulevard, and the second
was attached to a car at the Hollenbeck Division.
</P>
<P>
   Soliah's father disputed the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAPD said that she put a bomb under a police car,'' he
said. ``It was a symbolic bomb; it wasn't going to go off. They had
it on their desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want them to tell the truth,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Police and Soliah's family paint vastly different pictures of
the woman once known to her friends simply as Kathy.
</P>
<P>
   She is accused of belonging to the SLA, a group of about a dozen
terrorists and bank robbers based in Berkeley that kidnapped
Northern California newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Soliah graduated from Palmdale High School with the Spirit and
Service award. She belonged to the Spanish Club, the Pep Club and
the California Scholarship Federation, and she participated in
Powder Puff Football.
</P>
<P>
   Her father was an English teacher and football and track coach
for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Her senior portrait shows a serious-looking brunette with
collar-length hair and bangs. She also belonged to the Business
Club and Girls Athletic Association and Future Teachers of America.

QUAYLE ATTACKS BUSH `TRIANGULATION' STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 and CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ GOP presidential hopeful Dan Quayle ripped what
he views as the ``mushy'' message of GOP front-runner George W.
Bush, saying Wednesday that it could lead, at best, to a hollow
victory for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   An intense Quayle compared the Texas governor's unwillingness to
take a stand on many issues to President Clinton's
``triangulation'' strategy designed to seek the middle ground
between the extreme factions of his party. It was developed by
Clinton's former adviser Dick Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans don't win elections trying to be like Bill Clinton
and being Dick Morris Republicans,'' Quayle said in an interview.
``If you are going to run an ambiguous, mushy, equivocating,
triangulation, Dick Morris type of campaign, what good is it to be
elected? You're not really going to change the country. And I want
to change the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, who is basing his campaign in Arizona, is trailing Bush
badly in New Hampshire, according to a poll taken last week by the
``Boston Herald.'' It shows that 45 percent of Republican voters in
the state favor Bush, and only 4 percent would vote for Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began campaigning only a few days ago, swinging through
Iowa, Connecticut and New Hampshire, and taking less-than-hardline
stands on abortion and taxes. On Tuesday night in Greenwich, Conn.,
he laid out his ``compassionate conservative'' platform. He
promised to cut taxes, but help people learn to save; to confront
teenage pregnancy, but offer practical help to women in crisis; and
to raise standards in school, but enact programs to ensure no
children are left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say Republicans are backing him so strongly
because they believe his moderate stance will help them regain the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign did not return phone calls Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   In his tour of New Hampshire on Wednesday, Quayle took a ``been
there, done that'' approach to Bush's message of conservative
compassion. Quayle spoke out repeatedly in favor of cutting taxes
and against abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   After a morning visit in Manchester to the New Life Home for
Women and Children, a Christian residential program in which women
struggle to overcome such problems as addiction to alcohol and
drugs, Quayle used it as an example of how private operations often
outdo government in such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I call real compassion,'' Quayle said later at a
press conference in Concord. ``These are conservatives out there
working every day, saving lives. Getting people off of drugs and
getting them back on the right road. This goes to prove a point
that I have made over and over again. That conservatives are
compassionate. We care deeply about our friends, our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   During his public appearances, Quayle was measured in his
criticism of Bush's gospel of moderation.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle left it to former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, the
national co-chairman of Quayle's campaign, to accuse Bush of trying
to bend with the political winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is trying to be like Clinton,'' Sununu said. ``Bush is
running with the rhetoric of the Clinton campaign that was
successful for Clinton in '92 and '96.''
</P>
<P>
   Sununu, a former chief of staff under Bush's father, President
George Bush, warned that selecting Bush as the GOP's supposed
savior will drive the party into a train wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Still popular in his home state, Sununu is also a notorious
arm-twister, and is believed to be cranking a few limbs behind the
scene in order to swell the ranks of grass-roots activists who
support Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Sununu denied he is working his troops over, but suggested he
would begin calling in chits for Quayle in September or October,
when the campaign season is in full bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's trip to New Hampshire was designed to cajole a wide
range of possible supporters: grass-roots activists, legislators
and voters.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the hopeful's efforts have netted him only three
endorsements from state lawmakers. But campaign observers at least
perceive Quayle to have a significant foundation of local workers
in place for the upcoming primary.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle seemed compassionate enough, and impressive as a
candidate, said several people who clasped hands with him
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him to be a very gentle spirit, and he cares about
people,'' said Carole Cadieux, 35, who kicked a cocaine habit to
rebuild her life and become a staff member of the New Life Home.
</P>
<P>
   But even some people who liked Quayle's message and his looks
said they were going to do just what he doesn't want them to do:
vote for Bush because he looks like a winner.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pleasant View Retirement Home in Concord, Sara Edsall,
93, shook Quayle's hand and told him, ``You're as handsome as your
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   But she later told a reporter she wasn't going to vote for him,
because she thought Quayle couldn't be elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to live long enough to get the Republicans back in
office,'' Edsall said. ``I hope we're all going to get in back of
Bush and elect him.'' &QL;

OUSTED RICE OWLS ENJOY GAME, NOT RESULT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ At the end of a dream yesterday, the Rice Owls
opted for reflection instead of tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great baseball game, and I enjoyed being in it,''
said coach Wayne Graham, after the Owls (59-15) lost a 6-5 College
World Series elimination game to Alabama (53-15). ``The score just
didn't turn out right, that's all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bloop hit won it, but that's how it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bloop _ a sinking fly ball that landed a few feet in front
of charging right fielder Will Ford _ came off the bat of Alabama's
Sam Bozanich, and scored G.W. Keller with the winning run with two
out in the bottom of the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The hit came off Mario Ramos (13-3), who had entered the game in
the ninth as the fourth Rice pitcher of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was rested, and he's been our best all year,'' Graham said.
``You wouldn't want to lose a game with him sitting on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, playing in its second CWS in three years, indeed went down
with its best _ including shortstop Damon Thames, who slugged the
Owls back into it with two home runs off Alabama starter Justin
Smith, who allowed only four hits and struck out 12 in eight
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama got a big boost in the third when Rice starter Marc Gwyn
walked the bases full and Keller hit a deep drive into left center.
Left fielder Charles Williams got his glove on the ball, but
couldn't make the catch, and three runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Thames hit a solo shot over the left-field fence in the seventh
to cut the Crimson Tide lead to 4-2, then came up in the eighth
with two runners aboard via walks.
</P>
<P>
   He fouled off four pitches on an 0-2 count, and then the tiring
Smith, who had beaten Oklahoma State on Friday, threw his 125th
pitch of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Thames hit it into the left-field seats, giving the Owls a 5-4
lead and launching Graham into a hopping, leaping celebratory dance
in the third base coaching box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love baseball,'' the 63-year-old coach said. ``I get
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   So did everyone else wearing blue _ but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a moment, we were on top of the world,'' Thames said.
``But we came down fast.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom half, Bozanich walked, was sacrificed to second,
stole third _ one of six successful thefts by the Tide _ and scored
on a wild pitch. Brent Boyd then singled, stole second, and tried
to score the potential winning run on another hit, but was cut down
at the plate on a perfect throw from Ford.
</P>
<P>
   But Andy Phillips, rolling on a 36-game hitting streak, opened
the ninth with his third double, and Keller drew an intentional
walk. The Owls nearly got out of it when Ramos threw Phillips out
at third on a bunt and got a ground ball to short from former
Mansfield High School standout Kelley Gulledge.
</P>
<P>
   But the runners were going with the pitch, averting the double
play and forcing Thames to throw to first. The stage was set for
Bozanich's bloop, which scored Keller from third.
</P>
<P>
   Thames, a coaches National Player of the Year in '98 and one of
three Rice draftees who chose to return for their senior years,
walked away with no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we came back for,'' said Thames, a ninth-round
pick this year by St. Louis. ``We knew we were going to have a
great team and we thought we could get back here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great program, obviously a great education, and it was
a fantastic experience that you'd be crazy to miss. For me, it's
the end of a chapter.''

SPURS' TOWERS STIFLING, BUT JACKSON KEYS WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ When the pope visited in 1987, this city put him
in a Stetson.
</P>
<P>
   In case it wants to get a head start with Tim Duncan, he wears
an 8 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by their typically stifling defense and a predictably
dominating edge in the paint, the San Antonio Spurs rode Duncan's
33 points and 16 rebounds for an easy 89-77 victory over the New
York Knicks in Game 1 of the NBA Finals before a raucous crowd of
39,514 last night at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't as easy at it looked, not at all,'' Duncan said. ``I
had to work to get position, but I worked hard. Once I got the
ball, I had a good rhythm going and my shots were falling. Once I
got rolling, my teammates kept coming back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a bigger brother holding his flailing sibling at bay by
simply palming his forehead, the Spurs stymied several Knicks' runs
led by Latrell Sprewell's transition energy by simply pounding the
ball into their Twin Towers and getting five clutch 3-pointers by
Jaren Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   While Duncan and David Robinson combined for 46 points and 25
rebounds, it was Jackson's off-balance 3-pointer which pushed the
Spurs' lead to 74-65 and at least momentarily stopped New York's
huge heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duncan was awesome, but we know he's going to get his
points,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``The one that killed
us with Jackson. We've got to take him away or it's going to be a
short series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Goody Two Sneaker Spurs held the Knicks to 38 percent
shooting, a near Finals-record low 10 points in the second quarter
and 14 in the fourth in tying the NBA record with its 11th
consecutive playoff victory.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing without leader Patrick Ewing and with forwards
Larry Johnson and Marcus Camby hobbling with knee injuries, the
Knicks stayed close behind the creativity of Allan Houston and
Sprewell. But when New York closed to within five in the third
quarter, the 7-foot-1 Duncan scored three consecutive times over
the 6-foot-8 Johnson to produce some breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks got as close as six again, but Jackson hit his
falling 3-pointer and sealed the victory with another triple in the
final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jaren's making that shot, we can really click,'' Spurs
coach Gregg Popovich said. ``They chose to leave him open and he
hit some big ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' game plan worked perfectly for 18 minutes, as they
spread the floor for Houston jumpers and allowed Sprewell to attack
the Spurs in transition, sometimes even one-on-four. New York led
27-21 after the first quarter and 35-31 before San Antonio's size
took over.
</P>
<P>
   With Sprewell resting on the bench and his big men piling up
fouls, the Knicks' pace slowed to a walk and, predictably, an
offensive meltdown. In one of the worst quarters in Finals history,
the Knicks went without a point for five minutes, without a field
goal for seven minutes and produced a paltry 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, as they have throughout their playoff stampede, took
advantage of their defensive lockdown. Robinson sparked a 14-2 run
with a block on Chris Dudley, a lob assist on a Duncan layup and
foul-line jumper that propelled the Spurs into a 45-37 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   With San Antonio's interior size turning the Knicks into
jump-shooters, the Spurs held the Knicks to the second-lowest
scoring quarter (10 points, more than only Utah's nine-point fourth
quarter in last year's Game 3) in Finals history in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan dominated in the third quarter and early in the fourth,
almost effortlessly scoring on a variety of spin moves, layups,
offensive rebounds and fadeaway bank-shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still very young, but if he keeps that up, he'll be a
legend here pretty quick,'' Popovich said. ``I hope I have to keep
digging deep to come up with words to describe him. Tonight he was
pretty special.''

RANGERS' HELLING PUTS UP STOP SIGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There will be no debate should a must-win scenario
present itself this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Helling would make that start,'' said Rangers manager
Johnny Oates, who gave no latitude for ambiguity. ``That's the
reason he was our Opening Day pitcher, and he has not done anything
to change my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night could not be considered one of those must-win
situations, but the Rangers breathed a collective sigh of relief
after their 3-0 victory against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers snapped their season-high four-game losing streak
and beat the defending World Series champions for the first time in
eight attempts at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (6-6) pitched seven scoreless innings despite only one
natural 1-2-3 inning, but he retired all six batters he faced with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers needed a hero, and Helling stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   Others emerged, too.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Lee Stevens hit a two-run, second-inning home run
off right-hander Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez (7-6).
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Rusty Greer robbed the Yankees of at least three
hits with his range.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Jeff Zimmerman worked out of a two-on, none-out jam
by retiring three consecutive batters.
</P>
<P>
   Closer John Wetteland pitched a 1-2-3 ninth inning for his major
league-best 22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Ruben Mateo halted the Rangers' slump with
runners in scoring position at 0-for-26 with his run-scoring,
seventh-inning double. The Rangers are 1-for-32 with runners in
scoring position in five games at Yankee Stadium this season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, center stage belonged to Helling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all starts with starting pitching,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Helling gave no greater demonstration than after surrendering a
third-inning double to third baseman Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   ``A situation like that can get out of hand really quick,'' said
Helling, who improved to 6-3 with a 3.05 earned-run average in his
past 11 starts. ``I did everything in my power to make good pitches
there. I think that was as sharp as I was all night. I don't think
I missed a spot. I think I threw every pitch where I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' No. 2, 3 and 4 hitters _ shortstop Derek Jeter,
right fielder Paul O'Neill and center fielder Bernie Williams _ can
verify that. Helling retired all three on strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give Helling credit,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ``He pitches around the strike zone, and he'll throw enough
pitches up and then throw a couple of knee-high pitches. He got
O'Neill that one inning and Jeter both on knee-high fastballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling, who surrendered only four hits and two walks, departed
after 123 pitches. The performance again demonstrated why the
Rangers signed Helling to a three-year, $10.5 million contract in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Helling has pitched well for us,'' Oates said. ``I think
he's been the one guy who has went out there and kept us in
ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling also squelched those irritating,
Rangers-can't-beat-the-Yankees post mortems for at least an
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we'll get more,'' Oates said of victories against the
Yankees. ``It's not the first. It won't be the last.''

SLEEPWALK DEFENDANT: `THERE'S NO WAY I COULD DO THAT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Scott Falater, fighting a charge that he murdered his
wife in a coldblooded act of mayhem, cried Wednesday and told the
jury a love story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people talk about their spouse as their right arm,'' said
the man who claims he was sleepwalking when he stabbed his wife 44
times. ``She was like both my arms, and my legs, half my head and
all of my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater repeatedly choked back tears as he took the stand before
a packed courtroom and a grim-faced jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to do without her,'' Falater said. Then he
covered his mouth with his hand, his chest heaving in muffled sobs.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Michale Kimerer's first question went to the
core of the trial: Did Falater have any reason to murder Yarmila?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Falater responded firmly. ``There's no way I could do
that. Not intentionally. I loved her.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater's hope for acquittal hinges on whether the jury is
convinced that he was asleep and not acting deliberately when he
killed his wife of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   As his tears flowed in Maricopa County Superior Court, Falater
reached for a handkerchief to dry his eyes and wipe his nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was really my only confidant and she was by far my best
friend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do without her. She was
probably virtually all of my emotional life.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Motorola engineer will return to the stand today to
continue his testimony under the gentle direction of Kimerer, a
big, bearded man who asked his questions in a tone of pained
bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   Then he will face cross-examination from prosecutor Juan
Martinez, who has repeatedly attacked the professional credibility
and personal integrity of defense witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Falater's tender story of his love affair with Yarmila provided
a stark and strange counterpoint to the trial's repeated discussion
of the night in 1997 that ended with her body floating in the
crimson waters of the family's backyard pool.
</P>
<P>
   Falater talked of his high school infatuation with the spunky
girl who spoke her mind and helped him manage the trauma of an
Illinois home life wrecked by his father's violent alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   ``She helped me a lot to deal with those feelings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage seemed inevitable, he said, smiling as he recalled
Yarmila's plucky reaction when he dropped to a knee to propose
while they were still in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Of course. What were you waiting for?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The young couple lived first in Chicago, then moved to Florida
and on to Minnesota as Scott pursued his career in engineering and
Yarmila dedicated herself to rearing their two children.
</P>
<P>
   Falater said the repeated moves were difficult for his wife, who
struggled to adjust and made friends slowly. But the family found
comfort in the Mormon Church, he said, ridiculing the prosecution's
claim that Yarmila resented the church's demands upon her time.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say she didn't like her involvement in the church is utter
hogwash,'' Falater said.
</P>
<P>
   What about Martinez's suggestion that the couple had argued over
Scott's desire to have more children, Kimerer asked.
</P>
<P>
   Falater responded that he created a standing family joke about
wanting more kids because he and Yarmila had done so well with
Megan and Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted more children than she did, but I also realized that
she ended up with 90 percent of the job there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of pushing Yarmila, Falater said, he defused the
issue with humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started urging my kids to have their kids so we could be
grandparents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And what about about Martinez's idea that Scott's interest in
Yarmila had cooled because she gained a lot of weight, Kimerer
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of like large women,'' Falater shrugged. ``It only
impacted me because she was upset at how large she was. . . . She
might have been large, but she was always beautiful to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater admitted that Yarmila had been unhappy when the family
moved to Phoenix in 1987. With prodding from a bishop, he committed
himself to building a stable home life and told Yarmila he would
become a taxi driver rather than subject her to another move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Make all the friends you want; they're going to be
yours as long as they're around.' ''
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, Falater said, ``Our marriage got better and
better and was better than ever at the time of her death.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater said he dreams constantly about Yarmila in his cell at
the Maricopa County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I open my eyes and see the jail walls and realize what's
happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Falater's testimony came after the jury submitted to the last
defense expert more than dozen written questions that suggested
skepticism about the defense case.
</P>
<P>
   Could Falater have planned the killing to make it appear to have
occurred while he was sleepwalking?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some pieces of the evidence are not fakeable,'' responded Dr.
Rosalind Cartwright, a psychologist and director of a sleep
disorder center in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   How could Cartwright know that Falater was actually sleepwalking
that night of Yarmila's death? That conclusion is ``a deduction . .
. from all the pieces we put together,'' Cartwright said. &QL;

RULES AT MOUNT RAINIER PARK MAKING SOME CLIMBERS, HIKERS GO
ELSEWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Washington's high hiking places have long been seen as
a spot to escape crowds, controls and congestion.
</P>
<P>
   But the 235,612 acres of Mount Rainier National Park have become
the state's most closely regulated and most jammed alpine
environment _ from the packed parking lot at Paradise to climbers
squeezed in at the Thumb Rock bivouac site, 10,775 feet up on
Liberty Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulation of Mount Rainier is pretty extreme and the
issue driving it is the number of people wanting to partake of a
fabulous place,'' said Tim McNulty, co-author of ``Washington's
Mount Rainier National Park: A Centennial Celebration'' (The
Mountaineers, 144 pages, $35).
</P>
<P>
   So regulated is Mount Rainier that many hikers and backcountry
campers are taking their feet elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   And even more strict regulations are on the horizon, including a
possible limit on personal vehicles allowed inside the park.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy use is the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2.2 million people will visit the park this year,
as it celebrates its centennial.
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 visitors will venture out onto a trail for at
least a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Up on the mountain, the National Park Service recorded 11,118
climbers last year.
</P>
<P>
   The park is drawing up a 20-year management plan to establish
``visitor carrying capacities,'' designed to prevent both damage to
alpine environments and frayed human nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be managed a lot more than it is, particularly
during times of peak use,'' said John Wilcox, wilderness district
ranger in charge of climbing and back-country maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would anticipate during those peak periods, the traffic will
be heavily managed, and there may be limits to how many personal
vehicles are allowed in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   National parks are an idea that America gave the world.
Americans insist on seeing their nation's scenic crown jewels,
arriving in ever-increasing numbers at parks long starved for
money.
</P>
<P>
   Several parks have already resorted to shuttle buses at peak
points and periods of use. Private cars are banned over most of the
80-mile road in Alaska's Denali National Park. A shuttle system on
the south rim of Grand Canyon National Park ``assured that visitors
experience something other than gridlock and carbon monoxide,''
said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service is drawing up a plan on how to handle
the 4 and a half million yearly visitors to California's narrow
Yosemite Valley. The park currently limits entry of private cars at
peak use periods.
</P>
<P>
   At Mount Rainier, backcountry camping has been stringently
regulated since 1973. The Park Service long ago imposed camping
limits on the mountain's two most popular climbing routes.
Recently, it has limited overnight use at Camp Hazard on the Kautz
Glacier route, and put a cap of 12 people a night at Thumb Rock.
</P>
<P>
   The rules have critics, particularly among backpackers. Camping
along trails is allowed only at designated sites.
</P>
<P>
   Campsites were put in what Wilcox calls ``durable areas,''
largely in forest and well below the famous meadows, high lakes and
moraines of the mountain. For many hikers, ``durable'' translates
to dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put camps so far from the scenery,'' said Ira Spring,
renowned Northwest photographer and coauthor of ``50 Hikes in Mount
Rainier National Park'' (The Mountaineers, 144 pages, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``The sunsets, with their brilliant colors, are one of the
mountain's premier attractions _ but campsites are so far away
(from good viewing spots) that you stumble back in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy-handed regulatory environment is chasing people away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very controlled hiking experience, and perhaps has to
be for the number of people,'' said Rick McGuire, a Seattle hiker
and conservationist. ``I would rather hike where I can go where I
want and camp where I want.''
</P>
<P>
   John Zilavy, a Seattle attorney, drove up to Mount Rainier with
friends in 1997. They planned to hike a fabled chunk of the
round-the-mountain Wonderland Trail through the meadows of
Summerland, up over Fryingpan Gap and down to Indian Bar.
</P>
<P>
   All campsites on the route were full, however, and Zilavy's
party found itself sent off to Palisades Lakes, a remote area with
no views of the mountain, near the northeast corner of the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all backcountry, it's all wilderness and I didn't mind
getting shunted off to an area I found fascinating,'' Zilavy said.
``Still, it really screwed up our plan, and it would have been a
lot tougher on people who had come here from elsewhere in the
country with the dream of going to a particular place on the
mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   A new system has gone into effect this year. Mount Rainier
National Park is taking advance reservations for backcountry
campsites. Up to 60 percent of sites are reservable up to two
months in advance of a backpacking trip or a climb of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 40 percent will be filled on a first-come,
first-served basis on the day of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   A reservation costs $20 per party per trip. (The park can be
contacted by by e-mail at morawilderness &LR; nps.gov for backcountry
sites; or by phone at 360-569-4453 for backcountry sites and
climbing, 800-365-2267 for front-country car camping sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new system sounds saner,'' said author Bruce Barcott, who
had to gamble on dates as he hiked the Wonderland Trail while
writing his book ``The Measure of a Mountain: Beauty and Terror on
Mount Rainier'' (Sasquatch, 278 pages, $23.95).
</P>
<P>
   Barcott was irritated at some rangers he encountered on
backcountry trails. He developed a lot more admiration for the
approach of the park's climbing rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure most hikers have had the experience of walking down a
trail, and having a ranger grill you more than necessary about
where you are going and what your plans are,'' Barcott said. ``The
answer you feel like giving is, `It's none of your business and I
don't know.' ... It's their job, but part of you bristles at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The climbing rangers, he found, were far less intrusive,
generally content just to check in and give briefings on route
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were the least parental rangers in the park,''
Barcott said. ``They are the people who have to risk their lives if
you get in trouble, but they make an effort not to act like big
brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Mount Rainier was the first national park in the country to
allow cars, about 60 of which arrived by muddy road in 1907. The
car craze proved to be what author Ruth Kirk called ``an
unstoppable flood.'' President William Howard Taft was driven to
Paradise in 1911, although mules had to pull his car part of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Finding one of the 758 parking spots at today's Paradise can be
a midsummer afternoon's nightmare. The lots at Paradise, and
sometimes Sunrise, fill up by noon on summer and holiday weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Spaces are generally plentiful on weekdays. At peak use periods,
however, ``We just can't get 'em all up there in the way they want
to get up there,'' said the park's chief planner, Eric Walkinshaw.
</P>
<P>
   The park seems loathe to bar the automobile if planners can
avoid it. A shuttle bus system is economically questionable.
Instead, park planners are looking at ways to warn Rainier-bound
visitors that parking lots are full, and suggest other places to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to it is getting people information long before they
get to the park,'' said Walkinshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Other road problems at Mount Rainier National Park are working
to shunt visitors onto the heavily used routes up to Paradise and
Sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, there are two problems at Mount Rainier National
Park over which its managers have no control: The park is small,
and the 14,411-foot mountain is a magnet.
</P>
<P>
   The national park was created largely with straight-line
boundaries, long before recreation and conservation planners began
to look at drawing boundaries with an eye to protecting entire
valleys and safeguarding both winter and summer habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the park ``protects'' is rocks and ice, land that
the Northern Pacific Railroad happily traded a century ago for
productive lowland forests in southwest Oregon. The lush,
low-elevation forests west and north of Mount Rainier have been
transformed into a sea of clearcuts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, however, Congress did protect the remaining unlogged
and unroaded valleys by designating five wilderness areas bordering
on or near Mount Rainier National Park.
</P>
<P>
   If visitors are willing to step back from the densely visited
park areas and head into the national forest wilderness, Mount
Rainier can be enjoyed without the crowds, the congestion and the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Spring identifies several short hikes outside the national
park that provide perspective and breathtaking panoramas on the
Northwest's greatest volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Bearhead Mountain, in the Clearwater Wilderness, delivers an
eye-popping view of the mile-high Willis Wall. The Glacier View
Lookout is a premier spot to watch sunset colors. High Rock, south
of Rainier, has bottom-to-top vistas and an unmatched experience of
mountain light at both the beginning and end of day.
</P>
<P>
   But people just keep coming, coming and coming. Mount Rainier
National Park may even figure in next year's race for the White
House. Vice President Al Gore wants to climb the mountain.

THE JACKSON FIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Only in the mystical, magical world of
Phil Jackson, all Native American symbolism and perfect Zen
moments, could a career move happen this way.
</P>
<P>
   There he was, fishing in Alaska, thousands of miles from his
dream job in Los Angeles and completely unaware of the negotiations
between his agent and the Lakers. Then the news came, from the
mouths of babes. Or, rather, a young Eskimo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a little Eskimo village, coming off the river after
fishing, and some kid came out and said, `I hear you're the coach
of the Lakers,' '' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, Jackson ended his one-year basketball
sabbatical and resumed his storied coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday night, back home in Montana, Jackson's agent
confirmed the kid's story _ that, indeed, he was just a few clauses
and pen strokes away from coaching the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, an agreement in principle was reached. By Wednesday
morning _ at 10:57 Pacific Daylight Time, to be exact _ he had
signed for five years and $30 million to take over the only team he
wanted to coach after leaving the Chicago Bulls last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a very lucky man today,'' Jackson said at his noon
coronation ceremony at the posh Beverly Hilton. ``I think this was
a marriage that was in the making, and of all the jobs that were
out there this year, this is the one that piqued my interest.''
</P>
<P>
   More so than a return to the New York Knicks, where he won two
championships as a player. More so than a partnership with the New
Jersey Nets, who were prepared to make him the richest coach in the
land.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lakers, Jackson saw the best of opportunities _ to
recapture a moment in time, or more precisely an era. In the
Lakers, he sees the same promise he saw 10 years ago when he
embarked on a nine-year run with the Bulls that netted six
championships and an aura of success that could put him in the Hall
of Fame without ever coaching again.
</P>
<P>
   But here he is, looking to start another three-peat with a
supremely gifted, if underachieving and underdeveloped team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team that is talented, it's young, it's on the
verge. It's been on the verge, but it hasn't been able to get over
the top,'' Jackson said. ``That's a similar situation to what
happened 10 years ago in Chicago, and we hope to have the same type
of success here.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, of course. But with
able stand-ins in Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, whom Jackson
said ``reminds me a lot of Michael Jordan, and there's not too many
players who have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant greeted Jackson at the hotel Wednesday, then quietly
slipped away. But both Bryant and O'Neal have enthused about
Jackson's arrival. And by all accounts, Jackson is exactly what the
Lakers _ who were swept out of the playoffs two years straight _
need.
</P>
<P>
   Del Harris lost the players' interest. His replacement, Kurt
Rambis, lost their confidence. In Jackson, the millionaire
20-somethings have a leader who commands instant respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' agreed general manager Mitch Kupchak. ``I mean,
the X's and O's of the game, the triangle offense, those are all
key, important things. But there are literally dozens of NBA
coaches who are great X's and O's coaches. . . . We needed more
than that. We needed a certain presence and somebody to respect
when he spoke in the locker room. That was the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will install the passing-reliant, movement-oriented
triangle offense made famous by the Bulls. And he said O'Neal,
Bryant and Glen Rice, a potential free agent, will all fit
perfectly in that system.
</P>
<P>
   He also was decidedly blunt in his assessment of his new
proteges. That O'Neal is not yet a leader, and that he must learn
to pass more and score less. That Bryant, while already a force at
age 20, is ``uneducated in basketball and in life.''
</P>
<P>
   So Jackson's challenges are clearly laid out. And on a team with
three guys who demand the ball, his selfless triangle system could
be stretched to its limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who likes to play basketball in a team-oriented system
will find this very easy to play in and very enjoyable,'' Jackson
said. ``It's a player-run offense, it's not a coach telling a team
what he wants out there on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson beamed under the spotlights, the Lakers family stood
in the wings beaming at his confidence and his words. Part-owner
Magic Johnson was there, along with two of owner Jerry Buss'
children, Forum president Jeanie Buss and assistant GM Jim Buss.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Buss could not attend the ceremony, but Jerry West,
standing proud, offered thanks to the owner for making the
financial investment that could finally restore the franchise's
past glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a very exciting day for us,'' said West,
calling Jackson ``a preeminent coach in America.''
</P>
<P>
   His arrival happened more easily than anyone could have
anticipated. Jackson wanted to be here, but Buss had to commit the
dollars for a premier coach, something he's never done. Once Buss
decided to make that commitment, he had West contact Jackson-agent
Todd Musburger about two weeks ago. The rest happened quickly, in
what Musburger called ``an ideal negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Lakers have restored, at the very least, a sense of
stability. Each of the last three seasons ended with speculation
over the coaching situation _ first with Harris, who eventually was
fired, then with Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have to worry, at the end of the season,
about coaches anymore. I think for all of us, that certainly is a
help,'' West said. Of the once-nagging questions about the coaching
position, he added, ``That will never be asked again as long as
he's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Stability seems guaranteed. Wins and championships, those are of
course expected to follow. But Jackson, as others have before him,
preached patience to a city starved for a victory parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an educational process,'' he said. ``So to set goals of
60 wins or whatever this next season would not be appropriate,
because it could take this young team two months to learn how to
play together in a system of offense. But the end results are going
to be fine. I'm very confident of that.''

DUNCAN LEADS SPURS TO 89-77 VICTORY OVER KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Spurs' cerebral Tim Duncan tilted his chin
down and saw the ragged beard and bulky knee brace on a tattered
and hardly agile Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The math was easy. Duncan spent a stretch of the fourth quarter
picking on the hampered Johnson for awhile before he moved on to
the next Knick who dared to cover him. They came and went and each
plunged into foul trouble as Duncan overwhelmed the revolving door
of Knicks on his way to scoring 33 points and grabbing 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan was part of a Spurs team that flaunted their good health,
solid depth and looming size until the patchwork Knicks frayed at
the edges and came undone, 89-77, at the Alamodome during Game 1 of
the National Basketball Association finals on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Knicks had an unfamiliar look of exasperation as
they departed the court as the loser of a Game 1 on the road for
the first time in their improbable playoff run. They became
flustered by their foul trouble, and grew uncharacteristically
frantic at the finish.
</P>
<P>
   `'I thought we were frenetic offensively,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy
said. `'We were trying to create shots so hard, I thought we were
playing at such a pace that we lacked poise.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston went from asserting himself against Mario Elie to
losing that edge with just 2 of his 19 points in the fourth
quarter. Latrell Sprewell went from creating turnovers and
transition opportunities through three quarters to making mistakes
and pulling up for way too many jumpers at the end, finishing with
3 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter. That helped turn a
6-point lead by the Spurs with 8 minutes 33 seconds left in the
game into a 15-point bulge with 2:22 left in the game. And there
was nothing the Knicks could do to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   `'I started off good because offensively, we were in better
flow,'' said Houston, who scored 14 points in the first half. `'The
second half, we were frantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was an example of this. He had a full head of steam as
long as the Knicks were getting out on the fast break, and the
layups were coming easy. But once the Spurs' shot-blocking picked
up and the Knicks' defense wore down, Sprewell seemed to rattle
just a bit, particularly on defense.
</P>
<P>
   There were times when he lost Jaren Jackson in transition, and
wound up watching him launch a 3-pointer to cut off whatever
momentum the Knicks had mustered. There were times when he lost
control of the ball by trying to make too much happen and ended the
night with six turnovers. .
</P>
<P>
   `'Jaren Jackson was big,'' said Sprewell, who shot 1 for 8 in
the fourth quarter as a part of a 22 percent effort by the team
down the stretch. `'Mario Elie made some shots. Those guys were
huge. We have to regroup. We expect their big guys to get some
points, but we have to pay more attention to the others.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to stay aggressive with foul trouble. The Knicks
had fouls hanging on them like a tree decked with ornaments. By the
end of the game, Johnson and Marcus Camby had five fouls, while
Kurt Thomas and Chris Childs were on edge with four fouls. And
Houston played most of the second half with three.
</P>
<P>
   Fouls brought hesitation, and any timid stance was at the mercy
of Duncan and David Robinson, who added 13 points, 9 rebounds, 3
blocks and delivered 7 assists, finding the man cutting to the
basket all night.
</P>
<P>
   `'That's what he does,'' Duncan siad. `'He doesn't have to score
big amounts for us. On any given night he can do that. When he goes
out and gives us defensive intensity and changes people's shots, it
changes the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The game turned when the Spurs went on a 13-4 run that began in
the middle of the fourth quarter. It was Robinson and Duncan, and
then a big 3-pointer by Jackson to put the Spurs ahead, 87-72, with
2:22 left.
</P>
<P>
   `'They have great size and strength and quickness,'' Van Gundy
said. `'We're going to have to have some better answers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to come up with those answers when attrition through
foul trouble began to creep up on an already thin Knicks lineup in
need of the man in the gray suit on the bench, Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's tough for them because they are hurt,'' Duncan said.
`'But they are physical, and they can do the job on us on any given
night.''
</P>
<P>
   It's wasn't Camby's night to pull off that trick. Camby couldn't
fill the void on his own, not like he had in the Knicks' previous
series with the Indiana Pacers. He was a live body, who brought
energy and soared inside for dunks off missed layups, and even came
up with a blocked shot in 23 foul-plagued moments. He could help
keep the Knicks close for only so long.
</P>
<P>
   `'I got in foul trouble early,'' Camby said. `'It's not
something I'm used to. David and Tim, they're definitely
exceptional. We had a very hard time stopping them.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter who tried. At the frustrating end, Johnson limped off
after scoring 5 points and grabbing 1 rebound and went straight to
the trainer's room after the game. He was a haggard symbol of a
ragged night by the Knicks, not accustomed to coming up empty in
Game 1s.
</P>
<P>
   `'At this point, it make us more hungry,'' Houston said. `'We
can't expect to win every Game 1 because we've done it in the past.
We have to come out and keep trying.''

PARK RESTED, READY TO BE TESTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chan Ho Park traveled to Oakland, spent the
pregame shagging balls or taking grounders or throwing in the
bullpen. He was with the Dodgers, but he certainly didn't feel that
way.
</P>
<P>
   It was worse since the Dodgers were losing. Park didn't pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last seven games I was really bored,'' Park said. ``I feel
really ashamed of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Park admitted the last seven games have been some of the
toughest of his professional career, and he didn't even throw a
pitch. The right-hander was serving a seven-game suspension for his
part in a fight with Anaheim's Tim Belcher. The suspension ended
with Wednesday's game against the Pirates, which Park watched from
the stands, and his new hope is the imposed rest invigorates his
season. Park starts the series finale against the Pirates tonight
at Dodger Stadium with the hope of putting the first two months of
the season behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The cerebral Park, who is 4-3 with a 4.84 ERA, said he made sure
the time off helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``For myself, it was a good time,'' Park said. ``I feel a little
stronger than before. It was a very good experience for myself and
it made me feel stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Park missed one start and was fined $3,000 by the National
League after punching and then hitting Belcher with a flying kick
during his June 5 start against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rookies ready: If the Dodgers are going to surge soon,
rookies Jamie Arnold and Angel Pena need to play an important role.
Arnold took over Darren Dreifort's spot in the rotation and will
pitch Saturday against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love starting,'' said Arnold, a former No. 1 pick by
Atlanta. ``When I was with the Braves, I came up through the
organization as a starter. I said I didn't care what got me to the
major leagues. I didn't care. If the chance to start came up, that
would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Angel Pena is the new No. 1 catcher, taking over for
Todd Hundley on Tuesday. Pena said he's got much more confidence
than he had during his six-game stint last September in which he
hit .231.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Scioscia (the manager at Triple-A Albuquerque) worked me
hard every day down there,'' said Pena, who's hitting .214 since
joining the Dodgers on May 18. ``I had to do something every day,
like blocking balls, even when I wasn't catching. I'm ready now.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Arizona talks heat up: Representatives of the Fort McDowell
Indian Community presented a new proposal to the Dodgers regarding
a spring-training facility near Phoenix, Ariz. The new proposal is
for baseball facilities only, but there is room for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the ideas were very conceptual,'' Dodgers president and
CEO Bob Graziano said. ``(Wednesday) was to get more specific of
what the proposal contained.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the Dodgers said they wanted on-site housing,
particularly for their minor-leaguers. However, Graziano said that
can change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to listen to that,'' Graziano said. ``No other
major-league team has on-site housing. It's convenient for
minor-league players. . . . Maybe they can accommodate that with a
hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian community is talking about building a hotel and golf
courses on the barren land. But Graziano said there's no hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we think there's a better deal to be made in six months,
we'll wait,'' Graziano said. ``We don't have a lease that expires
in Vero Beach, so we don't have to rush.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Meeting of minds: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson and general
manager Kevin Malone spent much of the pregame in a closed-door
meeting. Malone and Johnson said the discussion was on the general
mood of the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make sure we have things squared away and we
know how each other is doing,'' Malone said. ``I wanted to see what
his thinking is, what he's feeling. He's been great, positive,
still believes.''

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez had another effective outing for
the New York Yankees and continued to prove that he can still be
that same ornery and baffling pitcher who blazed through the
American League as if it were the American Legion last year.
</P>
<P>
   His manager, Joe Torre, saw how much crisper the Yankees can
look when their starter is reliable. Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   There was one important element that ruined Hernandez's night.
Rick Helling was a lot better. No matter how competent Hernandez
was, it did not really matter because the right-hander for Texas
dominated the Yankees for seven innings and made sure their offense
was anything but crisp in guiding the Rangers to an impressive 3-0
victory at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Rangers, like the Yankees, are leading their
division, they have developed an inferiority complex against the
defending champions after having lost 6 of 7 games against New York
this season and 14 of the last 18 regular-season meetings. Add the
three-game sweep by New York in the 1998 division series and the
Yankees had grabbed 17 of the last 21 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're obviously a good club,'' Torre said. ``We've been
fortunate against them.''
</P>
<P>
   For one night, though, the Rangers ruled. Lee Stevens socked a
monstrous two-run homer off El Duque into the right-field bleachers
in the second inning and Helling thwarted the Yankees with a strong
fastball, a sweet curveball and precise control.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had numerous scoring opportunities, but the magical
Helling performed like David Copperfield in making them disappear;
he allowed no hits in six at-bats with runners in scoring position
and just four hits overall.
</P>
<P>
   After Helling departed, the Yankees used a walk and an infield
error in the eighth to bring the potential tying run up against
Jeff Zimmerman with none out. But Zimmerman, a rookie who might be
the finest setup man in the league, was just as fierce as Helling
as he got Paul O'Neill to line to left, struck out Bernie Williams
and retired Tino Martinez on a groundout. The Yankees finished an
abysmal 0 for 9 with men in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not getting good swings against him,'' Torre said of
Helling. ``That's what it's all about. He changes speeds well on
his fastball. He has a curveball and a changeup. It looked like he
had everything tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who is 4-2 with a 1.99 ERA in his last six starts,
had one forgettable sequence in the second. After jumping ahead of
Juan Gonzalez with two strikes, Hernandez picked at the strike zone
and walked the Rangers' cleanup hitter.
</P>
<P>
   With Hernandez pitching from the stretch for the first time, he
tossed a weak changeup, and Stevens hammered it 419 feet. ``The
location was a little bit high,'' Hernandez explained. ``It was a
good pitch to hit. I made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The fan who whipped the ball back onto the field did not know it
then, but the hit basically decided the game. Ruben Mateo had a
run-scoring double in the seventh off Hernandez, who yielded three
runs and five hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Derek Jeter dived for Todd Zeile's low liner and
landed awkwardly on his left elbow and collarbone. Jeter remained
sprawled on the dirt for a few seconds before slowly standing up,
causing second baseman Luis Sojo to wave into the dugout for
assistance. But, after Jeter grimaced a few times and flexed his
arm a few times, he stayed in the game. Everyone affiliated with
the Yankees exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter seemed fine, but the Yankees were not. Helling, who had
allowed three earned runs in his last 18 2/3 innings, somehow had
one loss and two no-decisions during that span. But he ended that
drought and won for the first time since May 26 against a team he
beat once while going 20-7 last season.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees want to remember how and why they lost this game,
they could start the review in the first inning. After Jeter
singled and O'Neill walked, the Yankees were in position to damage
Helling. But Helling retired Williams and Martinez on fly balls to
left.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees trailing, 2-0, in the third, Scott Brosius, the
leadoff man for one night, opened by tucking a ball into the
right-field corner for a double. Once again, Helling was in a
sticky situation. But he struck out Jeter, O'Neill and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees left Jeter at second in the fifth, and Martinez was
inexplicably picked off first base to finish the sixth. By then, it
was obvious that it was Helling's night, not Hernandez's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always confident,'' the Yankees' Cuban right-hander
said. ``The day I'm not confident, I'm going home.''

McCLURE PREPARED TO TAKE THE TWO-CAR WINSTON CUP PLUNGE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry McClure has begun the countdown he hopes will keep his
racing team off NASCAR's endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   A single-car owner in a sport where survival now is measured in
two-, three- and five-car budgets, McClure is in the midst of a
sponsor and driver search suitable for the launch of a second
Winston Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   McClure's target date is ``sometime in July,'' the official
start of the schedule's second half and unofficial beginning of the
silly season for rampant rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Mark this down as fact: You can hardly win in Winston Cup racing
without a teammate any more. That point dramatically was hammered
home during 1998. Led by Jeff Gordon's single-season, record-tying
13 victories, multiple-car teams won 29 of 33 events. Bobby Labonte
was crowned single-car team ``champion'' with two rousing victories
last year. Team owner Joe Gibbs was so giddy at that success ratio
that he added rookie Tony Stewart and millions of Home Depot's
dollars to prop up his Pontiac program.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte (sixth) and Hamilton (10th) were the only single-car
drivers to wind up among the top 10 in points at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton and Ricky Rudd _ one of the dwindling members of the
once-trendy owner/driver ranks _ were the other single-car entities
to score Cup victories last year. Neither Hamilton nor Rudd has
come close to sniffing the rarefied fumes of Victory Lane during
the season's first 14 races. In fact, heading into the Pocono 500
at Pocono (Pa.) Raceway this weekend, no single-car team has won a
Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   Only one single-car operation, Bill Davis Racing with persistent
Ward Burton, is listed among the drivers' top 10. And Davis has
begun grooming Dave Blaney, former World of Outlaws Sprint Car
champion and his current Busch Grand National driver, for a
full-time Cup ride in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As we have seen with the disparate results racked up by team
owner Jack Roush's five-car fleet of Ford Tauruses in 1998-99, more
is not automatically better for all hands. At a time when NASCAR is
strictly controlling test dates, the primary sponsor pool is
beginning to dry up by some accounts and computers are spewing out
reams of information, more is just more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The multi-car team is here to stay,'' said McClure, whose No.
4 Kodak Film Chevrolet Monte Carlo has become a series fixture. As
recently as 1995, however, McClure won three races with driver
Sterling Marlin. After going 0-for-1997 with Marlin, McClure hired
Hamilton away from Richard Petty's No. 43 STP team, which then was
a single-car deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is 15th in points and dutifully waiting on a teammate
whom McClure might summon from the Winston Cup, Busch Grand
National, Craftsman Truck or Indy Racing League ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because expectations in Winston Cup are at an all-time
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your sponsor's expectations are high. My expectations are
high. Bobby Hamilton's expectations are high,'' McClure said of his
team based in Abingdon, Va. ``I don't need to do it personally. But
for this team to survive, we need that two-car team.''
SPOTLIGHT ON...Kay Keselowski
Woman owner earns respect in truck series
With an assist from her famous husband, Teresa Earnhardt paved the
way for successful women team owners in NASCAR's Craftsman Truck
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Earnhardt owned the No. 16 NAPA Chevrolet pickup that Ron
Hornaday Jr. steered to series championships in 1996 and 1998. That
husband Dale Earnhardt is a seven-time Cup champion unquestionably
accelerated that team's development.
</P>
<P>
   But Kay Keselowski and her not-as-famous racing husband, Bob,
are beginning to make headlines. That was the case Friday night,
when Dennis Setzer won the Pronto Auto Parts 400K at Texas Motor
Speedway in the No. 1 Mopar Performance Dodge owned by Kay
Keselowski.
</P>
<P>
   Setzer stands fifth in series points after 10 events, and has
finished in the top five in four of the past five races. Setzer
also has led laps in five of the past six events, assisted by
spotter Kay Keselowski.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of drivers would have a problem with a woman spotter,
but we have a great relationship,'' Kay Keselowski said. ``It helps
me feel like I'm part of that race, and I have something to do with
winning and losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay Keselowski's team is only the second non-NASCAR Winston Cup
Series affiliated outfit to win races in three consecutive seasons
(1997-99).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty excited to be where we're at,'' said Kay
Keselowski, whose husband is a former Automobile Racing Club of
America stock car champion and Truck series regular. ``We can't
match resources with the Hendrick's and Childress' and Earnhardt's
_ there's no way for us to do that. So we have to draw on our
knowledge and the fact that Bob and \Rteam manager\S Ron Keselowski
have been hands-on their whole lives. It's difficult. But we try
real hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay Keselowski said she had never been to a racetrack before she
met and eventually married Bob 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw this zinger at me, called racing,'' she said. ``Why
in the world would you ... I didn't understand it at all. I didn't
know who Richard Petty was.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Kay Keselowski now deals with King Richard as a
fellow Dodge truck owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely in the minority; there's only a couple of us
women \Rowners\S out there,'' she said. ``But I haven't thought
about being `accepted.' I do what I need to do to make this a
successful team.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS
Miller gets BGN ride
Team owner Darwin Oordt hired his third driver of the NASCAR Busch
Grand National Series yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR veteran Butch Miller will be in and Stanton Barrett out
as driver of the No. 40 Channellock Chevrolet Monte Carlo when the
series visits Watkins Glen, N.Y., for the Lysol 200 on June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, who replaced Kerry Earnhardt after the season's seventh
race, was upset that Oordt had hired Miller to drive on the Glen's
2.45-mile road-course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though that's just one race, I felt like it would be
devastating to what we've been trying to build,'' Barrett said.
``You don't change drivers in midstream when things are going well,
no more than you change crew chiefs or engine-builders.''
</P>
<P>
   Oordt said he made the move in a bid to run up front and
generate more TV exposure for his sponsor.
Setzer goes to school
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge Boys never have won a NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series
road-race, going 0-for-11 in that category since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to snap that streak, five Dodge drivers attended
Skip Barber's three-day road course academy in Sebring, Fla., at
the end of April. The group traded their 3,400-pound trucks for
1,100-pound Formula Dodge open-cockpit cars for lessons from chief
instructor Terry Earwood and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this driver is more ready than he's ever been,'' said
Dennis Setzer, winner of the Pronto Auto Parts 400K at Texas Motor
Speedway on Friday night. ``We also went to a small track in
Georgia \RJune 1-2\S and tested our road-race truck, which I've
never done. That's a big ace in the hole for us. Because any
right-hand corner is a major thought for left-hand racers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Truck series will run the first of back-to-back road-course
events at Portland (Ore.) International Raceway tomorrow.
CART also hits `road'
</P>
<P>
   The road-course season also begins for the Championship Auto
Racing Teams FedEx Series this weekend with the Budweiser/G.I.
Joe's 200 at Portland International Raceway. Ten of the next 12
CART events are to be run on either road or temporary street
courses. Fried begins therapy Crew chief Steve Fried has begun a
physical therapy program after his release from Methodist Hospital
in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Fried, crew chief for Energizer Motorsports rookie Robby McGehee
in the Pep Boys Indy Racing League, suffered head and chest injures
in a pit road accident during the Indy 500 on May 30. The immediate
focus will be for Fried to regain his strength and balance.
Last words
</P>
<P>
   ``The track is best described as three straightaways of sheer
boredom, and three turns of sheer fear.''
</P>
<P>

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux may be able to tell their sad stories
of struggle to the rest of the National League. They may even be
able to get a little sympathy in a few of those locales.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the rivers they cry won't flow through Houston, where the
Astros' bats have suddenly come up dry. Coincidence? Likely not.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Glavine had done a day earlier, Maddux dumped a season's
worth of frustration on the Astros, helping the Atlanta Braves to a
3-1 victory Wednesday night at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what all the talk is about those guys
struggling,'' Astros interim manager Matt Galante said. ``I don't
see it. Maddux had great stuff. I didn't see a struggling pitcher;
I saw the same old Maddux.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux and Glavine brought mediocre records and high ERAs to
town, but none of that seemed to matter against the Astros, who
managed nine hits over the past two days _ just three in
Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   But a testament to the way the Astros battled was the fact they
still managed to have the tying run at the plate in the eighth
inning despite being outhit 14-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how a three-hit game could have been that
exciting,'' Galante said. ``We battled our butts off; we just came
up a little short.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros dropped their second game in a row but remain
percentage points ahead of the Braves for the best record in the
National League. That figures to be a dogfight for the rest of the
summer, and it has the potential to get as heated as things became
in the bottom of the seventh inning Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (6-4) stomped around the mound and screamed obscenities a
couple of times after calls he didn't particularly like. Braves
manager Bobby Cox eventually had words with home-plate umpire Bruce
Froemming and was ejected after a spirited debate on the subject of
balls and strikes. Cox got his money's worth, serving up a
lip-reader's buffet before finally leaving the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with a little emotion in baseball,''
Maddux said. ``It's not basketball or football, but every once in a
while emotion slips in. We do care.''
</P>
<P>
   Once that squabble ended, a stink broke out involving Astros
center fielder Carl Everett, who had stolen third base one batter
earlier. Everett apparently was responding to something said by a
Braves player _ perhaps someone on the bench _ but he declined to
get into specifics about the matter after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Those fireworks were far more explosive than anything the
Astros' offense produced.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux held them to three hits and a run in 6 innings, and
relievers Mike Remlinger, Rudy Seanez and John Rocker combined for
2 innings of hitless, scoreless relief. Rocker collected his second
save in as many days and his 15th of the season. For the game,
Braves pitchers struck out 13 _ the most times Astros hitters have
fanned this season.
</P>
<P>
   Astros starter Sean Bergman didn't appear to have his best
stuff, but he kept the game close nonetheless. Four of the first
five batters reached base, including right fielder Brian Jordan,
who singled home Bret Boone in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves put at least one runner on base against Bergman (4-3)
in every inning except the fourth. Shortstop Ozzie Guillen hit a
one-out double in the fifth and scored on Chipper Jones'
two-bagger. Bergman allowed three doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bergy's location wasn't good,'' Galante said. ``His pitches
were up a lot. He made too many mistakes up in the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves added salt to Bergman's wounds in the sixth inning
when first baseman Brian Hunter started a two-out rally with a base
hit and scored on the second of Maddux's two singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you give up a base hit to the pitcher in that situation,
you just can't do that,'' said Bergman, who allowed three runs and
11 hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros hit only two balls out of the infield through the
first six innings, but they finally broke through for a run in the
seventh. Bill Spiers, a career .467 hitter against Maddux, led off
with a double, moved to third on Derek Bell's chopper to the mound
and scored on Everett's clutch two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who is 14-for-26 when a runner is at third base,
managed to punch the ball into left field despite breaking his bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been trying to pound me inside,'' Everett said of
Maddux. ``He had success the first two times, and the third time I
got him. I went up there with a heavier bat.''
</P>
<P>
   That was about the only time the Astros got the best of Maddux,
who had five 1-2-3 innings and retired 17 in a row at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the stuff he had, you would think he has 10 or 11 wins,''
Astros shortstop Ricky Gutierrez said. ``He was putting the ball
wherever he wanted to put it. He pretty much breezed through us.
That was his type of game.''

POLICE MAKE ARREST IN 23-YEAR-OLD MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYNNWOOD, Wash. _ Twenty-three years ago, police thought they
knew who killed 18-year-old Kimberly Marie Kuntz. Now they think
they can finally prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly's brother-in-law, James L. Stephens Jr., was charged
with first-degree murder Wednesday in her 1976 stabbing death.
Police used DNA evidence to make the case to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers say Stephens' then 3-year-old daughter was
somewhere in the apartment when Kimberly died and was able to
confirm that her father had been there that night.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens was charged in 1976 with Kimberly's rape and murder,
but prosecutors dropped the charges after deciding there wasn't
enough evidence for a solid case.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly's family never forgot her. Neither did police.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by new advances in DNA technology, Lynnwood
investigators reopened the case in 1997, poring over dusty boxes of
reports and evidence, reinterviewing witnesses, looking for
anything they could have missed before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to guess how many times we read the reports, just to
make sure we had everything,'' Detective Jim Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   They hit gold this week when a private laboratory solidly
matched a blood sample taken from Stephens six weeks ago to a semen
stain on the shirt Kimberly Kuntz wore when she died, police and
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the oldest murders charged in Snohomish County
history, Prosecutor Jim Krider said in a statement, calling the
arrest a result of ``excellent and persistent'' police work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those cases _ that's why we get into the business,
for justice,'' said Lynnwood Detective Sgt. Steve Bredeson, who
worked on the Kuntz murder as a young detective between 1978 and
1981, and directed Nelson and Detective Steve Rider to reopen it in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Kuntz's life was cut short just as it was beginning,
her family said in a statement Wednesday. She had graduated the
year before from Mountlake Terrace High School, where she had been
a cheerleader, and she worked as a file clerk for Allstate
Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so vibrant and fun. Her life was just beginning. She
had plans for college and a bright future,'' her mother and sister
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a daughter, she was such a joy, so loving and
considerate,'' wrote her mother, Gwen Kuntz. ``She and her dad were
quite close. I loved her dearly and miss her always.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Wednesday's charging papers, Kimberly was killed
while she was baby-sitting her 3-year-old niece _ the daughter of
Stephens and his estranged wife, Donna Stephens, who was Kimberly's
sister _ on the night of May 8, 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens had moved out of the apartment and Kimberly had told
friends she was hesitant to baby-sit in case she ran into him
because he had recently raped his estranged wife, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
   When Donna Stephens (who has since remarried and changed her
name) came home around 2:15 a.m., there was no answer when she
knocked at the door, papers said. She then saw a man standing 15
feet away wearing only a stocking mask. The man ran, and she called
police.
</P>
<P>
   Police found Kimberly Kuntz dead on the floor of the master
bedroom. Her niece was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did daddy come over tonight?'' Donna Stephens asked the little
girl, the papers said. The child nodded yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did daddy come see you?'' Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did daddy yell at Auntie Kimmi?'' Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did daddy say goodbye?'' No.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens admitted stopping by the apartment, but denied arguing
with Kimberly, the papers said. He skipped a follow-up appointment
with police, and later was arrested in a Bellingham, Wash., motel
where he had checked in under an assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Lancaster, who used to work with Kimberly, remembered her
friend in a telephone interview Wednesdsay night. Lancaster
recalled talking with Kimberly the night she died, asking her if
she wanted to come over. Kimberly said she couldn't, that she had
to baby-sit. The next thing she heard, her friend was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, justice has been served after all these years,''
Lancaster said, stunned by the news. Kimberly was ``a beautiful
girl,'' she said, outgoing and friendly and fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never forgotten about her.''
</P>
<P>
   After his 1976 arrest, Stephens pleaded not guilty to charges of
raping and murdering Kimberly Kuntz. Crime laboratory reports at
the time could neither exclude nor definitively identify him as the
killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology wasn't there,'' said Bredeson, who was a patrol
officer at the time. But each time the case was reopened it
progressed a bit, finding a few new witnesses or eliminating
potential other suspects.
</P>
<P>
   When he took his supervisory position in 1997, the department
was reorganized and priority was given to solving the old cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years is a long time, but it's not impossible by any
stretch of the imagination,'' said George Riley, scientific
director of GeneLex, the Seattle-based laboratory that did the key
DNA tests in the case.
</P>
<P>
   New techniques allow the lab to test samples that would have
been considered too small for adequate results even a few years
ago, and they also are ``so specific that it gets very good results
even when the evidence is in bad shape,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the DNA profile from the semen stain that had
been kept for 23 years as evidence in the Kuntz case would be found
only in one in every 377 million Caucasians. The semen stain was a
perfect match for Stephens' DNA, Snohomish County Deputy Prosecutor
Paul Stern wrote in court papers.

   Stephens, who lives in West Seattle and works for a shipping
company, has remarried and has a child, police said. He had been
under intermittent surveillance for some time, and under a steady
watch since police got a search warrant and took a blood sample six
weeks ago, Rider said.
</P>
<P>
   The case has consumed the detectives for two years now.

<P>
   Stephens was arrested without incident Wednesday afternoon at a
McDonald's restaurant near his home, police said. He's scheduled to
be arraigned Thursday. Police said they don't believe he's been in
trouble with the law in recent years.

statement Wednesday and thanked police for bringing some kind of
closure.

   ``It might seem like a long time ago that she was murdered, but
we never forgot,'' they wrote. ``Not a day passes that we don't
think of her. We have lived with this loss since then and it never
goes away.''

FOR WIN-PARCHED UNSER, PORTLAND HAS BEEN WELLSPRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND _ Father's Day in the Unser family historically has
been fast-paced. It usually includes winning a CART FedEx Series
race at Portland International Raceway, or coming darn close. It's
an occasion celebrated with victory champagne, not another gaudy
necktie.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a ritual Al Unser Jr. hopes to revive Sunday in the
Budweiser/G.I. Joe's 200 at the 1.967-mile Portland road course
where he scored the first of his storied 31 career wins on Father's
Day 1984.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon made for a particularly poignant holiday scene.
Unser's father, in the prime of his own legendary racing career,
was by all accounts the happiest last-place finisher in series
history _ his car unable to turn a lap because of mechanical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very gratifying day, let me tell you,'' said Al Unser
Sr., who still gets excited recounting it. ``To have your son
follow in your footsteps and then get to the point where he wins a
race and to do it for the first time on Father's Day ... It was
just great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest also is home to Al Jr.'s most recent win _ 1995 in
Vancouver, B.C. It's been a l-o-n-g 44 months since the two-time
CART series champion has sprayed champagne in victory circle.
</P>
<P>
   The same driver who won a dominating eight of the 16 races en
route to the 1994 PPG Cup has only seven podium finishes during
this nearly four-year winless streak, prompting the media and some
fans to suddenly question Unser's unquestionable abilities. And for
one of the most talented racers in history, this second-quessing
stings the ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating for him not being able to win, but he's a
great driver, and there are so many things that are out his
control,'' said Team KOOL Green driver Paul Tracy, a former Unser
teammate at Team Penske.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through these same sort of things, and you have to
put your head down and know it will eventually come around. He's an
icon in terms of Indy-car racing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's understandably tougher to endure the disappointments when
you've become accustomed to great success. Only Michael Andretti
has more wins (38) than Unser (31) among active drivers. In 17 CART
seasons, Unser has ranked among the top-five in points 11 times,
but hasn't finished among the top-10 since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   What he's done in the Northwest, is reason for optimism. He's
never finished lower than fifth place in nine starts at Vancouver
and has a record four victories there, including three straight
from 1993-95.
</P>
<P>
   Unser has finished among the top five in 12 of his 15 starts in
Portland, including back-to-back wins in 1994-95. He finished fifth
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But while struggling in races elsewhere, he has faced trying
times off the track, as well.
</P>
<P>
   His 12-year-old daughter Cody was stricken in February with a
rare neurological condition that has left her partially paralyzed
and unable to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after vowing to win the Miami season-opener for Cody a
month after her diagnosis, Unser broke his ankle on the first lap
of the race. His Marlboro Team Penske Mercedes-Benz was a mangled
and innocent victim of a rookie driver's first-race mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The injury sidelined Unser for the next two races and he comes
to Portland with only two points toward the championship standings
_ his lowest total ever through eight races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought last year was a tough year and the year before that
was tough, but, boy, was I wrong,'' Unser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my daughter getting hurt, then breaking my leg at Miami
after I thought we had a good shot in the race. ... I've just been
going, `Oh, O.K.' I believe in the good Lord, and there must be a
reason why things are happening like this. I have to believe He'll
get me through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Unsers are not quitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser hopes that kind of determination will make a difference
for his daughter, the second of his four children. Doctors have
been cautiously optimistic about Cody's recovery, reticent to give
a time frame. The virus that has caused the condition could go away
as quickly as it struck. And Cody, a youth basketball player and
avid outdoors person, could be walking again soon.
</P>
<P>
   There are no certainties, however, and Unser's voice cracks with
emotion when he talks about her. Some days, he'd prefer not to.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there was a brief time when Unser thought about stepping
away from racing _ first when Cody fell ill, then again when he
broke his ankle so severely. It seemed like he was being hit by one
misfortune after another and he wanted to be at his daugher's
bedside.
</P>
<P>
   Then he decided the best therapy for Cody would be setting an
example, by meeting the frustrations and mounting challenges
head-on and not giving in when that's the easier route.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing Cody needed right now was for me to stop
racing,'' Unser said. ``She needs the inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the inspiration goes both ways. A long-awaited
victory Sunday would make it Unser's kind of Father's Day.

DANISH A GOOD FIRST BITE FOR U.S. WORLD CUP TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is billed as the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, but
let's be honest. Up until now, World Cup fever has been mostly
about Mia Hamm and the dominance of the home team.
</P>
<P>
   That Stars and Stripes mood and marketing motif was certainly
clear Wednesday, when Women's World Cup officials opened a press
conference at the Essex Hotel on Central Park West with a video
montage that featured, well, a lot of footage of the mighty
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   We expect a lot more of this kind of thing the next three weeks,
provided the Americans do what is predicted of them, which is to
score goals, whoop it up with big wins and entertain the masses.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, this decidedly American mode of hyping the
World Cup has been a predictable approach here in the United
States, where the 16-team, 32-game soccer tournament begins
Saturday and ends July 10 with the championship in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm we know from those Pert commercials and because People
magazine told us she was one of the 50 prettiest people.
</P>
<P>
   And we know the general greatness of the skilled, veteran and
determined U.S. women's team because ever since 1991, when a
fledgling bunch won the first-ever Women's World Cup in China, the
U.S. has won Olympic gold and Goodwill Games and made the rounds
during exhibitions to the delight of soccer moms, dads and kids
across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the World Cup, not the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams are here. The U.S. has to beat other countries,
starting with Denmark, who is the opponent in Saturday's
anticipated U.S. opener at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday, just to set the record straight, the coach of
Denmark's World Cup team clarified a few facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all,'' Jorgen Hvidemose said in his best
Scandanavian-inflected English, ``let me just say that Denmark is
not the capital of Holland, as one person in Detroit once told
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tall, hunched over the microphone, speaking slowly and
deliberately to make sure no one missed his droll point, the Danish
coach played his underdog role without a flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark, along with 14 other World Cup participants, certainly
has the right to feel as if this entire World Cup on U.S. soil was
created to make the visitors feel like they are playing Vivian
Vance to the American team's Lucille Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Denmark and the rest can show up for this breakthrough
event for women's soccer (460,000 tickets have been sold and all 32
games are on TV), but it is best to understand that the marketing
of the event and the sport is all about the home girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I know that this is the way it will be,'' Hvidemose
said. ``It is promotion of the World Cup and women's soccer so the
Americans are the ones featured. I think it's OK. The Americans are
the Olympic champions and they probably have the best team.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, in Denmark, there is no equivalent of Mia Hamm, no way
for the Danes, or Mexicans or Brazilians or Norwegians, to fight
fire with star power.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could not happen there,'' Danish defender Lene Terp said.
``You cannot get that big. It's too small a country. If you start
to get that big, they bring you down. The sky is not so high in
Denmark. We are a little more ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when the best players from all 16 World Cup teams met
in San Francisco for a World Cup media event in February, Terp
said, she raised her eyebrow in disbelief when World Cup officials
handed her a Mia Hamm Barbie Doll.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is so American,'' Terp said, smiling a knowing smile
about the largesse of this big country.
</P>
<P>
   The Danes know exactly what they are up against in this 1999
Women's World Cup. And they don't care.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, they say it does not bother them.
</P>
<P>
   They view the U.S. as the one true professional team in the
World Cup, although they are certain there are ways to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not afraid,'' Hvidemose said. ``All teams have
weaknesses. You only have to find them. We know how to beat them,
but we're not sure we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   It does not faze the Danes that this World Cup is being played
in eight of America's biggest sports venues and corresponding
crowds, from Giants Stadium and a crowd of nearly 76,000 for the
opener to Foxboro, Soldier Field and the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have 300 Danes at Giants Stadium,'' Hvidemose said.
``I have heard from the Danish American Club in New York and they
promised they would be there, sitting behind the Danish flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred vs. 75,700. You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, yes, in Denmark, maybe we have 100 people at our games.
Mostly family. They come and eat a picnic,'' Terp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a great chance for us. We know our real chances
are against Mexico and Brazil (the other two teams in this
bracket), but this opening game, everyone will be nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get too high, maybe we can use this opening game
to our advantage. But if we lose, we should go out of that game
with our heads held high. We're prepared. We'll make it a good
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heavy dose of America boosterism, that is exactly
what soccer fans want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   So welcome to the Danes. Their sense of humor, proportion and
irony are much appreciated.
</P>

MOYER BAFFLES TIGERS FOR EIGHT, WINS 7TH STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Humility was the first thing Jamie Moyer learned as a
major leaguer. He won his debut in 1986, beating his hometown team,
the Philadelphia Phillies, and his childhood idol, Steve Carlton. A
few days later, also against the Phillies, he failed to survive the
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is a game of failure, Moyer said Wednesday night, after
succeeding again. He beat the Detroit Tigers 7-1 with a performance
typical of his recent stretch. Moyer worked eight innings, allowing
seven hits and walking none. It was his seventh win in a row and
improved his record to 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to win games,'' the 36-year-old left-hander said.
``I know it's not going to go on forever, and I'm not going to get
caught up in it. You could just as easily lose two or three in a
row and be pitching well, or pitching poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going well for me right now. I'm not going to gloat
about it, I'm not going to brag about it. That's not me, because I
know _ I've been humbled so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   He was humbled earlier this season by the Tigers, who beat Moyer
7-0 at the Kingdome on April 26. That night, said Tigers manager
Larry Parrish, Detroit was able to take Moyer's changeup to right
field. Not so at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't read Moyer's changeup at all tonight,'' Parrish
said, ``and he had a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a good slider, as Brian Hunter observed from center
field. The Mariners outfielder was with Detroit in April, and this
was his first time playing behind Moyer as a center fielder. That
vantage point gave Hunter new insight into Moyer's stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some pitches today playing center field, and it's a
whole different angle on the game,'' Hunter said. ``He even had a
little backdoor slider working along with his curveball. He was
throwing four pitches for strikes, and when a pitcher's doing that,
you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was one of four Mariners with multi-hit games, including
Ken Griffey Jr., who had two doubles as the designated hitter, and
David Segui, who had three singles and two walks. Alex Rodriguez
and Butch Huskey drove in runs, Dan Wilson hit a solo homer and
John Mabry was 2-for-4. But all Moyer needed was David Bell's RBI
double and Wilson's run-scoring groundout in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer lasted until the ninth, when rookie Aaron Scheffer came on
before some 40-45 family members and friends. Scheffer fanned the
first two he faced at his hometown park, then gave up two singles
before getting a fly out to end it. He kept the game ball, which
was no doubt a popular item at the Scheffer home in nearby
Westland, where Aaron stayed over Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dream come true,'' Scheffer said. ``It was awesome,
especially with my family and friends out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a Detroit reporter if he pitched Scheffer because of
his local ties, Mariners manager Lou Piniella smiled. Tiger Stadium
had no impact on his decision, but he was happy with how it worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   He was happiest, though, about Moyer, whose innings have been
invaluable to Piniella's inconsistent staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most important thing,'' Piniella said. ``You need
innings from your starters. We got eight good ones from Jamie
tonight _ eight excellent ones, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer struck out a season-high nine Tigers, and his eight
innings gives him 1051/3 for the year, tops in the American League.
He has a 2.56 earned run average during the eight starts in his win
streak and has worked eight innings in five of those outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job,'' Moyer said, ``is to go as deep into the game as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer spread around the credit, pointing to his defense and even
the new Tiger Stadium groundskeeper. Before, Moyer said, there
would be a 6-inch hole beneath the rubber on the mound by the
second inning, and the landing spot was essentially dust. Wednesday
night, the conditions were ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it is, it's my office,'' Moyer said. ``I
want my office to be just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the office or the employee in it, this much is
known about Moyer: the last five weeks, productivity is at a high.

U.S. DIPLOMAT FAILS TO CONVINCE BEIJING THAT EMBASSY BOMBING WAS
ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: CORRECTS headline; SUBS first 11 grafs with Chinese response,
details)  (rk)  
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering spent
Wednesday trying to convince determinedly skeptical Chinese
officials that the bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade on the
night of May 7 was a mistake. But after listening attentively, the
Chinese made clear that they were not persuaded, American diplomats
said today.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering, supported by officials from the Defense Department
and intelligence agencies, gave a detailed account of ``a long
series of errors over time'' that led to the bombing, members of
the delegation said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese side, represented by Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
and Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, ``listened with respect
and appreciation of the seriousness with which we spoke,'' an
American diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're digesting what we said,'' the diplomat said. ``They
have to think it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering arrived with a letter of introduction from President
Clinton that included an offer to pay compensation to the families
of the victims. Three Chinese died in the embassy attack, which
Chinese officials condemned as a deliberate act of aggression and
which created severe strains in Chinese-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   The officials refused Wednesday to give details of the oral and
written explanations given to the Chinese, saying that the same
information will soon be released to the American public.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the previously offered theory involving a faulty
map was far too simple to explain how NATO planners identified the
Chinese Embassy as a military site and pummeled it with multiple
bombs. ``It was a more complicated series of mistakes than that,''
a diplomat said. ``It wasn't just one faulty map.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering spent more than four hours meeting with Yang and with
other officials from the Foreign Ministry and the Chinese military.
In the afternoon, he met with Tang for about one hour. Wednesday
evening, during a two-hour dinner with Yang and others, the two
sides turned to discussion of bilateral and strategic issues,
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   China has demanded not only a full and public explanation of the
bombing but also the punishment of those responsible, a condition
the Americans may have difficulty meeting. .
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the Americans promised that at the end of the
investigation into the bombing ``the issue of accountability will
be addressed,'' the diplomat said, and the Chinese did not press
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the visit's sensitivity, even the fact that the
U.S. delegation had arrived in Beijing was not reported in
newspapers Wednesday morning or on Wednesday's night's television
news.
</P>
<P>
   In the angry aftermath of the embassy attack, which killed three
Chinese journalists and created indelible images here of a
smoldering building and weeping relatives, China suspended talks
with the United States on its proposed entry into the World Trade
Organization as well as on human rights and arms control, and put
off planned military meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The two governments are now feeling their way toward a new,
perhaps more realistic, relationship than in the past, when both
spoke of building a ``constructive strategic partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   The night of the embassy bombing, China's leaders were already
angry over the NATO military campaign in Yugoslavia, which they
called an illegal intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here described the embassy bombing as a criminal act
of aggression, and encouraged the state-controlled press to run
wild with accusations that it was the intentional act of an evil
empire, out to keep China down.
</P>
<P>
   In place of last year's friendly talk of partnership, top
officials including President Jiang Zemin, began warning about U.S.
plans for global domination, although they always maintained that
business ties should continue.
</P>
<P>
   When news of the bombing broke, latent public resentment of U.S.
power erupted into days of rock-throwing demonstrations at the U.S.
Embassy, mainly by students. Their fury was genuine, but they also
received logistical support from the government, which seemed to
view the outpouring of nationalism as a useful way to unify the
population and divert attention from economic and political issues
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Few Chinese openly accept the proposal that the United States,
with its technological wizardry, could have hit their embassy by
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   And if Chinese do accept the U.S. excuse of an outdated map,
they have to confront another painful truth: that the United States
and NATO simply were not paying much attention to China, which
expects to be treated as a great power.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, the vitriolic attacks on the United
States have moderated. Communist Party leaders have tried to
channel the nationalistic energy into hard work and support for the
Party in its drive to build a stronger China that can better stand
up to any attempts at foreign domination in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have stressed the need to resume business and
political ties with the United States _ after receiving an adequate
accounting of the Belgrade strike.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's newspapers reported the foreign trade minister's
statement that the right atmosphere for negotiations over China's
entry into the World Trade Organization will not be restored until
``U.S.-led NATO'' gives a satisfactory explanation for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The negotiations will be continued only if the good and
friendly atmosphere reappears,'' said the minister, Shi Guangsheng.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the trade body has been a longtime goal of China,
and President Clinton has said he wants to see China's entry this
year. But negotiations will be difficult in any case, because the
United States insists that China make hard concessions to open up
its markets.
</P>
<P>
   As they decide how to portray Pickering's visit, the Chinese
leaders face another delicate task: how to escape from a month of
aggressive anti-American rhetoric and credibly declare the
resumption of, in Shi's words, a ``good and friendly atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji are pragmatists who in the
past have stressed that Western trade and investment are important
to China's economic modernization. But they cannot afford to look
weak in the face of what they personally have called U.S.
aggression.

FASSERO NOT KEEN ABOUT MOVE TO BULLPEN

   DETROIT _ Jeff Fassero was not excited when he learned he was
moving to the bullpen, but he held out hope he could close games,
as he did in Montreal at times between 1991 and 1993. That won't
happen in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted me to be a set-up man,'' Fassero said of his
conversation with manager Lou Piniella. ``I said, if that's the
case, I want to close, too. I'm not going down there just to get
left-handers out. I want to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Piniella: ``I've got a closer. I didn't put him in the
bullpen to close. If I use (Jose) Mesa two or three days in a row,
it's a different story. I'm going to use (Fassero) like I use
(Jose) Paniagua.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero has made 170 starts since his last relief outing, on
Sept. 11, 1993. The Mariners had raised the issue of moving him to
the bullpen when he struggled in April, so Piniella's move wasn't a
total shock. But Fassero was unsure Wednesday how he'll adjust to
his new role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be (difficult), because in my heart I still want to
be a starter,'' Fassero said. ``I don't know how that will affect
me down there.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old left-hander does not think he'll have trouble
re-learning the mentality of a reliever, because he has made 162
relief appearances in his career. But he's not sure how his arm
will hold up after so many years as a starter, and pitching coach
Stan Williams admitted, ``We're going to have to learn him all over
again, from a bullpen standpoint, what he's able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella insisted Wednesday that the bullpen is best for
Fassero, and he has numbers on his side. Left-handers are batting
just .203 with two homers off Fassero, compared to .357 with 23
homers by right-handers. Only Boston's Pedro Martinez had thrown
more pitches than Fassero before Wednesday night's games, and
Fassero's effectiveness has dwindled after the early innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I told him (Tuesday), if he can piece together two or
three good innings, that's a way to get him back on track,''
Piniella said. ``It sounds like a demotion from the rotation, but
he can really help us. He'll get work on a more steady basis as
opposed to every five days, and it could get him sharper. He wasn't
happy when I told him about it, and I didn't expect him to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero is a free agent at the end of the season, and figured to
be one of the more attractive starters on the market. Now, he'll
have to pitch his way back into the M's rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a job to do, and I have to go out there and do
it,'' Fassero said. ``It's my free-agent year, and I'd like to put
up good numbers, and so far I haven't. I don't know _ we'll see
what happens the next couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Melvin Bunch still is scheduled to start in
Fassero's spot on Saturday. However, veteran Paul Abbott pitched
well in his first start for Class AAA Tacoma on Tuesday, working
seven innings, allowing four runs and averaging 91 mph with his
fastball. He may need one more start, but if he doesn't, Abbott
will start Sunday and Frankie Rodriguez will move up to Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   AVOIDING THE `KILL ZONE': Williams has begun a routine with
Mariners relief pitchers to help them pitch to the corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been hurting us are balls in the `kill zone' and
walks,'' Williams said. ``What we're trying to do is eliminate the
middle eight-tenths of the plate and make up a plate on either side
of that, and have them throw side to side.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday, when the program began, pitchers spent much of
the pre-game playing catch. Now, Williams is supervising each
pitcher throwing off a mound in hopes that the individual
attention, combined with the emphasis on avoiding the middle of the
plate, will help them develop consistent release points for inside
and outside pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the young pitchers to know that they can throw in and
out, and gain confidence in their mind that they can do that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Williams isn't slicing up home plates for his
makeshift model. He's using towels.
</P>
<P>
   CALLING ON MAC: Right-hander Mac Suzuki, designated for
assignment Tuesday, has attracted some interest from other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a few inquiries, a few calls from some clubs,
and we've made a few calls,'' said vice president for baseball
administration Lee Pelekoudas. ``We'll see how that plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are gauging interest in Suzuki partly to see if any
team would claim him if they tried to outright him to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL REPORT: Piniella expects to have right fielder Jay
Buhner (strained hamstring) back within a week. ... With Edgar
Martinez likely out until Friday with a sore left elbow, Ken
Griffey Jr. started at designated hitter again Wednesday as he
nurses a minor muscle pull in his upper thigh. ... Reliever Eric
Weaver, out since May 15 with bone spurs in his right elbow, threw
before Wednesday's game without pain. He is hoping to return in two
to three weeks.

 SPORTS COLUMN: COMBATANTS A MYSTERY UNTIL NOW  (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It took too long, but Game 1 arrived at last,
along with the news that Tim Duncan is as good as advertised. No
surprise, really, or that Larry Johnson's sprained knee ligament
miraculously healed. If we'd waited much longer for the finals to
begin, Phil Jackson would've found a cure for Shaquille O'Neal's
free-throw-shooting disease, or the common cold.
</P>
<P>
   Sit around long enough, you start to believe anything, even that
Patrick Ewing has been taking limping lessons in case he is needed
to make the first two jump shots of Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the guys around here, we joke that Patrick's going to
do the Willis Reed thing,'' said the Spurs' Jaren Jackson, who made
his own finals impression on Wednesday night with torrid
fourth-quarter shooting as the Spurs defeated the Knicks, 89-77,
kicking off a series that should have begun last Sunday night when
most Eastern time zone children weren't asleep.
</P>
<P>
   David Stern, the National Basketball Association commissioner,
once said that no finals game should ever end after anyone's
late-night news. That strategy has apparently gone the way of the
100-point offense, with the games beginning after most East Coast
kids and even a few working parents have gone to bed. Had the
series commenced last Sunday and not avoided next Sunday, three of
the possible seven games could have begun at 7:30 in the East.
Something for the fans, to conclude a season that began three
months late. Does anyone even remember the lockout?
</P>
<P>
   Stern has always wanted his championship series to develop the
cachet of the World Series and, by golly, it has. Game 1 flirted
dangerously with spilling into the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. This series actually has a quaint, old World Series
feel to it, with the Knicks and Spurs having not met during the
50-game regular season. It actually felt as if that they were from
rival leagues, the establishment Knicks against the first
descendants of the old American Basketball Association to advance
this far.
</P>
<P>
   Before baseball panicked into interleague play, the World Series
was always guaranteed to contain a freshness other sports lacked in
their championship events. It was a novelty to see the Yankees
confront the Braves in 1996. It was a pleasure to have Tony Gwynn
walk into Yankee Stadium and get caught up in its history, like
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   So Knicks fans waited Wednesday night, with their sophisticate's
curiosity and provincial dread to find out about Duncan, seen only
once, as a rookie, last season in New York. Let Marcus Camby
explain what the Knicks are up against.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside, outside, he does it all,'' Camby said after Duncan
torched the Knicks with 33 points and 16 rebounds, after the Spurs
won their 11th straight playoff game and put these Knicks behind in
a playoff series for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said he should have been the mvp and based on tonight,
you'd have to agree,'' Latrell Sprewell said. ``You see him on TV
but not until you get out there and have to bang with him, do you
have a different respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Only then could the Knicks know that Duncan is poised beyond his
23 years, that, as his coach, Greg Popovich said, ``Nothing fazes
the guy.'' Duncan hurt the Knicks from the high post and killed
them from the low post. And just when the Knicks were starting a
fourth-quarter push, Jackson hit three ``daggers,'' in Jeff Van
Gundy's opinion, mainly because Duncan was commanding so much
attention down low.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Duncan and David Robinson, this is not a fearsome Spurs
cast, but on Wednesday night it contributed in a way that was
reminiscent of those championship Bulls not named Jordan and
Pippen. Jackson brought his microwave offense off the bench. Avery
Johnson ran a competent point. Jackson and New York-raised Mario
Elie did an excellent job steering Sprewell and Allan Houston into
the 14 feet worth of interior Spurs defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spurs basketball,'' Robinson said. ``Close down the rim.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Camby, his no-rebound first half and gamelong foul
trouble indicated how much the Knicks have moved up in class from
Rik Smits. For a man so wounded, Larry Johnson looked mighty
limber, but grossly overmatched guarding Robinson in the first half
and Duncan in the second. This was a bad Knick omen, and, for Van
Gundy, the predicted matchups nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was decided last night. The Knicks only need one victory
to make this a successful trip. First impressions did mean
something in their three previous series, though. Based on last
night's, eighth-seeded Cinderella may be coming to the end of the
ball. A few strokes, unfortunately, before midnight back home. &QL;

SPREWELL AND HOUSTON SENDING OUT AN SOS TO TEAMMATES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs for rewriting throughout)  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ When they were finding seams in the defense in the
first half and knocking down jump shots Wednesday night, Latrell
Sprewell and Allan Houston were exploiting the one clear mismatch
the Knicks have over the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   They can't do anything about Tim Duncan; he is simply too good.
And David Robinson is going to get to the free-throw line
eventually, so the Knicks can forget about completely neutralizing
him, too. So much for the frontcourt matchup.
</P>
<P>
   But on the perimeter, it was different. The Knicks have scorers
and creators, players who can get to the basket and draw a foul. It
was thought to be their one great chance at upsetting the
multifaceted Spurs in the NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could just give Allan and Spree a little help, there's
no telling what we could do,'' Kurt Thomas said after San Antonio
won Game 1, 89-77. ``We definitely need to get more of a rhythm
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for some atrocious moments in the second and fourth
quarters, the Knicks didn't completely fall apart. Given that the
Spurs had come off 10 days of rest and the Knicks were hobbling, a
blowout would not have been strange.
</P>
<P>
   And when you break down the numbers, the dynamic duo of Duncan
and Robinson (46 points, 25 rebounds, nine assists, five blocked
shots) was simply more productive than Sprewell and Houston (38
points, eight turnovers and 23 missed shots).
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those factors, the Knicks never moved the ball like the
team that picked apart Indiana in the conference finals. Too often,
their offensive sets boiled down to Sprewell and Houston
monopolizing the ball on the perimeter and waiting for the shot
clock to wind down before moving.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell had six turnovers, but he kept the Knicks in the game
with his scoring binges. Houston scored 10 points in the first
quarter, but went from assertive to awestruck over the next three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more aggressive at getting the ball where I wanted to
get it,'' Houston said of his first-quarter onslaught. ``I have to
be more intent on getting to my spot. I didn't do that later in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``When we're in a good flow, everyone looks better.''
</P>
<P>
   The main problem was, neither Sprewell nor Houston received much
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``When guys are double-teamed, we definitely have to hit outside
shots,'' said Chris Childs (1 for 8). ``There's going to be nights
when shots don't fall. And when they don't fall, you have to do
other things. I've got to knock down more shots. As for those guys,
we need to get them more points in transition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls learned over the last decade that two potent
scorers on the perimeter can compensate for a drop-off at point
guard or center. And for the Knicks not only to compete, but to
pull off a monumental upset in the NBA finals, they need Sprewell
and Houston to play extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   But when your other offensive options have trouble producing,
it's tough to keep pace with a team like San Antonio. Charlie Ward,
Chris Dudley and a gimpy Larry Johnson did not give the Knicks
enough offensively. They finished a combined 5 for 20 from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have caught too many bounces and good breaks this
post-season to fold easily in the finals. Even in the fourth
quarter Wednesday night, they were within striking distance of at
least making it interesting.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three rounds of the playoffs, the Knicks found ways
to win on the road in Game 1. They did it by moving the ball around
and finding the open man. No matter who that player was, he would
usually knock down an open shot with the game in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs get a lot of credit for their defense, which was
menacing and impenetrable at the end of the second and fourth
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was Mario Elie bodying up Houston or Sean Elliott
flailing his arms to disrupt Sprewell, they put serious kinks in
the Knicks' game.
</P>
<P>
   But this was more about the Knicks' inability to generate points
at crucial moments of the game than any tremendous stop by Duncan
or Robinson. Thomas began to show signs of life near the end,
scoring on his patented arching jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson, who surprised everyone by rehabilitating his knee
injury in five days and starting Wednesday night, gets a pass. He
did all he could, given the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their contributions and those of Sprewell and Houston,
though, the rest of the Knicks have 48 hours to fix their broken
offensive games. Going home to Madison Square Garden in an 0-2 hole
would be rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurried shots,'' Childs said when asked to describe the
Knicks' offensive breakdown that led to 38.3 percent shooting and
50 missed shots. ``We weren't looking at the third and fourth
option. We were looking at the first option, staying on the strong
side instead of reversing the ball and pick-and-rolling more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in too much of a rush, shooting too many early jump
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Too much Sprewell and Houston and not enough of anyone else is
not going to cut it against this team. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ Maybe it was that Tim Duncan did so much so well.
Maybe the New York Knicks' injury and foul problems inside finally
caught up with them. But Duncan began Wednesday to take another
step toward the top level of superstardom.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His team began to look like him. The San Antonio Spurs made it
look easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs didn't break any records, though they did extend their
playoff winning streak to 11, matching the longest ever in the
postseason. They were far from their best, only occasionally
matching the play in their sweeps of the Los Angeles Lakers and
Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   But that made the Spurs' 89-77 victory Wednesday night so
remarkable. The Spurs didn't rout the Knicks to begin the NBA
Finals before 39,514 in the Alamodome. They just never seemed
terribly concerned with them, as if they could pick the score and
humbly chose to stop where they did.
</P>
<P>
   After taking over in the second quarter, the Spurs seemed to
need only to lean on Duncan enough to roll past the surprising
Eastern Conference champions. Though Knicks forward Larry Johnson
started despite a sprained right knee, Duncan all but toyed with
him and whatever else New York threw at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy at all,'' Duncan said. ``Those guys were
playing hard out there. They're a very physical team. I worked very
hard to get in position before they got down there. I worked hard
tonight. I really did.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan needed to make that point and insist so emphatically
because once he finished shaking off the rust from the nine-day
layoff since completing the sweep of the Trail Blazers, he had so
little trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't always take away greatness,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy said. ``We can't live with Duncan getting 33.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, who ended the game by pointing to an upper-deck group of
supporters from the Virgin Islands, dominated as if he was still
taking on the best of St. Croix.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 33 points, 16 rebounds and a pair of blocked
shots. He teamed with David Robinson, who had 13 points, nine
rebounds, seven assists and three blocked shots, to choke off most
of the Knicks' offense, reducing them to one-on-one jump shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably a little young to be a legend yet,'' Spurs coach
Gregg Popovich said of Duncan. ``I'm willing to call him that if
he's going to do this every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, however, only began the Spurs' flight to a 1-0 lead.
Once he began to roll, the outside shooters, particularly Jaren
Jackson, were left open. Jackson made five of 10 3-pointers to add
17 points off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Knicks, who will try to bounce back in Game 2 on
Friday, made just 31 of 81 shots (38.3 percent) despite hitting 52
percent of their first-quarter shots and taking a six-point lead.
And though the Knicks remained within six points with eight minutes
left, they made just five of 22 shots in the final 12 minutes with
Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston making only one of 12.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and Robinson combined to block five shots. But they
changed countless others until they changed the Knicks' offense
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing they do is clog the lane,'' Van Gundy said.
``Any time you penetrate the ball, they have two great
shot-blockers. We played three great shot-blockers in the first
three series, but never two on the court at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Spurs forward Malik Rose, ``Our defense in the fourth
quarter, led by David, man, they just covered the rim up.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan had begun to take over late in the first half, scoring
nine points in the final four minutes of the half and blocking the
last Knicks shot at the buzzer as the Spurs turned a 27-21
first-quarter deficit into a 45-37 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan continued to dominate the third quarter, and for most of
the period the Knicks did little but watch as either Sprewell or
Houston went one-on-one. Duncan scored the first three times he
touched the ball, and when Sean Elliott took a pass from Avery
Johnson for an open 17-footer, the Spurs had a 62-50 lead, their
largest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   While the Spurs were just beginning to finally get their entire
offense going, the Knicks were bogging down, limited to whatever
Sprewell and Houston could create for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine minutes of the game, the Knicks had worked
their offense well enough to have five assists. In the next 24
minutes, they had just three.
</P>
<P>
   But as they always seem to, the Knicks stayed just close enough.
With the Spurs temporarily going away from virtually everything
they did to gain command, the Knicks knocked six points off a
12-point Spurs lead with eight minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson nailed a trey, his fourth of the game, to give the Spurs
a 77-68 lead. But they did not finish off the Knicks until Duncan
took over one last time.
</P>
<P>
   After a Robinson free throw pushed the lead to 10, Duncan scored
six of the Spurs' next seven points, all on layups. His tip of a
missed reverse gave the Spurs an 84-70 lead with 3:07 left.
</P>
<P>
   While the Spurs were becoming increasingly efficient, the
Knicks' offense went from sporadic to dreadful.
</P>
<P>
   Relying almost entirely on one-on-one moves, the Knicks made
just two of 14 shots in the quarter, until a Kurt Thomas jumper
with 2:46 left. Indefatigable in the Pacers series, the Knicks
appeared worn to a collapse. And the Spurs cruised to a no-doubt
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for them, just because they are hurt,'' Duncan
said. ``We're going to keep playing hard through it. They're a very
physical team. Even when they beat us up, we're going to find ways
to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he left little doubt.

BELTRE'S HIT GIVES DODGERS VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With two months of frustration built up from poor
start after poor start, Los Angeles Dodgers lefty Carlos Perez used
a bat to take some of that pent-up energy out.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it was on the water cooler in the dugout after
Perez was hooked after giving up four runs in 31/3 innings in
another abbreviated start against the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the slumping Dodgers beat the Pirates 6-5 in a slow-paced
game Wednesday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Adrian Beltre gave the Dodgers the slight edge
with a single to right with two outs in the seventh off reliever
Brad Clontz. The floater down the line scored Raul Mondesi and came
after Devon White was intentionally walked.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers entered the night having lost a season-high four
straight, seven of eight and 10 of 13.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers used the home run and hustle to climb back
into the game, it doesn't solve the mystery of what to do with
Perez. Manager Davey Johnson has talked repeatedly about how Perez
throws too many pitches and doesn't challenge hitters. Johnson
contemplated pulling Perez out of the rotation but said he needed
to work out his problems as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Pirates, Perez threw 82 pitches, allowed five hits,
walked three batters and hit another with a pitch. It's the fourth
time this season Perez has lasted fewer than four innings. Perez's
last start ended after a season-low 21/3 innings in which Oakland
scored eight times. In his last three starts, Perez, who saw his
National League-worst 7.18 ERA rise to 7.38, has allowed 19 earned
runs in 121/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the previous night, when Kevin Brown trailed 2-0 after
two pitches, it took the Pirates a little longer to get to Perez.
Pittsburgh didn't score until the third batter, Brian Giles,
singled to center. The Pirates took a 2-0 lead when Giles, who was
eventually balked to third, scored on a popup in short right field.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh took a 3-0 lead in the second when Abraham Nunez
scored on Mike Benjamin's single to right.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tied it with one swing in the bottom of the third on
Gary Sheffield's three-run homer off Pittsburgh starter Francisco
Cordova. It was Sheffield's 14th homer.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez, who is 2-8 with the no-decision, walked three
straight to begin the fifth before Johnson pulled him in favor of
Jamie Arnold, who is slated to start Saturday. Johnson said Arnold
would be available through Wednesday's game without it affecting
his pending start.
</P>
<P>
   Perez walked to the dugout, picked up a bat and started swinging
wildly at the water cooler, taking repeated hacks at it before
throwing the bat down and disappearing down the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold hit Ed Sprague with his first pitch to force in a run and
give the Pirates a 4-3 lead. It was the second straight outing
Arnold entered the game with the bases loaded only to hit the first
batter he faced. But the rookie righty escaped further damage when
he got Giles to ground to Young for an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tied the score 4-4 with White's solo homer to lead
off the bottom of the fourth. They took the lead later in the
inning when Beltre popped a ball just out of the reach of second
baseman Nunez and stretched it into a double. Beltre went to third
when right fielder Jose Guillen's throw bounced off him and scored
on Angel Pena's double to right-center field to give the Dodgers a
5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh tied it in the top of the sixth off Arnold with the
aid of an Eric Young error. The second baseman misplayed Warren
Morris' grounder to lead off the inning. Morris scored on a two-out
single to right by Giles. &QL;

MAN GETS LETTER POSTMARKED 1950
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TROY ANDERSON AND MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When a time-worn envelope with a 3-cent stamp
arrived at his door, Robert J. Davis knew he had a mystery on his
hands. And then he saw the postmark: ``Winsted, Conn., June 6,
1950.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was five years before I was even born,'' the 44-year-old
roofing contractor said. ``It's kind of weird that I got a letter
sent 50 years ago addressed to our name and address.''
</P>
<P>
   The envelope is addressed to ``Mrs. Robert J. Davis, but Davis
doesn't know the sender, Harriet Atwood, or anyone in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Postal authorities also were perplexed when they heard about it
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a little detective mystery here,'' said Terri
Bouffiou, a Postal Service spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the letter, Davis and his wife, Annette, realized
its grave importance. In it, Atwood appears to be telling her
daughter and son-in-law in Tujunga _ ``Doris and Rob'' _ that she
might die at any time and wants them to visit her in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very cold much of the time,'' Harriet Atwood wrote.
``Every few minutes I have to put my hands under a woolen blanket.
I was in a great deal of pain last night. ... It's nice to hear
from you, and please save up money so you can come and see me this
summer as I'm not much good at best and something might take me out
anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   She signed it: ``Ma.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is at a loss as to what to do with the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the daughter and son-in-law are alive, but
they should get this letter,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a neat thing if we could get this letter to
somebody in her family, but we'll have to fly back to Connecticut
personally to deliver it or it'll get lost in the mail for another
50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   A Winsted, Conn., resident named Nancy Atwood, 71, said she
thought the Harriet Atwood in the letter might be her
grandmother-in-law, also named Harriet Atwood. She thought her
grandmother-in-law might have sent the letter to her daughter, who
was recently put into a retirement home in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But when she looked in a drawer with information about that
Harriet Atwood, she found that her grandmother-in-law was born
March 16, 1853, and died Dec. 4, 1938, 12 years before the letter
was written.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would have been dead at that point,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Postal authorities said the delivery of the letter nearly 50
years after it was mailed is both highly unusual and mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   Bouffiou said she's heard of letters found after being lost for
20 or 30 years, but never after almost half a century.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of scenarios could account for the letter's recent
arrival, she said.
</P>
<P>
   If a Postal Service worker discovers mail behind a desk or under
a floor when a post office is remodeled, it is sent in a plastic
envelope with a note of apology attached.
</P>
<P>
   But the Atwood letter arrived without a note.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was addressed in 1950 to ``Mrs. Robert J. Davis, P.O.
Box 182, Tujunga, Calif.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the top of the envelope is another, more recent postmark:
``Philadelphia, Pa.,'' with a date of April 12, 1999, and a
forwarding address. That new address is the current one of Davis
and his wife, 10739 Helendale Ave., Tujunga.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10739 has a question mark after it, and it's not in (the
same) handwriting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouffiou said the U.S. Postal Service's East Coast mail recovery
center is located in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Bouffiou speculates someone recently found the letter and
dropped it into the mail. Someone at the mail recovery center might
have found Robert J. Davis' address in Tujunga on the Internet and
mistakenly thought he was the same Robert J. Davis whose wife was
sent a letter in 1950. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

 By FRAN BLINEBURY 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN ANTONIO _ Tim Duncan gave the New Yorkers a dose of their own
brand of hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   It was as easy as mugging tourists from Iowa on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   As an opening-night performance in the NBA Finals, it was good
enough to receive a curtain call on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   He was inside. He was outside. He hit jump shots. He rolled to
the hoop for simple layups and difficult reverses.
</P>
<P>
   He was up above the rim grabbing rebounds. He was down
scrambling all over the floor for loose balls.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a second-year pro in his first game in the championship
round, and he rolled to 33 points and 16 rebounds, telling the
Knicks right from the start that it was going to be a long night.
And maybe a very short series after an 89-77 decision by the Spurs
in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just really happy and really relieved to finally get
back out there on the floor and play a game after a 10-day
layoff,'' Duncan said. ``Those 10 days seemed like an eternity, and
in the first quarter tonight a couple of us got winded.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all we wanted to do was sort of weather the storm at the
start, get our legs back and get back into our rhythm, and we
thought it would be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   For Duncan, the former swimmer from St. Croix in the Virgin
Islands, this one looked like a lazy day in the pool. Doing the
backstroke.
</P>
<P>
   With the Knicks missing the injured Patrick Ewing and playing
with the hobbled Larry Johnson, they were virtually helpless
against the Spurs' Twin Towers combination of Duncan and David
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   This was a night that began with San Antonio legend George
Gervin whipping the crowd of 39,514 into a frenzy with a ceremonial
jump ball using the red, white and blue ball of the old ABA, where
the pace was often breakneck and scoring was at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   But Duncan and Robinson quickly showed the Knicks that times
have most certainly changed around these parts as they stopped up
the middle on defense and choked off virtually any chance that New
York had of taking the ball to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game where the Knicks shot a miserable 38 percent from
the field, where Latrell Sprewell missed 15 of 24 shots, where
Allan Houston couldn't fully recapture his magic from the previous
round and shot just 7-for-17.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night when the Spurs took awhile to blow all the rust
out of their pipes.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, it was a night when there was absolutely no answer
for Duncan and everything that he did.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk before the series about the last meeting between
Duncan and the Knicks' Marcus Camby back when they were in college.
Camby got the best of that matchup. But it wasn't even close this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan started off the night by banking in an 18-foot jumper,
and by the end he was tiptoeing along the baseline and dropping in
nifty reverse layups. He may be only in his second NBA season, but
he performed like a veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim didn't like the way he started off in the last series
against the Trail Blazers,'' said Spurs point guard Avery Johnson.
``So he worked hard during the break before this one. He worked
extra hard. I could see that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see in his eyes before the game that he was ready, and
I told him, `Big fella, I'm coming to you the whole game.'''
</P>
<P>
   And they did. And there was nothing the Knicks could do to stop
him.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the hoop on Chris Dudley, and he shot the ball over
Johnson. He zoomed past Camby, and he devoured Herb Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Just the fact that the 41-year-old Williams _ the oldest player
in the NBA _ was in the game near the end of the first half spoke
volumes about how desperate the Knicks are and will continue to be
in this series, trying to find any way to just slow Duncan down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim is a strange bird,'' said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. ``He
is so mature for his age. He has a natural disposition that I call
island time. It seems like absolutely nothing fazes him. Whether he
makes a fantastic play or he makes a big turnover, nothing bothers
him. He just goes on, and he plays his game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about Tim that I noticed right from the
start,'' said Robinson. ``He came into the league in his first
season, and it wasn't like he was excited or in awe of anything. He
knows how to play the game, and he goes about doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan is the rarity these days as a rookie who remained in
college for his entire four years, and that is one of the primary
reasons that his game is so solid, so fundamentally sound. He
sounds like a veteran, and he plays wise beyond his years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just started calling plays and I hit a few baskets, and
so they kept coming to me,'' Duncan said. ``I had to work hard out
there tonight, because the Knicks play hard and they're a physical
team. I had to work hard to get my shots. It wasn't easy out there
at all for me.''
</P>
<P>
   So you can imagine how the Knicks felt.

A ROMP IN THE PARK FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TWINS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Throw in a few palm trees, and this could easily have
been March and another spring training game between those Fort
Myers cohabitants, the Red Sox and Twins.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the 30,085 in attendance at Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's
5-1 Sox win at Fenway Park was to remain engaged in a game so
devoid of excitement, one spectator, Pedro Martinez, amused himself
by standing on top of the dugout steps and giving the choke sign in
the direction of the press box.
</P>
<P>
   There was more at stake, of course, for rookie Brian Rose, who
ran his record to 4-0 by scattering seven hits in six-plus innings,
the only Minnesota run coming on Torii Hunter's leadoff home run in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think the more I'm throwing the more confidence I have
that I can throw pretty much all my pitches,'' said Rose, who in
spring was one of the team's first cuts but in six starts since his
promotion from Pawtucket has been a part of five Red Sox wins.
</P>
<P>
   The win keeps intact the most astonishing stat of the Sox season
so far: the Pawtucket callups of Rose (4-0), Juan Pena (2-0), and
John Wasdin (6-0) remain unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty low-key type of guy,'' said Rose, of the South
Dartmouth Roses. ``I think I'm a little more mature than I was in
'97. I'm just going out there every five days, trying to do my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who had no-decisions in his previous two starts, including
his last outing in New York when he allowed just three hits in
seven scoreless innings, was given a 2-0 lead in the second on RBI
doubles by newly revived Mike Stanley and Damon Buford.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox widened that lead to 4-1 when Stanley hit his second
double of the night, scoring Brian Daubach, who had led off with a
double and taken third on Nomar Garciaparra's drive to deep center.
Troy O'Leary, who walked, took third on Stanley's hit and scored on
a sacrifice fly by Jason Varitek, newly ordained in Baseball
America as the best-ever catcher in college baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who on Tuesday night broke an 0-for-27 slump and wound
up collecting his 1,000th hit, played the numbers game again
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night when he recorded the 200th double of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Longevity,'' Stanley said. ``I'm just thankful that I've been
able to stay healthy and stay around this game. I mean, they're not
Hall of Fame milestones by any stretch of the imagination but
they're Hall of Fame in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The first four Sox runs were scored against another
Twins-pitcher-in-training, rookie Dan Perkins, who won 13 games in
each of the last two seasons, but had never pitched higher than
Double A New Britain. It's been a tough week for Rock Cats alumni,
who are heavily represented on this 13-rookie roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perkins obviously had a hard time throwing strikes,'' said
manager Tom Kelly, host of the Twins' nightly community auditions,
who lifted Perkins after three innings in which only half his
pitches (32 of 64) were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Those brave souls who stayed for the duration were rewarded for
their patience with Garciaparra's 11th home run and first of the
month. It was a first-pitch blast into the left-center-field screen
in the eighth inning off lefthander Benj Sampson that ended a
14-game homerless streak for the Sox shortstop, Yawkey Way's
favorite son for the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a home run hitter,'' said the only man in the Sox
lineup whose baseball card suggests otherwise, ``so I don't worry
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The night's one whiff of controversy _ or comedy, depending on
your interpretation of Martinez's gestures _ was inspired by the
Twins seventh, which began with a single by Chad Allen. The next
batter, A.J. Pierzynski, skidded a ground ball up the middle that
was cut off nicely by Offerman as he glided to his right. The Sox
second baseman, with his momentum carrying him toward left field,
attempted to flip the ball with his glove to Garciaparra at the
bag, but his throw flew past the Sox shortstop and both runners
were safe. Official scorer Bruce Guindon charged Offerman with an
error on the play.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, manager Jimy Williams lifted Rose for Derek Lowe,
who extricated the Sox from further trouble when he retired pinch
hitter Brent Gates on a flyball and induced Jacque Jones to bounce
into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   But it was in the eighth inning, when Williams used three
relievers _ Rheal Cormier, Kirk Bullinger, and Mark Guthrie _ that
Martinez appeared to register his displeasure with the Offerman
error call.
</P>
<P>
   He stood on the steps for several moments while looking at the
press box, pointed at the scoreboard, held up four fingers (the
number used to designate the second baseman), formed an ``L'' _ his
gesture for loser _ then grabbed his throat with his hand
repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said it was a mistake to think he was motioning toward
the scorer. ``I was giving the `L' Johnson to Kevin Shea,'' he
said, referring to the Sox publicist. ``Don't assume what I was
doing until you ask me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea laughed when told of Martinez's remark. ``He gives me the
`L' all the time,'' Shea said. ``I thought he was waving to his
father in the grandstand.''
</P>
<P>
   Guindon, who has been the regular scorer at Triple A Pawtucket
since 1992 and estimates he has scored about 25 games here in a
backup role, defended his call after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't hesitant then, and I'm not hesitant now,'' Guindon
said. ``If he wanted to concede second base, I think he still gets
the batter. If he makes a good throw to second base, I think he has
a chance at a double play, though I can't assume that.''
</P>
<P>
   Much ado about nothing? Given the chance to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, Martinez is almost always
above reproach.
</P>
<P>
   Then again . . . he still insists that was Jim Corsi in the Yoda
mask last summer.

DUNCAN DOES IN KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ This one came right from the script. You want to
beat the Spurs, something's gotta give. They gave away little
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. Tim Duncan killed the Knicks inside, Jaren
Jackson tortured them from afar, and once the Spurs got rolling,
things pretty much fell into place.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio shook off its predictable rust from a nine-day
layoff and then, riding Duncan like the thoroughbred he is, took
over the game. The result was a convincing 89-77 triumph in Game 1
of the NBA Finals, the Spurs' 11th straight playoff victory. Game 2
is Friday night at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan put on a clinic at the expense of any Knick who had the
temerity to try to defend him. He finished with 33 points, 16
rebounds, 2 blocked shots, and a host of hosannas from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside, outside, he did it all,'' saluted Marcus Camby, who
was limited to 23 minutes by foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Added Duncan, ``I'll stick with rusty.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, whose raison d'etre is the long ball, knocked down five
treys, including a couple of improbable daggers. He finished with
17 points. David Robinson did not shoot well (3 for 10) but did
everything else, collecting 9 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 blocks, and
getting a handful of Knicks into early foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But the story was Duncan. He outscored the entire Knicks team in
the second quarter, 11-10, which also coincided with the Spurs'
takeover of the game. San Antonio turned a 6-point deficit after
one into an 8-point lead at the half with Duncan already in
double-double land (19 and 10.).
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks never seriously threatened, but, true to their style
and purpose, stayed within reasonable striking distance. But they
never got closer than 6, and the Spurs limited them to 14 points in
the fourth, pulling away with a Duncan-led 8-0 run to make it 82-68
with 4:51 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks did get something from Larry Johnson, but not much.
He had as many fouls (5) as points. Latrell Sprewell and Allan
Houston each had 19, but Sprewell patterned his night after Antoine
Walker (24 shots) and Houston missed nine of his last 11 shots
after starting out strong in the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, collectively as a team, we were a little
frantic and lost our poise on the offensive end,'' Houston said.
``We lost a little of our rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the foul trouble, the big game from Duncan and
the ongoing injury woes (Camby hurt his knee, but dismissed it
afterward), the Knicks were hanging around, within 6 with 8:28
left. The Spurs called time and decided to put an end to formal
competition for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the break came (a) Camby's fifth foul and (b) Jackson's
fourth trey on an inside-out pass from Duncan. Then came five
botched possessions and a Robinson free throw. Duncan then went
over Chris Dudley for a short jumper and, after another Robinson
rejection, hit a short pop to complete a game-breaking 8-0 run. The
lead was 14 with 4:51 left and the Knicks, who shot 27 percent in
the quarter and 38 percent in the game, were cooked.
</P>
<P>
   The two unknowns going into the game were the status of Johnson,
who sprained his right knee last Friday, and the effect of the
nine-day layoff on the Spurs. Johnson told coach Jeff Van Gundy he
could go and started the game. But he was gone in less than three
minutes due to two quick fouls, a pattern the Knicks battled,
unsuccessfully, all game.
</P>
<P>
   The one Knick who survived the battle inside was Kurt Thomas,
who had 13 points and 16 rebounds. The Knicks outrebounded the
Spurs, 43-37, and had a huge edge in second chance points, 20-2.
That prompted San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich to say the team
needed to shore up those two areas, along with poor free throw
shooting (19 of 31).
</P>
<P>
   Popovich might not have anticipated those shortcomings, but he
had to expect it would take awhile for his team to get rolling. The
Spurs actually trailed by 6 at the end of a very shaky first
quarter which was easily predictable. Then the Knicks got
Duncanized in a hurry. He had 9 of his 11 points in the final 4:16
as San Antonio closed the half with a 14-2 run, holding the Knicks
without a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped giving them the easy shots they had in the first
quarter,'' Duncan said. ``We started contesting everything. It
really took us about a quarter to get everything going and a half
to get back to where we were.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a place the Spurs know quite well these days. That's in
the script as well.

KNICKS FACE TALL ORDER AGAINST SPURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ For the first time in the semi-august history of
the NBA Finals, the 1999 version features an eighth-seeded team,
the New York Knicks. Also unprecedented is an appearance by one of
the survivors of the old American Basketball Association, the San
Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   This series also may be the first time in Finals history that
the free throw is celebrated as the coin of the NBA realm.
</P>
<P>
   In other words _ bring back the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's a tad harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Bring back Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Besides lacking a certain Air and a certain pedigree, this Green
Acres matchup of Eddie Albert country vs. Eva Gabor urbanity lacks
a flow, if Wednesday night's first game is representative of the
next week's best-of-seven grind.
</P>
<P>
   While 50 combined free throw attempts is not a Finals record,
they did serve as a pleasant diversion to the 29 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   And since the Spurs had 31 foul shots, that was as good a
symptom as any in explaining the Spurs' 89-77 opening win over
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But in searching for a cause for the symptom, and its result,
extensive research is not required.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs are taller. Remember where you read it.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly Tim Duncan, who by the time Game 2 rolls around
Friday, figures to be 11 feet, 6 inches in the imagination of the
Knicks. His 33 points and 16 rebounds dwarfed the Gothams in the
fashion of Manhattan skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   In the likely event that Jordan does not come back today, Duncan
has made a credible effort to give America a fresh hoops hero. He
needs to work up a good gambling jones, as well as snappy patter
with phone-service-shilling cartoon characters. But a guy has to
start somewhere, and splattering a Big Apple team is a great way to
some big pub.
</P>
<P>
   Along with fellow 7-footer David Robinson (13 points, nine
boards, seven assists), they were exactly as advertised: Way too
much for the Knicks, as they have been for the Western Conference.
Eleven consecutive postseason triumphs not only ties an NBA record,
it leaves the Knicks with a formidable task in just pulling out a
win, much less the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great size, strength and quickness in the post,''
said a slightly baffled Jeff Van Gundy, the Knicks coach. ``We
studied them a lot, but you don't know a team until you play
them.''
</P>
<P>
   What Van Gundy knows now is what seemed obvious to many less
scholarly basketball mavens: Missing injured center Patrick Ewing
and struggling with hobbled power forward Larry Johnson (21
minutes, five points), the Knicks may as well be catching buffaloes
with box traps.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's ease with which he grabbed entry passes and slithered
past the Knicks' aggressive double-teams was remarkable. On
defense, he and Robinson combined for five blocks and shocked the
Knicks with threats to so many other shots that they missed 17 of
their 22 fourth-quarter casts.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as if the heavily draperied Alamodome had fallen in on
the New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've faced three good shot-blockers in the playoffs,'' Van
Gundy said of Miami's Alonzo Mourning, Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo
and Indiana's Rik Smits. ``But never two at the same time. That's a
big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one is quite set to reward the Spurs with the
championship trophy, Wednesday night did establish that the talent
mismatch between the Knicks and Spurs is formidable. And given the
patchwork nature of the Knicks' lineup owing to injuries, the Spurs
seem to have an edge in the ever-elusive matter of chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you just have those years where everything clicks,''
said Robinson, who couldn't be more delighted that he has evolved
into a high-post passer from a low-post scorer. ``And when you have
the team that comes together, there's a bond on the floor that's
real positive. This is just one of those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, sluggish from the nine-day layoff, began to hum in
the second quarter as the Knick fouls piled up, leaving poor Chris
Dudley as the helpless, hopeless big man to work on the Spur
tandem. Dudley, perhaps the worst shooter this side of Olden
Polynice, was readily abandoned by the double-teaming Spurs'
defense, and thus wound up with three of the Knicks' final five
shots of the first half. Two had to be removed surgically at
halftime from his soul, so harshly were they rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan claimed his night was much harder than it looked, and
presumed that the Knicks would again dump heavy ordnance in the way
of fouls for the rest of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are physical,'' he said, ``and can do a job on us on a
given night.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that the given night could occur in the next three
games. But already gone is the chance to catch the Spurs at the end
of a nine-day nap. Just as is the chance get taller.
</P>
<P>
   There's always the chance that the Spurs, having never been to
the Finals before, could outthink themselves. But Spurs coach Gregg
Popovich seemed hip to the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get real dumb in nine days,'' he said, ``trying to
think of something clever.''
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious Wednesday night that Popovich and the Spurs were
concentrating only on the obvious:
</P>
<P>
   Tall guys good. Short guys short.

SPURS STRIKE FIRST AS DUNCAN DOMINATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ He is usually so reserved and mild-mannered. San
Antonio Spurs center Tim Duncan rarely gets accused of anything
bad.
</P>
<P>
   So it would be hard to believe that Duncan got into his share of
trouble as a child. But he did _ doing ``stupid things'' _ though
Duncan insists he was not one to cut school.
</P>
<P>
   He liked homework.
</P>
<P>
   And you can bet the New York Knicks were studious before Duncan
and the Spurs tagged an 89-77 loss on them in Game 1 of the NBA
Finals Wednesday night at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   What the Knicks found out while falling behind in this
best-of-seven series is that Duncan isn't a quick study. He's also
neither as soft or as aloof as he is often made out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan still can be ornery, which is how he amassed a game-high
33 points and 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bad for the Knicks, who dropped Game 1 for the first time in
four playoff series. Good for the Spurs, who won their 11th
straight playoff game behind Duncan's muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy at all,'' said Duncan, who made his 13-for-21
shooting seem effortless. ``Those guys were playing hard. They are
a very physical team. I had to work to get into positions where I
could get easy shots before they could get down there on me. I
worked hard. I really did.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard the Knicks pushed, pulled and crowded Duncan,
he appeared immovable. He was one of the few Spurs who seemed to
benefit from their 10 days off before Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job of posting deep, avoiding the double team
and just getting up and shooting over guys,'' teammate Mario Elie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Duncan's teammates looked rusty with the exception of
Jaren Jackson. He chipped in 17 points off the bench, including
five 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can live with Duncan scoring 33,'' New York coach Jeff Van
Gundy said, ``but we've got to take away Jaren Jackson's threes.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy may change his tune if San Antonio begins to get its
usual firepower from several different sources. For the moment, the
Knicks' primary concern might be how to score against the Spurs'
tall front line.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell did what they could and
scored mostly in transition. Both New York guards scored 19 points.
But Larry Johnson, Chris Dudley, Kurt Thomas and Marcus Camby
combined for just 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Knicks won the rebounding battle 43-37, they
were held to 38-percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kind of lost our poise a little bit on the offensive
end,'' Houston said, ``instead of passing the ball to each other
and being a little bit unselfish and taking shots that we need to
take. That's really the key for our team at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks trailed by 11 points in the third quarter, but cut
the Spurs' lead to six early in the fourth. But Jackson buried a
3-pointer and Duncan made three straight field goals.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:05 left in the fourth quarter, Duncan tipped in his own
miss. That put the Spurs ahead 84-70 and finished off the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for them because they're all hurt,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson started despite a sprained right knee that made his
availability a game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   Though Johnson, the Knicks' most effective post player in the
playoffs, did not seem bothered by the knee, foul trouble left him
ineffective. Only 2:11 had elapsed in the first quarter before he
picked up his second foul while trying to defend San Antonio's
David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   New York sent double teams at Duncan and Robinson early. But
Duncan and Robinson attacked the double teams with strong moves to
the basket. The Spurs' aggression put the undersized Knicks in foul
trouble for most of the first half. Johnson and Camby each had
three fouls midway through second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim and I talked about it before the game,'' Robinson said.
``We were going to have to take it to the hole and be real
aggressive to get things going. We knew we had to get them low and
get some opportunities down low. The aggression early was
important.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Knicks had was their backcourt. If Houston wasn't able
to push the ball up court and sink a pull-up jumper, Sprewell did.
New York parlayed the fast-paced assault into a 35-31 lead with
4:16 left in the second.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a matter of time, though, before San Antonio flexed
its muscle.
</P>
<P>
   And Duncan took advantage of the Knicks inside shuffle the most.
</P>
<P>
   He scored eight of his 19 first-half point during a 14-2 run
that put the Spurs ahead 45-37 just before halftime. From there,
the Spurs never let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people see that laid-back demeanor and they don't
think he's that kind of competitor,'' Robinson said. ``We went at
it from Day One. ... I know he's going to bring it every night.
When he's got a great matchup, he's going to go to work.''

 CHRONICLE PUBLISHING OFFICIALLY ON THE BLOCK  &HT;     By DAN FOST AND PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The board of Chronicle Publishing Co. voted 9 to 0 Wednesday to
formally put the company up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came almost six weeks after the San Francisco company,
which owns The Chronicle, KRON-TV and other media properties, hired
New York investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette to ``review
and evaluate the company's financial, business and strategic
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   A source who was at the meeting said the privately held company
could fetch more than $2 billion if it were sold in pieces. John
Morton, a newspaper industry analyst based in Silver Spring, Md.,
said that figure sounded like a good estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding is expected to take most of the summer, executives said,
and it probably will be late this year or early next year before
any sales are completed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the company has not formally solicited offers, DLJ
reported that several media companies already have expressed
interest in buying various parts of Chronicle Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett Co. of Arlington, Va.; Hollinger Inc. of Toronto;
Journal Register Co. of Trenton, N.J.; Knight Ridder Inc. of San
Jose; and Times Mirror Co. of Los Angeles reportedly have expressed
interest in buying the company's three newspapers. In addition to
San Francisco daily, Chronicle Publishing owns the Worcester
Telegram &AMP; Gazette in Massachusetts and the Bloomington Pantagraph
in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Co., which bought the Boston Globe in 1993
for $1 billion, reportedly is interested in the Worcester paper.
Copley Newspapers expressed interest in the Bloomington paper.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder Chairman and CEO Tony Ridder confirmed Wednesday
that his company, which publishes the San Jose Mercury News and the
Contra Costa Times, would be interested in buying all the
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're strong in the South Bay and East Bay but don't have much
circulation in San Mateo, San Francisco or Marin,'' he said,
``Those areas and Alameda are served by The Chronicle, and they're
great markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton said Knight Ridder might face antitrust hurdles if it
tried to buy The Chronicle. ``I don't think the Justice Department
would ever let that one go by,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ridder said that after consulting lawyers, he disagrees. He
also said Knight Ridder would be interested in The Chronicle
despite its joint operating agreement with the San Francisco
Examiner, which is owned by New York's Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of CHRON17 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Under the JOA, which continues into 2005, The Chronicle and
Examiner maintain separate news operations but jointly operate all
production, advertising, circulation and other noneditorial
activities. The two owners share revenues and expenses 50-50, even
though The Chronicle's circulation is more than four times the
Examiner's.
</P>
<P>
   A source at the McClatchy Co., which publishes the Sacramento
Bee, said the JOA discouraged that company from pursuing a bid for
The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, Fox Television, USA Network and Young Broadcasting Inc.
have expressed preliminary interest in buying KRON, the NBC
affiliate in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks Muse has expressed interest in buying all the company's TV
properties, which also include San Francisco cable station BayTV;
ABC affiliate KAKE in Wichita, Kan.; and NBC affiliate WOWT in
Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Television stations are selling for increasingly higher prices.
Last year, Hearst-Argyle Corp., Hearst's television arm, set a
record with the $520 million purchase of KCRA and two smaller
properties in Sacramento, the nation's 20th-largest market. The San
Francisco Bay Area is No.5 in market size.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers say the company is not likely to be sold in one
piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine a single buyer interested in all
properties,'' said Nion McEvoy, a board member, shareholder and
editor in chief of Chronicle Books, one of the company's two
book-publishing divisions. The other is MBI, a Wisconsin publisher
of transportation books.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Also, federal rules prohibit one company from owning a
newspaper and a television station in the same community.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing was exempted from the rule because it went
into effect after the company already owned KRON and The Chronicle.
Industry observers say the Federal Communication Commission
probably would not let a new owner buy both properties.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing, which also operates the SF Gate.com Web
site, employs a total of 3,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Cuthbertson, executive officer of the Northern California
Media Guild, the union that represents about 350 Chronicle
employees, said he wasn't surprised by Wednesday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of CHRON17 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``All of our concerns remain about jobs and our contract,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By next month, qualified prospective buyers who sign
confidentiality agreements will be given a look at each operation's
financial data, according to an informed source.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle is the 11th-largest daily newspaper in the
country, with a circulation of 482,268.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has expressed interest in buying The Chronicle but not
the other properties, according to a source. Under the JOA, Hearst
has the right of first refusal to buy The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both the Examiner and Chronicle said yesterday
that they did not know whether that right would hold up if all of
Chronicle Publishing was sold.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chronicle meeting, DLJ representatives handed board
members dark green folders containing financial analyses and sale
options.
</P>
<P>
   The paper is owned by roughly three dozen descendants of
Chronicle co-founder M.H. de Young.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the 10 board members are shareholders, and the others
are outside directors. One family director was absent yesterday as
the board gathered in the company's wood-paneled conference room
under the gaze of the formal portraits of previous publishers.
</P>
<P>
   One major shareholder and former director, Nan T. McEvoy, had
repeatedly advocated keeping the 134-year-old company in family
hands. But she reportedly has ``accepted the inevitable,''
according to one source.
</P>
<P>
   As she left the meeting, McEvoy said only, ``We'll see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The board decided to sell for several reasons, according to
company spokesman Don Solem. The economy is strong, media companies
are fetching high prices, the Bay Area is growing in importance
thanks to Silicon Valley and its perch on the Pacific Rim, and
Chronicle Publishing has a diverse set of assets that could bring
more money separately than together.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Solem said, many of the shareholders are four or
five generations removed from the founders of the newspaper. None
are involved in active management of any of the operating units,
and only a handful are even employed by the company, a big change
from past generations.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of CHRON17 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``All of those things add up to: The time to sell is now,'' Solem
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of speculation on this, the future of newspapers
in San Francisco is moving to a fairly quick resolution,'' said Tom
Goldstein, dean of the Columbia University School of Journalism in
New York. If Hearst buys The Chronicle, it likely would merge it
with the Examiner or close one of the two papers. ``The trend
toward one-newspaper towns is absolutely unmistakable over the
years. There are so few left as to be almost statistically
negligible.''

CLINTON SAYS MILOSEVIC IS SAFE FROM ARREST INSIDE SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ President Clinton said Thursday that the U.S.-led
western alliance will not raid Yugoslavia to arrest Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on war crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks came as the British-led international military
force in Kosovo (KFOR) continued to find suspected mass graves and
charred bodies apparently linked to the murderous campaign by
Yugoslavia's Serbians to rid Kosovo of ethnic Albanian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Allied troops would arrest Milosevic and other indicted Yugoslav
war criminals only if they come across the suspects in Kosovo or
elsewhere in the world, Clinton told a joint news conference with
French President Jacques Chirac before flying to Cologne, Germany
for the annual summit of the world's seven largest industrialized
democracies and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do not believe that the NATO allies can invade Belgrade
to try to deliver the indictment, if you will,'' he said. ``If he
remains in Serbia, inside the confines of Serbia, presumably he's
beyond the reach of the extradition powers of the other
governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors from the International Criminal Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia (ICTY) charged Milosevic and four of his
lieutenants last month with four counts of crimes against humanity,
including deportation, murder, and persecutions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in history that an international war
crimes tribunal has indicted a head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the decision to indict Milosevic on war crimes
but urged caution in pursuing the next step. ``But sometimes these
things take a good while to bear fruit,'' Clinton said, adding: ``I
think we'll just have to wait and see how that develops.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's concession that Milosevic would remain free inside
Serbia could help nail down a U.S.-Russian compromise on the role
of 10,000 Russian troops expected to serve with the 50,000-member
allied force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials oppose war crimes' prosecutions of Yugoslav
leaders. The communist-controlled Russian parliament has even
suggested putting NATO Secretary General Javiez Solana on trial for
war crimes because of NATO's accidental bombings of civilians
during the allies' 78-day bombing campaign across Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In his Oval Office address to the nation on June 10, Clinton
cited Milosevic's record of launching ethnic wars in Croatia,
Bosnia and now Kosovo. Milosevic orchestrated a campaign in which
40,000 Yugoslav troops torched 500 villages, executed men of all
ages and buried them in mass graves, raped women and forced
children to watch their parents die.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole people was forced to abandon in hours communities
their families had spent generations building,'' Clinton said,
adding: ``For these atrocities, Mr. Milosevic and his top aides
have been indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunal for war
crimes, and crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Serbians to replace their leader. ``As long as he
remains in power, as long as your nation is ruled by an indicted
war criminal, we will provide no support for the reconstruction of
Serbia,'' Clinton declared. ``But we are ready to provide
humanitarian aid, and to help to build a better future for Serbia
too, when its government represents tolerance and freedom, not
repression and terror.''

<P>
   &UR; By DIANA BUTLER BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey, conservative Protestant pastors picked
``Father'' and ``Master'' as images for God over those of
``Mother'' and ``Spouse'' by a wide margin. Indeed, of the
ministers responding not one chose ``Mother'' as appropriate to
understand God.
</P>
<P>
   Although such views might be expected among conservatives, the
preference is also strong with more liberal Christians. Given a
choice in a different poll, Episcopalians said they would rather
have a homosexual minister than address God as Mother.
</P>
<P>
   Why do American Christians hold onto ``Father'' as their image
of choice for God so tenaciously? Why is fatherhood equated to
Godhood?
</P>
<P>
   Since my daughter Emma's birth, I have enjoyed watching my
husband father his little girl. He reads stories, changes diapers,
packs lunches, washes clothes, cleans up messes, feeds, hugs,
bathes, and plays. Since we both work, we share her care equally.
He does a remarkable job. And among our friends, he is not alone in
shared parenting. Most, if not all, have similar arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of these tasks reflect God's tender care and
provision. But none of them is particularly masculine -- or
feminine for that matter. Emma's daily needs are provided by both
parents regardless of gender. When it comes to discipline, which
some may define as ``male,'' we share that as well. For us, and for
many of our friends, the gendered categories of parenthood have all
but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In the Victorian culture that persisted until the 1960s,
fatherhood was viewed as a distant and forbidding role. Father
provided; mother nurtured. Father went to work; mother stayed at
home. Father disciplined; mother comforted. Children trembled when
mother warned, ``Just wait until your father gets home.''
</P>
<P>
   Victorian fatherhood, however outdated, continues to shape
American images for God. God the Father is a rather distant
character: Master, Judge, and King of the universe. He is feared,
revered, and loved out of respect for his power.
</P>
<P>
   To continue to cling to ``Father'' as the dominant image of God
perpetuates these inappropriate stereotypes. Most Christians call
God ``Father'' only out of tradition and do not stop to think about
the implications of this practice.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christians insist that ``Father'' is the biblical name for
God. It is not. In the Hebrew Bible, God's name is YHWH
(transliterated Jehovah). Jewish scripture rarely uses ``Father''
to describe God.
</P>
<P>
   Those who equate God with Father usually point out that Jesus
called God Father -- and who should know better than Jesus what God
is like? In spite of misleading English translations, Jesus did not
refer to God as Father as often as Christians believe. In the
Gospel of Mark, God is called Father only four times. In Luke, 15
times. In Matthew, 49 times. In the Gospel of John, Father occurs
109 times.
</P>
<P>
   This wordcount reveals an interesting fact. The earliest gospel,
Mark, written closest to Jesus's ministry, refers to God as Father
much less frequently than the latest one, John. Calling God
``Father'' was a late first century theological development and not
the regular practice of early Christians. Scholars argue that this
reflects a growing influence of Roman secular ideas of hierarchy
and fatherhood on the church as it moved away from its Jewish
roots.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting on ``Father'' as the sole image for God seems bad on
two counts: first, it perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes of
masculinity and fatherhood; and second, it is not (as many think)
biblical.
</P>
<P>
   What is clearer from the biblical text is that when Jesus
referred to God as Father he was alluding to the relationship
between himself and God -- not a stereotype or a role. The word
Jesus used for father, ``abba,'' connotes intimacy and relation. As
biblical scholar Elizabeth Johnson points out, ``Jesus' Abba is not
a patriarchal figure ... but a God of community and celebration.
Everyone related to the one Abba stands in a relation of mutuality
with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, it is appropriate to think of God as Father.
However, given contemporary cultural ideals, it is equally
appropriate to depict this God as Mother. The emphasis is on
community and relatedness -- not lines of authority and kingship.
</P>
<P>
   On this Father's Day, I'll be thinking of God the Father -- the
One who is always willing to be there, to lend a helping hand, to
roll around on the floor and play. The Father who feeds, clothes,
comforts, disciplines, and brings home half of the bacon, too. God
the Father; God the Mother; God the Parents; God the Baby; and God
in intimate community.

</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey, conservative Protestant pastors picked
``Father'' and ``Master'' as images for God over those of
``Mother'' and ``Spouse'' by a wide margin. Indeed, of the
ministers responding not one chose ``Mother'' as appropriate to
understand God.
</P>
<P>
   Although such views might be expected among conservatives, the
preference is also strong with more liberal Christians. Given a
choice in a different poll, Episcopalians said they would rather
have a homosexual minister than address God as Mother.
</P>
<P>
   Why do American Christians hold onto ``Father'' as their image
of choice for God so tenaciously? Why is fatherhood equated to
Godhood?
</P>
<P>
   Since my daughter Emma's birth, I have enjoyed watching my
husband father his little girl. He reads stories, changes diapers,
packs lunches, washes clothes, cleans up messes, feeds, hugs,
bathes, and plays. Since we both work, we share her care equally.
He does a remarkable job. And among our friends, he is not alone in
shared parenting. Most, if not all, have similar arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of these tasks reflect God's tender care and
provision. But none of them is particularly masculine -- or
feminine for that matter. Emma's daily needs are provided by both
parents regardless of gender. When it comes to discipline, which
some may define as ``male,'' we share that as well. For us, and for
many of our friends, the gendered categories of parenthood have all
but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In the Victorian culture that persisted until the 1960s,
fatherhood was viewed as a distant and forbidding role. Father
provided; mother nurtured. Father went to work; mother stayed at
home. Father disciplined; mother comforted. Children trembled when
mother warned, ``Just wait until your father gets home.''
</P>
<P>
   Victorian fatherhood, however outdated, continues to shape
American images for God. God the Father is a rather distant
character: Master, Judge, and King of the universe. He is feared,
revered, and loved out of respect for his power.
</P>
<P>
   To continue to cling to ``Father'' as the dominant image of God
perpetuates these inappropriate stereotypes. Most Christians call
God ``Father'' only out of tradition and do not stop to think about
the implications of this practice.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christians insist that ``Father'' is the biblical name for
God. It is not. In the Hebrew Bible, God's name is YHWH
(transliterated Jehovah). Jewish scripture rarely uses ``Father''
to describe God.
</P>
<P>
   Those who equate God with Father usually point out that Jesus
called God Father -- and who should know better than Jesus what God
is like? In spite of misleading English translations, Jesus did not
refer to God as Father as often as Christians believe. In the
Gospel of Mark, God is called Father only four times. In Luke, 15
times. In Matthew, 49 times. In the Gospel of John, Father occurs
109 times.
</P>
<P>
   This wordcount reveals an interesting fact. The earliest gospel,
Mark, written closest to Jesus's ministry, refers to God as Father
much less frequently than the latest one, John. Calling God
``Father'' was a late first century theological development and not
the regular practice of early Christians. Scholars argue that this
reflects a growing influence of Roman secular ideas of hierarchy
and fatherhood on the church as it moved away from its Jewish
roots.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting on ``Father'' as the sole image for God seems bad on
two counts: first, it perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes of
masculinity and fatherhood; and second, it is not (as many think)
biblical.
</P>
<P>
   What is clearer from the biblical text is that when Jesus
referred to God as Father he was alluding to the relationship
between himself and God -- not a stereotype or a role. The word
Jesus used for father, ``abba,'' connotes intimacy and relation. As
biblical scholar Elizabeth Johnson points out, ``Jesus' Abba is not
a patriarchal figure ... but a God of community and celebration.
Everyone related to the one Abba stands in a relation of mutuality
with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, it is appropriate to think of God as Father.
However, given contemporary cultural ideals, it is equally
appropriate to depict this God as Mother. The emphasis is on
community and relatedness -- not lines of authority and kingship.
</P>
<P>
   On this Father's Day, I'll be thinking of God the Father -- the
One who is always willing to be there, to lend a helping hand, to
roll around on the floor and play. The Father who feeds, clothes,
comforts, disciplines, and brings home half of the bacon, too. God
the Father; God the Mother; God the Parents; God the Baby; and God
in intimate community.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``We set our sights high. We want to mobilize the entire
country. We want to affect every sector in America that can
increase the number of kids raised by committed fathers,'' said Don
Eberly, Chairman of the National Fatherhood Initiative at its Urban
Summit this week.
 &HT;    The need is an aching one. For 25 million American kids,
Father's Day will hurt, because their dad does not live in their
home. Four of ten of them haven't seen their fathers in at least a
year. Fifty percent have never been in their father's home.
 &HT;    There are two jet engines propelling fatherlessness in America.
One is divorce, ``an oddly neglected topic in a nation that has the
worst record of broken marriages in the entire world,'' as George
Gallup puts it. A million kids a year see their parents divorce,
and half of them will see a second divorce by the time they are 18.
 &HT;    Two-thirds of divorces are filed by women, and fathers are often
devastated by it.
 &HT;    ``Mothers fare better after than divorce than men,'' said Kent
Earnhardt, a divorced attendee at the Summit. ``Suicide rates for
divorced men are five times higher than for married men and the
rate is higher for divorced men than divorced women. We don't hear
about depressed dads who've been left feeling powerless. It leads
to depression. That's how you feel when someone divorces you and
you have no say-so.
 &HT;    ``We lose the emotional support of being around our kids.''
(Earnhardt moved into a small apartment across from the school his
kids attend so that he could see them daily.)
 &HT;    The larger engine driving fatherlessness is out-of-wedlock
births that totaled 1.2 million in 1997, a third of all births, and
69 percent of all black children. This is by far, the tougher issue
and was the focal point of the Summit. There is one bit of good
news. After soaring relentlessly year after year, rising 10-fold
from only 125,000 in 1946, the number of illegitimate births
stopped rising in 1995, and remained level in 1996 and 1997.
 &HT;    Few Summit speakers had any idea about how to reverse the trend
or increase the marriage rate of parents of inner-city kids. One
remarkable exception was Charles Ballard, who fathered a son
out-of-wedlock four decades ago, and went to prison for an assault
where he made a commitment to Christ. That prompted him to adopt
his son after he left prison, though he did not even have a high
school diploma.
 &HT;    But having that son motivated him to get his GED, then to go to
college while pressing pants at a dry cleaners, and even to get a
Master's Degree. At a Cleveland city hospital where he saw many
unwed mothers, he asked them if he could speak with the fathers. He
persuaded hundreds of them to take responsibility for their
children, as he had done.
 &HT;    That was the genesis of what is now the National Institute for
Responsible Fatherhood and Family Revitalization. He told the
Summit, ``We hire married couples to run our program, train them
and put them into high-risk communities where they buy homes. That
is commitment to the community.''
 &HT;    As a result, more than 3,000 men who had abandoned their
children, reconnected with them, motivating most of them, as it did
Ballard, to get more education and better jobs, to support them.
With that experience, Ballard had a few more things to tell the
Summit:
 &HT;    ``God wants men to get married. We must support them, or be
anti-God. I was amazed when a barber said, `I have two daughters.
In three months I've worked full-time, 14 hours a day and give half
my income to my children.'
 &HT;    ``We have to change a man's heart, first. Our families model
love and compassion. We take our married couples and seed the
community with them. We are turning the hearts of the fathers to
their children.'' (Malachi 4:6)
 &HT;    My question to black, inner-city churches is this, ``Why can't
you become a similar constructive force for marriage? Why can't the
married couples of your churches make a case for chastity outside
of marriage, and teach children, men and women the value of
marriage?''
 &HT;    In 1950, only 15 percent of black children were born
out-of-wedlock.
 &HT;    Charles Ballard quoted Deuteronomy to his secular audience:
 &HT;    ``Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your
soul and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you
today are to be upon your hearts. Impress them on your children.
Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the
road, when you lie down and when you get up.''
 &HT;    If African-American churches taught that message, they could
push illegitimacy and divorce rates back down, as they move men and
women to marry.

RACHEL GRIFFITHS: OUT FROM DOWN UNDER AND HEADED FOR THE TOP

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Rachel
Griffiths in ``My Son the Fanatic.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The secret to success for today's Australian actors seems fairly
obvious: Pack a bag, leave home and expect to be away for years.
 &HT;    Cate Blanchette, who starred in ``Elizabeth'' (1998), and
Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce, both of ``L.A. Confidential'' (l997),
took that approach. After the shine wore off of ``Shine'' (l996),
Geoffrey Rush headed for England and ``Shakespeare in Love''
(l998), and he's just finished a horror movie in Hollywood.
 &HT;    And then there's Rachel Griffiths.
 &HT;    ``I haven't been home for I forget how long,'' the Australian
actress admits.
 &HT;    If you can't quite place Griffiths, who was everyone's favorite
``what was she in again?'' nominee at the 1999 Oscars, she first
came to our attention as Toni Collette's feisty best friend in
``Muriel's Wedding'' (l995). She followed that with a small role in
``Jude'' (1996) and then a supporting part in ``My Best Friend's
Wedding'' (1997).
 &HT;    Earlier this year she found herself in the rarefied ranks of
Best Supporting Actress contenders for her role as Hilary du Pre,
older sister of the late British cellist Jacqueline du Pre (Emily
Watson), in ``Hilary and Jackie'' (l998).
 &HT;    For the past few years Griffiths has worked steadily in England,
appearing in films such as the offbeat romantic comedy ``Among
Giants'' (l999), which opened and closed pretty quickly in March.
Her newest film, ``My Son the Fanatic,'' is due to open in America
on June 25.
 &HT;    Even more than ``Hilary and Jackie,'' ``Fanatic'' showcases
Griffiths' ability to completely lose herself in a role. It's her
strength as an actress, even if it's also a weakness when it comes
to winning name recognition and Hollywood stardom.
 &HT;    In ``Fanatic'' she plays a refreshing variation on the classic
hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold. The movie _ original, charming and
funny _ is set in northern England in working-class Bradford, the
kind of drab, industrial town that rarely turns up in movies, even
British ones.
 &HT;    Sporting a very credible north-of-England accent, Griffiths
plays Bettina, a local hooker who befriends and then falls in love
with an older man, am Indian taxi driver named Parvez (the
celebrated Indian actor Om Puri). As if their age and background
differences weren't enough, suddenly Parvez's son becomes a
fanatical, fundamentalist Muslim and institutes a violent campaign
to wipe out vice in Bradford.
 &HT;    ``Bettina is a woman with a lot of pain, but still she has such
positivity and warmth,'' Griffiths says. ``She's similar to many of
the 15 girls I met while doing research for the role. All of them
had a truckload of pain in their faces and in their eyes.
 &HT;    ``At first I saw them as victims who could not have had any
self-esteem to do what they did,'' the actress says. ``But while
many had a history of sexual abuse, surprisingly they did have a
good feeling of self-worth.
 &HT;    ``These were not glamorous call girls getting $1,500 a night
working for Heidi Fleiss in jobs that came with a nice condo, a car
and a college fund,'' she adds. ``These women serviced blue-collar
workers in a region of high unemployment, facing hatred in their
community from men and women.
 &HT;    ``They plied their trade in dangerous areas, never knowing for
sure whether their clients were going to beat them up, rape them or
even kill them. Yet many of them insisted they did have
self-esteem.''
 &HT;    The script, which was based on a short story that appeared in
The New Yorker, caught Griffiths' attention at once.
 &HT;    ``I was touched by it and the way in which it juxtaposes love
and compassion against hatred and intolerance,'' she says. ``It
also shows that the most unlikely people can fall in love and
affect each other's lives in powerful ways.''
 &HT;    Although she has a home in Sydney, Griffiths is heading back to
Britain to polish her Welsh accent for the new comedy ``Pavarotti
in Dad's Room,'' which co-stars Jonathan Pryce.
 &HT;    ``It's a much lighter role,'' she says, ``which I need to help
me lighten up after doing Bettina.''
 &HT;    Griffiths recently returned home to Sydney to star in the play
``Sylvia.'' It was a reunion of sorts, since she had started out on
stage in Sydney and Melbourne before winning international acclaim
for ``Muriel's Wedding.''
 &HT;    ```Muriel' put me on the map,'' she recalls, ``and even though
Americans were saying I looked like Juliette Lewis or Debra Winger,
or I was the next Jamie Lee Curtis, I didn't think I was like any
of them. I thought of myself as the next Anthony Hopkins or Daniel
Day-Lewis.''
 &HT;    She makes no apologies for her penchant for globetrotting, which
she doesn't see as neglecting Australia.
 &HT;    ``It's good to work overseas,'' she says. ``Our industry is very
small, and it makes sense to do only one picture a year in
Australia. Otherwise you get overexposed.''
 &HT;    That's not a problem for her so far in the United States, but
she notes that, after her Oscar nomination, things are changing
fast.
 &HT;    ``Today I'm in a wonderful position,'' she says. ``I no longer
get scripts sent to me with other actresses' fingerprints on them.
 &HT;    ``I don't think I'll ever be a personality movie star, because
I'm not really a personality actor,'' she says. ``I love supporting
roles that have a very strong function, and to me `Hilary and
Jackie' and `My Son the Fanatic' fit that bill. In `Hilary and
Jackie' Emily did all the fireworks and created all the sound, and
I could do the feeling.
 &HT;    ``I did my role like somebody who feels the audience will make
an emotional connection with her,'' she says, ``even though she's
not the blinding light.''

   1. VERDUN IN THE DESERT: THE HORROR OF AFRICA'S
</P>
<P>
   FORGOTTEN WAR Along a stretch of worthless no-man's-land in the
Horn of Africa, a half-million troops from poverty-stricken
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been facing off in a little-noticed war
that may be the most pointless of Africa's many pointless wars.
They are locked in trench warfare, armed with high-tech weapons but
applying tactics more worthy of World War I. The toll has been
horrific - 40,000 lives lost, a third of them in a single three-day
battle - and the war has drained both countries' already barren
treasuries. Yet neither side will back down. Only the United States
and the United Nations appear capable of imposing a solution, and
their attention is focused elsewhere. By Alexander Smoltczyk. From
Der Spiegel. 1,000 words. (English translation available.)

hatreds actually masks a far older and wiser imperial tradition.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bad news does not always travel fast
 &HT;    (For release June 20, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday, my doctor wrote me a prescription for Rezulin, a
drug used to treat type-2 diabetes. I am among an estimated 15
million Americans with the disease. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug
Administration issued a report saying that there is ``further
evidence of serious and sometimes fatal liver injury in patients
treated with Rezulin.''
</P>
<P>
   It recommended that Rezulin no longer be used as a first therapy
for type-2 diabetes, that users need more frequent liver testing
and that the labels for the drugs be redone to reflect these
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The medication has had a troubled existence, so much so that my
doctor, before writing the prescription on Tuesday, chatted about
it with me, acknowledging the possibility of liver problems but
citing statistics that made it seem quite infrequent, considering
the number of people using the drug. (On March 19, the
manufacturers of the drug admitted it has been linked to about 28
deaths and seven liver transplants since its 1977 arrival on the
market.)
</P>
<P>
   Quite professionally, my doctor wanted me to know the dangers
and asked my approval before writing the prescription. I trust my
doctor and gave him the go-ahead. That was a day before the FDA
pronouncement, which included news that doctors were going to mail
letters by the FDA explaining the increased concern about the drug
and the new labeling.
</P>
<P>
   But here's what's got me really upset about the FDA
announcement. My hometown paper _ the Miami Herald _ did not carry
a word about it. Since type-2 diabetes has more impact on older
persons, and the South Florida area is awash in them, it seemed a
pretty important announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Had I not been keeping up on news via America Online, I never
would have known about the Wednesday announcement, would have
filled my prescription and, likely, would have gulped down a pill
by now.
</P>
<P>
   The next newspaper up the road, the Sun-Sentinel of Fort
Lauderdale, carried the news from the FDA as three paragraphs at
the very bottom of a story about a new diabetes monitor _ the
headline being on the monitor, not the warning.
</P>
<P>
   The National Edition of the New York Times carried not a word
about it and USA Today carried one paragraph inside the Lifeline
column_ just below the paragraph that said beheaded snakes still
can bite.
</P>
<P>
   A long-gone friend once noted that there is just enough news in
the world every day to fill up a newspaper. Not so. There is far
more, and we are having to seek alternative sources to keep track
of those many things that govern our quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   And even when you find the material, you are not certain of what
you are reading or seeing. The Associated Press story on Rezulin
carried by America Online made mention that the drug ``can cause
sudden and lethal liver failure, the government decided today.''
Yet the FDA's public announcement, put out on its Web page, made no
reference to ``sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   That caused me to call the FDA. Dr. John Jenkins, the agency's
director of the Office of Drug Evaluation II, said the word
``sudden'' is an interpretation. What the FDA has found, he said,
is that people who test normal one day can start showing symptoms
of liver failure within a week or two. That would be ``sudden.'' He
said it was not typical and that most cases of liver failure as a
result of the drug are gradual.
</P>
<P>
   So, what we have here is an example of when the information
highway is there but not used by many, despite the public's right
to know, and how some of that information eventually comes to us
not only late but a bit skewed.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A WWII victory in Kosovo
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tidying up:
</P>
<P>
   Germany contributed some 500 military personnel and 14 aircraft
to the Kosovo campaign. Its pilots flew 394 missions to suppress
Serb anti-aircraft. They also flew 44 reconnaissance missions, and
remote-controlled German planes flew another 192. Now German armor
has rolled into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The German military had participated in recent years in various
multilateral peacekeeping missions, but this was the first time
German arms were engaged in Europe since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Germany returned to action as a well-established democratic
nation _ its 50th anniversary was May 23 _ in the company of other
democratic nations fighting to end a policy of murderous ethnic
abuse. Imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you win one. Really win one.
</P>
<P>
   _ George W. Bush, on his maiden presidential campaign swing,
dubbed ``Great Expectations,'' is apparently confident the American
electorate doesn't know its Dickens. Otherwise he would fret that
voters might remember that the great expectations of the novel were
secretly funded by a crook. Poll-challenged Al Gore, for his part,
has lauched his ``What? Me worry?'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Great Practical Joker, the gremlin of Washington, D.C.,
has pulled off another nifty prank.
</P>
<P>
   The always holier-than-thou Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., was in
such a righteous huff over President Clinton's executive
appointment of a gay man as ambassador to Luxembourg that Inhofe
asserted senatorial privilege to block all other Clinton
appointees, and never mind the damage to U.S. interests. This is an
especially foolish time, for instance, to leave the U.N.
ambassadorship vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, technicians trying to puzzle out why the computer
system in Inhofe's office was being balky discovered it was
engorged with pornography three of the senator's staff had
downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Larry Flynt no doubt smiles, like the Happy Buddha.
</P>
<P>
   _ While Inhofe was being embarrassed, telepreacher Pat Robertson
was being exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson has always insisted with a straight face _ well, with
that perpetual Howdy Doody grin that on him passes for one _ that
his Christian Coalition is a nonpartisan organization busy about
the Lord's social work here on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Robertson has fooled the Lord is anybody's guess, though
it would seem an obvious mismatch, but he couldn't fool the
Internal Revenue Service. It has denied the tax-exempt status the
Christian Coalition had long sought. Groups that engage in
``substantial'' political activities aren't qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson is regrouping and has resumed direct command of the
coalition. The taxes it will now have to pay probably will be
small, but exposure of the organization as substantially political
lifts its mask of piety and may make some churches reluctant to let
themselves continue being used as religious cover for the partisan
energies of the Republican right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the IRS in your prayers.

PINEHURST NO. 2: SECOND TO NONE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ True golfers need not take the awkward route
of dying to savor golfers' heaven. They need only travel to the
Sandhills Country of Pinehurst, N.C., where 35 gems of golf courses
jewel this area, making it the true golfers' paradise of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And, of all the courses, Pinehurst No. 2 is the jewel of jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Ross's old homestead is on the third hole of Pinehurst
No. 2 and Ross's pilgrims trek to the site. Some of the more
fanatical bow and others linger to swap tales of America's foremost
golf course architect and, when they finally turn their backs on
Ross's home, they can stare out at his creation. A masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Little of American architecture _ of any kind _ moves the soul.
But here in Pinehurst, with sand so strangely afoot 100 miles from
the Atlantic Ocean on ``the course that Ross tinkered with for most
of his (later) life,'' as golf architect Rees Jones put it, the
soul is most definitely moved.
</P>
<P>
   Ross took great pride in this creation, which is on the byroads
of east-central North Carolina. Elizabeth Shapiro, Ross's
Boston-born granddaughter, Wednesday read a letter that Ross had
written in 1935 to Lillian Pippitt, Ross's daughter and Shapiro's
mother, after Ross had replaced the sand greens at Pinehurst with
grass and had made other improvements on No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new course is just grand,'' read Shapiro, from the letter.
``It is, I think, the best job I have ever done, and it will always
be a monument to (Donald Ross).''
</P>
<P>
   It was said to be impossible but even the hard souls of the men
of the US Golf Association also have been moved. For decade after
decade, the signature of virtually all courses the USGA revamped
for the Open has been frightfully narrow fairways as the first name
and ankle-high rough as the final name of the signature.
</P>
<P>
   Out of deference to Ross, though, there is neither at Pinehurst.
Fairways are wide and open and the rough at Pinehurst No. 2 might
cover a worm, but little more. These Open golfers will be tested as
Ross wanted all golfers to be tested, by their approach shots to
canny, subtle, and inscrutable greens. Miss by a foot or 2, and
those approach shots will bounce or roll to purgatory in front of
the greens or hell behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman's words were gushing, and not atypical as the
golfers took their final practice swings Wednesday for the US Open.
``Overall, as I think of all the US Opens I've played in,'' said
Norman, ``this is by far the best. By tenfold. They've maintained
the integrity of Donald Ross. This is the best US Open I've seen
and that's pretty much the word on the driving range and on the
putting green.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross designed hundreds of courses in the United States, and
Massachusetts golfers can debate until the last word rims out of
the 19th hole whether Essex, Salem, Worcester, Oyster Harbors or
Winchester country clubs are among his best creations, as Rhode
Island golfers can debate the merits of Rhode Island Country Club
versus Wannamoisett. But Pinehurst No. 2 was Ross's pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pleasure to play this golf course,'' said Norman.
``This is going to be very, very high up on my list of favorite
golf courses to play. I played very few courses on the PGA Tour
that challenge you in every aspect of your game, from the putting
all the way down to your driver. And Donald Ross has done it
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) is a second-shot golf course,'' said Norman, ``just as
Donald Ross wanted it. There's not a lot of trouble off the tees.
Not a lot of fairway bunkers. But Ross designed it as a second-shot
course. It's a very, very precise second-shot course and that's how
Ross did it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Rees Jones was called in four years ago to refine Pinehurst
No. 2, the fifth time he has refined an Open course for the USGA,
he went out of his way to be true to what Donald Ross cherished in
golf architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said Jones, ``was Ross's ultimate design. He tinkered
with it until the day he died.'' And, most of all, Jones wished to
be true to Ross's concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree it's like what I did at Brookline (Mass., for
the 1988 US Open at The Country Club),'' said Jones. ``Because,
like there, I had old photos to work from and when I rebuilt the
three greens at Brookline, I had a model. Here, the model was out
there for me to find.''
</P>
<P>
   So Jones searched Ross's archives at Pinehurst and located old
photos and plans for the 1962 US Amateur played at Pinehurst No. 2.
``(Ross) lived at the third hole and saw the course every day
(during the winter) and this was his ultimate challenge,'' said
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Golf legend has it _ although golf historians debate the facts _
that the reason Ross was so determined to make Pinehust No. 2 the
ultimate in course design was because he was miffed that Bobby
Jones chose Alistair MacKenzie _ and not Ross _ to design Jones's
ultimate course, Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say,'' said Rees Jones, ``that he was trying to outdo
Augusta National, when really Augusta National was trying to outdo
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ross) actually built No. 2 twice and then he redid it,'' said
Rees Jones, ``to make it the ultimate challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   To an average golfer, Pinehurst may not seem difficult because
the fairways are wide, the greens are large, there is only one
water hazard, and pine straw not hackable rough lines the edges of
the fairways. In that sense, this course is similar to Augusta
National.
</P>
<P>
   But, for a professional golfer, the subtleties are devilish. The
greens may be large, Jones explained, but there actually is only a
small area of the green to which a golfer may hit and expect his
ball to stay on the green. And, if the ball bounds off, trouble
abounds.

 PINEHURST, N.C.: ... trouble abounds.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any golfer who has played Ross courses in New England knows the
absolute truism, said Jones: ``You never want to miss a Donald Ross
green over the green; you want to miss it short.''
</P>
<P>
   Revamping The Country Club for the Open ``will always be my
favorite job because it was my first Open (reconstruction),'' said
Jones, ``and because The Country Club was just a natural piece of
ground where they had left it alone a lot. But here, Ross created
this. Nature created The Cuntry Club.''
</P>
<P>
   But both jobs, said Jones, ``are like working on sacred ground.
So I came back here lots of times to make sure that everything was
done with what I thought Ross would have done. I think Ross would
be very happy. It's as close to way he left it in 1948, when he
died.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gods of golfing are warring with the gods of weather.
Wednesday, the weather gods won for the second day in a row,
dropping gentle rain on Pinehurst No. 2, slowing the greens, the
soft ground saving wayward shots from wandering afar.
</P>
<P>
   If there is controversy to what Jones did to refine Ross's
course, it is that the greens were expected to be very fast and the
grass surrounding the greens very trim. An errant shot was expected
to roll off the greens, confounding the golfers with which club to
use to get back onto the green. ``In Ross's day,'' said Jones,
``golfers were using mid-irons to get to the greens. Now, they're
using short irons'' and Ross's whole concept of the all-important
second shot was being thwarted by better equipment and more talent.
</P>
<P>
   Getting up and down from off the green was expected to be
improbable under Jones's re-design; Wednesday, balls were not even
leaving the green. ``This may be the only course in the world where
every green is crowned,'' said Jones. And every green is raised.
Havoc was supposed to loom.
</P>
<P>
   But Pinehurst played kindler and gentler Wednesday because of
the rain and the unthinkeable for the USGA _ a winning score of
12-under par _ possibly loomed as wet weather is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real hazard here is not the bunkers _ many are not even
close to the green _ but the chipping area,'' said Jones.
``Historically, we knew that's what Ross envisioned (a
lightning-quick and confounding chipping area) and the USGA wanted
to do what Ross envisioned. It'll be interesting to see how the
USGA reacts after the tournament.'' They might not come back if the
scores are too low.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1975 and the Atlanta Athletic Club has the Open been
held in the South and the prospect of unbearable weather has been
one of the reasons. But the cool, damp weather of this week has
furrowed more than a few brows. Rees Jones and the USGA may be
imploring the spirit of Donald Ross to convince the gods of golf
that Pinehurst No. 2, of all courses, should not be reduced to the
status of just another course because the weather gods wanted to
rain on yet another parade.
</P>
<P>
   Especially now that the US Open is paying its first visit to
Pinehurst No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eons and eons ago, long before scares of global warming or
global cooling, this part of North Carolina was under water. But
the earth cooled, the Atlantic Ocean retreated and tons of sand
were left behind here in these gentle hills.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1895, Bostonian James Walker Tufts, flush with money from
soda fountains, visited this ``Sahara of North Carolina,'' replete
with barren and forbidding dunes, and promptly bought 5,000 acres
at $1 an acre. The climate was temperate here and Tufts believed in
the therapuetic values of the longleaf pine tree.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts promptly built a New England-style village, naming it
Pinehurst Village, and North Carolinians thought this Yankee baron
to be a grand fool as he assembled architects, engineers, planners,
and workers to build a resort and grand hotel. Tufts also planted
220,000 pine seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1898, an unhappy dairy farmer complained to Tufts that guests
at the resort were trampling through his fields, chasing a little
white ball with strange-looking clubs. His cows were being
disturbed
</P>
<P>
   Tufts found a New Yorker to lay out a nine-hole course at
Pinehurst, placating the farmers and, in time, brought in a young
Scotsman who had come to Boston a few years earlier to finish the
job and lay out a grand golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Ross would spend the winters of the next 48 years in
Pinehurst, directing his mules and men with spade and shovel to
move dirt, but not move it too far. To build a course, but a course
that was natural in the truest sense of the word, in tune with
nature.
</P>
<P>
   And now, nearly a century later, Tiger Woods came to Pinehurst
and said, ``To me, (Pinehurst No. 2) is the ultimate. I don't know
why. I think it's because it's not artificial.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lee Westwood said this course is unique, not seen in his
Europe nor here in the US. ``We have nothing like this in Europe,''
said Westwood. ``I don't know why people have the provision this is
going to suit the European player. Very rarely do we have to play
shots that we have to play around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus has seen virtually all the best courses in the
world and he came to Pinehurst and said, ``This golf course right
here is my favorite golf course from a design standpoint. I enjoy
this as much as any golf course I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rees Jones again repeated that all the greens on No. 2 are
crowned ``and you won't see that aywhere else in the United States,
or maybe in the world.'' The golf architect paused, ``You know,
Ross helped build (Pinehurst) No. 1 and he built course No. 3 and
No. 4. So he had other courses to play . . . for mere mortals.''

<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Here are some of the clubs Payne Stewart has
experimented with around the greens at Pinehurst Number 2: 2-iron,
3-iron, 4-iron, 5-iron, pitching wedge, sand wedge, lob wedge,
putter, 7-iron, and 8-iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be great out there,'' he promises. ``It's going
to be special.''
</P>
<P>
   I certainly hope so. The United States Open is usually a very
aggravating affair. It doesn't matter whether it's Oakmont or
Oakland Hills or Congressional or Olympic, it's always the same old
baloney. They take a nice golf course, narrow the fairways to the
width of a hotel corridor, grow the rough higher than Muggsy
Bogues's head and dare the greatest golfers in the world to shoot
par.
</P>
<P>
   I hate it. Stray 2 feet off the fairway and you might as well be
in Canada. That's not golf. That's sado-masochism.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard, sure, but it's phony. The game, in theory, should be
challenging and rigorous. I think we all would agree to that. But
the standard US Open course of late is artificial. Phony. Bogus.
Stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   This is a classic Donald Ross golf course. There is no need for
trickeration, unless you count making a couple of par 5s par 4s, a
move that simply means that additional decision-making will be
necessary. Other than that, this is the basic golf course laid out
by the great man 92 years ago. It is what it is.
</P>
<P>
   When people talk about this course, they use words such as
``creativity'' and ``imagination.'' OK, most of that imagination
will take place around the greens, but isn't that where we all know
big tournaments are customarily won, anyway? One of the things that
makes golf so fascinating is its complexity. Strength and distance
count. Soft touch counts, too. Thinking is another factor, and on
this course a man is forced to do a lot of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Big drivers are going to whale away on this course. ``It's
actually going to bring in the driver more than most (Open
courses),'' observes Colin Montgomerie. ``Because the fairways are
4 or 5 yards wider than normal, people are going to use drivers,
and because of that fact, miss the fairways as much as if they used
2-irons or 3-woods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the normal US Open,'' points out Greg Norman, ``you had to
be very conservative. The driver wasn't in your bag; the driver is
in your bag this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The big hitters will be hitting their 290s and 310s and if that
gets them off, fine. That's when the fun will start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course from tee to green is pretty simple,'' says Tiger
Woods. ``It's around the green where it gets complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The standard Open green is surrounded by thick rough. There is
no mystery. You dig your feet in and you hack away. Either you get
lucky or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 2 there is no rough around the greens. They don't need
any. The greens are elevated and sloped. Things are not what they
seem. What works for one competitor may not work for another. You
will see lob wedges. You will see mid-irons. You will see many a
player putt uphill from long distances. And that's not all.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger is working on his 3-wood as a means to get close to the
pin, and he is not alone. Others think he's a bit daft. ``A 3-wood
or a 5-wood for a shot of 10 yards doesn't really make a lot of
sense to me,'' says Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   It happens to make sense to Greg Norman. ``I grew up using that
3-wood putt shot since I was in my teens and early 20s,'' he says.
``So I know that shot and I've played it before. I'll use it here
if I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   As will Mr. Woods. ``Because my 3-wood has more loft, it enables
me to put the ball on top of the grass faster and running,
especially when I've got grain to deal with,'' he explains. ``And
here you do.''
</P>
<P>
   So there.
</P>
<P>
   There is never going to be one answer for everybody. There will
be an improvisational theater air to the play around the greens.
There will be first-guessing, second-guessing and 10th-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   There was early speculation that because it is not a stereotyped
US Open course it might open the door for someone to become the
first European winner since Tony Jacklin in 1970. ``The runoffs
around the green are similar to Augusta in many ways,'' suggests
Montgomerie, ``and we've won 11 of the last 20 of them, so it might
favor the European player here for the first time in many years.''
</P>
<P>
   That's his opinion, anyway. It sure isn't Englishman Lee
Westwood's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing like this in Europe,'' he maintains. ``I don't
know why someone has the impression it's going to suit the European
player. That's just a proviso in case one of us wins.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter who wins, the star of the 1999 US Open will be a man
who died in 1948. For this course sprang from the fertile brain of
Donald Ross, the Scot who had a hand in fashioning an almost
unfathomable 400 golf courses. ``I grew up on a Donald Ross golf
course,'' says David Duval. ``I think what you see with these golf
courses, they're like ageless. They will always seem to be good
chip-and-putt challenges for any type player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fun for the players to hit different shots,''
concludes Curtis Strange, the last man to win back-to-back Opens
(The Country Club in '88 and Oak Hill in Rochester, N.Y., the
following year). ``It's going to be fun for you to watch, the
viewers to watch on television, because there's going to be a lot
of different shots hit and a lot of imagination used.''
</P>
<P>
   We live in an age of hype and BS and nonsense. We ache for
something authentic. Most of America has become one big theme park.
And now we give you Pinehurst Number 2. This is a real golf course
for a real golfer. May the best thinker win.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bad news does not always travel fast
 &HT;    (Eds: Fixes misleadingly dropped word in 4th graf.)
 &HT;    (For release June 20, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday, my doctor wrote me a prescription for Rezulin, a
drug used to treat type-2 diabetes. I am among an estimated 15
million Americans with the disease. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug
Administration issued a report saying that there is ``further
evidence of serious and sometimes fatal liver injury in patients
treated with Rezulin.''
</P>
<P>
   It recommended that Rezulin no longer be used as a first therapy
for type-2 diabetes, that users need more frequent liver testing
and that the labels for the drugs be redone to reflect these
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The medication has had a troubled existence, so much so that my
doctor, before writing the prescription on Tuesday, chatted about
it with me, acknowledging the possibility of liver problems but
citing statistics that made it seem quite infrequent, considering
the number of people using the drug. (On March 19, the
manufacturers of the drug admitted it has been linked to about 28
deaths and seven liver transplants since its 1977 arrival on the
market.)
</P>
<P>
   Quite professionally, my doctor wanted me to know the dangers
and asked my approval before writing the prescription. I trust my
doctor and gave him the go-ahead. That was a day before the FDA
pronouncement, which included news that doctors were going to be
mailed letters from the FDA explaining the increased concern about
the drug and the new labeling.
</P>
<P>
   But here's what's got me really upset about the FDA
announcement. My hometown paper _ the Miami Herald _ did not carry
a word about it. Since type-2 diabetes has more impact on older
persons, and the South Florida area is awash in them, it seemed a
pretty important announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Had I not been keeping up on news via America Online, I never
would have known about the Wednesday announcement, would have
filled my prescription and, likely, would have gulped down a pill
by now.
</P>
<P>
   The next newspaper up the road, the Sun-Sentinel of Fort
Lauderdale, carried the news from the FDA as three paragraphs at
the very bottom of a story about a new diabetes monitor _ the
headline being on the monitor, not the warning.
</P>
<P>
   The National Edition of the New York Times carried not a word
about it and USA Today carried one paragraph inside the Lifeline
column_ just below the paragraph that said beheaded snakes still
can bite.
</P>
<P>
   A long-gone friend once noted that there is just enough news in
the world every day to fill up a newspaper. Not so. There is far
more, and we are having to seek alternative sources to keep track
of those many things that govern our quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   And even when you find the material, you are not certain of what
you are reading or seeing. The Associated Press story on Rezulin
carried by America Online made mention that the drug ``can cause
sudden and lethal liver failure, the government decided today.''
Yet the FDA's public announcement, put out on its Web page, made no
reference to ``sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   That caused me to call the FDA. Dr. John Jenkins, the agency's
director of the Office of Drug Evaluation II, said the word
``sudden'' is an interpretation. What the FDA has found, he said,
is that people who test normal one day can start showing symptoms
of liver failure within a week or two. That would be ``sudden.'' He
said it was not typical and that most cases of liver failure as a
result of the drug are gradual.
</P>
<P>
   So, what we have here is an example of when the information
highway is there but not used by many, despite the public's right
to know, and how some of that information eventually comes to us
not only late but a bit skewed.

   Japan's wafer-thin 8.3-meter Subaru telescope collected its
first images from space in January. The Gemini North, an 8.1-meter
telescope built by a seven-nation consortium that includes the
United States, is scheduled to begin scanning the heavens any day.
These telescopes are part of the elite new generation of optics
that promises to lead mankind beyond the solar system into
unexplored regions of space. Michael D. Lemonick, a senior science
writer at Time, reports.

   When Mr. Kelly said his legs were killing him, he was right. A
prisoner in New York City jail, Mr. Kelly participated in a deep
knee-bend competition judged by fellow inmates. His winning lift:
1,134 pounds. What he didn't realize was the damage he had done to
his leg muscles _ and consequently his kidneys. Tony Dajer, who is
at work on a book about medical mistakes and the science of
diagnosis, reports.

<P>
   Dec. 29, 1940. The Luftwaffe had roared over London. The dome of
Saint Paul's Cathedral rose ghostly above the smoke and flames.
Below, buried in rubble, hundreds of people were dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any alive in there?!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here. I'm Alice. Please find me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews reached Alice only after nine hours of desperate
digging. To their relief, she seemed intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all right, my girl. You're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My leg. Please. I can't feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City, 1998. A quiet day in the emergency room. William,
my resident, ambled over and said, ``Twenty-five-year-old male with
gross hematuria. He's been peeing red since he woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' I asked. Many hidden pathologies can turn a healthy
young man's urine a shocking red. ``How many red cells in the
urinalysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Five to 10 per field.''
</P>
<P>
   Too few for frank bleeding caused by a kidney stone or a
ruptured kidney cyst. Something besides blood was making our
patient's urine red.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, not much. He's a prisoner. The cops brought him in
not long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   William and I approached the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly, how are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts. Damn. Pardon the language, but it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing original there. Prisoners often feel the urge for a
change of scenery, and a trip to the ER can fit the bill. But then
Kelly gripped his thighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're killing me, Doctor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody hit you? Did you have a bad fall?'' I asked, more
attentive now.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. God help me. I need something for the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to picture an inmate's schedule of daily activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you worked out recently?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a contest _ deep knee bends. Not much else to do in
jail, Doctor. And I won _ 1,134.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-oh. When?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Night before last. Winner got extra dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I understood. I owed that understanding to E.G.L. Bywaters,
the brilliant English doctor who treated Alice after her rescue
from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   At first Alice had seemed fine. Nothing but her left calf had
suffered. But by evening the next day, the leg had turned cold and
blue below the knee. Bywaters called the surgeons in to amputate.
That should have been the end of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But soon afterward Alice's urine turned an ominous brown. Under
the microscope it teemed with casts _ crescents of debris that
congeal when the kidneys' collecting apparatus is dammed or
poisoned. Her kidneys seemed to have shut down.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh day, wrote Bywaters, Alice ``collapsed and died
in three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't feel any pain at all,'' continued the
prisoner. ``We did 'em night before last.''
</P>
<P>
   The resident's face lit up. ``Now I know. Rhabdomyolysis,'' he
announced. The word means ``destruction of skeletal muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had trashed his thigh muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple,'' I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from simple in 1941. In March, Bywaters and his
colleague D. Beall noted in the British Medical Journal the deaths
of three more young people with injuries similar to Alice's. Their
autopsies recorded the kidneys as ``the point of major interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidneys are the first stop in the body's waste elimination
system. Blood carrying waste flows into the kidneys via coils of
porous capillaries.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around the capillaries are cells that act as
gatekeepers. They keep big items like blood cells and large
proteins inside the blood vessels and permit water, smaller
proteins and waste to pass into the kidney tubules, where, with
more distilling, urine forms.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters noted that the victims' tubules were clogged with
``dense, brownish material ... that seemed to be all of the same
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked exactly like what he had seen in Alice's urine before
she died. Alice's kidneys, and those of her fellow victims, had
been choked and poisoned. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   The problem begins with wrecked cells. As every budding
Schwarzenegger knows, muscles require constant remodeling. So each
cell is loaded with a potent package of protein-chewing enzymes.
And the cells must also store oxygen and fuel to be ready at a
moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   When muscle cells are crushed or cut off from their blood supply
(as in Alice's case) or violently stressed (as in Kelly's case),
they leak myoglobin, the oxygen-storing protein of the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   What Bywaters did was trace the steps between muscle injury and
kidney failure. He figured out that the brown substance was
myoglobin. At one-fourth the size of hemoglobin, it was the perfect
size to sneak through the meshwork in the kidney capillaries and
clog the urine-forming draining tubules.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters also figured out why myoglobin was muddy in color.
Myoglobin with a neutral pH stays red and is nontoxic to tubule
cells in the kidneys. But at an acid pH, myoglobin separates into
two daughter molecules, one of which is muddy brown in color and
poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with muscle injury are often dehydrated, which turns
their blood acidic. Meanwhile, myoglobin, released from dying
muscle cells, clogs kidney tubules. The piled-up myoglobin is then
exposed to increasing amounts of acid, which turns it into its
noxious form.
</P>
<P>
   If this poisoning goes on, the kidneys stop working. They no
longer excrete potassium. And potassium buildup can trigger cardiac
arrest, as it did in Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Kelly's condition wasn't that advanced, but he
could get there. His thighs, at least on a cellular level, were
mincemeat. His urine was saturated with myoglobin. Kidney function
was borderline, and it could go south without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly's pipes need flushing, William,'' I said. ``Let's go
with a quick liter of saline.''
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters had recommended a minimum of three liters a day to
flush the kidneys. We now know that up to 20 liters is needed. We
also added a hefty dose of baking soda to Kelly's fluids to
neutralize the acid buildup in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Rhabdomyolysis goes hand in hand with humanity's penchant for
mayhem. Today doctors can treat the condition, but only if we catch
it early. Kelly's brush with killer knee bends was proof of that.

<P>
   Dec. 29, 1940. The Luftwaffe had roared over London. The dome of
Saint Paul's Cathedral rose ghostly above the smoke and flames.
Below, buried in rubble, hundreds of people were dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any alive in there?!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here. I'm Alice. Please find me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews reached Alice only after nine hours of desperate
digging. To their relief, she seemed intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all right, my girl. You're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My leg. Please. I can't feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City, 1998. A quiet day in the emergency room. William,
my resident, ambled over and said, ``Twenty-five-year-old male with
gross hematuria. He's been peeing red since he woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' I asked. Many hidden pathologies can turn a healthy
young man's urine a shocking red. ``How many red cells in the
urinalysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Five to 10 per field.''
</P>
<P>
   Too few for frank bleeding caused by a kidney stone or a
ruptured kidney cyst. Something besides blood was making our
patient's urine red.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, not much. He's a prisoner. The cops brought him in
not long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   William and I approached the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly, how are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts. Damn. Pardon the language, but it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing original there. Prisoners often feel the urge for a
change of scenery, and a trip to the ER can fit the bill. But then
Kelly gripped his thighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're killing me, Doctor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody hit you? Did you have a bad fall?'' I asked, more
attentive now.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. God help me. I need something for the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to picture an inmate's schedule of daily activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you worked out recently?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a contest _ deep knee bends. Not much else to do in
jail, Doctor. And I won _ 1,134.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-oh. When?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Night before last. Winner got extra dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I understood. I owed that understanding to E.G.L. Bywaters,
the brilliant English doctor who treated Alice after her rescue
from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   At first Alice had seemed fine. Nothing but her left calf had
suffered. But by evening the next day, the leg had turned cold and
blue below the knee. Bywaters called the surgeons in to amputate.
That should have been the end of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But soon afterward Alice's urine turned an ominous brown. Under
the microscope it teemed with casts _ crescents of debris that
congeal when the kidneys' collecting apparatus is dammed or
poisoned. Her kidneys seemed to have shut down.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh day, wrote Bywaters, Alice ``collapsed and died
in three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't feel any pain at all,'' continued the
prisoner. ``We did 'em night before last.''
</P>
<P>
   The resident's face lit up. ``Now I know. Rhabdomyolysis,'' he
announced. The word means ``destruction of skeletal muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had trashed his thigh muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple,'' I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from simple in 1941. In March, Bywaters and his
colleague D. Beall noted in the British Medical Journal the deaths
of three more young people with injuries similar to Alice's. Their
autopsies recorded the kidneys as ``the point of major interest.''

   The circle of glass casts a shimmery light like a fine piece of
crystal. It weighs 16 tons and stretches 27 feet from edge to edge.
Yet its understructure, a honeycombed lattice of one-inch-thick
walls, is so precisely wrought that were it dinner-plate size, its
filigree of glass would be wine-goblet thin.
</P>
<P>
   The surface, a sweeping parabola of Euclidean purity, seems
perfectly matched to its function: to peer from a tiny speck in the
universe called Earth into an unimaginably distant past when vast
galaxies were still forming.
</P>
<P>
   In 2002, when it is polished and coated and then paired with a
twin atop Mount Graham, Ariz., this mirror will open a new window
on the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror is the brainchild of astronomer Roger Angel, whose
boyish face masks a competitiveness that drove him to engage in
one-upmanship with rival mirror makers.
</P>
<P>
   Angel's mirror, shaped and polished, incongruously, in the
bowels of the University of Arizona football stadium, is the
largest piece of optical glass ever cast.
</P>
<P>
   But happily for astronomers, this sleek saucer is only one of an
elite new generation of optics that promises to lead them beyond
the solar system into unexplored regions of space.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seven of these 8-meter-plus mirrors, four of them already
set up 13,800 feet above sea level on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are
poised to begin the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Two Keck telescopes, whose jigsaw-style mirrors, assembled from
hexagonal pieces, stretch a massive 10 meters across, have been
operating on Mauna Kea since 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Japan's wafer-thin 8.3-meter Subaru (the Japanese name
for the Pleiades constellation) telescope collected its first
images from space in January.
</P>
<P>
   And in the same neighborhood the Gemini North, an 8.1-meter
telescope built by a seven-nation consortium that includes the
United States, is scheduled to begin scanning the heavens any day.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Hemisphere skies, with a panoply of stars that cannot
be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, are about to be probed by the
first two of four Europe-financed 8-meter instruments, called
collectively the Very Large Telescope. One was scheduled to begin
service atop Cerro Paranal in Chile in April. Chile's Cerro Pachon
will get the Gemini South observatory next year.
</P>
<P>
   This amazing new generation of telescopes will take mankind
closer to the dawn of creation than ever before. Previously, the
oldest light gathered by telescopes emanated from galaxies formed a
few billion years after the Big Bang. Theorizing about what
happened any earlier has been a bit like trying to describe what a
toddler would look like by observing a 25-year-old adult.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers expect the new instruments to show them a more
youthful universe _ ``bits and pieces that came together to form
the first galaxies,'' says Angel, 59, who is head of the University
of Arizona's Steward Mirror Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the big telescopes have an equally intriguing
assignment: to see planets outside our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years astronomers have observed 18 stars whose motions
indicate the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have even worked out planet densities and orbital
paths, but so far none of these planets has actually been seen.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of telescopes could not only put such planets
on the map but, through a spectroscopic analysis of the light they
reflect, determine their composition and _ the ultimate question _
whether they have the potential for harboring life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three or four planets that are far enough from their
stars that they can be resolved by the Large Binocular Telescope,''
Angel says. ``We can actually record the photons from these
planets.''
</P>
<P>
   The new telescopes could begin to unravel a host of other cosmic
mysteries, too. Is the universe flat, round, or saddle-shaped? Why
isn't matter distributed uniformly throughout the universe? And
most puzzling of all, where is the ``missing matter'' thought to
make up 80 percent of the mass of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers, famously insatiable, have been keeping Roger Angel
busy. Steward Mirror Lab has turned out a number of sub-5-meter
mirrors, two 6.5s, and the 8.4 now being polished on the floor of
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, a second 8.4-meter mirror that will join its twin on
Mount Graham, Ariz., in 2002 to form the Large Binocular Telescope
_ a brilliantly powerful instrument whose twin 8.4-meter mirrors,
yoked together, will have the light-gathering capacity of a
12-meter mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Angel is betting that the telescope will be the first to see
planets beyond our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' says Angel, who won a MacArthur Foundation
``genius'' award in 1996, in large part for his achievements in
creating giant mirrors, ``that we're getting the hang of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Angel seems intent on keeping his reputation as top mirror man
intact. Early on, he and his collaborator Neville Woolf decided on
a maximum size of 8 meters for their mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized,'' he says, ``that this was about the biggest
mirror you could transport, given the width of U.S. highways,'' not
to mention the two-lane roads that lead to mountaintop
observatories.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a sort of undeclared space race, their magnum
opus is more than a foot wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agreed that 8 meters was a good size,'' Angel says,
``but the Europeans decided to go us one better and made the VLT
8.2. Then the Japanese said, `Fine. We think we'll go for 8.3.' But
our mirror was the last one to have its design formally set, so I
thought I'd go for 8.4.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers won't mind if the contest continues. Getting near
the Big Bang is going to take a lot of glass.

intact. Early on, he and his collaborator Neville Woolf decided on
a maximum size of 8 meters for their mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized,'' he says, ``that this was about the biggest
mirror you could transport, given the width of U.S. highways,'' not
to mention the two-lane roads that lead to mountaintop
observatories.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a sort of undeclared space race, their magnum
opus is more than a foot wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agreed that 8 meters was a good size,'' Angel says,
``but the Europeans decided to go us one better and made the VLT
8.2. Then the Japanese said, `Fine. We think we'll go for 8.3.' But
our mirror was the last one to have its design formally set, so I
thought I'd go for 8.4.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers won't mind if the contest continues. Getting near
the Big Bang is going to take a lot of glass.

   Dec. 29, 1940. The Luftwaffe had roared over London. The dome of
Saint Paul's Cathedral rose ghostly above the smoke and flames.
Below, buried in rubble, hundreds of people were dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any alive in there?!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here. I'm Alice. Please find me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews reached Alice only after nine hours of desperate
digging. To their relief, she seemed intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all right, my girl. You're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My leg. Please. I can't feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City, 1998. A quiet day in the emergency room. William,
my resident, ambled over and said, ``Twenty-five-year-old male with
gross hematuria. He's been peeing red since he woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' I asked. Many hidden pathologies can turn a healthy
young man's urine a shocking red. ``How many red cells in the
urinalysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Five to 10 per field.''
</P>
<P>
   Too few for frank bleeding caused by a kidney stone or a
ruptured kidney cyst. Something besides blood was making our
patient's urine red.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, not much. He's a prisoner. The cops brought him in
not long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   William and I approached the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly, how are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts. Damn. Pardon the language, but it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing original there. Prisoners often feel the urge for a
change of scenery, and a trip to the ER can fit the bill. But then
Kelly gripped his thighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're killing me, Doctor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody hit you? Did you have a bad fall?'' I asked, more
attentive now.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. God help me. I need something for the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to picture an inmate's schedule of daily activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you worked out recently?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a contest _ deep knee bends. Not much else to do in
jail, Doctor. And I won _ 1,134.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-oh. When?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Night before last. Winner got extra dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I understood. I owed that understanding to E.G.L. Bywaters,
the brilliant English doctor who treated Alice after her rescue
from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   At first Alice had seemed fine. Nothing but her left calf had
suffered. But by evening the next day, the leg had turned cold and
blue below the knee. Bywaters called the surgeons in to amputate.
That should have been the end of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But soon afterward Alice's urine turned an ominous brown. Under
the microscope it teemed with casts _ crescents of debris that
congeal when the kidneys' collecting apparatus is dammed or
poisoned. Her kidneys seemed to have shut down.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh day, wrote Bywaters, Alice ``collapsed and died
in three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't feel any pain at all,'' continued the
prisoner. ``We did 'em night before last.''
</P>
<P>
   The resident's face lit up. ``Now I know. Rhabdomyolysis,'' he
announced. The word means ``destruction of skeletal muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had trashed his thigh muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple,'' I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from simple in 1941. In March, Bywaters and his
colleague D. Beall noted in the British Medical Journal the deaths
of three more young people with injuries similar to Alice's. Their
autopsies recorded the kidneys as ``the point of major interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidneys are the first stop in the body's waste elimination
system. Blood carrying waste flows into the kidneys via coils of
porous capillaries.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around the capillaries are cells that act as
gatekeepers. They keep big items like blood cells and large
proteins inside the blood vessels and permit water, smaller
proteins and waste to pass into the kidney tubules, where, with
more distilling, urine forms.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters noted that the victims' tubules were clogged with
``dense, brownish material ... that seemed to be all of the same
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked exactly like what he had seen in Alice's urine before
she died. Alice's kidneys, and those of her fellow victims, had
been choked and poisoned. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   The problem begins with wrecked cells. As every budding
Schwarzenegger knows, muscles require constant remodeling. So each
cell is loaded with a potent package of protein-chewing enzymes.
And the cells must also store oxygen and fuel to be ready at a
moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   When muscle cells are crushed or cut off from their blood supply
(as in Alice's case) or violently stressed (as in Kelly's case),
they leak myoglobin, the oxygen-storing protein of the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   What Bywaters did was trace the steps between muscle injury and
kidney failure. He figured out that the brown substance was
myoglobin. At one-fourth the size of hemoglobin, it was the perfect
size to sneak through the meshwork in the kidney capillaries and
clog the urine-forming draining tubules.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters also figured out why myoglobin was muddy in color.
Myoglobin with a neutral pH stays red and is nontoxic to tubule
cells in the kidneys. But at an acid pH, myoglobin separates into
two daughter molecules, one of which is muddy brown in color and
poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with muscle injury are often dehydrated, which turns
their blood acidic. Meanwhile, myoglobin, released from dying
muscle cells, clogs kidney tubules. The piled-up myoglobin is then
exposed to increasing amounts of acid, which turns it into its
noxious form.
</P>
<P>
   If this poisoning goes on, the kidneys stop working. They no
longer excrete potassium. And potassium buildup can trigger cardiac
arrest, as it did in Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Kelly's condition wasn't that advanced, but he
could get there. His thighs, at least on a cellular level, were
mincemeat. His urine was saturated with myoglobin. Kidney function
was borderline, and it could go south without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly's pipes need flushing, William,'' I said. ``Let's go
with a quick liter of saline.''
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters had recommended a minimum of three liters a day to
flush the kidneys. We now know that up to 20 liters is needed. We
also added a hefty dose of baking soda to Kelly's fluids to
neutralize the acid buildup in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Rhabdomyolysis goes hand in hand with humanity's penchant for
mayhem. Today doctors can treat the condition, but only if we catch
it early. Kelly's brush with killer knee bends was proof of that.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The circle of glass casts a shimmery light like a fine piece of
crystal. It weighs 16 tons and stretches 27 feet from edge to edge.
Yet its understructure, a honeycombed lattice of one-inch-thick
walls, is so precisely wrought that were it dinner-plate size, its
filigree of glass would be wine-goblet thin.
</P>
<P>
   The surface, a sweeping parabola of Euclidean purity, seems
perfectly matched to its function: to peer from a tiny speck in the
universe called Earth into an unimaginably distant past when vast
galaxies were still forming.
</P>
<P>
   In 2002, when it is polished and coated and then paired with a
twin atop Mount Graham, Ariz., this mirror will open a new window
on the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror is the brainchild of astronomer Roger Angel, whose
boyish face masks a competitiveness that drove him to engage in
one-upmanship with rival mirror makers.
</P>
<P>
   Angel's mirror, shaped and polished, incongruously, in the
bowels of the University of Arizona football stadium, is the
largest piece of optical glass ever cast.
</P>
<P>
   But happily for astronomers, this sleek saucer is only one of an
elite new generation of optics that promises to lead them beyond
the solar system into unexplored regions of space.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seven of these 8-meter-plus mirrors, four of them already
set up 13,800 feet above sea level on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are
poised to begin the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Two Keck telescopes, whose jigsaw-style mirrors, assembled from
hexagonal pieces, stretch a massive 10 meters across, have been
operating on Mauna Kea since 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Japan's wafer-thin 8.3-meter Subaru (the Japanese name
for the Pleiades constellation) telescope collected its first
images from space in January.
</P>
<P>
   And in the same neighborhood the Gemini North, an 8.1-meter
telescope built by a seven-nation consortium that includes the
United States, is scheduled to begin scanning the heavens any day.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Hemisphere skies, with a panoply of stars that cannot
be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, are about to be probed by the
first two of four Europe-financed 8-meter instruments, called
collectively the Very Large Telescope. One was scheduled to begin
service atop Cerro Paranal in Chile in April. Chile's Cerro Pachon
will get the Gemini South observatory next year.
</P>
<P>
   This amazing new generation of telescopes will take mankind
closer to the dawn of creation than ever before. Previously, the
oldest light gathered by telescopes emanated from galaxies formed a
few billion years after the Big Bang. Theorizing about what
happened any earlier has been a bit like trying to describe what a
toddler would look like by observing a 25-year-old adult.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers expect the new instruments to show them a more
youthful universe _ ``bits and pieces that came together to form
the first galaxies,'' says Angel, 59, who is head of the University
of Arizona's Steward Mirror Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the big telescopes have an equally intriguing
assignment: to see planets outside our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years astronomers have observed 18 stars whose motions
indicate the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have even worked out planet densities and orbital
paths, but so far none of these planets has actually been seen.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of telescopes could not only put such planets
on the map but, through a spectroscopic analysis of the light they
reflect, determine their composition and _ the ultimate question _
whether they have the potential for harboring life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three or four planets that are far enough from their
stars that they can be resolved by the Large Binocular Telescope,''
Angel says. ``We can actually record the photons from these
planets.''
</P>
<P>
   The new telescopes could begin to unravel a host of other cosmic
mysteries, too. Is the universe flat, round, or saddle-shaped? Why
isn't matter distributed uniformly throughout the universe? And
most puzzling of all, where is the ``missing matter'' thought to
make up 80 percent of the mass of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers, famously insatiable, have been keeping Roger Angel
busy. Steward Mirror Lab has turned out a number of sub-5-meter
mirrors, two 6.5s, and the 8.4 now being polished on the floor of
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, a second 8.4-meter mirror that will join its twin on
Mount Graham, Ariz., in 2002 to form the Large Binocular Telescope
_ a brilliantly powerful instrument whose twin 8.4-meter mirrors,
yoked together, will have the light-gathering capacity of a
12-meter mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Angel is betting that the telescope will be the first to see
planets beyond our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' says Angel, who won a MacArthur Foundation
``genius'' award in 1996, in large part for his achievements in
creating giant mirrors, ``that we're getting the hang of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Angel seems intent on keeping his reputation as top mirror man
intact. Early on, he and his collaborator Neville Woolf decided on
a maximum size of 8 meters for their mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized,'' he says, ``that this was about the biggest
mirror you could transport, given the width of U.S. highways,'' not
to mention the two-lane roads that lead to mountaintop
observatories.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a sort of undeclared space race, their magnum
opus is more than a foot wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agreed that 8 meters was a good size,'' Angel says,
``but the Europeans decided to go us one better and made the VLT
8.2. Then the Japanese said, `Fine. We think we'll go for 8.3.' But
our mirror was the last one to have its design formally set, so I
thought I'd go for 8.4.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers won't mind if the contest continues. Getting near
the Big Bang is going to take a lot of glass.

   The circle of glass casts a shimmery light like a fine piece of
crystal. It weighs 16 tons and stretches 27 feet from edge to edge.
Yet its understructure, a honeycombed lattice of one-inch-thick
walls, is so precisely wrought that were it dinner-plate size, its
filigree of glass would be wine-goblet thin.
</P>
<P>
   The surface, a sweeping parabola of Euclidean purity, seems
perfectly matched to its function: to peer from a tiny speck in the
universe called Earth into an unimaginably distant past when vast
galaxies were still forming.
</P>
<P>
   In 2002, when it is polished and coated and then paired with a
twin atop Mount Graham, Ariz., this mirror will open a new window
on the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror is the brainchild of astronomer Roger Angel, whose
boyish face masks a competitiveness that drove him to engage in
one-upmanship with rival mirror makers.
</P>
<P>
   Angel's mirror, shaped and polished, incongruously, in the
bowels of the University of Arizona football stadium, is the
largest piece of optical glass ever cast.
</P>
<P>
   But happily for astronomers, this sleek saucer is only one of an
elite new generation of optics that promises to lead them beyond
the solar system into unexplored regions of space.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seven of these 8-meter-plus mirrors, four of them already
set up 13,800 feet above sea level on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are
poised to begin the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Two Keck telescopes, whose jigsaw-style mirrors, assembled from
hexagonal pieces, stretch a massive 10 meters across, have been
operating on Mauna Kea since 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Japan's wafer-thin 8.3-meter Subaru (the Japanese name
for the Pleiades constellation) telescope collected its first
images from space in January.
</P>
<P>
   And in the same neighborhood the Gemini North, an 8.1-meter
telescope built by a seven-nation consortium that includes the
United States, is scheduled to begin scanning the heavens any day.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Hemisphere skies, with a panoply of stars that cannot
be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, are about to be probed by the
first two of four Europe-financed 8-meter instruments, called
collectively the Very Large Telescope. One was scheduled to begin
service atop Cerro Paranal in Chile in April. Chile's Cerro Pachon
will get the Gemini South observatory next year.
</P>
<P>
   This amazing new generation of telescopes will take mankind
closer to the dawn of creation than ever before. Previously, the
oldest light gathered by telescopes emanated from galaxies formed a
few billion years after the Big Bang. Theorizing about what
happened any earlier has been a bit like trying to describe what a
toddler would look like by observing a 25-year-old adult.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers expect the new instruments to show them a more
youthful universe _ ``bits and pieces that came together to form
the first galaxies,'' says Angel, 59, who is head of the University
of Arizona's Steward Mirror Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the big telescopes have an equally intriguing
assignment: to see planets outside our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years astronomers have observed 18 stars whose motions
indicate the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have even worked out planet densities and orbital
paths, but so far none of these planets has actually been seen.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of telescopes could not only put such planets
on the map but, through a spectroscopic analysis of the light they
reflect, determine their composition and _ the ultimate question _
whether they have the potential for harboring life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three or four planets that are far enough from their
stars that they can be resolved by the Large Binocular Telescope,''
Angel says. ``We can actually record the photons from these
planets.''
</P>
<P>
   The new telescopes could begin to unravel a host of other cosmic
mysteries, too. Is the universe flat, round, or saddle-shaped? Why
isn't matter distributed uniformly throughout the universe? And
most puzzling of all, where is the ``missing matter'' thought to
make up 80 percent of the mass of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers, famously insatiable, have been keeping Roger Angel
busy. Steward Mirror Lab has turned out a number of sub-5-meter
mirrors, two 6.5s, and the 8.4 now being polished on the floor of
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, a second 8.4-meter mirror that will join its twin on
Mount Graham, Ariz., in 2002 to form the Large Binocular Telescope
_ a brilliantly powerful instrument whose twin 8.4-meter mirrors,
yoked together, will have the light-gathering capacity of a
12-meter mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Angel is betting that the telescope will be the first to see
planets beyond our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' says Angel, who won a MacArthur Foundation
``genius'' award in 1996, in large part for his achievements in
creating giant mirrors, ``that we're getting the hang of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Angel seems intent on keeping his reputation as top mirror man
intact. Early on, he and his collaborator Neville Woolf decided on
a maximum size of 8 meters for their mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized,'' he says, ``that this was about the biggest
mirror you could transport, given the width of U.S. highways,'' not
to mention the two-lane roads that lead to mountaintop
observatories.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a sort of undeclared space race, their magnum
opus is more than a foot wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agreed that 8 meters was a good size,'' Angel says,
``but the Europeans decided to go us one better and made the VLT
8.2. Then the Japanese said, `Fine. We think we'll go for 8.3.' But
our mirror was the last one to have its design formally set, so I
thought I'd go for 8.4.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers won't mind if the contest continues. Getting near
the Big Bang is going to take a lot of glass.

<P>
   Dec. 29, 1940. The Luftwaffe had roared over London. The dome of
Saint Paul's Cathedral rose ghostly above the smoke and flames.
Below, buried in rubble, hundreds of people were dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any alive in there?!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here. I'm Alice. Please find me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews reached Alice only after nine hours of desperate
digging. To their relief, she seemed intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're all right, my girl. You're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My leg. Please. I can't feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City, 1998. A quiet day in the emergency room. William,
my resident, ambled over and said, ``Twenty-five-year-old male with
gross hematuria. He's been peeing red since he woke up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' I asked. Many hidden pathologies can turn a healthy
young man's urine a shocking red. ``How many red cells in the
urinalysis?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Five to 10 per field.''
</P>
<P>
   Too few for frank bleeding caused by a kidney stone or a
ruptured kidney cyst. Something besides blood was making our
patient's urine red.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's he do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, not much. He's a prisoner. The cops brought him in
not long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   William and I approached the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly, how are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts. Damn. Pardon the language, but it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing original there. Prisoners often feel the urge for a
change of scenery, and a trip to the ER can fit the bill. But then
Kelly gripped his thighs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're killing me, Doctor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anybody hit you? Did you have a bad fall?'' I asked, more
attentive now.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. God help me. I need something for the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to picture an inmate's schedule of daily activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you worked out recently?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a contest _ deep knee bends. Not much else to do in
jail, Doctor. And I won _ 1,134.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-oh. When?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Night before last. Winner got extra dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I understood. I owed that understanding to E.G.L. Bywaters,
the brilliant English doctor who treated Alice after her rescue
from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   At first Alice had seemed fine. Nothing but her left calf had
suffered. But by evening the next day, the leg had turned cold and
blue below the knee. Bywaters called the surgeons in to amputate.
That should have been the end of the case.
</P>
<P>
   But soon afterward Alice's urine turned an ominous brown. Under
the microscope it teemed with casts _ crescents of debris that
congeal when the kidneys' collecting apparatus is dammed or
poisoned. Her kidneys seemed to have shut down.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh day, wrote Bywaters, Alice ``collapsed and died
in three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't feel any pain at all,'' continued the
prisoner. ``We did 'em night before last.''
</P>
<P>
   The resident's face lit up. ``Now I know. Rhabdomyolysis,'' he
announced. The word means ``destruction of skeletal muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had trashed his thigh muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple,'' I agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from simple in 1941. In March, Bywaters and his
colleague D. Beall noted in the British Medical Journal the deaths
of three more young people with injuries similar to Alice's. Their
autopsies recorded the kidneys as ``the point of major interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidneys are the first stop in the body's waste elimination
system. Blood carrying waste flows into the kidneys via coils of
porous capillaries.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around the capillaries are cells that act as
gatekeepers. They keep big items like blood cells and large
proteins inside the blood vessels and permit water, smaller
proteins and waste to pass into the kidney tubules, where, with
more distilling, urine forms.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters noted that the victims' tubules were clogged with
``dense, brownish material ... that seemed to be all of the same
substance.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked exactly like what he had seen in Alice's urine before
she died. Alice's kidneys, and those of her fellow victims, had
been choked and poisoned. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   The problem begins with wrecked cells. As every budding
Schwarzenegger knows, muscles require constant remodeling. So each
cell is loaded with a potent package of protein-chewing enzymes.
And the cells must also store oxygen and fuel to be ready at a
moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   When muscle cells are crushed or cut off from their blood supply
(as in Alice's case) or violently stressed (as in Kelly's case),
they leak myoglobin, the oxygen-storing protein of the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   What Bywaters did was trace the steps between muscle injury and
kidney failure. He figured out that the brown substance was
myoglobin. At one-fourth the size of hemoglobin, it was the perfect
size to sneak through the meshwork in the kidney capillaries and
clog the urine-forming draining tubules.
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters also figured out why myoglobin was muddy in color.
Myoglobin with a neutral pH stays red and is nontoxic to tubule
cells in the kidneys. But at an acid pH, myoglobin separates into
two daughter molecules, one of which is muddy brown in color and
poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with muscle injury are often dehydrated, which turns
their blood acidic. Meanwhile, myoglobin, released from dying
muscle cells, clogs kidney tubules. The piled-up myoglobin is then
exposed to increasing amounts of acid, which turns it into its
noxious form.
</P>
<P>
   If this poisoning goes on, the kidneys stop working. They no
longer excrete potassium. And potassium buildup can trigger cardiac
arrest, as it did in Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Kelly's condition wasn't that advanced, but he
could get there. His thighs, at least on a cellular level, were
mincemeat. His urine was saturated with myoglobin. Kidney function
was borderline, and it could go south without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kelly's pipes need flushing, William,'' I said. ``Let's go
with a quick liter of saline.''
</P>
<P>
   Bywaters had recommended a minimum of three liters a day to
flush the kidneys. We now know that up to 20 liters is needed. We
also added a hefty dose of baking soda to Kelly's fluids to
neutralize the acid buildup in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Rhabdomyolysis goes hand in hand with humanity's penchant for
mayhem. Today doctors can treat the condition, but only if we catch
it early. Kelly's brush with killer knee bends was proof of that.

   The circle of glass casts a shimmery light like a fine piece of
crystal. It weighs 16 tons and stretches 27 feet from edge to edge.
Yet its understructure, a honeycombed lattice of one-inch-thick
walls, is so precisely wrought that were it dinner-plate size, its
filigree of glass would be wine-goblet thin.
</P>
<P>
   The surface, a sweeping parabola of Euclidean purity, seems
perfectly matched to its function: to peer from a tiny speck in the
universe called Earth into an unimaginably distant past when vast
galaxies were still forming.
</P>
<P>
   In 2002, when it is polished and coated and then paired with a
twin atop Mount Graham, Ariz., this mirror will open a new window
on the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The mirror is the brainchild of astronomer Roger Angel, whose
boyish face masks a competitiveness that drove him to engage in
one-upmanship with rival mirror makers.
</P>
<P>
   Angel's mirror, shaped and polished, incongruously, in the
bowels of the University of Arizona football stadium, is the
largest piece of optical glass ever cast.
</P>
<P>
   But happily for astronomers, this sleek saucer is only one of an
elite new generation of optics that promises to lead them beyond
the solar system into unexplored regions of space.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seven of these 8-meter-plus mirrors, four of them already
set up 13,800 feet above sea level on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are
poised to begin the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Two Keck telescopes, whose jigsaw-style mirrors, assembled from
hexagonal pieces, stretch a massive 10 meters across, have been
operating on Mauna Kea since 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Japan's wafer-thin 8.3-meter Subaru (the Japanese name
for the Pleiades constellation) telescope collected its first
images from space in January.
</P>
<P>
   And in the same neighborhood the Gemini North, an 8.1-meter
telescope built by a seven-nation consortium that includes the
United States, is scheduled to begin scanning the heavens any day.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Hemisphere skies, with a panoply of stars that cannot
be seen from the Northern Hemisphere, are about to be probed by the
first two of four Europe-financed 8-meter instruments, called
collectively the Very Large Telescope. One was scheduled to begin
service atop Cerro Paranal in Chile in April. Chile's Cerro Pachon
will get the Gemini South observatory next year.
</P>
<P>
   This amazing new generation of telescopes will take mankind
closer to the dawn of creation than ever before. Previously, the
oldest light gathered by telescopes emanated from galaxies formed a
few billion years after the Big Bang. Theorizing about what
happened any earlier has been a bit like trying to describe what a
toddler would look like by observing a 25-year-old adult.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers expect the new instruments to show them a more
youthful universe _ ``bits and pieces that came together to form
the first galaxies,'' says Angel, 59, who is head of the University
of Arizona's Steward Mirror Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the big telescopes have an equally intriguing
assignment: to see planets outside our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years astronomers have observed 18 stars whose motions
indicate the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have even worked out planet densities and orbital
paths, but so far none of these planets has actually been seen.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of telescopes could not only put such planets
on the map but, through a spectroscopic analysis of the light they
reflect, determine their composition and _ the ultimate question _
whether they have the potential for harboring life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three or four planets that are far enough from their
stars that they can be resolved by the Large Binocular Telescope,''
Angel says. ``We can actually record the photons from these
planets.''
</P>
<P>
   The new telescopes could begin to unravel a host of other cosmic
mysteries, too. Is the universe flat, round, or saddle-shaped? Why
isn't matter distributed uniformly throughout the universe? And
most puzzling of all, where is the ``missing matter'' thought to
make up 80 percent of the mass of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers, famously insatiable, have been keeping Roger Angel
busy. Steward Mirror Lab has turned out a number of sub-5-meter
mirrors, two 6.5s, and the 8.4 now being polished on the floor of
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, a second 8.4-meter mirror that will join its twin on
Mount Graham, Ariz., in 2002 to form the Large Binocular Telescope
_ a brilliantly powerful instrument whose twin 8.4-meter mirrors,
yoked together, will have the light-gathering capacity of a
12-meter mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Angel is betting that the telescope will be the first to see
planets beyond our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' says Angel, who won a MacArthur Foundation
``genius'' award in 1996, in large part for his achievements in
creating giant mirrors, ``that we're getting the hang of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Angel seems intent on keeping his reputation as top mirror man
intact. Early on, he and his collaborator Neville Woolf decided on
a maximum size of 8 meters for their mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized,'' he says, ``that this was about the biggest
mirror you could transport, given the width of U.S. highways,'' not
to mention the two-lane roads that lead to mountaintop
observatories.
</P>
<P>
   But because of a sort of undeclared space race, their magnum
opus is more than a foot wider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agreed that 8 meters was a good size,'' Angel says,
``but the Europeans decided to go us one better and made the VLT
8.2. Then the Japanese said, `Fine. We think we'll go for 8.3.' But
our mirror was the last one to have its design formally set, so I
thought I'd go for 8.4.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers won't mind if the contest continues. Getting near
the Big Bang is going to take a lot of glass.

 &HT;    Phorid fly and fire ants
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _Watch out, imported fire ants: Your historic
antagonists from the old country are settling in in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gnat-sized flies, imported from Brazil, bred in Austin, and
released in February near Laredo, seem to be thriving. Despite heat
and drought, they are reproducing on their own and attacking
imported fire ants every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely optimistic and on course,'' said Larry
Gilbert, chairman of the Zoology Department of the University of
Texas, who is part of a state-supported effort to find biological
controls for the stinging red ants to replace expensive chemicals
that kill even beneficial insects.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert recently found the flies active at 30 percent of ant
mounds around release sites on a private ranch near Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   The ants are known for disrupting many a family picnic and
causing billions of dollars in damages from North Carolina to Texas
since arriving from Brazil on ships early in this century. But the
flies keep them on their best behavior in Brazil, where they are
not pests.
</P>
<P>
   The flies throw fear into an entire mound by attacking only a
few workers, laying eggs in gaps between the ant's armor. When the
eggs hatch, the larvae kill the ant by eating their way out of its
body. Maturing into flies, they start the process all over again.
</P>
<P>
   The flies shouldn't become a problem themselves, since they only
prey on the imported ants in an ancient parasitic relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert's work ``seems to be progressing very well,'' said
Harlan Thorbilson, a Texas Tech entomologist studying a species of
fungi that can infect a whole mound.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientists say it could be a decade before batches of
flies, or other controls, are available for your own back 40.

 &HT;    Mayor flush, as he plunges into big `toilet' issue
 &HT;    By Scott McCabe
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ It nearly killed him last year, but Mayor Tom
Ramiccio vows he'll again make the annual July 4 trek across what
he calls Palm Beach County's biggest toilet: the Intracoastal
Waterway.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, he'll take the seventh annual one-mile
``Plunge Against the Grunge'' in a donated plastic bubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not crazy,'' said Ramiccio, who was hospitalized twice
with a mysterious virus after last year's dip. He lost 30 pounds
and suffered earaches, headaches and 103-degree fevers. ``People
need to know the lagoon is dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles of canals and about 1,500 storm drains dump fertilizers,
grease, cigarette butts, rubber, pesticides and animal excrement
into the lagoon. Anything can be found there: cyanide, gold,
silver, even the polio virus, health officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiccio's ready to return, despite vowing to ban recreational
activities in the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   He's taking BOB, a scooterlike submarine that'll keep his head
dry in a plastic fish-bowl helmet. Whether the mayor submerges
completely or just bobs along, he'll remain dry, said inventor
Andrew Sneath of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiccio said he won't dip his head. Not after last year. Not
after the battery of tests, CAT scans, an MRI and a spinal tap.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, in the ``Dead Zone,'' where the swim takes place,
``It's so polluted you can't see your hand in front of your face,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gargiulo, county director of environmental health and
engineering, said the swim _ initiated by former Mayor Rodney
Romano in 1993 to dramatize the need for a cleanup _ sends the
wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect, it's a horrible idea,'' Gargiulo said.
``It's like eating bad food to discourage others from eating bad
food.''

 &HT;    Pedestrian struck twice in road rage
 &HT;    By A. Scharnhorst
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A driver was so angry at a pedestrian
who cursed her that she turned her car around, ran into the woman
and then made another U-turn to ram the pedestrian head-on,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Boone, 38, of suburban West Palm Beach, suffered two
broken legs and other injuries in the hit-and-run, officials said.
She was in fair condition at Delray Medical Center on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Boone was walking with a friend along the sidewalk when a small
white car drove by heading east, reports show. She began cursing at
the driver and ``ran out into the roadway taunting the car,'' said
sheriff's Det. Tom Becksfort.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives did not know why Boone swore at the driver or what
she said, but a friend told investigators it ``is not uncommon for
her to do something like that,'' Becksfort said.
</P>
<P>
   While her friend yelled at her to get back on the sidewalk, the
car turned around on the same side of the street and struck Boone
in a glancing blow, Becksfort said. The driver did another U-turn
and drove back to strike Boone again.
</P>
<P>
   ``She bounced up on the hood and rolled off'' over the top of
the car, Becksfort said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver was described as a white woman with frizzy blond
hair, accompanied by a Hispanic woman. She may have been driving a
Ford Escort, witnesses told police.

 &HT;    Spanish anchor, cannons pulled from sea
 &HT;    By Joe Brogan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Two barnacle-encrusted cannons and an anchor
from the wrecked Spanish ship San Miguel de Archangel were raised
recently from the sandy bottom of Jupiter Inlet, where they had
lain awaiting restoration.
</P>
<P>
   When the 340-year-old artifacts broke the surface of the inlet's
azure waters with a salty spray and were hoisted onto a barge in
the shadow of Jupiter Lighthouse, it marked the first step in a
two-year process that will refurbish them.
</P>
<P>
   They were donated to the town, which will pay the state Bureau
of Archeological Research, Conservation and Collection in
Tallahassee $5,000 to undo centuries of corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real good example of the town partnering with the state
so the public can see these artifacts in a setting that is very
close to where they came from,'' said Russ Ruskay, town parks and
recreation director.
</P>
<P>
   Once restored, the 1,000-pound items will be displayed outdoors
in the recently-redesigned Lighthouse Park on the inlet's north
side. They will be visible from U.S. 1, Ruskay said. But that could
take two years, state archaeologist Jim Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   An electrolysis process will slowly remove salt and other
contaminants from the metal. Then it will be sandblasted and
painted with a primer coat and an industrial-quality finish coat.
</P>
<P>
   The archaeological bureau has restored more than 100 artifacts
since it was formed in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Leo, a Palm Beach County lifeguard and president of
Jupiter Wreck Inc., donated the artifacts to the town. He found the
remains of the ship while swimming in the ocean off Jupiter Inlet
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The San Miguel de Archangel began its fateful journey in 1659
when the viceroy of Lima, Peru, ordered it to sail to Spain to
impress King Philip IV with the quality of gold and silver coins
minted in the New World.
</P>
<P>
   It sank in a storm off Jupiter Inlet in either December 1659 or
January 1660 and rested in 10 feet of water until Leo's discovery.
</P>
<P>
   He has salvaged more than 10,000 gold and silver coins, gold
bars and various artifacts from the wreck.

 &HT;    Pedestrian struck twice in road rage
 &HT;    By A. Scharnhorst
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A driver was so angry at a pedestrian
who cursed her that she turned her car around, ran into the woman
and then made another U-turn to ram the pedestrian head-on,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Boone, 38, of suburban West Palm Beach, suffered two
broken legs and other injuries in the hit-and-run, officials said.
She was in fair condition at Delray Medical Center on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Boone was walking with a friend along the sidewalk when a small
white car drove by heading east, reports show. She began cursing at
the driver and ``ran out into the roadway taunting the car,'' said
sheriff's Det. Tom Becksfort.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives did not know why Boone swore at the driver or what
she said, but a friend told investigators it ``is not uncommon for
her to do something like that,'' Becksfort said.
</P>
<P>
   While her friend yelled at her to get back on the sidewalk, the
car turned around on the same side of the street and struck Boone
in a glancing blow, Becksfort said. The driver did another U-turn
and drove back to strike Boone again.
</P>
<P>
   ``She bounced up on the hood and rolled off'' over the top of
the car, Becksfort said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver was described as a white woman with frizzy blond
hair, accompanied by a Hispanic woman. She may have been driving a
Ford Escort, witnesses told police.

 &HT;    There's joy in watching a thunderstorm
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ The storm swept through late Wednesday
afternoon, coming from the south, a blue-black wall of clouds
accompanied by thunder slowly arriving, sounding like a parade
rounding the corner. We were trying to finish our round of golf,
but a few flashes of lightning convinced us to head to the
clubhouse and to stop wielding lightning rods made by Big Bertha or
Ping. We barely made it before the skies opened. The round was
over, time for a few beers, chips and salsa.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's dusk and a gentle rain still comes down. My roses and
tomato plants look pleased.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a wet spring, for which we're grateful here behind
the Pine Curtain. Much of Texas is still experiencing the drought
that started early last year and made last summer the most
miserable in recent memory. I made a vow last year, while lugging
around hoses and desperately trying to keep the lawn alive, that I
would never complain about rain again. So far, I've kept my
promise.
</P>
<P>
   I do love a thunderstorm. I'll sit on the back porch at night,
reading a book under the ceiling fan, watching the heat lightning
build in the southeastern sky down by Lake Sam Rayburn, making
silent bets about whether it will turn into wind and rain. And a
good trash-hauler in the early morning is perfect for lounging in
the recliner under a comforter, sipping coffee and listening to the
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Storms out of the south seem to pack more rain and less wind
than storms that start out in the Staked Plains of West Texas and
sweep across into the Piney Woods. I pay attention to those storms
coming from the west. They often bring big winds and occasional
tornadoes. Storms that come up from Houston or Beaumont are laden
with moisture from the Gulf, but not much wind or hail. We've had
our share of both lately.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my two best lightning stories:
</P>
<P>
   _ As a child, growing up in New Hampshire, our tiny house had a
cellar that was too small and nasty to call a basement, with a dirt
floor and a musty smell that conjured up images of boogeymen in my
young mind. It also tended to flood when it rained hard, so we had
a sump pump to get the water out. One afternoon a thunderboomer
hit, and the cellar began taking on water. My mother enlisted me to
help her run the pump. I held the hose out the window while
lightning bolts lit up the sky. Suddenly there was a crackling in
the air, and a white-blue arc of light came through the window,
went around us both and back out the window. In my mind, more than
30 years later, I can still smell the air after the lightning came
through, as if someone had set fire to a milk jug and then snuffed
it out. My mother and I stood there in shock for a moment, finally
realizing neither of us had been struck. That ended our attempt to
pump out the cellar, and I did my level best to never go down there
again.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many years later, I was playing golf by myself on a now-closed
course in San Augustine. A storm came up when I was as far away
from the clubhouse as you could get, maybe a half-mile. I didn't
have much warning before I realized I was in trouble. As I drove
the cart pell-mell toward safety, lightning hit on the course at
least a dozen times, sometimes less than 50 yards away. The wind
was blowing at least 60 mph. I was trying to remember the words to
the Act of Contrition from my Catholic upbringing as I weaved
through trees bent over from the wind. I felt like I was in a
Stephen King novel, the trees looking like monsters as the
lightning illuminated them, gnarled branches reaching malevolently
for me. (I have always suffered from an overactive imagination.)
</P>
<P>
   Later, safely back at the pro shop, I found out lightning had
struck a house near the course, causing a fire.
</P>
<P>
   The finest summer weather I've ever experienced was in
Flagstaff, Ariz., a town about the size of ours, just south of the
Grand Canyon. I spent a week there a decade ago. Each day it would
start clouding up promptly at 3 p.m., and a thunderstorm would pass
through, lasting roughly an hour. You could set your watch by the
storm's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Sauna Land, an afternoon thunderstorm's aftermath is
nearly unbearable, steam rising from the asphalt and the air heavy
enough to bottle. But in Flagstaff, up high and surrounded by the
San Francisco mountains, it feels like the world has been reborn
after a summer storm. There's a cool dry air, a magical light that
makes the world look like an Ansel Adams photograph, and a
freshness that makes you optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   One of these days I'm going to go back to Flagstaff in summer
just so I can revel in an afternoon storm from the safety of a
porch, and then sit under a birch tree when it's done and read a
good book. I can think of few finer ways to spend a day.

 &HT;    Remembering the way we were
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Kids today see reruns of ``The Andy Griffith
Show'' and no doubt think life in Mayberry was no more real than
what the Clampet family experienced in Beverly Hills. But for many
of us who grew up in the '50s and '60s, life did imitate art _ we
just didn't know it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A friend sent me this list of remembrances that kids today just
might not believe ever existed except in a TV sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Being sent to the drugstore to test vacuum tubes for the TV or
radio.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Kool-Aid was the only other drink for kids, other than
milk and sodas.
</P>
<P>
   _ When boys couldn't wear anything but leather shoes to school.
</P>
<P>
   _ When it took five minutes for the TV to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   _ When all your friends got their hair cut at the kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   _ When nearly everyone's mom was at home when the kids got
there.
</P>
<P>
   _ When nobody owned a pure-bred dog.
</P>
<P>
   _ When a dime was a decent allowance, and a quarter a huge
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you'd reach into a muddy gutter for a penny.
</P>
<P>
   _ When girls neither dated nor kissed until late high school, if
then.
</P>
<P>
   _ When your mom wore nylons that came in two pieces.
</P>
<P>
   _ When all your teachers wore either neckties or had their hair
done, everyday.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Bible reading and prayer started every school day.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you got your windshield cleaned, oil checked, and gas
pumped, without asking, for free, every time. And you got trading
stamps to boot!
</P>
<P>
   _ When laundry detergent had free glasses, dishes or towels
hidden inside the box.
</P>
<P>
   _ When any parent could discipline any kid, or use him to carry
groceries, and nobody, not even the kid, thought a thing of it.
</P>
<P>
   _ When it was considered a great privilege to be taken out to
dinner at a real restaurant with your parents.
</P>
<P>
   _ When they threatened to keep kids back a grade if they failed
_ and did!
</P>
<P>
   _ When women were called, ``Mrs. John Smith,'' instead of their
own name.
</P>
<P>
   _ When being sent to the principal's office was nothing compared
to the fate that awaited a misbehaving student at home.
</P>

   Are there more? Let me know what you remember about the ``olden
days'' and I'll print the best ones.

 &HT;    LCRA water deal blew in on the winds of fate
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The $100 million water accord struck between
Austin and the Lower Colorado River Authority was the product of a
lot of hard work and a twist of fate.
</P>
<P>
   In an illustration of how long a shadow one decision can cast,
Mark Rose, general manager of the LCRA, might not have been in the
position to make either the Garwood or the Austin deal if his dream
of becoming mayor of Austin had come true.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was elected to the Austin City Council in 1983. He was
re-elected in 1985, the year Frank Cooksey was elected mayor.
Cooksey soon discovered that his relationship withRose had more
than a few thorns. Their running disagreement over the direction of
the city resulted in Rose mounting a challenge to Cooksey in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Five months after announcing his mayoral candidacy, Rose
withdrew in an announcement that stunned his supporters. He quit to
take a top administrative job with the LCRA. He said at the time
that it was an offer he couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   If Rose ever looked back, he never said so publicly and last
week he probably left a bigger imprint on Austin than he ever would
have had as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Rose and Austin Mayor Kirk Watson signed an agreement that will
guarantee Austin's water supply for the next 50 years at a price
tag of $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, the city locks up water rights _ bought and sold in
Texas like any other commodity on a first-come, first-served basis
_ that could easily have gone elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Given current and projected growth, the deal was a wise one, but
one that will be shot at by those unfamiliar with the Byzantine way
Texas water rights are allocated or by those who see water as a
tool with which to manipulate growth.
</P>
<P>
   Ensuring a water supply to meet the future demand is
fundamental, but it took commitment and vision. Rose had the
foresight to acquire the water rights owned by the Garwood
Irrigation District. Rose bought 133,000 acre feet _ enough water
to cover 133,000 acres under one foot _ for $75 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest such deal in the history of the state. In so
doing, Rose ensured a water supply for the Austin area for the next
50 years. That didn't automatically ensure that Austin would get a
share of it, though.
</P>
<P>
   The LCRA's district stretches from the Hill Country to the coast
and there are plenty of potential customers for that water. Just
because the water flows through Austin doesn't give the city
automatic rights to it.
</P>
<P>
   The city staff had to move _ and fast _ toward acquiring those
rights. With any hesitation, Rose and the LCRA would have been
required to sell to whoever came to them with a deal ``We had a
chance to do something without a crisis,'' Rose said last week.
``Austin feels good; we feel good. This is the way things are
supposed to work.''
</P>
<P>
   For Watson, the deal is also a source of great pride. A
longtime, behind-the-scenes political player, Watson stepped into
the spotlight to run for mayor. The chief opponent in the race was
Ronney Reynolds, a former City Council member whose cherished dream
was to be mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Watson led Reynolds going into a run-off, and Reynolds suddenly
withdrew. Reynolds' supporters were as stunned as Rose's were 10
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   However able a council member Reynolds was, he was always cast
as a villain by environmentalists. Had Reynolds tried to put
together the deal, the muted grumbling you hear about it now would
have been long and loud.
</P>
<P>
   Both Watson and Rose say _ with justification _ the deal is
their proudest moment. To think _ that moment hinged as much on a
twist of their fates as it did all the hard work that went into
putting it together.

 &HT;    Plenty of candidates are aiming for Archer's seat
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Texas congressional districts don't turn over very
much. And Houston's 7th District, where Republican Bill Archer
won't be standing for re-election next year, will be turning over
for the first time since Archer inherited it from George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That's former President Bush _ not his son George, the Texas
governor who wants to be president. The elder Bush, who still lives
in the district, quit the 7th in 1970 to make a run for the U.S.
Senate against liberal Democrat Ralph Yarborough. But he lost to
Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, who upset Yarborough in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Archer is 71 and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
He's quitting partly because he's been around for a long time. But
undoubtedly adding to his decision is that Republicans limited
their committee chairmen to three two-year terms when they took
over Congress in the 1994 elections _ and next year is Archer's
last as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of candidates to replace him. So far, a
state representative, an investor, a journalist-turned-preacher,
the daughter of a former mayor and a lawyer have announced. All are
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That's no surprise, since the 7th District is among the most
Republican in the country. In 1996, GOP presidential nominee Bob
Dole got 67 percent here. The last time a Democrat had the gall to
challenge Archer, in 1988, she got just 21 percent. Archer's idea
to abolish the income tax system and replace it with a national
sales tax is wildly popular here.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. John Culberson (R-Houston) officially announced his
candidacy four days after the legislative session ended. But he's
been waiting for years for the time when Archer might retire and
has been running for months.
</P>
<P>
   Culberson's well-rehearsed platform is built around removing
U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice in particular and the
federal government in general from any control over state school,
prison and other systems.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year veteran of the Texas House says he would continue
the work of the Republican Congress in cutting taxes and government
spending to strengthen job growth and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Culberson notes that he has filed lawsuits and worked with
``Chairman Archer'' to pass laws aimed at vastly reducing federal
control over local affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Culberson, who plans to rely on grass-roots campaigning, says
his chief competitor is Peter Wareing, 47, an investor. He's also
been running for months, and there are lots of bumper stickers on
Suburbans to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Wareing is the son-in-law of Jack Blanton, a popular and
well-known donor to politicians of both political parties. Blanton
was appointed to the University of Texas Board of Regents in 1985
by Democratic Gov. Mark White.
</P>
<P>
   Wareing says he's voted in both parties' primaries and
contributed to conservative Democrats as well as Republicans. He
has already raised more than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to raise whatever it takes to run an effective
campaign,'' Wareing says matter-of-factly _ and is ready to dip
into his own pocket if necessary. Message: He'll have TV ads in
Houston's hugely expensive market; Culberson might not.
</P>
<P>
   Wareing's campaign sounds similar to Culberson's: shrink the
federal government. ``The message of most of the candidates is
going to be pretty similar, since we're all Republicans,'' Wareing
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates likely to get support from hard-core
religious conservatives are Republican National Committeewoman
Cathy McConn, whose father Jim was mayor decades ago, and Wallace
Henley, who quit as the preacher of the Encourager Church to run.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney and GOP political activist Mark Brewer also is running.
</P>
<P>
   That Gov. Bush will be on the Republican primary ballot, and
that there will be churning among candidates seeking Culberson's
state House seat and perhaps another seat, should help make the
turnout larger and mainstream _ blunting the impact of the
religious conservatives.

 &HT;    Texas Democrats' rebuilding effort takes another direct hit
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _The Texas Democratic Party, looking for a return
to its glory days, is also looking for replacements for three top
officials who had been working on that mission.
</P>
<P>
   The party's executive director, finance director and
communications director all quit in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Cook, the former executive director, said he left because
he and Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm operated on different
frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chair and I had some differences in approach to the job,''
he said. ``We sat down and talked about it. I decided it was a good
time to leave.'' Neither he nor Malcolm wanted to talk about those
differences but Cook said Malcolm, a former Republican who was
elected state Democratic chairman last June, was a more
``hands-on'' leader than others had been.
</P>
<P>
   The other resignations were turned in by Finance Director
Shannon Finley and Communications Director Liz Chadderdon. Finley
will move to Reno to serve as finance director for Nevada Attorney
General Frankie Sue Del Papa's 2000 race for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Finley said her departure is for career and family reasons.
Chadderdon, who took a job with a Washington direct-mail firm,
could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm called the staff turnover ``just the normal of what goes
on.'' Cook has a long record of party leadership. In addition to
serving as executive director since December, he had been the
director of the party's effort to help coordinate all of its
candidates' campaigns in 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The turnover comes amid rumblings of dissatisfaction with
Malcolm's performance as head of the party. Democratic sources say
several people are considering challenging Malcolm when her term
ends next June. She said Wednesday she plans to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm said she is aware of the undercurrent of
dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter who is doing anything there are always going to be
detractors. Yes, it is different,'' she said of her leadership
style. ``That's the very reason I was elected.'' Malcolm has
stressed improving communications among Democratic activists and
re-energizing the grassroots.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of elections under Malcolm's leadership did not
go well for the Democratic Party, which for generations was the
dominant party in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of last November's election, Republicans hold every
statewide office. Next year, in addition to the uphill challenge of
trying to carry Texas for a Democratic presidential candidate who
could be running against Gov. George W. Bush, the Democrats face a
monumental challenge in trying to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm said the party's top goal for 2000 is maintaining its
slim edge in the Texas House of Representatives and trying to
regain a Senate majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making a lot of progress and part of what we see as you
move on down the road is that you do make changes as you go toward
a goal,'' she said.

 &HT;    Authors took clear, conservative stance on child sexual abuse
 &HT;    By Romy L. Cawood
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ People are talking about psychology again, and
the talk is hot. This time it's like the telephone game _ the last
messages are really juicy, but then you find out the first one, and
it is so dull that you suspect someone substituted a completely
different message.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Dalfonzo of the Family Research Council denounced a recent
American Psychological Association study on child sexual abuse, as
well as cultural forces that ``are making pedophilia look
attractive to its potential victims.'' Dalfonzo referred to ``a
coalition of family groups, psychologists and members of Congress''
who are equally displeased with the APA study. She added that Dr.
Laura Schlessinger also has things to say about all this _ namely,
that the study is ``junk science.''
</P>
<P>
   I am a psychologist, and where I come from, an accusation of
``junk science'' is like tomatoes and eggs on your car. Here is
what the fuss is about: The APA's Psychological Bulletin (1998,
vol. 124) featured a study entitled ``A Meta-Analytic Examination
of Assumed Properties of Child Sexual Abuse Using College
Samples.'' For those not familiar with the term, a meta-analysis
examines data from a set of studies in order to answer some
research question. This particular study examined the assumptions
that child sexual abuse causes harm in a manner that is
``pervasive,'' ``intense'' and ``an equivalent experience for boys
and girls.'' Their conclusion was that child sexual abuse ``does
not cause intense harm on a pervasive basis regardless of gender in
the college population.''
</P>
<P>
   If readers take the authors' conclusions at face value _ which I
recommend _ they will discover that the authors are clear and
conservative in stating their findings. They don't say pedophilia
is OK. They don't even come close. For example, they do discuss the
usefulness of new terms (''adult-adolescent sex,'' etc.). But they
clearly explain that the idea is to have more precise language
among researchers, so these researchers can produce better science
about child sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   I actually scoured the APA piece for misstatements,
overstatements, anything that could be construed as dramatic enough
to make Dr. Laura's Web page. I came up empty. In contrast, her Web
page offered all sorts of misstatements and drama _ now here was a
critic's smorgasbord. Dr. Laura stated that the article in question
``proposes that psychologists stop using judgmental terms like
'child-abuse,' 'molestation' and 'victims.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her statement ignored the authors' very complete explanation of
the reason for using more specific terms in the scientific
community. It also ignored their discussion of the relationships
among scientific, legal and moral perspectives on child sexual
abuse. It's right in the article, should she care to go back and
look.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura also found reason to muse about a scenario in which
``psychology indeed recognizes consensual pedophilia as harmless.''
How did she get there? Perhaps she did not read the article,
because she is also under the impression that it is an ``overview
of all (emphasis mine) the research studying the harm resulting
from childhood sexual abuse.'' Wow. ``A'' for effort to anyone who
even tries to write that one.
</P>
<P>
   Allow me to say that I am fascinated when people criticize
scientific studies on the basis of their topics or their
conclusions alone. Science is the business of asking questions,
savory or unsavory, and people may not always like what they find.
In any case, if critics want to get into the game, they will have
to do more than shout from the sidelines. It is not enough to skim
read. It is not enough to read excerpts or, worse yet, to force the
subject material into a completely different agenda (although that
will make the critic more scientifically interesting).
</P>
<P>
   Dispute the statistical methodology. Replicate the study and get
different results. That will get you in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Or there is another option. Some may not realize that studies
published in APA journals do not necessarily represent the APA's
official stance. Journal editors are interested in presenting
quality science. If people have concerns about the APA's stance
with regard to pedophiles or child sexual abuse survivors, they
should be more interested in the current Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual, or DSM. This is the book that outlines diagnostic criteria
for psychological disorders. Keep in mind that debate, hashing and
rehashing is everyday stuff to the DSM people, so you'll have to
get your thinking cap on really good before you knock on that door.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are other hot topics from which to choose. I
have one: Investigate how Dr. Laura, in good conscience, can
present herself as ``Dr.'' in an advice-giving profession when her
Ph.D. is in a different field. Now that is scandal material.
</P>
<P>
   Romy L. Cawood, Ph.D. is a counseling psychologist

countryside with all the sundrenched opportunities that go along
with being at the beach. Two fine examples are in the midst of
celebrated, Southeast vacation spots: Henderson Park Inn in Destin,

   TRAVEL-INNS _ Bed and breakkfast inns are often referred to as
country inns because so many are quaint little getaways in the
mountains or countryside, away from the hustle and bustle of big
cities or popular vacation resorts. But some are springing up in
beach towns, providing guests that charming feel of being in the
countryside with all the sundrenched opportunities that go along
with being at the beach. Two fine examples are in the midst of
celebrated, Southeast vacation spots: Henderson Park Inn in Destin,
Fla. on the Forida panhandle, and Elizabeth Pointe Lodge Amelia
Island in Northeast Florida. (Laccetti Meyers, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   Edward is the president of a large corporation, and he worked
hard to reach that position. He speaks as though he has reached a
final destination and often refers to himself as ``a success.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unfortunate that he doesn't realize success is a journey,
not a destination. There can still be many more steps to be taken
in his life. His journey is not over.
</P>
<P>
   Even more unfortunate, Edward doesn't see that successful people
work around him, many of whom contributed to his own success.
</P>
<P>
   How we make a living, while most certainly an important part of
our existence, does not represent the whole of what success truly
is or who we may be. A successful life also involves our personal
relationships, our family experiences, and our spiritual
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is a part of success, but the ability to handle the
disappointments, the illnesses, or whatever problems life brings to
us, and to handle them with dignity and fortitude, is also a part
of success.
</P>
<P>
   Success can unfold as a lifelong journey. We do not come to a
certain destination point marked ``success'' and then sit on it
smugly, without concern for further events. People who live each
day to the fullest, with the excitement and challenges those 24
hours can bring, become successful people. They don't need to have
an important position or make a great deal of money or be famous.
Success may be described as making the journey called life as deep
and profound an experience as possible. It is a giving not a taking
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Each person's life can be infinitely complex. It is said that
``within each of us is the life we have chosen and the lives we
might have led.''
</P>
<P>
   Our thoughts and dreams of what we might have been or might have
done live within us. The little boy may wish one day to be a
fireman. Another day, a policeman. For a few weeks, he may be
certain he's going to be a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   As he matures, he begins to sort through his dreams and starts
to make choices. He moves forward on his journey. And he is a
success because he has learned to choose and meditate and search.
He realizes that he might change his mind, that he might make
mistakes, and that things may not always work out according to his
plans and hopes. But this is all right because he can handle change
and learn from it.
</P>
<P>
   There may be many life possibilities for each one of us. Success
is finding out which of these possibilities may be most meaningful.
Through choices, we select our values, our work, the person we
marry, how we raise our children, the church we attend, and the
food we eat. Some choices can change or direct our future; others
may be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   How we choose and what we do with our choices indicate the road
signs of our journey and, if we follow the right road, success can
be with us through good times and bad. Success is indeed a journey.
It is not a destination, for a destination means the journey is
over.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful expression of acknowledging the help we receive is
this story. It was the late 1800s and an important member of the
British Parliament was hurrying through the rain and fog of the
bleak Scottish countryside to deliver a crucial speech. Still miles
from his destination, his carriage was forced off the road, its
wheels plunging axle deep in mud. Try as they might, the horse and
driver could not move the carriage. So important was his speech
that even the aristocratic Englishman, in his formal attire, gave a
hand. But it was no use. The carriage would not budge.
</P>
<P>
   A young Scottish farm boy happened to be driving a team of
horses past the distraught parliamentarian and volunteered to help
pull the carriage loose. After much effort and considerable
exertion, the carriage was finally pulled free. When the boy
steadfastly refused to take any money for his help or for his
clothes, which were torn and dirty from the ordeal, the Englishman
asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``A doctor, sir. I want to be a doctor,'' was the reply. The
gentleman was so impressed with the boy and so grateful for his
kindness that he said, ``Well, I want to help.'' And surely enough,
he kept his word. Through his generosity, he made it possible for
the young lad to attend the university.
</P>
<P>
   More than fifty years later, Winston Churchill became
dangerously ill with pneumonia while in Morocco. His life was saved
by a new wonder drug called penicillin, which had been discovered a
few years earlier by a Scottish-born physician, Sir Alexander
Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming was the farm boy who helped the member of Parliament on
that dark and rainy night in Scotland half a century before. The
member of Parliament? None other than Winston Churchill's father,
Randolph.

HEARST AGREES TO SELL ITS BOOK GROUP TO MURDOCH'S NEWS CORP. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Hearst Corporation announced Thursday that it has
agreed to sell the Hearst Book Group consisting of William Morrow &AMP;
Co. and Avon Books to the News Corporation Limited, owner of
HarperCollins Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is expected to be completed in July.
</P>
<P>
   William Morrow &AMP; Company and Avon Books together publish 1,000
titles annually and have a combined active inventory of almost
6,000 titles.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News
Corporation, said the acquisition would ``further strengthen our
book publishing business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have orchestrated a significant turnaround at HarperCollins
over the last few years and are well positioned to take the next
step -- to build on this experience and success to create an even
stronger, more vital and profitable publishing company,'' Murdoch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank A. Bennack, Jr., president and chief executive officer of
The Hearst Corporation, said, ``The joining of Morrow and Avon with
HarperCollins will result in an enormously powerful publishing
company with the scale to compete with the largest worldwide
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although our book publishing companies have made significant
progress in recent years, we've known for some time that the Hearst
Book Group had to expand by acquisition, seek a merger partner, or
divest, as we have done here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank everyone at the Hearst Book Group for their commitment
to the company through the years and wish them well in this new
association.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    FOR FEEBLE RUSSIA, THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING IMPORTANT

   MOSCOW _ Winning isn't everything. For Russia these days, with
its economy a shambles and its president ailing and oblivious to
affairs of state, winning isn't even possible.
</P>
<P>
   But being in the game is.
</P>
<P>
   Possessing a prominent role in world affairs has become
all-important for the withered superpower still struggling to
define its role in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing troops to take the Pristina airport last weekend ahead
of NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo was the latest and most audacious
example of an approach, which, by design or default, has given
Russia a conspicuous role in determining the future of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States seldom agree on policy in some of
the most contentious and dangerous parts of the world, from Iraq to
Yugoslavia, from economic reforms in Russia itself to NATO
expansion in Europe. At the United Nations and elsewhere, Moscow's
diplomatic vexing of America and its Western allies seldom
prevails, but it cannot be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The bold move by Russian generals, with an apparent nod from
President Boris Yeltsin, to speed troops into war-torn Kosovo was
viewed as an important achievement in Russia, where nationalists
are suspicious of both NATO's eastward expansion and America's
intentions in a region once under the sway of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   . ``What did Moscow accomplish with this frantic gesture? A
great deal. Western politicians, recently grown accustomed to
presenting Russia with a fait accompli, were reminded that two can
play this game,'' said Maxim Yusin, a political commentator for the
Russian daily Izvestia.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Russians have lived with a fact of life seldom
discussed here but widely comprehended: They lost the Cold War. As
a result, Russians are loath to tolerate what they perceive as the
West dictating the terms of a New World Order.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States and Britain bombed Iraq last December
after U.N. weapons inspectors there were thwarted, Russia reacted
with hard rhetoric. Frustrated by the Kremlin's inability to affect
policy, some Russians took to the streets to protest the action
against a traditional Russian ally.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, launched in March,
took the simmering collective resentment a step further, giving
Russians a reason to vent their anger. The U.S. Embassy in downtown
Moscow remains marred by paint stains and broken windows after it
was pelted by angry mobs at the start of the NATO air war nearly
three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Thursday, Russia's Communist-dominated lower house of
parliament, the Duma, passed a resolution calling on NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana to be tried as an international war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has historic, cultural and Orthodox Christian ties to
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. Since the end of World War
II, Yugoslavia has been an important customer of Russian arms
suppliers and oil and gas exporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian self-esteem plays a larger part in motivating
Moscow's policy than Slavic brotherhood or regional trade.
</P>
<P>
   For the majority of people in the former Soviet Union, life was
austere, but nonetheless filled with self-satisfaction with the
communist empire's military, scientific, cultural and sports
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the new Russia
promised greater prosperity and peace, but ultimately failed to
deliver. Most Russians are poorer than they were 10 years ago; the
country's army is falling apart as is the social net of health and
welfare services.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's economic collapse last August, polls have
consistently shown a sizeable majority of Russians blame America
for Russia's failures, despite ample evidence of Russia's own bad
management, corruption and failure to enact meaningful economic
reforms. Many believe the United States -- despite its economic aid
and advice, or perhaps because of it -- has a policy designed to
humiliate and weaken Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia retains its powerful seat as a permanent member of the
United Nations Security Council. It also has stepped up to the
table as the eighth member of the G-8 - the world's seven largest
industrialized democracies, plus Russia, added last year as a
signal of Moscow's importance.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomacy is slow and, for Russia of late, unsatisfying. Its
military glory was long ago tarnished by humiliating failures in
Afghanistan and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is why the dispatch of 200 troops to Pristina's
airport touched a patriotic chord here. The Russian public
applauded Russia's bold move of troops into Kosovo. The general in
charge of the operation received a promotion and a medal. Russian
newspapers were filled with headlines celebrating Russia's
``lightening strike'' that got the better of the United States and
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The event underscored Russia's desire to be a player on the
world stage, to flex its muscle as in the days of the Soviet Union.
With Yeltsin's clout slipping steadily and no one with the
authority to fill his role, a foreign policy has emerged to defy
the West first, and ask questions later.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic-reform advocates in Russia regarded the Kosovo troop
deployment -- if indeed it was planned by the Kremlin, or merely
the act of unrestrained generals forcing Yeltsin's hand -- as a
policy of denial. They saw it as yet another example of Russia's
continuing inability to shift its world thinking from Cold War
politics to 90's-style global economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irreparable damage has been inflicted to Russia's image,''
said Konstantin Borovoi, a reform-minded member of the Duma.
``Russia's self-isolation is already a fact of life. There will be
a cooling of long-term relations with Russia. That will not be a
cold war but a cooling of relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilly or not, the West cannot afford to neglect Russia, which
has the world's second largest nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, ruled by the ostensibly westward-leaning Yeltsin, is
still awkwardly searching for its identity. Like a bad habit from
bygone days, it embraces brutal dictators like Iraq's Saddam
Hussein and Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic, clinging to them as
tools to be used in the Russian foreign policy to leverage more
influence for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's policy may be irksome, but it is not ideological. If
there is one bright spot, it is Russia's willingness to bend.
</P>
<P>
   The divisiveness over the Kosovo war, and the disorderly peace,
has not significantly influenced other areas of U.S.-Russian
cooperation. On Wednesday, Russian and U.S. officials in Washington
extended for another seven years the program begun in 1991 to
reduce the threat of nuclear, biological, chemical and other
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in the Balkans, Russia defied its combative posture in
favor of pragmatism. Russia ardently opposed the NATO air campaign
against Yugoslavia. In the beginning, there was even speculation
that Moscow would try to re-supply the Serbs with arms. But in the
end, Russia helped broker Milosevic's capitulation. Russia eagerly
wanted to be included in the international peacekeeping mission to
oversee the post-war Kosovo province, then rushed in setting up a
potentially dangerous stand-off between Russian and NATO troops at
the airport in Pristina. In the end, Moscow agreed to quietly
negotiate the terms of its peacekeeping role.
</P>
<P>
   Even Moscow commentators who praised that daring move in Kosovo
see a need to sober up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Moscow has to remain cool and try not to overdo it. It has
to keep this success from going to its head. We should not demand
too much. We should bear in mind our actual capacities, financial
and otherwise,'' said Yusin, the political commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's self-consciousness about its world image was apparent
in a recent domestic debate over a tax bill rejected by the Duma.
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin warned that Russia could become a
``world pariah'' if the parliament failed to pass the tax-revenue
package designed to pave the way for badly needed financial
assistance from the International Monetary Fund -- which itself,
has become a target of Russian animosity.
</P>
<P>
   In short-term diplomacy, Russia is making the best of a weak
hand. But in the long run in world affairs, Russia still must
decide what it wants to be -- participant or pariah?
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, little will change until Yeltsin moves on, and
the government and the parliament end their feuding. His term is
scheduled to conclude next summer when new presidential elections
are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the support and aid in the world will not make a
difference if Russia and her leaders do not get serious about
reform and overcoming the Soviet, communist legacy,'' said David
Kramer of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua _ It's another boiling hot day on Antigua,
where tourists chug Carib beer and frolic on sand as soft and fine
as baby powder.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sleepy Caribbean island that boasts 365 beaches -- or
one for every day of the year -- the perfect lure for sun-starved
American tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Antigua's not as prosaic as it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua, only 9 miles wide and 12 miles long, has become the
latest beachhead in America's war to reshape offshore banking in an
economically troubled region increasingly reliant on this booming
industry.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials charge that recent laws passed here have weakened
controls on money laundering, making Antigua a haven for crooks
with money to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Antiguan officials have agreed to revise some measures, but
argue that most of their laws are first-rate, even when compared to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the crossfire of this war of words is a savvy
businessman from Houston named R. Allen Stanford, owner of the
island's largest offshore bank, Stanford International Bank Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States just doesn't want to see this island
succeed,'' maintained Stanford, who also heads the Houston-based
Stanford Financial Group, in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the offshore industry has become the
lifeblood of many Caribbean islands with scant resources beyond
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials say that lax regulation of the offshore
industry -- so named because its banks and other institutions
conduct no business in the country where they're registered -- has
aided money launderers from criminal organizations across the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua, in particular, has long battled an image as one of the
Caribbean's most corrupt, unpoliced islands.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last year, the twin-island nation of Antigua and
Barbuda, with a population of just under 64,000, was home to as
many as 57 offshore banks, mostly U.S.-owned.
</P>
<P>
   These banks started cropping up a few years ago, when Antigua's
offshore industry was virtually unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   The island made headlines in 1997 when it closed five
Russian-owned banks local officials said were suspected of
laundering hundreds of millions of dollars for the Russian mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year earlier, Antigua had enacted an
anti-money-laundering law, one U.S. officials contend was never
fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April, the U.S. Treasury Department took the drastic
step of publicly warning U.S. banks to keep close tabs on
transactions conducted through banks in Antigua because of their
susceptibility to money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time in history that the department has
targeted a specific country with such a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the Antiguan government has, in effect,
turned away from its partnership with the United States government
in combating money laundering and other financial crimes,'' wrote
James L. Johnson, undersecretary for enforcement in the U.S.
Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory was a surprise blow to Antiguan officials -- and to
others -- who point to a continuing effort here to clean up the
reputation of the offshore industry, an effort Stanford has played
a leading role in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are islands with far worse records on money laundering
than Antigua, so we can't figure out why the United States is
picking on this one country, unless it has something against
Stanford,'' said Charles Intriago, publisher of the newsletter
Money Laundering Alert.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and friendly, with a Texas drawl to match, the 49-year-old
Stanford made his money in the early 1980s building houses in
Houston. One neighborhood there, Stanford Oaks, still bears his
name.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s Stanford set up his first bank in the Caribbean
-- where he had once taught scuba diving -- so that his homebuyers
might have a place to deposit their escrows.
</P>
<P>
   He opened his bank in Antigua in 1985. And today Stanford, who
flies in and out of this island in a private jet, is like this
island's own Henry Potter, the character from ``It's a Wonderful
Life'' -- only a kinder, gentler version -- in that he seems to
have his hands in almost every pie.
</P>
<P>
   Antiguans peruse his daily newspaper, the Antigua Sun, and
conduct business at his domestic bank, the Bank of Antigua.
</P>
<P>
   His offshore bank -- one of the first sights people see upon
exiting the airport -- is an imposing structure that dwarfs the
island's other commercial buildings in terms of its grandness.
</P>
<P>
   He's also spearheading construction of a hospital, a hotel and
office complex, and an indoor basketball stadium near the home of
Prime Minister Lester Bird, a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a johnny-come-lately,'' says Stanford, whose
businesses employs some 500 people here. ``I call myself Texan
first, and an Antiguan second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antigua's been my primary residence for seven continuous
years,'' he adds. ``I'm becoming an Antiguan citizen this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one seems to question Stanford's love of the island --
Lionel Hurst, Antigua's ambassador to the United States, calls him
``as forthright and respectable as they come'' -- the breadth of
his business activities here does raise eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important is that Stanford has helped Antigua
draft legislation to oversee its offshore industry by paying a team
of U.S. consultants to advise Antigua as it prepared amendments to
its anti-money-laundering law.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford said he wants to help Antigua build a respectable
offshore industry along the lines of the Bahamas, which has
tightened controls on money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those amendments -- approved in November -- were viewed
as positive even by U.S. officials, such as the one making it
illegal for offshore banks to accept cash deposits.
</P>
<P>
   But others helped get Antigua, a former British colony, into hot
water.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Treasury officials say the more ``egregious'' amendments
weakened controls on money laundering by inhibiting investigations
and strengthening bank secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
   They were most alarmed, though, that at least three members of a
six-member board created to oversee the offshore industry
represented the very institutions they were supposed to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   One of those three members was Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Errol Cort, once one of Stanford's attorneys,
explained the reasoning behind the board's make-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that in such a small country, with limited experience,
it would be useful to have people on the board who do have a lot of
experience in the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Antigua, which earns $5 million a year from
offshore banks, has since reconstituted the board and Stanford is
no longer on it. The island's annual budget is $155 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did raise eyebrows here when Mr. Stanford was chosen to sit
on the board,'' said Althea Crick, the board's executive director,
adding no further explanation.
</P>
<P>
   She defended Antigua's actions, in general, insisting the island
today has ``zero tolerance'' for money launderers.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiguan government has shut down 14 offshore banks
suspected of shady dealings since November -- it expects to close
perhaps 20 more -- and has drafted new amendments to the
anti-money-laundering law local officials insist will satisfy U.S.
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, privately, U.S. officials continue to express suspicion
over Antigua's efforts, saying the island has a poor track record
when it comes to keeping promises and cooperating with U.S.
investigators in cases of suspected money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   They also express suspicion when it comes to Stanford and his
influence on the Antiguan government even though no one will
pinpoint any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that suspicion may be related to last year's discovery
that alleged front men for the late Mexican drug baron Amado
Carrillo Fuentes had deposited $3 million in accounts at Stanford
International Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanford willingly handed over that money in February to the
Drug Enforcement Administration, a move that marked the first time
a Caribbean offshore bank has voluntarily repatriated drug money to
a U.S. government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Antiguan officials say the United States must have had an
ulterior motive in issuing the April advisory, which they are
pushing to have lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States doesn't want us to do well because then it
would lose its influence over us,'' said Attorney General Cort.
``The U.S. government would like to keep us as beggars, down on our
knees, looking for U.S. aid.''

   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ In a tidy house in this
quiet Mexican city, children scamper in a courtyard while women sew
and bake -- and rehearse the hard-boiled plays they've written
about lives scarred by rape, poverty and child labor.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from Broadway, but the Mayan Women's Strength
theater group is an experiment in drama all its own. The group also
provides childcare and community services for Mayan Indian women
here, and has toured the American Northeast, Texas, California,
Australia and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   FOMMA -- the Spanish acronym for the troupe -- remains a very
modest organization despite some measure of acclaim and its tours
abroad. Its primary goals remain providing bread-and-butter
services to abused and impoverished women and performing its plays
in the Mayan villages that encircle the city of San Cristobal de
las Casas in Mexico's Chiapas state.
</P>
<P>
   The women don't have to look far for inspiration for their
stories.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same area on the Guatemalan border where Zapatista
Indian rebels rose up in 1994, initiating a still unresolved
rebellion against centuries of injustice that Indians here have
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The women of FOMMA, who choose to remain neutral in the
conflict, have their own war to wage, particularly against machismo
and inequality. With their plays, they often hold up a mirror to
their communities to reflect flaws from within.
</P>
<P>
   Founding members Petrona de la Cruz, 32, and Isabel Juarez
Espinosa, 40, were both put to work as children because their
families were so poor. Juarez was nine when her mother left her
with a non-Indian family in San Cristobal, where she was put in
charge of caring for the family's baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family wanted me to study, but they didn't even have
anything to buy a notebook,'' Juarez said. ``I also worked in
another family's home where all I got was leftovers to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Juarez married but her husband was killed in a dispute
over land, a precious commodity here that often leads to bloody
clashes.
</P>
<P>
   De la Cruz left her Mayan village at 12 to become a domestic
servant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wash diapers at dawn and my hands would freeze,''
she remembers bitterly, sitting in FOMMA's small library for
children.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to her village, but had to work so hard at
gathering firewood, fetching water and cooking that she rarely had
time to get to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for women was to learn to run the house,''
De la Cruz said. ``And if I didn't do my chores, I wouldn't get any
food.''
</P>
<P>
   At 17, De la Cruz was raped, an experience that led to her to
write her first play, ``A Desperate Woman,'' about a man who tries
to rape his stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   After the rape, she quit her community because her assailant was
never brought to justice and she found living there intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Both women said they were finally able to fulfill dreams of
learning to read and write when they worked for sympathetic foreign
families in San Cristobal de las Casas who gave them time off to
study.
</P>
<P>
   Through the city's small-knit community of anthropologists and
social workers, the women gradually found their way into writing
and drama classes. Patient coaching brought their stories to the
stage and they learned to make props, costumes and shed their fear
of acting.
</P>
<P>
   They joined a drama troupe dominated by men, but split because
the men refused to perform ``A Desperate Women'' and told Juarez
she couldn't act because she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of conflict being in the group with men,
especially when it came to expressing opinions,'' Juarez said.
</P>
<P>
   FOMMA was born in 1993 and De la Cruz and Juarez sought funding
from the state of Chiapas and from abroad, including from the
Global Fund for Women in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A group called Cultural Survival in Boston, Mass., helped fund
FOMMA's maiden journey to the United States several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy initially balked at giving the women visas
because of fears the Mayan women would violate their visas and look
for work in America, according to Pia Maybury-Lewis of Cultural
Survival.
</P>
<P>
   An anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington
D.C. had to intervene to vouch for de la Cruz, Juarez and others,
Maybury-Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   At FOMMA's headquarters in San Cristobal, De la Cruz and Juarez
host a revolving group of Mayan women who have left villages
because they were abused or expelled due to religious or political
differences.
</P>
<P>
   The women take literacy classes in their Mayan dialects and
Spanish, and learn to sew, bake and to develop other job skills. De
la Cruz and Juarez said they learned from their own experiences
that childcare is a critical service as well, otherwise the women
wouldn't be able to study and work.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone, children too, help write plays and learn to act.
</P>
<P>
   A work called ``The Juanas' Life'' is a warning to women who
become domestic servants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the kind of treatment you might expect, how to look
for jobs,'' De la Cruz said, ``and how to not just keep quiet when
you don't like something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Victims of Deceit'' explores family crises that develop when
Indian men leave villages to find work in the city, leaving their
wives behind.
</P>
<P>
   Other works combine Mayan mythology with feminist messages. When
they perform before audiences in the traditional Indian villages,
the group is often met with mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprises people when they see we can dress up and act like
men,'' said De la Cruz. ``There's still a lot that needs to be
changed for men to realize that women are equal.''

   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua _ It's another boiling hot day on Antigua,
where tourists chug Carib beer and frolic on sand as soft and fine
as baby powder.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sleepy Caribbean island that boasts 365 beaches -- or
one for every day of the year -- the perfect lure for sun-starved
American tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Antigua's not as prosaic as it might seem.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua, only 9 miles wide and 12 miles long, has become the
latest beachhead in America's war to reshape offshore banking in an
economically troubled region increasingly reliant on this booming
industry.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials charge that recent laws passed here have weakened
controls on money laundering, making Antigua a haven for crooks
with money to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Antiguan officials have agreed to revise some measures, but
argue that most of their laws are first-rate, even when compared to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the crossfire of this war of words is a savvy
businessman from Houston named R. Allen Stanford, owner of the
island's largest offshore bank, Stanford International Bank Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States just doesn't want to see this island
succeed,'' maintained Stanford, who also heads the Houston-based
Stanford Financial Group, in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the offshore industry has become the
lifeblood of many Caribbean islands with scant resources beyond
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials say that lax regulation of the offshore
industry -- so named because its banks and other institutions
conduct no business in the country where they're registered -- has
aided money launderers from criminal organizations across the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Antigua, in particular, has long battled an image as one of the
Caribbean's most corrupt, unpoliced islands.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last year, the twin-island nation of Antigua and
Barbuda, with a population of just under 64,000, was home to as
many as 57 offshore banks, mostly U.S.-owned.
</P>
<P>
   These banks started cropping up a few years ago, when Antigua's
offshore industry was virtually unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   The island made headlines in 1997 when it closed five
Russian-owned banks local officials said were suspected of
laundering hundreds of millions of dollars for the Russian mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year earlier, Antigua had enacted an
anti-money-laundering law, one U.S. officials contend was never
fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April, the U.S. Treasury Department took the drastic
step of publicly warning U.S. banks to keep close tabs on
transactions conducted through banks in Antigua because of their
susceptibility to money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time in history that the department has
targeted a specific country with such a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the Antiguan government has, in effect,
turned away from its partnership with the United States government
in combating money laundering and other financial crimes,'' wrote
James L. Johnson, undersecretary for enforcement in the U.S.
Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory was a surprise blow to Antiguan officials -- and to
others -- who point to a continuing effort here to clean up the
reputation of the offshore industry, an effort Stanford has played
a leading role in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are islands with far worse records on money laundering
than Antigua, so we can't figure out why the United States is
picking on this one country, unless it has something against
Stanford,'' said Charles Intriago, publisher of the newsletter
Money Laundering Alert.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and friendly, with a Texas drawl to match, the 49-year-old
Stanford made his money in the early 1980s building houses in
Houston. One neighborhood there, Stanford Oaks, still bears his
name.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s Stanford set up his first bank in the Caribbean
-- where he had once taught scuba diving -- so that his homebuyers
might have a place to deposit their escrows.
</P>
<P>
   He opened his bank in Antigua in 1985. And today Stanford, who
flies in and out of this island in a private jet, is like this
island's own Henry Potter, the character from ``It's a Wonderful
Life'' -- only a kinder, gentler version -- in that he seems to
have his hands in almost every pie.
</P>
<P>
   Antiguans peruse his daily newspaper, the Antigua Sun, and
conduct business at his domestic bank, the Bank of Antigua.
</P>
<P>
   His offshore bank -- one of the first sights people see upon
exiting the airport -- is an imposing structure that dwarfs the
island's other commercial buildings in terms of its grandness.
</P>
<P>
   He's also spearheading construction of a hospital, a hotel and
office complex, and an indoor basketball stadium near the home of
Prime Minister Lester Bird, a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a johnny-come-lately,'' says Stanford, whose
businesses employs some 500 people here. ``I call myself Texan
first, and an Antiguan second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antigua's been my primary residence for seven continuous
years,'' he adds. ``I'm becoming an Antiguan citizen this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one seems to question Stanford's love of the island --
Lionel Hurst, Antigua's ambassador to the United States, calls him
``as forthright and respectable as they come'' -- the breadth of
his business activities here does raise eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important is that Stanford has helped Antigua
draft legislation to oversee its offshore industry by paying a team
of U.S. consultants to advise Antigua as it prepared amendments to
its anti-money-laundering law.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford said he wants to help Antigua build a respectable
offshore industry along the lines of the Bahamas, which has
tightened controls on money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those amendments -- approved in November -- were viewed
as positive even by U.S. officials, such as the one making it
illegal for offshore banks to accept cash deposits.
</P>
<P>
   But others helped get Antigua, a former British colony, into hot
water.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Treasury officials say the more ``egregious'' amendments
weakened controls on money laundering by inhibiting investigations
and strengthening bank secrecy rules.
</P>
<P>
   They were most alarmed, though, that at least three members of a
six-member board created to oversee the offshore industry
represented the very institutions they were supposed to regulate.
</P>
<P>
   One of those three members was Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Errol Cort, once one of Stanford's attorneys,
explained the reasoning behind the board's make-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that in such a small country, with limited experience,
it would be useful to have people on the board who do have a lot of
experience in the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Antigua, which earns $5 million a year from
offshore banks, has since reconstituted the board and Stanford is
no longer on it. The island's annual budget is $155 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did raise eyebrows here when Mr. Stanford was chosen to sit
on the board,'' said Althea Crick, the board's executive director,
adding no further explanation.
</P>
<P>
   She defended Antigua's actions, in general, insisting the island
today has ``zero tolerance'' for money launderers.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiguan government has shut down 14 offshore banks
suspected of shady dealings since November -- it expects to close
perhaps 20 more -- and has drafted new amendments to the
anti-money-laundering law local officials insist will satisfy U.S.
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, privately, U.S. officials continue to express suspicion
over Antigua's efforts, saying the island has a poor track record
when it comes to keeping promises and cooperating with U.S.
investigators in cases of suspected money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   They also express suspicion when it comes to Stanford and his
influence on the Antiguan government even though no one will
pinpoint any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that suspicion may be related to last year's discovery
that alleged front men for the late Mexican drug baron Amado
Carrillo Fuentes had deposited $3 million in accounts at Stanford
International Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanford willingly handed over that money in February to the
Drug Enforcement Administration, a move that marked the first time
a Caribbean offshore bank has voluntarily repatriated drug money to
a U.S. government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Antiguan officials say the United States must have had an
ulterior motive in issuing the April advisory, which they are
pushing to have lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States doesn't want us to do well because then it
would lose its influence over us,'' said Attorney General Cort.
``The U.S. government would like to keep us as beggars, down on our
knees, looking for U.S. aid.''

   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ In a tidy house in this
quiet Mexican city, children scamper in a courtyard while women sew
and bake -- and rehearse the hard-boiled plays they've written
about lives scarred by rape, poverty and child labor.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from Broadway, but the Mayan Women's Strength
theater group is an experiment in drama all its own. The group also
provides childcare and community services for Mayan Indian women
here, and has toured the American Northeast, Texas, California,
Australia and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   FOMMA -- the Spanish acronym for the troupe -- remains a very
modest organization despite some measure of acclaim and its tours
abroad. Its primary goals remain providing bread-and-butter
services to abused and impoverished women and performing its plays
in the Mayan villages that encircle the city of San Cristobal de
las Casas in Mexico's Chiapas state.
</P>
<P>
   The women don't have to look far for inspiration for their
stories.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same area on the Guatemalan border where Zapatista
Indian rebels rose up in 1994, initiating a still unresolved
rebellion against centuries of injustice that Indians here have
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The women of FOMMA, who choose to remain neutral in the
conflict, have their own war to wage, particularly against machismo
and inequality. With their plays, they often hold up a mirror to
their communities to reflect flaws from within.
</P>
<P>
   Founding members Petrona de la Cruz, 32, and Isabel Juarez
Espinosa, 40, were both put to work as children because their
families were so poor. Juarez was nine when her mother left her
with a non-Indian family in San Cristobal, where she was put in
charge of caring for the family's baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family wanted me to study, but they didn't even have
anything to buy a notebook,'' Juarez said. ``I also worked in
another family's home where all I got was leftovers to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Juarez married but her husband was killed in a dispute
over land, a precious commodity here that often leads to bloody
clashes.
</P>
<P>
   De la Cruz left her Mayan village at 12 to become a domestic
servant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wash diapers at dawn and my hands would freeze,''
she remembers bitterly, sitting in FOMMA's small library for
children.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to her village, but had to work so hard at
gathering firewood, fetching water and cooking that she rarely had
time to get to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for women was to learn to run the house,''
De la Cruz said. ``And if I didn't do my chores, I wouldn't get any
food.''
</P>
<P>
   At 17, De la Cruz was raped, an experience that led to her to
write her first play, ``A Desperate Woman,'' about a man who tries
to rape his stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   After the rape, she quit her community because her assailant was
never brought to justice and she found living there intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Both women said they were finally able to fulfill dreams of
learning to read and write when they worked for sympathetic foreign
families in San Cristobal de las Casas who gave them time off to
study.
</P>
<P>
   Through the city's small-knit community of anthropologists and
social workers, the women gradually found their way into writing
and drama classes. Patient coaching brought their stories to the
stage and they learned to make props, costumes and shed their fear
of acting.
</P>
<P>
   They joined a drama troupe dominated by men, but split because
the men refused to perform ``A Desperate Women'' and told Juarez
she couldn't act because she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of conflict being in the group with men,
especially when it came to expressing opinions,'' Juarez said.
</P>
<P>
   FOMMA was born in 1993 and De la Cruz and Juarez sought funding

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Winning isn't everything. For Russia these days, with
its economy a shambles and its president ailing and oblivious to
affairs of state, winning isn't even possible.
</P>
<P>
   But being in the game is.
</P>
<P>
   Possessing a prominent role in world affairs has become
all-important for the withered superpower still struggling to
define its role in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing troops to take the Pristina airport last weekend ahead
of NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo was the latest and most audacious
example of an approach, which, by design or default, has given
Russia a conspicuous role in determining the future of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States seldom agree on policy in some of
the most contentious and dangerous parts of the world, from Iraq to
Yugoslavia, from economic reforms in Russia itself to NATO
expansion in Europe. At the United Nations and elsewhere, Moscow's
diplomatic vexing of America and its Western allies seldom
prevails, but it cannot be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The bold move by Russian generals, with an apparent nod from
President Boris Yeltsin, to speed troops into war-torn Kosovo was
viewed as an important achievement in Russia, where nationalists
are suspicious of both NATO's eastward expansion and America's
intentions in a region once under the sway of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   . ``What did Moscow accomplish with this frantic gesture? A
great deal. Western politicians, recently grown accustomed to
presenting Russia with a fait accompli, were reminded that two can
play this game,'' said Maxim Yusin, a political commentator for the
Russian daily Izvestia.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Russians have lived with a fact of life seldom
discussed here but widely comprehended: They lost the Cold War. As
a result, Russians are loath to tolerate what they perceive as the
West dictating the terms of a New World Order.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States and Britain bombed Iraq last December
after U.N. weapons inspectors there were thwarted, Russia reacted
with hard rhetoric. Frustrated by the Kremlin's inability to affect
policy, some Russians took to the streets to protest the action
against a traditional Russian ally.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, launched in March,
took the simmering collective resentment a step further, giving
Russians a reason to vent their anger. The U.S. Embassy in downtown
Moscow remains marred by paint stains and broken windows after it
was pelted by angry mobs at the start of the NATO air war nearly
three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Thursday, Russia's Communist-dominated lower house of
parliament, the Duma, passed a resolution calling on NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana to be tried as an international war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has historic, cultural and Orthodox Christian ties to
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. Since the end of World War
II, Yugoslavia has been an important customer of Russian arms
suppliers and oil and gas exporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian self-esteem plays a larger part in motivating
Moscow's policy than Slavic brotherhood or regional trade.
</P>
<P>
   For the majority of people in the former Soviet Union, life was
austere, but nonetheless filled with self-satisfaction with the
communist empire's military, scientific, cultural and sports
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the new Russia
promised greater prosperity and peace, but ultimately failed to
deliver. Most Russians are poorer than they were 10 years ago; the
country's army is falling apart as is the social net of health and
welfare services.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's economic collapse last August, polls have
consistently shown a sizeable majority of Russians blame America
for Russia's failures, despite ample evidence of Russia's own bad
management, corruption and failure to enact meaningful economic
reforms. Many believe the United States -- despite its economic aid
and advice, or perhaps because of it -- has a policy designed to
humiliate and weaken Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia retains its powerful seat as a permanent member of the
United Nations Security Council. It also has stepped up to the
table as the eighth member of the G-8 - the world's seven largest
industrialized democracies, plus Russia, added last year as a
signal of Moscow's importance.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomacy is slow and, for Russia of late, unsatisfying. Its
military glory was long ago tarnished by humiliating failures in
Afghanistan and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is why the dispatch of 200 troops to Pristina's
airport touched a patriotic chord here. The Russian public
applauded Russia's bold move of troops into Kosovo. The general in
charge of the operation received a promotion and a medal. Russian
newspapers were filled with headlines celebrating Russia's
``lightening strike'' that got the better of the United States and
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The event underscored Russia's desire to be a player on the
world stage, to flex its muscle as in the days of the Soviet Union.
With Yeltsin's clout slipping steadily and no one with the
authority to fill his role, a foreign policy has emerged to defy
the West first, and ask questions later.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic-reform advocates in Russia regarded the Kosovo troop
deployment -- if indeed it was planned by the Kremlin, or merely
the act of unrestrained generals forcing Yeltsin's hand -- as a
policy of denial. They saw it as yet another example of Russia's
continuing inability to shift its world thinking from Cold War
politics to 90's-style global economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irreparable damage has been inflicted to Russia's image,''
said Konstantin Borovoi, a reform-minded member of the Duma.
``Russia's self-isolation is already a fact of life. There will be
a cooling of long-term relations with Russia. That will not be a
cold war but a cooling of relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilly or not, the West cannot afford to neglect Russia, which
has the world's second largest nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, ruled by the ostensibly westward-leaning Yeltsin, is
still awkwardly searching for its identity. Like a bad habit from
bygone days, it embraces brutal dictators like Iraq's Saddam
Hussein and Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic, clinging to them as
tools to be used in the Russian foreign policy to leverage more
influence for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's policy may be irksome, but it is not ideological. If
there is one bright spot, it is Russia's willingness to bend.
</P>
<P>
   The divisiveness over the Kosovo war, and the disorderly peace,
has not significantly influenced other areas of U.S.-Russian
cooperation. On Wednesday, Russian and U.S. officials in Washington
extended for another seven years the program begun in 1991 to
reduce the threat of nuclear, biological, chemical and other
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in the Balkans, Russia defied its combative posture in
favor of pragmatism. Russia ardently opposed the NATO air campaign
against Yugoslavia. In the beginning, there was even speculation
that Moscow would try to re-supply the Serbs with arms. But in the
end, Russia helped broker Milosevic's capitulation. Russia eagerly
wanted to be included in the international peacekeeping mission to
oversee the post-war Kosovo province, then rushed in setting up a
potentially dangerous stand-off between Russian and NATO troops at
the airport in Pristina. In the end, Moscow agreed to quietly
negotiate the terms of its peacekeeping role.
</P>
<P>
   Even Moscow commentators who praised that daring move in Kosovo
see a need to sober up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Moscow has to remain cool and try not to overdo it. It has
to keep this success from going to its head. We should not demand
too much. We should bear in mind our actual capacities, financial
and otherwise,'' said Yusin, the political commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's self-consciousness about its world image was apparent
in a recent domestic debate over a tax bill rejected by the Duma.
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin warned that Russia could become a
``world pariah'' if the parliament failed to pass the tax-revenue
package designed to pave the way for badly needed financial
assistance from the International Monetary Fund -- which itself,
has become a target of Russian animosity.
</P>
<P>
   In short-term diplomacy, Russia is making the best of a weak
hand. But in the long run in world affairs, Russia still must
decide what it wants to be -- participant or pariah?
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, little will change until Yeltsin moves on, and
the government and the parliament end their feuding. His term is
scheduled to conclude next summer when new presidential elections
are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the support and aid in the world will not make a
difference if Russia and her leaders do not get serious about
reform and overcoming the Soviet, communist legacy,'' said David
Kramer of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

THE ELEMENTAL MALE IS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call him Monkey Boy. Call him Vine Man. Call him Lord of the
Jungle, Lord of the Apes or Lord of the Loincloth. But whatever you
call him, he's back _ Tarzan, poster boy for the 20th century's
deep aboriginal urge.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's new animated version marks the 51st time the movies
have visited Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic adventure series.
Featuring the voices of Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan, Minnie Driver as
Jane and Glenn Close as Tarzan's gorilla mom, Kala, the new film
boasts a few sumptuous visuals as well as the studio's usual canned
cheer. And it retains a scrap or two of the original Tarzan, that
Ape-reared English nobleman who grows into a paradigm for
humanity's lost innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Which is, when you get right down to it, why we still care about
him. Teetering at the edge of the second millennium, tipping
hesitantly into the third, we see in Tarzan a throwback to less
complicated times: The bugs in Tarzan's jungle have nothing to do
with Y2K. Tarzan is the elemental male, a creature of strapping
build and simple communicative skills who can shrug off a bullet
wound as a minor scratch.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a fetching ad for environmental purism, representing a
no-frills, back-to-nature lifestyle that's unsullied by food
additives or fossil fuels. If he were only vegetarian, he'd be
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs published his first Tarzan story in 1912 and two years
later released a novel, ``Tarzan of the Apes.'' Twenty-four sequels
later _ swept along by a stream of films, comic strips, radio shows
and boob-tube incarnations _ the monosyllabic heartthrob was a
multimedia global hero.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of a hero was he? Unlike other popular figures of the
early 20th century, Tarzan was a stripped-down figure, a paragon of
maleness without the usual sidearms. Like Zorro or D'Artagnan or
the Black Pirate (all of them played by Douglas Fairbanks), Tarzan
was a swashbuckler _ but he bore no weapons, swung from vines
instead of ropes and was always way too naked to come across as a
man of mystery.
</P>
<P>
   No swords, no masks, no blousy shirts, no clutter. His was
minimalist masculinity: the Visible Man, a Bauhaus Braveheart with
rippling pecs.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Tarzan that's survived a zillion popular imaginings:
an oversize Y chromosome with a quavering yodel. In 1932, when
Johnny Weissmuller first oogh-ooghed and found his Jane in
``Tarzan, The Ape Man,'' he solidified for all ages the image of
Tarzan as a fantasy He-Man _ a wordless jungle stud who swung from
trees and killed charging lions with a single blade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the most horrible man I ever met,'' Maureen O'Sullivan
told him, giggling and twirling his hair, and he stared back,
bemused. He was the swinger to end all swingers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tarzan was always more than a big male bimbo. He was Adam to
Jane's Eve. He was mythic. He loomed. He was a classless refutation
of England's caste system; born Lord Greystoke and orphaned in
Africa as a baby, he later returned to civilization, only to
abandon its suffocating confinements in favor of Africa's wild
tangles. And he represented, ultimately, both communion with and
dominion over nature _ a dominion earned not by gunpowder but by
muscles and smarts.
</P>
<P>
   It's a power that still lures. Despite all the talk of the
ozone, despite all of our obsessing over extinct species and
free-range chickens and chlorofluorocarbons, we're still rather
fond of the idea that human beings rule Earth. And while Tarzan may
be softened up and Disneyfied into a gamboling tree-hugger, it's
important to remember that the Lord of the Jungle has always been
one for a good, raw steak.

`TARZAN' FAILS TO GET OFF THE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 87-year-career of Tarzan, the Lord of the Apes, he has
been attacked by leopards, shot at by hunters, seduced by ladies,
belittled by fops and chased along the Brooklyn Bridge. And now,
he's been Disneyed.
</P>
<P>
   This might have been a good thing. It might have meant an
imaginative animated reworking of a hoary legend, similar to the
studio's spins on ``The Little Mermaid,'' ``Beauty and the Beast''
or ``Hamlet'' (better known as ``The Lion King''). But either the
folks at Disney are tired of the grind or old Lord Greystoke is
losing his fizz, because ``Tarzan'' isn't quite the children's
classic it's cracked up to be.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the animation is exquisite, but mere artwork doesn't
make a movie. No, something's missing _ something crucial, and not
just the standard show-tune score, deep-sixed to make room for a
conventional soundtrack scattered with percussive Phil Collins
jungle ditties.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Tarzan crooning a few major-key showstoppers on
growing up hairless in a hairy world, we get Collins' wispy,
agreeable tenor, commenting in song while our vine-swinging
mesomorph surfs through the trees. (A true child of the '90s, he
skids along branches like a skateboard.) But it's not just the
rousing choruses we're missing, here. Two other elements are
absent: Characters and plot.
</P>
<P>
   If you look closely, you'll find the remains of Edgar Rice
Burroughs' original in the directors' (Kevin Lima and Chris Buck)
compressed tale; this ``Tarzan'' is still the tale of an English
infant adopted by apes in the African jungle. Kala (voiced by Glenn
Close) is still his ape mom, Kerchak (Lance Henriksen) is still the
fearsome king ape, Tantor (Wayne Knight) is still the elephant,
Jane (Minnie Driver) is still the bosomy squeeze, Clayton (Brian
Blessed) is still the blowhard rival and Professor Porter (Nigel
Hawthorne) is still Jane's fogeyish, well-meaning pop. All such
tidbits of Tarzanicana remain.
</P>
<P>
   And Tarzan himself (Tony Goldwyn) still belts out the occasional
yodel, though it lacks Johnny Weissmuller's coloratura warble.
</P>
<P>
   The film's cast throws kitchen-sink energy into their roles, but
none of the dialogue takes them anywhere new. ``Tell me I'm not
looking at the hairless wonder!'' is about as original as it gets.
Even the comic relief feels factory made.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie O'Donnell puts honking Nooh Yawk attitude into the role of
Terk (a gorilla with a Foghorn Leghorn crest of hair), but you
almost wish she hadn't tried so hard _ it all sounds vaguely
desperate, like a stand-up comic trying to goose laughs out of
lousy material. And when a rhythm-happy band of gorillas starts
whacking out a jazzy tune on campsite knickknacks, the result is
unexpectedly, bizarrely racist.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing is really a matter of gravity. The original
``Tarzan'' (and indeed, the better film versions, particularly
``Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes'') combined
raw-flesh adventures with some serious philosophizing on humanity
and the uncivil nature of civilization. A touch of that is found
here: Clayton, animated with the bulging arms of a malevolent
Popeye, is a gun-toting maniac who'll shoot anything that moves.
But this ``Tarzan'' so condenses the plot that the
nobleman-turned-wildman never gets a taste of the outside world. He
never learns to use a fork. And judging from his sleek, sharp jaw,
he never makes it out of peach-fuzz adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Artistically, the filmmakers seem so obsessed with animating
their jungle milieu _ and with Tarzan's bunchy musculature _ that
the more mundane aspects of storytelling get short shrift. A
newfangled ``deep canvas'' technique mimics 3-D and provides a
cavernous, richly detailed backdrop for the ape-man's rambles, many
of which are dashing fun. Yet the secondary characters are
workmanlike and flat, rendered with little depth and none of the
out-there stylistic flare that marks Disney's best films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' is a serviceable film for kids: bright, eager to
please, full of spry action sequences and a fair bit of slapstick.
Some of the violence (person-on-person, animal-on-person,
animal-on-animal) may be too intense for small children, but it's
generally safe territory for families. What it lacks is grandeur.
For all its whooshing athleticism, breezy humor and soaring palette
of greens and blues, the legend of the ``white ape'' stays
strangely earthbound.

TEXAS-ARLINGTON SAVORS SWEET SUCCESS AS NONREVENUE PROGRAMS THRIVE
</HEADLINE>
AM-TEXAS-ARLINGTON ATHLETICS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Bill Reeves often jokes about his coaching
achievements at Texas-Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Although his position as associate athletic director involves no
sideline duty, Reeves will laugh and take credit for Southland
Conference tennis titles, outstanding track performances and great
golf shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marsha came by and got some advice,'' Reeves said about
Texas-Arlington shot putter Marsha French, the SLC record-holder in
the event. ``We worked on some technique.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's basketball is also one of Reeves' specialties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave Lawanna Allen some pointers on making last-second
shots,'' Reeves said of the UT-Arlington women's basketball player.
``It's working.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, a lot has worked for Texas-Arlington in the past
school year, especially in its nonrevenue programs. Texas-Arlington
won seven SLC titles in the 14 programs it sponsors. The revenue
sports _ men's basketball and baseball _ could have used some of
that valuable Reeves advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need to get those sports going,'' Texas-Arlington
athletic director Pete Carlon said. ``That's the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   As Texas-Arlington heads into the next academic year, it can
brag about making the most of a limited $3.2 million budget and
rising graduating rates. But there is no football team for Reeves
to offer tips. Men's basketball attendance is poor, and the team
has gone through seven consecutive losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The gymnasium is a converted theater. The baseball program is
working on six consecutive losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Carlon said the department's journey from here might be directly
tied to enrollment. He says that because the department's budget
definitely is.
</P>
<P>
   More students at Texas-Arlington means more money for the
Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   More money means a larger recruiting budget, fully funded
programs and the ability to market the revenue sports. A dramatic
rise in enrollment even means the return of football can't be ruled
out, Carlon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few things have to happen in our favor, but we could really
take off,'' Carlon said. ``You could see this department explode in
the next few years.''  &LR; subheds:SLC victories come in bunches
Texas-Arlington has emerged as the all-around sports king of the
SLC, an 11-team league of six Texas schools and five Louisiana
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks accomplished the feat by dominating in nonrevenue
sports, which the rabid college sports fans often call ``minor.''
But in Texas-Arlington's case, sports such as women's tennis and
men's golf are considered on equal ground with men's basketball,
women's basketball and baseball. That philosophy has earned the
Mavericks plenty of overall success in the past school year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the seven SLC titles in 1998-99 are a school record.
Texas-Arlington's teams won five titles in 1992. In women's
athletics, Texas-Arlington won conference championships in
volleyball, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field and
tennis. The softball team was third.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has joked that his work with pitcher Cassie Brand could
have helped the Mavericks softball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked on her fastball,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks men were SLC champions in golf, tennis and indoor
track and field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give each coaching staff enough funds to compete for
a conference championship in that sport,'' Carlon said. ``A lot of
schools only care about football or men's basketball. If we were
like that, I would have a hard time looking our other
student-athletes in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   So the SLC titles mount and accolades come from the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington won the women's all-sports trophy this season
for the third consecutive year. The award is based on a points
system in which each university is given points based on its
conference finish.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington's men captured the all-sports trophy for the
second time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, men's basketball failed to draw more than 1,000 fans
to a single home game at Texas Hall _ for the second consecutive
season. In fact, NCAA statistics showed that Texas-Arlington's
1997-98 attendance of 689 per game was fifth-worst among 301
Division I universities.
</P>
<P>
   The saving grace of the revenue sports was women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach Mike Dean guided his team to an 18-11 season, a
second-place tie in conference play and a Women's National
Invitation Tournament berth. It was the first national postseason
appearance in the program's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the obstacles that our basketball coaches face
with the facility we have, our budget, and that our academic
standards are the highest in the conference,'' Carlon said. ``I
would hope that students would come to UTA for the academics and
everything the university can offer, rather than a basketball
gym.''  &LR; subheds:Texas-Arlington basketball, coming to a theater
near you Last summer, Texas-Arlington closed in on a deal that
would have broken ground on a 10,000-seat, on-campus arena.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington would lease the land to a developer in exchange
for dates to use for home events. There was space for coaching
offices, luxury boxes, and the primary tenant was supposed to be a
minor-league hockey franchise.
</P>
<P>
   A drawing of the arena even made it on booster club membership
pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   The deal fell through, just days before the bid was to be
awarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a done deal, and so did everybody else,''
Texas-Arlington men's basketball coach Eddie McCarter said.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems Texas-Arlington will be playing in Texas Hall _ and
dealing with its deficiencies _ for quite some time. The 4,200-seat
facility is a theater that converts to a basketball arena with the
floor placed on the stage. Fans sitting in the lower level have to
look up to see the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Williams, UT-Arlington's senior vice president of finance
and administration, said last month that an arena is on the
university's master plan. But the construction of it would be at
least 20 years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, McCarter would be 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
   When it looked like an arena might be built, Texas-Arlington
coaches used it as a recruiting tool. The men's program landed
Bossier Parish Community College guard Keith Greene, the team's
leading scorer last year, who said the arena was part of the reason
he chose Texas-Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Longhorns transfer Anthony Goode said a new arena also
swayed his decision to attend Texas-Arlington. The situation made
it appear that McCarter wasn't being honest with potential
recruits, when he was simply relaying what administrators were
telling him.
</P>
<P>
   McCarter said he will never talk about an arena again until a
shovel is in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to mention anything about it to anybody,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The university has, however, decided to improve Texas Hall for
the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Carlon said the athletic department has drafted a proposal for a
new basketball floor, replacing one that received some damage while
being removed at the end of last season. Carlon said he would like
to improve the locker rooms and create office space for coaches, in
addition to their offices in the Gilstrap Center.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas-Arlington, even something that might seem small to a
Division I university _ such as office space at the arena _ is a
big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those offices will help Eddie and me when we bring kids in
here,'' Dean said. ``I'd be very excited if we could get that done.
We won't be going back and forth to Texas Hall all day during the
season. At every other school in the country I know of, the
basketball coaches have offices at the arena.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Texas Hall improvements, the football stadium is
getting new artificial turf in a project scheduled to begin June
28.  &LR; subheds:Finding the money, or a niche for football Whether a
Texas-Arlington football team will ever use the turf remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington football was killed in 1985 because of poor
attendance and the cost of operating it at the Division I-AA level.
</P>
<P>
   Carlon said there isn't anybody who would like to see
Texas-Arlington football return more than him, but the department
doesn't have the estimated $1 million a year it would take to
operate it at the Division I-AA level.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington rents out Maverick Stadium for high school
events such as football and soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington's budget barely pays for travel costs, coaching
salaries and scholarships for the sports Texas-Arlington already
sponsors. In fact, women's basketball offered 13 of the NCAA limit
of 15 scholarships last season.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a return received a boost when students at the
university passed a referendum last summer that asked for $7.75 per
credit hour to be given to the athletic department. It was an
increase of $4 on what students were already spending.
</P>
<P>
   Although other universities across the nation have such a fee,
Texas-Arlington was the first in Texas to try a separate athletics
fee. The student-fee bill has unanimously passed the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the fee, Texas-Arlington's athletic department can
keep its $3.2 million budget. If enrollment goes up, so does the
amount of money Texas-Arlington can spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to bring football back if it meant cutting
into our other sports, and there are still a lot of things that
have to happen,'' Carlon said. ``Students didn't pass the
referendum with an idea that it meant we would get football. But
they understood that, if it didn't pass, there would be no way.''
</P>
<P>
   For Texas-Arlington students to see football, Carlon said, the
department would have to raise enough money for start-up costs.
That includes purchasing equipment and building a field house
underneath the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   To get the field house erected at an estimated cost of $1.5
million, the athletic department would rely on a money-raising
campaign targeted at alumni and sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have to come from external sources,'' Carlon said.
``The referendum ensures that we have internal funds to keep
programs alive, but anything more we do would have to come from the
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington's booster organization, The Maverick Club,
already has started to tap an alumni base of almost 100,000 people
in the Fort Worth-Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Davis, the organization's president and a longtime booster,
is trying to revive the Maverick Club to its glory days of the
1980s with the help of Texas-Arlington coaches and current club
members.
</P>
<P>
   The Maverick Club has embarked on a membership drive similar to
those it used to have in Texas-Arlington's football playing days.
Davis has elected 35 people to captain teams with plans to canvass
the city of Arlington for support.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent booster club luncheon, Davis said, ``Everybody wants
to go a men's basketball game at Texas-Arlington and see people in
the stands. You wonder which comes first, the chicken or the egg.
If you support them, they win. If they win, people go there to
watch. The booster club is going to do everything it can to get
people out there. We haven't had a campaign like this one in a very
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlon said there also is a chance the NCAA will create a
Division I-AAA in the next few years. That division would allow
Texas-Arlington to start nonscholarship football without dropping
from the Division I level in other sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Student Congress recently passed a resolution, 25-1, to
conduct a football feasibility study.  &LR; subheds:Graduating to better
times In the booster club and in the department, there is still
plenty of room for growth and improvement, Carlon said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it's hard to ignore how far the athletic department
has come in the past three years. After the 1995-96 school year,
Texas-Arlington had a $2 million deficit created by the previous
administration, and there were rumors of the university dropping to
nonscholarship status.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, coaches said those rumors made it almost impossible
to recruit.
</P>
<P>
   The student-athlete graduation rate was 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale was about as low as it could possibly get, and I think
that trickles down to the athletes,'' Texas-Arlington sports
information director Steve Weller said. ``On top of that, nobody
was winning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, that certainly has changed.
Texas-Arlington teams have won 15 conference titles.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves can take credit for only 15 of those.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit has been erased, and Texas-Arlington's athletic
department is operating in the black. The graduation rate has more
than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable what Pete, his staff and coaches have done in
a very short period of time,'' University President Robert Witt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the department's image has been significantly
improved after being torn apart by debt at the end of 1996. In
fact, Carlon's first responsibility was to open communication lines
and regain respect from the rest of the university's faculty, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That accomplished, Texas-Arlington has focused on improving its
standing in the SLC.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly did that this season.
</P>
<P>
   Carlon said the next steps are to improve the higher-profile
sports, try to keep a staff of talented, young coaches and watch
the enrollment numbers.
</P>
<P>
   If those numbers rise dramatically, Texas-Arlington sports could
rise, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves will be there to offer some tips. nn

TEXAS-ARLINGTON SAVORS SWEET SUCCESS AS NONREVENUE PROGRAMS THRIVE
</HEADLINE>
AM-TEXAS-ARLINGTON ATHLETICS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Bill Reeves often jokes about his coaching
achievements at Texas-Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Although his position as associate athletic director involves no
sideline duty, Reeves will laugh and take credit for Southland
Conference tennis titles, outstanding track performances and great
golf shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marsha came by and got some advice,'' Reeves said about
Texas-Arlington shot putter Marsha French, the SLC record-holder in
the event. ``We worked on some technique.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's basketball is also one of Reeves' specialties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave Lawanna Allen some pointers on making last-second
shots,'' Reeves said of the UT-Arlington women's basketball player.
``It's working.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, a lot has worked for Texas-Arlington in the past
school year, especially in its nonrevenue programs. Texas-Arlington
won seven SLC titles in the 14 programs it sponsors. The revenue
sports _ men's basketball and baseball _ could have used some of
that valuable Reeves advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need to get those sports going,'' Texas-Arlington
athletic director Pete Carlon said. ``That's the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   As Texas-Arlington heads into the next academic year, it can
brag about making the most of a limited $3.2 million budget and
rising graduating rates. But there is no football team for Reeves
to offer tips. Men's basketball attendance is poor, and the team
has gone through seven consecutive losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The gymnasium is a converted theater. The baseball program is
working on six consecutive losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Carlon said the department's journey from here might be directly
tied to enrollment. He says that because the department's budget
definitely is.
</P>
<P>
   More students at Texas-Arlington means more money for the
Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   More money means a larger recruiting budget, fully funded
programs and the ability to market the revenue sports. A dramatic
rise in enrollment even means the return of football can't be ruled
out, Carlon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few things have to happen in our favor, but we could really
take off,'' Carlon said. ``You could see this department explode in
the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   SLC VICTORIES COME IN BUNCHES: Texas-Arlington has emerged as
the all-around sports king of the SLC, an 11-team league of six
Texas schools and five Louisiana schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks accomplished the feat by dominating in nonrevenue
sports, which the rabid college sports fans often call ``minor.''
But in Texas-Arlington's case, sports such as women's tennis and
men's golf are considered on equal ground with men's basketball,
women's basketball and baseball. That philosophy has earned the
Mavericks plenty of overall success in the past school year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the seven SLC titles in 1998-99 are a school record.
Texas-Arlington's teams won five titles in 1992. In women's
athletics, Texas-Arlington won conference championships in
volleyball, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field and
tennis. The softball team was third.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has joked that his work with pitcher Cassie Brand could
have helped the Mavericks softball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked on her fastball,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks men were SLC champions in golf, tennis and indoor
track and field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give each coaching staff enough funds to compete for
a conference championship in that sport,'' Carlon said. ``A lot of
schools only care about football or men's basketball. If we were
like that, I would have a hard time looking our other
student-athletes in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   So the SLC titles mount and accolades come from the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington won the women's all-sports trophy this season
for the third consecutive year. The award is based on a points
system in which each university is given points based on its
conference finish.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington's men captured the all-sports trophy for the
second time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, men's basketball failed to draw more than 1,000 fans
to a single home game at Texas Hall _ for the second consecutive
season. In fact, NCAA statistics showed that Texas-Arlington's
1997-98 attendance of 689 per game was fifth-worst among 301
Division I universities.
</P>
<P>
   The saving grace of the revenue sports was women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach Mike Dean guided his team to an 18-11 season, a
second-place tie in conference play and a Women's National
Invitation Tournament berth. It was the first national postseason
appearance in the program's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the obstacles that our basketball coaches face
with the facility we have, our budget, and that our academic
standards are the highest in the conference,'' Carlon said. ``I
would hope that students would come to UTA for the academics and
everything the university can offer, rather than a basketball
gym.''
</P>
<P>
   COMING TO A THEATER NEAR YOU: Last summer, Texas-Arlington
closed in on a deal that would have broken ground on a 10,000-seat,
on-campus arena.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington would lease the land to a developer in exchange
for dates to use for home events. There was space for coaching
offices, luxury boxes, and the primary tenant was supposed to be a
minor-league hockey franchise.
</P>
<P>
   A drawing of the arena even made it on booster club membership
pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   The deal fell through, just days before the bid was to be
awarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a done deal, and so did everybody else,''
Texas-Arlington men's basketball coach Eddie McCarter said.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems Texas-Arlington will be playing in Texas Hall _ and
dealing with its deficiencies _ for quite some time. The 4,200-seat
facility is a theater that converts to a basketball arena with the
floor placed on the stage. Fans sitting in the lower level have to
look up to see the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Williams, UT-Arlington's senior vice president of finance
and administration, said last month that an arena is on the
university's master plan. But the construction of it would be at
least 20 years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, McCarter would be 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
   When it looked like an arena might be built, Texas-Arlington
coaches used it as a recruiting tool. The men's program landed
Bossier Parish Community College guard Keith Greene, the team's
leading scorer last year, who said the arena was part of the reason
he chose Texas-Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Longhorns transfer Anthony Goode said a new arena also
swayed his decision to attend Texas-Arlington. The situation made
it appear that McCarter wasn't being honest with potential
recruits, when he was simply relaying what administrators were
telling him.
</P>
<P>
   McCarter said he will never talk about an arena again until a
shovel is in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to mention anything about it to anybody,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The university has, however, decided to improve Texas Hall for
the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Carlon said the athletic department has drafted a proposal for a
new basketball floor, replacing one that received some damage while
being removed at the end of last season. Carlon said he would like
to improve the locker rooms and create office space for coaches, in
addition to their offices in the Gilstrap Center.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas-Arlington, even something that might seem small to a
Division I university _ such as office space at the arena _ is a
big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those offices will help Eddie and me when we bring kids in
here,'' Dean said. ``I'd be very excited if we could get that done.
We won't be going back and forth to Texas Hall all day during the
season. At every other school in the country I know of, the
basketball coaches have offices at the arena.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Texas Hall improvements, the football stadium is
getting new artificial turf in a project scheduled to begin June
28.
</P>
<P>
   FINDING THE MONEY, OR A NICHE FOR FOOTBALL: Whether a
Texas-Arlington football team will ever use the turf remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington football was killed in 1985 because of poor
attendance and the cost of operating it at the Division I-AA level.
</P>
<P>
   Carlon said there isn't anybody who would like to see
Texas-Arlington football return more than him, but the department
doesn't have the estimated $1 million a year it would take to
operate it at the Division I-AA level.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington rents out Maverick Stadium for high school
events such as football and soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington's budget barely pays for travel costs, coaching
salaries and scholarships for the sports Texas-Arlington already
sponsors. In fact, women's basketball offered 13 of the NCAA limit
of 15 scholarships last season.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a return received a boost when students at the
university passed a referendum last summer that asked for $7.75 per
credit hour to be given to the athletic department. It was an
increase of $4 on what students were already spending.
</P>
<P>
   Although other universities across the nation have such a fee,
Texas-Arlington was the first in Texas to try a separate athletics
fee. The student-fee bill has unanimously passed the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the fee, Texas-Arlington's athletic department can
keep its $3.2 million budget. If enrollment goes up, so does the
amount of money Texas-Arlington can spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to bring football back if it meant cutting
into our other sports, and there are still a lot of things that
have to happen,'' Carlon said. ``Students didn't pass the
referendum with an idea that it meant we would get football. But
they understood that, if it didn't pass, there would be no way.''
</P>
<P>
   For Texas-Arlington students to see football, Carlon said, the
department would have to raise enough money for start-up costs.
That includes purchasing equipment and building a field house
underneath the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   To get the field house erected at an estimated cost of $1.5
million, the athletic department would rely on a money-raising
campaign targeted at alumni and sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have to come from external sources,'' Carlon said.
``The referendum ensures that we have internal funds to keep
programs alive, but anything more we do would have to come from the
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington's booster organization, The Maverick Club,
already has started to tap an alumni base of almost 100,000 people
in the Fort Worth-Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Davis, the organization's president and a longtime booster,
is trying to revive the Maverick Club to its glory days of the
1980s with the help of Texas-Arlington coaches and current club
members.
</P>
<P>
   The Maverick Club has embarked on a membership drive similar to
those it used to have in Texas-Arlington's football playing days.
Davis has elected 35 people to captain teams with plans to canvass
the city of Arlington for support.
</P>

   At a recent booster club luncheon, Davis said, ``Everybody wants

watch. The booster club is going to do everything it can to get
people out there. We haven't had a campaign like this one in a very

</P>
<P>
   Carlon said there also is a chance the NCAA will create a
Division I-AAA in the next few years. That division would allow
Texas-Arlington to start nonscholarship football without dropping
from the Division I level in other sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Student Congress recently passed a resolution, 25-1, to
conduct a football feasibility study.
</P>
<P>
   GRADUATING TO BETTER TIMES: In the booster club and in the

improvement, Carlon said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Smithsonian Institution on Saturday unveils a
unique traveling exhibition of solar devices intended to show that
virtually anything under the sun can be powered by its rays.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, a showcase for solar design innovations, will
begin a two-year national tour in September that will take it to
Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Chicago. Dates for the
visits have not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the exhibit is to demonstrate how easily we can
generate plenty of power featuring the sun,'' said Lucy Fellowes,
curator and project director of the Smithsonian-affiliated
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, an organizer of the exhibit
with the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton has pointed to solar energy as one
answer to the problem of global warming, critics say federal policy
has been less than vigorous in promoting the alternative to fossil
energy sources, which contribute to the ``greenhouse effect'' by
pumping tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced a ``Million Solar Roofs Initiative'' in 1997
and set a national goal of increasing the number of solar electric
panels and heat collectors. To stimulate the trend, the president
said the government would make a ``down payment'' by installing
20,000 solar systems on federal buildings by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States programs are strongest in title, not in
implementation,'' said Seth Dunn, a research associate at
Worldwatch Institute, a natural resources think tank in Washington.
``The government has sort of taken baby steps. There have been
serious cutbacks in funding, and most of the innovation is at the
state level.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn pointed to some state policies that encourage use of solar
energy, such as ``net metering,'' which allows solar homeowners to
sell excess electricity back to power companies.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one percent of the country's energy budget is provided
by solar power, said Kert Davies, science policy director at Ozone
Action, an environmental group. He said other countries are moving
to solar energy much faster. Japan, for example, already has
``millions'' of rooftop solar units.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldwatch ``State of the World'' report for 1999 noted that
between 1990 and 1997, worldwide use of solar power to generate
electricity grew by an annual rate of 16.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian display _ it's titled ``Under the Sun: An
Outdoor Exhibit of Light'' _ is sponsored and funded by the U.S.
Department of Energy and BP Solarex, the world's largest solar
energy manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the relationship of the sun and Earth, it illustrates
the usefulness of photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight to
electricity. ``Under the Sun'' examines the various ways that solar
energy can be used in everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Among the solar-powered items on display:
</P>
<P>
   _ A garden chair with a photovoltaic-powered overhead light that
is designed for reading under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   A solar-powered lawn mower that can cover 13,000 square feet in
the course of a growing season. It's equipped with an edge sensor,
a personal activation code, an impact detector, a theft alarm and a
communications system to keep it on track _ all powered by the sun.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``portable energy system'' that uses direct or indirect
sunlight to power and charge battery operated devices. It can
double the operating time of a laptop computer, for example.
</P>
<P>
   _ A solar cooker, which can help the estimated 1.5 billion
people who live in areas of the world where fuel wood is scarce. In
sunny areas, a family dependant on wood fuel can save about 30
percent of its annual wood consumption by using a solar cooker, the
Smithsonian says.
</P>
<P>
   _ A solar-powered fountain where the flow of its water is
determined by the intensity of the sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   _ A solar pavilion made of a thin film of photovoltaic glass
that generates enough electricity to power its own night lighting
and ventilation systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian says all of the items on display are
consumer-friendly and sensitive to the environment. Fellowes said
many of the items _ sun-powered lanterns, a clock and sundial,
garden lights, solar cookers and portable energy systems, for
instance _ already can be purchased at hardware stores, on the
Internet or through catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   In creating the exhibition, she said the National Design Museum
felt it was important to remain true to its mission of celebrating
the direct impact of design on daily life. ``It made sense to us to
look at energy, renewable energy from the sun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Design Museum's layout provided an attractive
setting for the exhibit, which opened in New York City last summer,
designed by architects Nicholas Goldsmith and Gregory Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became an exhibition on generating energy in our own
backyard. We had the opportunity to use our garden as features and
setting. The design used all features of the garden _ our green
space, trees, the museum's facade,'' Fellowes said. ``It was an
outdoor environment powered by the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellowes said the sponsors were so enthusiastic about ``Under
the Sun'' when it opened that they wanted it to go on tour. The
Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service worked with
them to develop a mobile version. For the national tour, Fellowes
said it was important to have a good geographic distribution and
one that would also allow the exhibit to ``follow the sun.'' The
final itinerary has not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Fellowes said she was intrigued by the materials and strategies
that were used to generate electricity in the exhibit when it
opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction was one of sheer exhilaration,'' she said. ``It
was beautiful night and day and it worked!''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the individual displays, she said, ``It's hard to
pick favorites.'' However, she said visitors should take care to
note that the exhibition is entirely self-powered, which she said
is its most appealing aspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the essence of design _ how to make something work,''
she said.

   WASHINGTON _ The Smithsonian Institution on Saturday unveils a
unique traveling exhibition of solar devices intended to show that
virtually anything under the sun can be powered by its rays.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, a showcase for solar design innovations, will
begin a two-year national tour in September that will take it to
Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Chicago. Dates for the
visits have not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the exhibit is to demonstrate how easily we can
generate plenty of power featuring the sun,'' said Lucy Fellowes,
curator and project director of the Smithsonian-affiliated
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, an organizer of the exhibit
with the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton has pointed to solar energy as one
answer to the problem of global warming, critics say federal policy
has been less than vigorous in promoting the alternative to fossil
energy sources, which contribute to the ``greenhouse effect'' by
pumping tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced a ``Million Solar Roofs Initiative'' in 1997
and set a national goal of increasing the number of solar electric
panels and heat collectors. To stimulate the trend, the president
said the government would make a ``down payment'' by installing
20,000 solar systems on federal buildings by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States programs are strongest in title, not in
implementation,'' said Seth Dunn, a research associate at
Worldwatch Institute, a natural resources think tank in Washington.
``The government has sort of taken baby steps. There have been
serious cutbacks in funding, and most of the innovation is at the
state level.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn pointed to some state policies that encourage use of solar
energy, such as ``net metering,'' which allows solar homeowners to
sell excess electricity back to power companies.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one percent of the country's energy budget is provided
by solar power, said Kert Davies, science policy director at Ozone
Action, an environmental group. He said other countries are moving
to solar energy much faster. Japan, for example, already has
``millions'' of rooftop solar units.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldwatch ``State of the World'' report for 1999 noted that
between 1990 and 1997, worldwide use of solar power to generate
electricity grew by an annual rate of 16.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian display _ it's titled ``Under the Sun: An
Outdoor Exhibit of Light'' _ is sponsored and funded by the U.S.
Department of Energy and BP Solarex, the world's largest solar
energy manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the relationship of the sun and Earth, it illustrates
the usefulness of photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight to
electricity. ``Under the Sun'' examines the various ways that solar
energy can be used in everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Among the solar-powered items on display:
</P>
<P>
   _ A garden chair with a photovoltaic-powered overhead light that
is designed for reading under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   A solar-powered lawn mower that can cover 13,000 square feet in
the course of a growing season. It's equipped with an edge sensor,
a personal activation code, an impact detector, a theft alarm and a
communications system to keep it on track _ all powered by the sun.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``portable energy system'' that uses direct or indirect
sunlight to power and charge battery operated devices. It can
double the operating time of a laptop computer, for example.
</P>
<P>
   _ A solar cooker, which can help the estimated 1.5 billion
people who live in areas of the world where fuel wood is scarce. In
sunny areas, a family dependant on wood fuel can save about 30
percent of its annual wood consumption by using a solar cooker, the
Smithsonian says.
</P>
<P>
   _ A solar-powered fountain where the flow of its water is
determined by the intensity of the sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   _ A solar pavilion made of a thin film of photovoltaic glass
that generates enough electricity to power its own night lighting
and ventilation systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian says all of the items on display are
consumer-friendly and sensitive to the environment. Fellowes said
many of the items _ sun-powered lanterns, a clock and sundial,
garden lights, solar cookers and portable energy systems, for
instance _ already can be purchased at hardware stores, on the
Internet or through catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   In creating the exhibition, she said the National Design Museum
felt it was important to remain true to its mission of celebrating
the direct impact of design on daily life. ``It made sense to us to
look at energy, renewable energy from the sun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Design Museum's layout provided an attractive
setting for the exhibit, which opened in New York City last summer,
designed by architects Nicholas Goldsmith and Gregory Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became an exhibition on generating energy in our own
backyard. We had the opportunity to use our garden as features and
setting. The design used all features of the garden _ our green
space, trees, the museum's facade,'' Fellowes said. ``It was an
outdoor environment powered by the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellowes said the sponsors were so enthusiastic about ``Under
the Sun'' when it opened that they wanted it to go on tour. The
Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service worked with
them to develop a mobile version. For the national tour, Fellowes
said it was important to have a good geographic distribution and
one that would also allow the exhibit to ``follow the sun.'' The
final itinerary has not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Fellowes said she was intrigued by the materials and strategies
that were used to generate electricity in the exhibit when it
opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction was one of sheer exhilaration,'' she said. ``It
was beautiful night and day and it worked!''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the individual displays, she said, ``It's hard to
pick favorites.'' However, she said visitors should take care to
note that the exhibition is entirely self-powered, which she said
is its most appealing aspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the essence of design _ how to make something work,''
she said.

DESPITE BUSH BONANZA, DOLE KEEPS HER EYES ON NO. 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Tired of suggestions that she would make a
good running mate for Republican front-runner George W. Bush,
Elizabeth Dole says she isn't interested in the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not undertake this sort of rigorous process in order
to be vice president,'' Dole told the Rotary Club of San Jose
Wednesday. ``You do it to win. I'm in it to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential hopeful spoke to about 300 Rotarians
who went out to the Italian Gardens Meeting Center less for the
ham-and-spaghetti buffet than to hear the woman who, some believe,
could be the first woman president.
</P>
<P>
   Or the first woman vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's honest ... and there's no question she's
capable,'' said Bill Cassidy, a Republican and retired real estate
broker from San Jose. But Cassidy said he wouldn't bet on Dole
winning the nomination, especially in the face of the groundswell
of support for Bush, the Texas governor and son of former President
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, 62, a Cabinet member in the Reagan and Bush
administrations, gave up her job as president of the American Red
Cross in January to form an exploratory campaign committee. She
said Wednesday she would likely make a formal announcement by this
fall, but by all appearances she is in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dole has run second behind Bush in some national polls,
the gap between the front-runner and his competitors has been
widening. A Los Angeles Times poll of California voters Wednesday
showed Dole lagging behind Bush by 50 percent to 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dole urged voters not to be distracted by polls nearly 18 months
before the election. ``It is early. Only 5 percent of people are
even thinking about the year 2000 right now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, Dole called for tax cuts and increased military
spending. She said she would push for more local control over
federal education dollars and for ``sensible'' gun control,
including mandatory child locks on all guns and a ban on bullets
that pierce body armor.
</P>
<P>
   She also did the ``Dole Stroll,'' the tag put on her penchant
for walking Oprah-like through an audience that first drew
attention when she appeared at the 1996 Republican presidential
convention on behalf of her husband, former Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas. Only a noisy, static-filled microphone forced her back to
the podium at the Rotary Club.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in the cradle of Silicon Valley, Dole discussed her
views on technology issues and her belief that the government
should, for the most part, take a hands-off role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep the government out of the way as much as
possible,'' she said. ``We want to leave the industry free to grow
and not be swamped with regulations and with government
intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, she said there should be no tax on Internet
access. She argued for making the research and development tax
credit permanent, as leaders of the technology industry have
sought. She praised the Senate for passing legislation Tuesday to
protect companies from lawsuits stemming from the millennium
computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Dole said she would also increase the number of visas to allow
technology companies hire workers from abroad to help ease the
industry's chronic shortage of skilled help.
</P>
<P>
   ``More workers should be permitted to come in as a remedy,'' she
said. ``But I think the long-term solution to that problem is
education. We've got to educate our young people.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leslee Coleman, executive director of the powerful industry
group the American Electronics Association, said Dole's views
mirror the association's positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things she said were music to our ears,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole also attended a fund-raising event Wednesday evening at the
Atherton home of Republican activist Carolyn Bechtel. The event was
expected to raise at least $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who has visited nine states in the last nine days,
including two trips to California, said she raised $500,000 last
week alone. ``Clearly we will have enough for a very viable
campaign,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It is a year and nearly five months until the
next presidential election, but already the experts say Bill
Bradley has no chance.
</P>
<P>
   The polls, which have replaced baseball as the national pastime,
all show him severely trailing fellow Democrat Al Gore and
Republican prodigal son George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, never mind that Bradley is a Princeton graduate, a
former Rhodes scholar, pro basketball star, three-term U.S. senator
or that he made $1.6 million last year for 64 speaking engagements;
the man is a sound-bite disaster, about as pithy as a rice cake,
about as witty as Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe worst of all, Bradley will not accept the media's role as
kingmakers in national politics. He not only refuses to put on a
lampshade and pink tutu anytime it will mean 30 seconds on network
television, he usually relegates reporters and their questions to
official press availability periods.
</P>
<P>
   He did that Tuesday in San Francisco as he sat in a circle of
Planned Parenthood employees, asking them questions and nodding and
murmuring, ``Mmm-hmm,'' to their answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not gonna do the press stuff,'' he said to the mini-Half
Dome of TV cameras and journalists as he sat down. ``I'll catch you
guys afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of a 10-day California campaign swing, Bradley came to
Planned Parenthood to learn, not to lecture. Unlike most pro-choice
candidates, he didn't talk with the six women and one male
physician in a nice neutral hotel meeting room, he came to ground
zero: a building in which abortions are sometimes performed.
</P>
<P>
   With his brainy, elegant wife Ernestine sitting next to him,
Bradley spent more than an hour listening intently to stories of
clinic violence, political complacency and day-to-day frustration.
</P>
<P>
   All 6-feet-5-inches of him sat up straight and attentive.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly he kept his huge hands in his lap, his long fingers
intertwined and calm. Substitute a tank top and shorts for the
charcoal-gray suit and dusky fuschia-striped tie, and Bradley could
almost have been resting on the New York Knicks bench in 1975,
watching his teammates in the final minutes of a cakewalk over some
other NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   When he did talk, Bradley tended toward the short professorial
summation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, basically what you're facing is multiple levels of
assault,'' Bradley said after hearing several anecdotes. ``And
you're saying that the people who suffer from this are low-income
women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly'' and ``absolutely,'' said the women and the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   When the Planned Parenthood roundtable broke up, Bradley
continued to ignore the few reporters who remained. He grabbed a
sandwich and a soft drink, which he consumed behind the closed door
of the executive director's office.
</P>
<P>
   In a deserted hallway, a young, amiable campaign aide talked
about his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to do events like this where he's going to get
something out of it,'' said the aide, meaning information, not a
photo-op. ``He likes to connect to one person or a few, then pass
on the connection to others down the road or incorporate their
stories into a speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide, who asked not to be named because he was just shooting
the breeze, not speaking officially, said he had worked on a slew
of political campaigns. Bradley's resembles none of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody `handles' him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a political climate in which the November 2000 election has
been reduced to a minor, after-the-fact exercise, it feels good to
imagine Bradley surprising the experts and making it a horse race
for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It feels good, too, to think about him reintroducing to the
American consciousness all those social justice agenda items that
he has consistently championed _ the kinds of issues that made
millions of baby boomers proud to call themselves liberals: Race,
equal economic opportunity, gay and lesbian rights, reproductive
choice, environmental protection, gun control, affordable health
care, a thriving public school system.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, it's all just a pipe dream, right?
</P>
<P>
   Bradley won't play political ball the way the experts say he
must. He's started his campaign ``too late'' and it's ``too
low-keyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what kind of person thinks he can get elected to the
presidency these days by staying off TV and listening to thousands
of regular citizens talk about their problems and dreams?

   LOS ANGELES _ The military just can't get a break these days.
First, armchair generals second-guess the Kosovo strategy ad
nauseam, then someone goes and makes a movie out of ``The General's
Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   A slick wallow in sleazy depravity that purports to address
high-minded ethical questions, this adaptation of Nelson DeMille's
best-selling novel doesn't quite descend to the level of
``8mm''-in-uniform, but it often comes close. Some rivetingly
staged dialogue sequences make the enterprise defensible, but
they're not enough to snatch victory from the forces of drooling
prurience.
</P>
<P>
   Working off one of those cheesy, everyone-has-something-to-hide
scenarios that mystery writers often substitute for real suspense
plotting, the movie makes a case for both gratuitously elaborate
shootouts and widespread sexual deviation being part and parcel of
life on a Southern Army base. By comparison, the over-elaborated
police corruption in ``L.A. Confidential'' seems as petty as a
forged requisition form.
</P>
<P>
   As well as the too-twisted-to-swallow plotting, ``Daughter''
shares ``Confidential's'' James Cromwell as a trusted authority
figure, so you know some sick stuff has got to be going on beneath
its lusciously lit surface. Cromwell's Gen. Joe Campbell is the
commanding officer at sweltering Fort McCallum, where his beautiful
daughter Elisabeth (Leslie Stefanson) is a captain in the
psychological operations unit. For some reason, she's practicing
her nerve warfare skills on her widely respected daddy _ a man so
revered, in fact, that he's being groomed for a vice presidential
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the general's biggest admirers is Criminal Investigation
Division warrant officer Paul Brenner (John Travolta), who served
under Campbell in Vietnam and is on an undercover visit to bust an
arms-smuggling ring (his disguise is Travolta's ``Primary Colors''
Clinton accent). But when Elisabeth's nude, abused corpse turns up
tied to tentpegs in a nearby training area, Brenner's focus shifts.
</P>
<P>
   He soon gets all nosey and self-righteous, despite being saddled
with an ex-girlfriend partner (Madeleine Stowe's Sarah Sunhill) and
pressure all up and down the local chain of command to keep the
inquiry discreet and ``in the army way.'' Apparently, that last
euphemism means Brenner and Sunhill can brutalize and browbeat any
serviceman they care to with Gestapo-like impunity, but should
cover up the small mountain of pornographic evidence that may
reflect negatively on the dead woman _ or her ambitious father.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, everybody from Elisabeth's Psy Ops mentor (a very
solid and slippery James Woods) to the general's loyal adjutant
(Clarence Williams III) to the fort's easygoing military police
chief (Timothy Huton) comes under some kind of suspicion, along
with what seems like the full rank of enlisted men and an entire
West Point graduating class.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta does a few big but forgettable gun stunts, holds his
ground in much more memorable verbal confrontations with Woods and
Cromwell, and doesn't muster very much of the attempted
Tracy-Hepburn tang in the banter scenes with Stowe.
</P>
<P>
   Director Simon West, contrary to many detractors, got a number
of good acting bits into the action headbanger ``Con Air.'' He
scores about the same percentage of well-wrought moments here. Only
this time, instead of ridiculously overblown fight sequences, the
actors have to compete against an escalating pile of lurid sex
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' is the kind of unnecessarily seamy
movie that makes you wish the armed forces _ or at least
Hollywood's version of them _ would really implement the ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy. And with extreme prejudice. &QL;

19TH-CENTURY TREATISE ON MARRIAGE IDEAL, RELEVANT

OUR RATING: 3 STARS

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Two summers ago, Rupert Everett tossed off arch
one-liners while looking smashing in designer duds in the romantic
comedy ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' Audiences were charmed. Now,
he's brought his painfully (and marvelously) dry delivery back for
a more restrained summertime romp, ``An Ideal Husband,'' an
enjoyable Oscar Wilde adaptation that has much to recommend beyond
the way Everett looks in a tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake _ this is Everett's movie. Writer-director
Oliver Parker has fashioned this minor Wilde work into a vehicle
for Everett's sparkling way with an epigram, and the dashing Brit
delivers each and every one with an understated remorse that nicely
connects with the material. He makes it look ridiculously easy.
</P>
<P>
   Everett plays Lord Goring, London's most eligible bachelor and
man about town (circa 1895). Everyone wants Goring to tie the
wedding knot, but Goring seems philosophically opposed. ``To love
oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,'' he tells his
manservant Phipps (the priceless Peter Vaughan) early in the film.
</P>
<P>
   While Goring cultivates that romance and dodges the overtures of
the lovely Mabel (Minnie Driver) and the proddings of his proper
father (John Wood), we meet the film's title character, Sir Robert
(Jeremy Northam). He seems, without question, to be an ideal
husband, what with his devotion to his beautiful wife Gertrude
(Cate Blanchett) and his high standing in London's House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: Sir Robert has a skeleton in his closet. And a
conniving adventuress named Mrs. Cheveley (expertly played by
Julianne Moore) is threatening to expose it unless he agrees to
support a financial scheme she's backing. Sir Robert, then, must
choose between principles and his position, not an easy decision
for a man who believes his wife would leave him were she to
discover that he's less than perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without my wife, I am nothing,'' Sir Robert tells Lord Goring.
</P>
<P>
   Those are desperate words, and, in writing the play, Wilde
wanted to point out that the problem wasn't necessarily with Sir
Robert, but with the wife who put her husband on an impossibly high
pedestal. The film uses its setting (the closing years of a century
_ the 19th) and the political dilemma of its title character to
draw some intriguing parallels to modern times. The message is
clear: Imperfections are what make us human. Embrace them.
</P>
<P>
   Parker keeps things moving at a brisk pace, even if, at times,
the film feels more staged than it should. Caroline Harris'
costumes are gorgeous and Michael Howell adds the sumptuous
production design that is perfectly suited to the period's high
times, not to mention the Miramax brand of filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, brimming as it does with corsets, costumes and
cleverness, ``An Ideal Husband'' seems to be stamped with the mark
of Miramax just as much as ``Tarzan'' bears the Disney imprimatur.
And in both cases, we see why it's often smart to go with the brand
names over their generic competitors. &UR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Several years ago, as personal computing became more
widely popular, I told a friend named Sandy Greenberg about a voice
recognition program that I'd been testing. He leaped at the chance
to use it too.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, a former White House aide and a successful business
executive, is blind. So being able to deal with his computer via
voice has dramatically changed his life. Since then, Greenberg has
operated on the cutting edge of an on-going revolution in
accessibility to high-tech services for handicapped people.
</P>
<P>
   At some stage, however, society must weigh how changes aimed at
helping the disabled should evolve. Should they be voluntary and be
driven by market forces or should they be mandatory and be driven
by federal regulations?
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Applied Special Technology, a non-profit group
that expands horizons for individuals with disabilities through
innovative uses of technology, opts for the voluntary approach.
Webmasters are invited to download Bobby, the logo of a jolly
policeman, as a seal of approval, indicating they've met the
group's user accessibility guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   To become Bobby-certified, a Web site must offer alternative

<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has similar ideas in mind for the
federal government and anyone who does business with the feds. But
in working to enforce the 1998 Workforce Investment Act, Reno has
invested in a billy club.
</P>
<P>
   By June 15, all federal agencies were required to report to Reno
on how they will ``ensure that the electronic and information
technologies used in their programs are accessible'' to the
disabled. (Only national security systems were exempted.)
</P>
<P>
   Standards written by the Access Board, a little-known 25-member
federal panel, apply to all devices and software ``used for
communication, duplication, computing, storage, presentation,
control, transport and production.'' Under rules to go into effect
in 2000, these functions ``must be accessible and usable by as wide
a range of people with disabilities as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes people who are blind or lack color perception, who
are deaf or hard of hearing, people with ``limited strength, reach
or manipulation, tremor or lack of sensation,'' people with speech
disabilities, people with ``reading, thinking, remembering, or
sequencing disabilities'' and people who are ``short of stature.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal net covering the Internet is being widely cast: the
Department of Education, for example, requires states that get
school funds to comply as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a world that is becoming increasingly cognizant of
the needs and rights of persons with disabilities,'' Reno wrote.
``We also live in a world that is becoming increasingly dependent
upon computers and other electronic and information technologies
for providing the information that we need in our daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The feds appear committed to weaving those ideas into an
integrated reality.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHEELCHAIR RAMPS TO CYBERSPACE
 &HT;    Moving in ``k'' (commentary) and ``f'' (financial) categories.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, June 20

<P>
   WASHINGTON Several years ago, as personal computing became more
widely popular, I told a friend named Sandy Greenberg about a voice
recognition program that I'd been testing. He leaped at the chance
to use it too.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, a former White House aide and a successful business
executive, is blind. So being able to deal with his computer via
voice has dramatically changed his life. Since then, Greenberg has
operated on the cutting edge of an on-going revolution in
accessibility to high-tech services for handicapped people.
</P>
<P>
   At some stage, however, society must weigh how changes aimed at
helping the disabled should evolve. Should they be voluntary and be
driven by market forces or should they be mandatory and be driven
by federal regulations?
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Applied Special Technology, a non-profit group
that expands horizons for individuals with disabilities through
innovative uses of technology, opts for the voluntary approach.
Webmasters are invited to download Bobby, the logo of a jolly
policeman, as a seal of approval, indicating they've met the
group's user accessibility guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   To become Bobby-certified, a Web site must offer alternative
text equivalents for all its non-text elements, such as images,
animations, audio, and video. It must also provide summaries of
charts and ensure that data conveyed by the use of color is
available as well in monochrome.

<P>
   Now that the air strikes against Yugoslavia have been stopped,
the world community will have to assess the damage and draw lessons
from the events of these past months. We should not allow the
misguided and unwarranted bombing operation to be followed by
hollow proclamations of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the plight of the Kosovars, the destruction of much
of the essential infrastructure in the rest of Yugoslavia and the
tremendous damage to international relations, any triumphalist
statements are jarring. Claims of victory are being made by those,
on either side, who must be troubled by the thought of being held
accountable for what has happened to Yugoslavia. Make no mistake
about it: The outcome is a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   As president of Green Cross International, a non-government
environmental organization that was among the first to sound the
alarm about environmental consequences of NATO's military action, I
feel duty bound to continue the discussion of this vitally
important subject. Some might now be tempted to ask: Was the threat
perhaps exaggerated? Could nature be much more resilient to the
impact of war than we thought? But this is a dangerous complacency
that could serve all of us badly.
</P>
<P>
   Let us recall the effects of the hostilities that followed
Saddam Hussein's aggression against Kuwait. The data cited at an
International Conference on the Environmental Consequences of War
held in Washington in June 1998 indicate that these consequences
are of a long-term nature. Scientists and environmental experts
estimate that 40 percent of Kuwait's strategic water resources have
been irreversibly polluted with oil. Quite alarming are the reports
of health problems among U.S. and British soldiers who fought in
that war problems that now also affect their children.
</P>
<P>
   I might add that the environmental and medical consequences of
the war in Iraq itself are, for reasons that are well known, not
widely covered by the media or studied by scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Military action against Yugoslavia included extensive use of
weapons containing depleted uranium. Such weapons burn at high
temperatures, producing poisonous clouds of uranium oxide that
dissolve in the pulmonary and bronchial fluids. Anyone within the
radius of 300 meters from the epicenter of the explosion inhales
large amounts of such particles.
</P>
<P>
   Although radiation levels produced by the external source are
quite low, the internal radiation source damages various types of
cells in the human body, destroys chromosomes and affects the
reproductive system.
</P>
<P>
   We are told by officials that depleted uranium components are
harmless and that DU weapons are therefore a legitimate means of
warfare. Let us recall, however, that many military and political
leaders initially believed and some seem to believe even now that
nuclear weapons too are quite ``conventional,'' albeit a more
powerful kind of weaponry. Do we need another, ``slow Hiroshima''
to understand this new mistake?
</P>
<P>
   We must now call for a comprehensive expert analysis of the
environmental situation in Yugoslavia and other countries in the
region and in the Danube basin. This should be a priority task. But
we must do more than just that.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that military conflicts in our time can cause both a
human and an environmental catastrophe makes the task of preventing
them even more urgent and important. Prevention must be foremost in
our thinking and our actions. But, if hostilities break out despite
all our efforts, they must be constrained by certain legal limits.
Such constraints have been laid down by the Geneva conventions and
their protocols. It is now clear that they should be supplemented
by provisions to limit the environmental damage caused by warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, I believe that strikes against certain industries
and infrastructure, such as nuclear power stations and some
chemical and petrochemical plants, must be prohibited. Similarly,
we should prohibit weapons whose use may have particularly
dangerous, long-term and massive environmental and medical
consequences. In my view, weapons containing depleted uranium
should be among the first considered for such a ban.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to convene a second conference on the
environmental consequences of war in order to discuss thoroughly
and in depth issues of this kind. It could adopt some urgently
needed amendments to international law and create a mechanism to
continue this work. It should also address the need for an
emergency fund to finance measures to deal with the aftermath of
environmental catastrophes. Recent events only underscore the
urgency of this initiative, which I put forward at the Washington
conference in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, political leaders and public opinion should
now demonstrate that we can learn the right lessons from the
tragedies of the 20th century. The human drama and the drama of
nature should be of equal concern to us. They should sound a call
to responsible action.

`RUN LOLA RUN' BURSTING WITH ENERGY 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS
</HEADLINE>
 By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just about every kind of film form you can think
of finds its way into the kinetic German urban fantasia ``Run Lola
Run.'' There's pixilation, video, cel animation, special effects,
all manner of camera speeds in every conceivable moving pattern; in
other words, it's the kind of showoffy showpiece that should
rightfully be a cacophonous mess.
</P>
<P>
   Except that all of these diverse style elements and more are
orchestrated with astonishing rigor by writer-director Tom Tykwer.
The film bursts with percussive, creative energy even when it
teeters under the strain of aesthetic overreaching.
</P>
<P>
   The end result? Definitely too clever by half, but a gas
nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Though only 81 minutes long, ``Lola'' moves so rapidly that it
can tell the same story three different times in three different
ways with varying outcomes. The basic plot concerns Manni (Moritz
Bleibtreu), a young underworld courier who has carelessly lost
100,000 marks he needs to deliver to his unforgiving boss in 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The panicked Manni calls his girlfriend Lola (Franka Potente),
who is partially responsible for the dire situation. She assures
him she'll get the money to him in the alloted time, even though
she hasn't got a pfennig and will have to run halfway across Berlin
to meet him. If she's late, he's going to rob a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The desperate, athletic Lola cuts quite a memorable figure
trotting along cobblestones and broken concrete, her persimmon hair
flopping atop her head like a worrying flame. Avoiding angry dogs,
flocks of nuns and aggressive hustlers of all stripes, she
variously relies on pleading, violence and gambling to get her job
done.
</P>
<P>
   Assaulted by emotional betrayal and relentless sight gags (a
favorite Tykwer ploy is to insert snapshots of the future fates
that await people Lola passes), our plucky distance gal displays an
imaginative resilience that is as impressive as her physical
stamina. Tykwer does pretty much the same thing, always coming up
with a robust bit of staging that brings urgency to even
thrice-repeated scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The director has a fine instinct for pacing, too. The movie's
driving forward motion is punctuated by still, character-revealing
moments, and there's even a contrapuntal shot of a turtle trudging
along. As might be expected from a filmmaker so fixated on visual
rhythms, Tykwer was also involved with composing the film's score,
a barrage of appropriately Teutonic techno-beats.
</P>
<P>
   And the triple attack on the same plot line gives Tykwer, well,
endless opportunity to play with cinematic time and narrative
caprice. Split-second decisions and encounters lead Lola in
amusingly varied directions, turning the whole filmgoing experience
into a kind of labyrinthine game.
</P>
<P>
   Fun as it all is, though, by the third go-'round tedium perhaps
inevitably sets in. Tykwer's final set of formal and story ideas
just can't sustain the level of inventive momentum we've come to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   That noted, there's still more real filmmaking in the short span
of ``Run Lola Run'' than you'll see in hundreds of hours' worth of
conventional Hollywood movies. Catch it if you can. &QL;

A BETTER MARINADE FROM SCRATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Making your own barbecue sauce doesn't have to be
a two-hour, labor-intensive ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, you can have all kinds of fun making a tangy sauce
from scratch for marinating and basting chicken and other meats.
And odds are it will be better than almost anything available in
the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   But the secret to a big-time shortcut is to start with one of
the commercial sauces found in the condiment section of the
supermarket, and start adding to it.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the bottle into a large bowl, and start to improvise. The
goal is to tinker with the commercial sauce and give it a zing it
probably is lacking. Creating a new sauce that is distinctly
different from the base and far more pleasing is as simple as
striking a match to soaked briquettes.
</P>
<P>
   Cookbook author William Rice identifies five distinct flavor
areas in the ``Steak Lover's Cookbook'' (Workman Publishing, 1997),
and suggests ingredients to add to a commercial sauce that will
take your barbecue sauce into the area you desire.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sour or tart: Add lemon juice, lime juice, tamarind, plain and
flavored vinegars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sweet: Brown sugar, honey, hoisin sauce, corn syrup.
</P>
<P>
   _ Salty: Coarse salt, celery salt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tomatoey: Ketchup, tomato paste, tomato juice, chili sauce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spicy: More or less in descending order of popularity:
coarsely ground black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, chili
powder, garlic powder, cumin (ground and seeds), anise or fennel
seeds, onion powder, ground ginger, white pepper, coriander seeds,
ground cinnamon, ground clove, ground allspice, grated nutmeg,
dried basil, dried oregano.
</P>
<P>
   Rice offers other helpful hints for preparing a homemade sauce,
using a commercial barbecue sauce as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Combining flavors from two or more of the flavor categories is
perfectly permissible. The idea is to experiment and improvise as
you prepare a sauce that caters to your particular tastes.
</P>
<P>
   If the sauce becomes too thick, add water to thin it. And if
you've been a little heavy handed adding hot ingredients, such as
cayenne pepper, counteract that by adding some sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Until you have found the combinations that work best for you and
the folks you are preparing food for, it is best to work with small
quantities. Start with only a third of the bottle and experiment.
This way, if the sauce takes off in a direction that makes your
eyes water, you've limited the expense of failure as well as the
number of ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   For those willing to start from scratch, here is a quick and
easy recipe for homemade barbecue sauce from ``The Ultimate
Barbecue Sauce Cookbook'' by Susan Puckett and Jim Auchmutey's
(Longstreet, 1996).

HOW U.S. POWS SURVIVED HARSH CAPTIVITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 4 STARS 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During the Vietnam War, 462 U.S. airmen were shot
down over North Vietnam and held as prisoners of war. They were
isolated, tortured and, sometimes, paraded through the streets of
Hanoi as crowds jeered and pelted them with debris. Throughout
their years of captivity, these men established a motto: Return
With Honor. In other words, don't do anything that you would
remember with shame once you returned home to the States.
</P>
<P>
   The riveting new documentary ``Return With Honor'' shows those
words in action through intimate interviews with many of the pilots
along with never-before-seen footage obtained from Vietnamese film
archives. The result is a powerful movie that testifies to the
courage of these men as well as the power of the human spirit to
endure inconceivable hardships.
</P>
<P>
   The film was written, directed and produced by Freida Lee Mock
and Terry Sanders, the team that made the Oscar-winning feature
``Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision,'' which profiled the designer of
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Tom Hanks adds his name as a
``presenter,'' a generous act to help spread the word about this
remarkable movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return With Honor'' came about after U.S. Air Force Academy
graduates collected 39 bound volumes of oral history from those who
had been POWs in Vietnam. Realizing they had the makings of a great
documentary, the graduates approached the filmmakers with the idea
of recounting a little-known, but important, slice of American
history.
</P>
<P>
   The stories _ told entirely through interviews with the men and
the wives they left behind _ are moving, absorbing and nothing
short of heroic. The film moves chronologically: The pilots recall
the early days of the war, when they were cocky and anxious to see
some action before the fighting ended. We see footage of planes
corkscrewing toward the earth and then hear the stories of men
taken prisoner and forced to march through one village after
another, where they were stoned and spat upon by the North
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, many of them wound up at the Hoa Lo Prison
(nicknamed the ``Hanoi Hilton''), an old jail built by French
colonialists where, in the words of Air Force Lt. Ron Bliss, ``you
could hear the screams of about 50 years. It was a hard place.''
</P>
<P>
   The former POWs recount the torture and difficult times (some
spent as many as eight years in jail), but also the brotherhood
that developed among the men. The prisoners developed a code of
communicating through tapping on the stone walls. Capt. George
McKnight recalls two years of solitary confinement during which he
intimately conversed, through tapping, with a man whose face he had
never seen.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers mix in modern footage they shot in Hanoi with the
interviews and archival material supplied by the Ministry of
Culture and Information in Vietnam. The variety of sources gives
``Return With Honor'' a compelling intricacy, with the unearthed
films from Vietnam being particularly revealing.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Navy commander Jeremiah Denton confront a North
Vietnamese camera crew by blinking the word ``torture'' in Morse
code (in case he broke and made a ``confession'') is just one of
many powerful episodes shown during the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return With Honor'' draws inspiration from these men's
stories, and well it should. Although their experience as POWs
continues to hamper some of them physically (and others no doubt
psychologically), most have moved on and recall the days there with
military stoicism, gallows humor and a small amount of pride.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men have enjoyed successful political careers (John
McCain is a U.S. senator and Republican presidential candidate; Sam
Johnson is a congressman from Texas); another, Pete Peterson, is
the current ambassador to Vietnam, living a mere three blocks from
where he was held for 6{ years.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the pilots reflects: ``Few people are called upon to
use everything they have.'' These men were called upon and not
found lacking. Their story is one that all Americans should know.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's early afternoon, and the guests are rocking on the front
porch of a quiet inn that looks more like a house on Cape Cod than
a hostelry on a Florida beach. Instead of listening to the birds
chirp or breathing mountain air, they're rocking in sync with the
waves as the ocean breeze blows over the sand and sea oats.
</P>
<P>
   Bed-and-breakfasts are often referred to as country inns because
so many are quaint little getaways in the mountains or countryside,
far from the hustle and bustle of big cities or popular vacation
resorts. But some are springing up in beach towns, providing guests
that charming feel of being in the countryside with all the
sun-drenched opportunities that go along with being at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Two fine examples are in celebrated Southeastern vacation spots:
Elizabeth Pointe Lodge on historic Amelia Island in northeast
Florida and Henderson Park Inn in ever-developing Destin, Fla., in
the Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Come along as staff writer Susan Laccetti Meyers tours both.

 &HT;    Scouting out Savannah's history
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ John Berendt's ``Midnight in the Garden of Good
and Evil'' may have created the appetite for stories about the
bizarre side of life in Savannah, but it doesn't hold a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Even tourists being ushered through the 19th century birthplace
home of Juliette Gordon Low, founder of the Girl Scouts, hear the
unusual story of how she became deaf.
</P>
<P>
   One ear went bad when she contracted an ear infection as a
child, and the doctor treated it with silver nitrate, says Jim
Varnedoe, one of several docents who give tours of Low's home.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at her wedding, a grain of rice lodged in her good ear,
and became infected. A different doctor, trying to remove it,
punctured her eardrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said it was so much trouble to listen to other people that
she just did all the talking,'' says Varnedoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrible story,'' says Sharon Katsos with a laugh,
adding that it's a story almost everyone who tours the home
remembers. She just finished a trip with 15 Girl Scout Cadettes
from Leesburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd been on a train all night, so you can imagine how much
sleep they got,'' Katsos says. ``But they were just entranced with
the lifestyle, even though they're teenagers.''
</P>
<P>
   Savannah as a whole can have that effect on visitors, even
though Low's home _ now officially the Juliette Gordon Low Girl
Scout National Center _ is just a small part of Savannah, one
antebellum mansion nestled under red oaks and Spanish moss at the
corner of Bull and Oglethorpe streets.
</P>
<P>
   And it's definitely not just for Girl Scouts. One recent day,
the tour groups were primarily two busloads of senior citizens and
a mob of French tourists, who brought their own translator, so that
Varnedoe would pause after every sentence of his practiced spiel
and wait for the French version.
</P>
<P>
   Low, who was born to a wealthy Savannah family, was only 3 years
old when Gen. William Sherman invaded the city in 1864, and she
could remember him paying a courtesy call to her parents (her
father ran a cotton brokerage) and holding her on his lap.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told (Low told it herself, true or not) that she
saw one of Sherman's soldiers missing an arm and asked him where it
was. ``Got it shot off by a rebel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose my father did it,'' the tyke supposedly replied.
``He's shot lots of Yankees!''
</P>
<P>
   Juliette, who was nicknamed Daisy (hence the youngest Girl
Scouts being called Daisies today), married William Low, the son of
a prosperous British shipping magnate, and the two spent much of
their life in England and Scotland. There she became friends with
Sir Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the fledgling Boy Scout
movement, who told her of the thousands of girls who had asked to
join the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Low returned to Savannah in 1912, widowed, childless, 52 years
old, feeling her life had been a failure, and founded the Girl
Scouts, who held their first meeting in the Low house.
</P>
<P>
   The history of Girl Scouts permeates the antiques-filled,
four-story, Regency-style house. In the family parlor is a bust of
Daisy Gordon Lawrence, Low's niece, whom Low registered as the
first official Girl Scout (Daisy, slightly peeved, felt her aunt
should have asked her first). Low was an artist and her oil
paintings hang on the walls of most of the rooms. The painted
porcelain plates in the dining room china cabinet _ depicting
wildlife and flowers _ are by her as well. She even took a ladies'
blacksmithing course and fashioned a set of wrought-iron gates that
stand in the garden behind the house, where Girl Scout troops
sometimes hold ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The house is not wheelchair-friendly (the first stage was built
between 1818 and '21), and the signage outside directing visitors
could be better (go downstairs under the porch to buy tickets
before you wait in line). But while everyone else in Savannah looks
for signs of the Lady Chablis or the statue from the ``Midnight''
cover, at least some go looking for the founder of Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: The Juliette Gordon Low Girl Scout National
Center. 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays (closed Wednesdays),
12:30-4:30 p.m. Sundays. Admission: $6.50 adults, $3 Girl Scouts,
$5.50 AARP members. 142 Bull St., Savannah. 912-233-4501.If you go
to Savannah . . .
</P>
<P>
   Getting here
</P>
<P>
   It's a four-hour drive from Atlanta. Take I-75 to Macon, then
I-16 to Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   Savannah is famous for the many bed-and-breakfasts in and around
its Historic District, and anyone who's settled into a good one
knows it's a pleasant way to stay here. (Check about air
conditioning when you make the reservation, though; not all
bed-and-breakfasts have it.) The Savannah Convention and Visitors
Bureau (number follows) can help with a selection.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative is to stay on Tybee Island, a strip of land about
4 miles long that borders the Atlantic Ocean and is linked to the
mainland by U.S. 80. Tybee is unlikely to impress visitors who want
to live in luxury, but for the budget-minded, young families, and
people who want to combine some serious beach time with their
Savannah trip, it's worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   While Savannah celebrates its past, from its founding through
the Civil War, through the events of ``Midnight in the Garden,''
Tybee is more like it's stuck in a time-warp of the late '50s to
mid-'60s. As you drive over several bridges to get there, you
wonder if maybe your car radio will revert to AM only.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny, slow-moving ``downtown'' (about four blocks long) has
an old-fashioned dime store called Chu's that's packed to the
rafters with everything imaginable; a place to rent bikes for $10 a
day; several restaurants that don't look as if they've been visited
by the Mobil Guide; and a few hotels. But the beach is enormous,
well-packed and very clean.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing is available from an old-fashioned pier. Some visitors
go to the Tybee lighthouse, which was built in the 1880s, with
stairs going all the way to the top (and landings on which to pause
and catch your breath).
</P>
<P>
   More information: Tybee Island Visitors' Center, 912-786-5444.
On the Web at www.tybeeisland.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around
</P>
<P>
   Savannah was voted one of the 10 Most Walkable Cities in America
by Walking magazine: small-scale, lots of shade and benches, and
James Oglethorpe's original design of town squares full of green
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most enjoyable ways to learn about the city and its
history is through the many walking tours. There are at least three
groups that offer them, and the largest is Savannah Walks
(1-888-728-9255, or www.savwalks.com/).
</P>
<P>
   There are several tours that concentrate on graveyards and ghost
stories (for best effect, do one after dark) and several that
concentrate on ``Midnight in the Garden.'' Tours generally cost
$10-$13 per person (less for children and senior citizens) and take
90 minutes to two hours. A good guide (and guides vary) will be
humorous, dramatic, filled with historical trivia, able to answer
questions, and won't let the occasional fact get in the way of a
really good yarn.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to walking tours, there are horse-drawn carriage
tours, bus tours, and guys who drive bicycle rickshaws.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   Like the bed-and-breakfast industry, Savannah is loaded with
good restaurants, the most famous of which is Elizabeth on 37th
(105 E. 37th St.; 912-236-5447). While Elizabeth's high-class
cuisine is worth a trip, if your plastic doesn't have much room,
there are lower-priced alternatives worth a stop.
</P>
<P>
   The 606 East Cafe (319 W. Congress St., 912-233-2887) is a funky
joint serving burgers, beers, onion rings (stacked by the foot) and
tasty bar food. But most visitors remember the decor, which makes
your typical TGI Fridays look minimalist. The crammed, kitschy
collection includes tons of cow-motif items, an overhead
clothesline, murals and aquariums. Even the waitresses apparently
must be multiple-tattooed before they are hired.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill's Pub (9 Drayton St.; 912-232-8501) had a brief scene
in the movie version of ``Midnight,'' but don't hold that against
it. The building dates to 1850, and although Churchill never came
near the place, the bar itself was shipped over from a British pub
in the 1920s. Traditional pub food includes bubble and squeak (a
casserole of mashed potatoes, cabbage, turkey and ham) and
shepherd's pie (ground beef and mixed veggies under a crust), and
the beers are a mix of British, American and European. Nothing is
more than $7.

 &HT;    Two Florida inns near ocean offer scenery and serenity
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 20.
 &HT;    By Susan Laccetti Meyers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ELIZABETH POINTE LODGE
</P>
<P>
   AMELIA ISLAND, Fla. _ Resembling an 1890s New England captain's
house, Elizabeth Pointe Lodge is one of the most attractive
structures on Florida's Amelia Island, a barrier island just south
of Georgia's Cumberland Island. The 25-room inn is covered with
gray Nantucket shingles and inside there is a maritime feel with
photos of old ships and nautical decor, including a captain's bed
in some rooms. Windows in some parts of the inn are in the style of
ship portholes.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Pointe stands out because the island is developed
primarily with older beach homes, condo resorts, such as the Amelia
Island Plantation, and the Ritz-Carlton hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Inn owners David and Susan Caples are also the proprietors of
Lodging Resources Workshops, a company that offers seminars
throughout the country (and at Elizabeth Pointe) on the nuts and
bolts of purchasing, owning and operating bed-and-breakfast inns.
They obviously know their business. From the moment you check in,
the hospitality is exemplary: warm but not overbearing. The owners
and front desk personnel readily offer suggestions for things to do
while on Amelia such as horseback riding or visiting the island's
seaport town of Fernandina to see a scattering of restored
Victorian homes. Fort Clinch State Park is also close by, home to a
fortress that was active from the Civil War through World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The inn's layout is cozy. On the ground floor there is a sitting
area around a stone fireplace. A favorite spot is the beachfront
porch with white slat rocking chairs. The dining area features a
wall of windows overlooking the ocean. A daily complimentary buffet
breakfast is served with items such as eggs Benedict, Spanish-style
eggs, grits and pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to pass the day sitting in one of the inn's Adirondack
chairs on the beach and watch the sea gulls fly by or read a book.
There is no pool, but it's never really missed.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Pointe has a limited lunch menu, and Fernandina is a
short bicycle ride away if you want to dine out. Days wind down at
the inn with lemonade served in the afternoons and a wine and
cheese happy hour at 6 p.m. The chocolate chip cookies, left in the
room after turndown service in the early evening, are divine.
They're also available in a jar by the front desk if you have a
craving earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  HENDERSON PARK INN
</P>
<P>
   DESTIN, Fla. _ Driving up to the Henderson Park Inn, you have to
pause for a second to consider if you really are in Destin. Just a
mile back on U.S. 98 are strip malls and towering condos that house
the thousands that flock to this gulf hot spot. But here on U.S. 98
East, the road dead-ends. And in the cul-de-sac is a green-roofed
inn that looks like a two-story, Victorian house out of the late
1960s television show ``The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson Park is not only eye-catching but is one of the most
distinctive places to stay in Destin. The rates aren't cheap. In
summer high season, the price can soar to $264 a night for a corner
room with a coastal view. (During the spring, smaller rooms run
about $160.) Despite the high tariff, the inn is often booked
months in advance because it is unique for the Panhandle. Guests
often include honeymooners or those celebrating an anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The inn is also a business destination, hosting meetings in a
small conference hall in a second building that has 15 guest rooms
in addition to the 20 rooms in the main house. The inn's restaurant
(serving breakfast, lunch and gourmet dinners, including seafood)
draws raves from locals and is the site of wine club dinners, baby
showers and birthday parties. The complimentary buffet breakfast
for guests includes Spanish frittatas and luscious eclairs and
helps visitors put on some vacation pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson Park bills itself as a ``beachside
bed-and-breakfast.'' But it's got all the trimmings of a luxury
beach resort: towel, beach chair and umbrella service, a pool,
poolside bar and complimentary happy hour on most nights (also
poolside). There's even bellboy service when you check in. But
instead of taking an elevator, guests assigned a room on the third
story must climb three flights of stairs. It's worth the work,
however, if yours is a room with a coastline view _ looking down
the beach over pristine dunes and surf instead of directly facing
the ocean. One drawback is that the less pricey rooms are small.
But there is no skimping on bathrooms, as most have a Jacuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   What really separates the Henderson Park Inn from some of
Destin's overindulgent development is its prime location adjacent
to Henderson Beach State Recreation area, which suffered minimal
damage after 1995's Hurricane Opal. The park provides a natural
barrier, and its convenient 1 1/4-mile beach is one of the few
undisturbed oceanfront sites in this busy area of the Panhandle.

 &HT;    Allure for Men, Romance take top fragrance honors
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 20
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton

<P>
   Every year, the New York-based Fragrance Foundation makes a big
stink over its FiFi Awards. At this annual gala, industry leaders
hail the scents most pleasing to their sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 awards were handed out earlier this month, and the U.S.
Men's Fragrance Star of the Year award went to Chanel's Allure for
Men. The other two nominees in that category were Calvin Klein's
Contradiction and Gucci's Envy for Men.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the award, Laurie Palma, a giddy Chanel executive,
said, ``This is such a thrilling moment for us. In 1997 we took
home a FiFi for Allure for Women, and winning one this year for
Allure for Men is a true testament to the power of Allure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the oversexed advertising environment we live in, the
marketing campaign for Allure is rather novel. Its black-and-white
print ads feature nine men who have achieved a measure of success
in their fields but who are not instantly recognizable. Each is
identified only by his profession and hometown. A line underneath
reads, ``Real men. Real allure.'' Beneath that is a phrase
illustrating the intrigue of each man, such as ``Sex appeal is just
the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Allure for Men scent combines sensual, woody, spicy and
fresh fragrance notes such as fruity bergamot, citron zest,
vetiver, high atlas cedar, tonka bean and hot Jamaican pepper.
Allure products range in price from $32.50 to $48.50.
</P>
<P>
   Other major FiFi Awards went to Ralph Lauren's Romance (U.S.
Women's Fragrance Star of the Year); Cacharel's NOA (European
Women's Star Fragrance); Emporio Armani (European Men's Star
Fragrance); and Van Cleef &AMP; Arpel's First (Fragrance Hall of Fame).

   ATLANTA _ When the hair on his head started thinning three years
ago, Atlanta graphic artist George Tierney grew a goatee to improve
his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   He got a good reaction from his girlfriend. ``So, from now on,
I'm going to have facial hair in some form or another,'' Tierney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Jimmie Warner holds his facial hair _ a mustache and
goatee _ in equally high esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand women love facial hair,'' he said. ``It's that
animal magnetism type of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   They are just two of the men who're fueling the ever-expanding
array of male grooming products in stores. Whether they're bearded,
cleanshaven or somewhere in between, men are paying more attention
to their whiskers than ever, and shaving product manufacturers have
taken note. The Gillette Co. wouldn't have spent an estimated $750
million on research, development and marketing of its new,
triple-bladed Mach 3 razor if it hadn't seemed like a good
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Browse the grooming section of any major drugstore and it will
appear as if there are as many different beard-softening gels and
foams as there are hairs sprouting from the average man's chin.
Many now contain such ingredients as aloe vera and oatmeal extracts
to ease skin irritation. And for the ultimate in shaving comfort,
men can opt to lather up with a shaving brush and soap. Brushes
start around $60 and can cost as much as $500 for a silver-tipped,
badger-hair model.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a fogless shower mirror on the market that's
designed to help prevent nicks because it won't cloud up. The $35
acrylic mirror, made by Z'Fogless, has five times the magnification
of standard mirrors and comes with compartments for shaving cream
and a razor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to men shaving in the shower, it's huge,''
Michael Parker, assistant manager of Brookstone in Lenox Square
(shopping mall), said of the mirrors. ``We usually end up running
out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Razors have evolved from standard safety blades and plastic
disposables to ones like Gillette's Mach 3 ($7) and Norelco's
Advantage, which dispenses Nivea lotion, for $95.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest razors on the market is Panasonic's Linear
Float Shaver, which costs $299 and came out in January. The
electric, wet-dry razor works with foams or gels and can perform
13,000 strokes per minute as compared to the standard 8,000 to
12,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Mercedes-Benz of shavers,'' declared Henry
Woodard, manager of the Sharper Image store at Lenox Square. ``Of
all the ones we have on the shelf, it sells above all others.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the gadgets men can buy to shave at home, more
and more are treating themselves to a relaxing shave at a
barbershop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men take their shaving seriously,'' said Lauren Cross, owner
of the Shaving Gallery in Cartersville. ``The art of shaving is
starting to be rediscovered, because men have got more time and
disposable income to spend on themselves. They're coming here from
miles away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross says she's booked solid every day with men willing to pay
$25 for a 40-minute shave. Some even pay her extra to redesign the
shape of their beards or mustaches.
</P>
<P>
   Lifestyle and personal preference determine a man's shaving
regimen more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Bevil of Dacula says he wears a full beard just to please
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look terrible without one,'' he said. ``I have a little
skinny chin. When I shave it, it scares me.''
</P>
<P>
   SHAVING TIPS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use a hard shaving soap, put it into a bowl and soak with
water
</P>
<P>
   to soften.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  With a badger brush (a top-of-the-line, silver-tipped one
costs about $500), rub in a circular motion to lift the beard
bristles.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shave with the grain of the beard. (Going against the grain
causes razor burn and ingrown hairs.) Use small, downward strokes.
At the bottom of the neck, however, shave upward.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  After shaving, rinse the face with warm water, then cold.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Seal pores with a block of alum, a natural astringent. Never
use alcohol or mineral-based products, because they can irritate
the skin.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use an after-shave balm to moisturize the skin.

 &HT;    Book on cutting edge of shaving info

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wallace G. Pinfold's new book reached stores just in the nick of
time for all you last-minute Father's Day shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Closer Shave: Man's Daily Search for Perfection'' (Artisan,
$16.95) is a laudable alternative to whatever lame gift you might
have rushed out and bought today. As Pinfold says, more than nine
out of every 10 men shave, trim or clip their facial hair daily. In
other words, they can identify.
</P>
<P>
   But, while this CD-case-sized tome is packed with
well-researched information, anecdotes and prose in homage to
shaving, it won't be an easy sell. Shaving, after all, isn't
something most men devote much thought to. They just do it.
</P>

   ``A few years ago, I wondered, `What do people think about when
they're not thinking about anything?' '' Pinfold said last week

JUST ANY OLD ICED TEA WON'T DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Receiving instant or bottled tea when I order
iced tea is like getting a TV dinner when I've asked for filet
mignon. And don't think for a minute that just because it's poured
into a plastic tumbler, I can't tell the difference. Iced tea does
not taste like powdered raspberries, nor does it leave sludge in
the bottom of the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Iced tea, like hot tea, is brewed, with water and tea leaves,
into a transparent, reddish-brown beverage. It's clear, it's crisp,
it's refreshing. It's not Snapple. And unless you add sweetener,
it's calorie free.
</P>
<P>
   Making iced tea is as easy as boiling water. In fact, it is
boiling water. But there are a few fine details for achieving the
best flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Use good water. Tap water is usually good enough but here's a
clue: If it comes out of the faucet opaque instead of clear, mosey
on down to the market for a gallon of noncarbonated water instead.
</P>
<P>
   Bring 1 quart water to a boil in a saucepan. Turn off heat, add
4 or 5 tea bags and cover. Let steep 5, 10 or 20 minutes. Whenever
you get back to it will do. Then pour into a pitcher with another
quart of water. Refrigerate to cool quickly so you can drink it
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   You can sweeten it, or flavor it with citrus wedges or mint. But
in the name of Gen. Robert E. Lee, serve it in a real glass. Tea
served in plastic tastes like plastic.

 &HT;    Georgia gardener opens gates to share passion for hydrangeas
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Penny McHenry saunters up her garden path, it's
as if the cherubic faces of her ``girls,'' as she calls them, lift
ever so gently to beam for Momma.
</P>
<P>
   The 74-year-old matriarch, dubbed Atlanta's ``Hydrangea Lady''
because of her 400-plus family of showy plants, pauses. She clasps
her hands adoringly around one of the fat blue mopheads and
shrieks, ``Look at that! Mmmmmwha!'' giving one a big smack on the
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kiss 'em, I talk to them, but,'' she says, lowering her
raspy voice to share a secret, ``I never, never tell one, `You're
so pretty,' because the one beside her might hear me. I'm convinced
that plants are like children _ they know when they're loved.''
</P>
<P>
   For 24 years, McHenry _ her little baby-blue wagon in tow _ has
wandered her garden not just in search of the most perfect bloom
but of answers in the tragic loss of a daughter. ``I feel very
strongly that Deede lives here,'' she says of the 23-year-old,
killed in a shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
   Deede's death in 1975 inspired her mother's garden and
quarter-century passion for the hydrangea. It was then that friends
brought McHenry two potted hydrangeas, which she planted in the
back yard. Her care for the plants led her to propagate them, or
``make babies,'' she says. Over the years, she began to experiment
with many of the hundreds of cultivars, producing a garden often
billed one of the country's finest hydrangea collections.
</P>
<P>
   And Momma couldn't be more proud of her girls. So much so she
prefers that visitors _ such as those taking part in this weekend's
American Hydrangea Society Tour _ tour her garden only in the
morning and evenings. In the afternoon heat, hydrangeas bow their
heads, and ``You don't want your girls looking all droopy if
company's coming by,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The ``company'' grows each year as the hydrangea hooks fans
drawn to a striking, yet low-maintenance plant that delivers
long-lasting summer color while kindling memories with its
nostalgic charm. ``It's a plant that evokes a lot of emotion,''
says Elizabeth Dean, whose nursery, Wilkerson Mill Gardens in
Palmetto, grows about 100 hydrangea cultivars. ``I do lots of slide
shows, and when I talk about hydrangeas, the audience goes orgasmic
with more oohs and ahhs than for any other plant. The blooms are
just so showy, when you stand in front of a loaded bush you just
want to dive right into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Penny takes the dive: McHenry's a lot like the bold, gaudy
plant. Sporting big blonde hair, big dark sunglasses and a
self-described big mouth, the one-time actress is a public
relations megaphone for the hydrangea. Garden designer Ryan Gainey
calls her ``Mrs. Mophead.''
</P>
<P>
   When McHenry first met the plant she was like most people, who
admire the billowy mopheads but are unfamiliar with its many
cousins. Her first two were simply tagged hydrangea macrophylla,
the common big-leaf varieties, which include hortensias and lace
caps. Hortensias have globe-shaped, or dense ``mophead'' blossoms;
lace caps have disc-like clusters of smaller flowers encircled by
larger ones. Others species include the panicle hydrangea (H.
paniculata) with cone-shaped flowers, the smooth-headed hydrangea
(H. arborescens), the climbers (H. anomala) with lace cap blossoms,
the small-flowering types (H. serrata) and the oakleaf (H.
quercifolia), a native to Georgia with elongated cluster blooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to have only one,'' McHenry says, glancing around to
see if any of her girls are listening, ``it would be the oakleaf.
It's pretty all year round,'' with white flowers that turn pink,
then mauve, and leaves that become crimson in fall.
</P>
<P>
   All hydrangeas are deciduous, which means McHenry's hundreds of
girls get ``naked,'' she says, in winter. Four years ago, landscape
designer Sandra Jonas convinced her to add evergreen shrubs and
perennials to brighten the drab landscape until spring and enhance
the sea of all blue, pink and white in summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that was here was acuba and 'ugly Agnes,' '' she says,
referring to the shrub elaeagnus.
</P>
<P>
   In spring and summer, squatty hostas, rocket-like foxgloves and
meandering clematis complement the fat mopheads with contrasting
form and texture.
</P>
<P>
   McHenry developed most of her collection of some 100 cultivars,
including one named in her honor, the 'Penny Mac,' the
old-fashioned way _ ``layering.'' By lowering a branch to the
ground, covering it with soil and anchoring it with a brick until
it takes root, she was able to extend her back yard's blue blanket
of shrubs to the front, where a sign welcomes visitors to
``Hydrangea Heaven.'' Others she acquired through hydrangea fans,
including the 400-member American Hydrangea Society, which she
founded five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, McHenry, whose big white station wagon sports
a license plate reading ``Hydrangea Lady,'' ran out of room in her
Flair Knoll Drive yard and got permission to plant hydrangeas on
church property behind her. ``Here are my Presbyterians!'' she
says, opening a rear gate to reveal dozens more mopheads.
</P>
<P>
   Penny's blue heaven. The key to growing beautiful hydrangeas,
she says, is pruning and sunlight. In addition to eliminating old
growth in early spring, McHenry cuts her flowers throughout the
summer, producing a second blooming in fall. And despite their
reputation as shade plants, most hydrangeas prefer several hours of
morning sun. Still, they are low maintenance plants with no enemies
to speak of, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Their only mystique is bloom color, which McHenry has
experimented with over the years by adding aluminum sulphate to the
soil to get blue, lime for pink. In general, acidic soil, produces
blue blossoms, while alkaline soil yields pink and red ones. Yet
sunlight also affects color. For that reason, both McHenry and Dean
believe gardeners place too much emphasis on changing hues. ``As
(Southern Living garden writer) Steve Bender once told me, 'Let
them be what they want to be,' '' she says. ``They're like your
children.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what had kept gardening a pleasure, not a chore, for
McHenry all these years. ``I don't have a gardener or a maid,''
says McHenry, whose only help is the moral support she gets from
husband Dave. ``I do not think gardening should be stressful. I
know when I come out here every day I'm not going to get everything
I want to do done. I garden because I'd rather be here than playing
bridge or at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as a grandmother of four, I strongly believe that if I can
teach them the wonders of nature (She's already taught three to
layer hydrangeas), I've achieved something.''
</P>
<P>
   Her thoughts suddenly get interrupted: ``Look at this lace
cap!'' she shouts, darting to inspect a discovery. ``How can
someone not like these girls?''
</P>
<P>
   Love is something Momma's girls know all about.
</P>
<P>
   Deede, no doubt, would vouch for that.

   ATLANTA: would vouch for that.
</P>
<P>
   P E N N Y ' S S E C R E T S
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta gardener Penny McHenry's best advice for growing
hydrangeas includes:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start with the soil. Make it rich and friable by providing
lots of amendments. She adds Nature's Helper Soil Conditioner and
manure. She also feeds her plants manure tea, which she makes by
placing barrels of manure at the corners of her house to collect
rain water, and a slow-release 10-10-10 fertilizer in spring and
fall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Give them plenty to drink. McHenry prefers soaker hoses to an
irrigation system so that the ground, not the plant, gets wet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't be shy with shears. McHenry believes the secret to her
second bloom in fall is a heavy pruning in spring and cuttings
throughout summer. In late March, she prunes several of the largest
canes to the ground and the remaining ones to just above the point
at which new growth has emerged. (Oakleafs don't require pruning.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Recycle those blooms. McHenry wastes nothing; all cuttings are
composted and returned to the soil as a layer of mulch, which helps
retain moisture and prevents weeds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be patient with color. Mophead bloom color can range from deep
blue to bright red. The soil's acidity, or pH, determines bloom
color, but sunlight and other conditions also play a role. To make
blooms blue, apply 1/4-ounce aluminum sulphate in one gallon of
water, once each in spring and fall; conversely, to make them pink,
add lime around the base of the shrub in spring and fall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make ``babies'': To propagate hydrangeas the old-fashioned
way, McHenry lowers the branch of a shrub to the (ground, covers it
with soil and anchors it with a brick. With frequent waterings and
feedings, roots emerge in six to eight weeks. Clip the branch from
the shrub and plant.

 &HT;    Zinnias sow seeds of disappointment
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The seed packet pictured a rainbow of perfect blooms, zinnias in
all their glory: red, yellow, orange _ hot colors for the hot times
when they explode in the garden and shower it with butterfly-loving
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   With memories of Big Momma dancing in my head _ Big Momma who
planted zinnias and collards in the front yard before it was cool _
I carefully scratched shallow little trenches into the ground. I
then scattered the seed in them, just as my grandmother had done
each spring back in Cuba, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I waited. Sure enough, in a few days the seeds sprouted,
and tiny green leaves on needle-sized stems pushed from the ground.
Wonderful. Now, just water and watch these babies grow into tall,
tough stems before producing blossoms of perfection like those on
the packet.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, disappointment, thy name is Zinnia.
</P>
<P>
   The stems reached a height of 2 inches and just stood there,
forlorn, weak, vulnerable. A large ant could accidentally trample
the poor darlings.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, I went to the garden to monitor the progress of
my would-be zinnia patch. Day after day, I marveled that any plant
could reach such a sad plateau and remain poised there, not growing
taller, yet not giving up and falling down, either.
</P>
<P>
   Yet again I had failed in the seed department. If my success
rate in growing plants from seed were translated into a baseball
player's batting average, I'm afraid I'd be booted off the team.
</P>
<P>
   For years, pride, manifesting itself as sour grapes, made me
disparage seed growing; I'd dismiss my failure by claiming I didn't
have time to grow plants from seed. I need more immediate
gratification, I'd say, cavalierly, knowing I was only trying to
fool myself.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain my repeated quests? Most springs find me
trying again. And there's never any shortage of potential failures;
my seed drawer is filled to the brim. Loose seeds, packets of
seeds, seeds nestled in paper towels, seeds stored and sealed
efficiently in little plastic bags. I even know what year some of
them were collected. However, what plants some of them came from
has grown a bit hazy.
</P>
<P>
   But the zinnia seeds were no mystery. And they were labled for
planting this year. They couldn't fail.
</P>
<P>
   Just as those okra seeds several years back were sure-fire.
Shared by a great grower in Rockdale County, the seeds produced
awesome okra _ in his garden. In mine, they grew plants that were
awesomely puny.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the hollyhock seeds for which I had such high
hopes when a friend sent them through the mail. Black hollyhock
blossoms _ I could just see them. Seems I never will. I didn't even
see shoots from the seeds so carefully planted. Same goes for the
poppy seeds I planted for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing about the poppies. When I first planted the gift
seeds a couple of years ago, the plants came up in the spring and
bloomed bright red, producing seeds of their own. Those seeds,
however, refused to germinate this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, my experience with seeds resembles my efforts to
grow certain houseplants that ``you just can't kill.'' I've had no
problem dispatching the unkillable snake plant, the invincible jade
and deathless cactus. Arguably, when I've had them keel over it's
because I watered too much, but there may be more to it than that.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, overwatering might have been the way I lost my first ones
many years ago. After that, however, they may have fallen victim to
unconscious dread, self-fulfilling prophecy; I believed they'd drop
dead, and they did.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, my speculation could be way off base; failure has
a way of breeding uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   What I do know for sure is that I'm hurting for zinnias. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I love pain, but I'll continue planting seeds; there's
always another spring, another summer. Meanwhile, I'm looking for a
few good (ready-made) plants.
</P>

HOW U.S. POWS SURVIVED HARSH CAPTIVITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 4 STARS 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During the Vietnam War, 462 U.S. airmen were shot
down over North Vietnam and held as prisoners of war. They were
isolated, tortured and, sometimes, paraded through the streets of
Hanoi as crowds jeered and pelted them with debris. Throughout
their years of captivity, these men established a motto: Return
With Honor. In other words, don't do anything that you would
remember with shame once you returned home to the States.
</P>
<P>
   The riveting new documentary ``Return With Honor'' shows those
words in action through intimate interviews with many of the pilots
along with never-before-seen footage obtained from Vietnamese film
archives. The result is a powerful movie that testifies to the
courage of these men as well as the power of the human spirit to
endure inconceivable hardships.
</P>
<P>
   The film was written, directed and produced by Freida Lee Mock
and Terry Sanders, the team that made the Oscar-winning feature
``Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision,'' which profiled the designer of
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Tom Hanks adds his name as a
``presenter,'' a generous act to help spread the word about this
remarkable movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return With Honor'' came about after U.S. Air Force Academy
graduates collected 39 bound volumes of oral history from those who
had been POWs in Vietnam. Realizing they had the makings of a great
documentary, the graduates approached the filmmakers with the idea
of recounting a little-known, but important, slice of American
history.
</P>
<P>
   The stories _ told entirely through interviews with the men and
the wives they left behind _ are moving, absorbing and nothing
short of heroic. The film moves chronologically: The pilots recall
the early days of the war, when they were cocky and anxious to see
some action before the fighting ended. We see footage of planes
corkscrewing toward the earth and then hear the stories of men
taken prisoner and forced to march through one village after
another, where they were stoned and spat upon by the North
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, many of them wound up at the Hoa Lo Prison
(nicknamed the ``Hanoi Hilton''), an old jail built by French
colonialists where, in the words of Air Force Lt. Ron Bliss, ``you
could hear the screams of about 50 years. It was a hard place.''
</P>
<P>
   The former POWs recount the torture and difficult times (some
spent as many as eight years in jail), but also the brotherhood
that developed among the men. The prisoners developed a code of
communicating through tapping on the stone walls. Capt. George
McKnight recalls two years of solitary confinement during which he
intimately conversed, through tapping, with a man whose face he had
never seen.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers mix in modern footage they shot in Hanoi with the
interviews and archival material supplied by the Ministry of
Culture and Information in Vietnam. The variety of sources gives
``Return With Honor'' a compelling intricacy, with the unearthed
films from Vietnam being particularly revealing.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Navy commander Jeremiah Denton confront a North
Vietnamese camera crew by blinking the word ``torture'' in Morse
code (in case he broke and made a ``confession'') is just one of
many powerful episodes shown during the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return With Honor'' draws inspiration from these men's
stories, and well it should. Although their experience as POWs
continues to hamper some of them physically (and others no doubt
psychologically), most have moved on and recall the days there with
military stoicism, gallows humor and a small amount of pride.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men have enjoyed successful political careers (John
McCain is a U.S. senator and Republican presidential candidate; Sam
Johnson is a congressman from Texas); another, Pete Peterson, is
the current ambassador to Vietnam, living a mere three blocks from
where he was held for 6{ years.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the pilots reflects: ``Few people are called upon to
use everything they have.'' These men were called upon and not
found lacking. Their story is one that all Americans should know.

WHEN FONDA SPOKE OUT, IT WASN'T FOR JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another honor for Jane Fonda: At its national convention in
Washington, D.C., next week, the American Association of University
Women will bestow its new Speaking Out for Justice Award on the
famous actress and aerobics queen. She is being hailed, the AAUW
says, as ``a committed activist who champions the environment,
human rights, and the empowerment of women and girls.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge from the AAUW's two-page biography of its honoree,
Fonda has also championed antigang efforts in California, rural
villagers in Tanzania, student theatrical work in Georgia, and
open-space preservation in Montana. The bio mentions the Oscar she
won for her role in ``Klute,'' her ``books, cookbooks, and
videos,'' her work on preventing teenage pregnancy, and the Fonda
Family Foundation, which promotes ``gender, racial, and
environmental justice.'' It talks about the children's camp she
used to run, it lists the boards of directors she serves on, and it
even has something to say about her roles in ``The China Syndrome''
and ``9 to 5.''
</P>
<P>
   But the AAUW document leaves a few things out. There is no
mention of ``Barbarella,'' for instance. Or of Ted Turner. Or of
Jim Jones and his People's Temple cult, which Fonda praised _ a few
months before the mass suicide in Guyana _ as ``the church I relate
to most'' for its ``sense of what life is all about.'' Above all,
the AAUW makes no reference to what was surely the most dramatic
illustration of the lengths this ``committed activist'' has been
willing to go in support of her ideals.
</P>
<P>
   I am looking at a picture that ran in The New York Times on
Sunday, July 16, 1972. The photo shows Fonda clapping, with a wide
grin on her face and three cameras around her neck, as she watches
a helmeted soldier operate an antiaircraft gun. Six or seven other
men, most of them in uniform, can be seen as well.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was taken in Southeast Asia. Fonda had flown over to
assist the war effort _ the North Vietnamese war effort. The rocket
launcher she was so gleefully applauding was used to shoot down US
pilots. Fonda had come to Hanoi to provide aid and comfort to a
vicious dictatorship at war with the United States and specifically
to assist in demoralizing American prisoners of war. In a series of
broadcasts for Radio Hanoi, Fonda denounced ``US imperialism,''
praised the valor of North Vietnamese, and urged American GIs to
disobey orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm speaking particularly to the US servicemen,'' she said in
one broadcast. ``I don't know what your officers tell you . . . but
(your) weapons are illegal and . . . the men who are ordering you
to use these weapons are war criminals according to international
law. In the past, in Germany and Japan, men who committed these
kinds of crimes were tried and executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda's North Vietnam propaganda tour is rarely spoken of today.
It is considered churlish to bring it up, a sign that one is
ideologically stunted, a rigid Cold Warrior unwilling to let
bygones be bygones.
</P>
<P>
   But where is the integrity in giving Fonda a ``Speaking Out for
Justice'' award without acknowledging what she said and did at the
most outspoken moment of her life? Fonda's behavior in 1972 was
horrible, no less for its disloyalty than for its cruelty. She did
more than applaud North Vietnam's antiaircraft artillery. She also
climbed into the gunner's seat, donned an enemy helmet, and peered
through the gunsight _ ``as if,'' Fred Cherry, a POW whose F-105
had been blown out of the sky by just such a weapon, would later
say, ``she was attempting to shoot down an American aircraft. . . .
It was very upsetting knowing an American celebrity was doing that
kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that wasn't the worst of it. POWs were tortured for
refusing to meet with Fonda and pose for propaganda shots with her.
Navy Captain David Hoffman was hung by his broken arm from a hook
in the ceiling until he agreed to take part. Michael Benge, a
civilian POW, was forced to kneel on a concrete floor, arms
extended, with a heavy metal rebar laid across his hands; every
time his arms sagged from the weight, he was whipped with a bamboo
cane.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the POWs came home and told what they had suffered
in Hanoi's prison camps, Fonda called them ``hypocrites and
liars.''
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as I am aware, she has never apologized for that
slander. Or for championing a Communist victory in Southeast Asia.
Or for denouncing Joan Baez in 1979, when the former antiwar
activist asked Fonda to join her in condemning the Communists'
massive human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   She did say _ once _ that she was sorry for the ``men who were
in Vietnam who I hurt.'' That was in 1988, when veterans' protests
in New England were delaying production of a movie she was making.
Fonda went on ``20/20'' to tell Barbara Walters that she regretted
having been ``thoughtless and careless'' _ but insisted that she
had nothing against the soldiers she had called war criminals and
liars. ``My intentions were never to hurt them or make their
situation worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Fonda was 34 in 1972. Her decision to abet the
totalitarians who were engaged in killing her fellow Americans was
not an adolescent whim. It was an adult choice, and it was beneath
contempt. And now she is to be honored for ``speaking out for
justice''? What can the American Association of University Women be
thinking?

SO FAR, SO GOOD FOR CANDIDATE BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Saturday in Iowa, Texas Governor George W. Bush (who is my
first cousin) announced that he would be a candidate for the
Republican presidential nomination. Wednesday in Tennessee, Vice
President Gore announced his presidential candidacy. Bush's launch
was widely regarded as successful. Gore's weeklong launch has met
with somewhat less enthusiastic reviews.
</P>
<P>
   You can measure the success or failure of Albert Gore's
presidential campaign by applying a simple test. If he's talking
about economic growth or doing battle with ``Republican
right-wingers'' in Congress, he's having a good day. If he's
talking about anything else, he's having a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a derivative product of President Clinton. There are
only two things that voters like about Clinton (aside from his
dogged determination). They assign him credit for six years of
economic prosperity, and they appreciate that he has kept the
loonier elements of the Republican Party in check. Everything else
they'd just as soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gore cannot ``distance'' himself from the president (in
part because the Clintons seem incapable of relinquishing the
spotlight), the overriding objective of Gore's campaign must be to
keep voters focused on what they've liked about the Clinton years.
That requires Gore to stay ``on message'' with maniacal intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign has been going sideways for nearly a year in
large measure because of the vice president's tendency to drift
``off message.'' He reiterates his disapproval of the president's
``relationship'' with Monica Lewinsky on ABC's ``20/20.'' He
imagines himself as Ryan O'Neal in ``Love Story.'' He fathers the
Internet as a child. People scratch their heads and wonder:
``What's up with that?''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, it's hard to think straight when your boss's
misconduct merits impeachment. But now that that storm has passed,
Gore has the opportunity to define the context within which this
presidential campaign will be understood. How a campaign is
understood determines, to a large degree, the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   What's unsettling about Gore's campaign so far is how quickly it
gets distracted. Candidate Gore should never talk about people,
places, and things that are not part of the winning context. He
should never talk about George W. Bush, Bill Bradley, or Monica
Lewinsky. The Gore campaign's inability to discipline itself in
this regard is what gives so many Democratic professionals such
pause about the vice president's prospects as a presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   You can measure the success of George W. Bush's presidential
campaign by applying an equally simple test. Every day that Bush
burnishes the Bush brand or adds new and attractive attributes to
it, he's having a good day. Every day that Bush spends time doing
something else, he's not moving the ball. By this measure, Bush's
initial forays into Iowa and New Hampshire were successful.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Bush's campaign will be his ability to ``manage and
enhance the brand.'' He has already won the endorsements primary
(he has more than any of his GOP competitors will ever have). He
has already won the money primary (he has raised more than the
others will ever raise). And he has already won the ``perception''
primary (most everyone thinks he'll be the nominee, and he probably
will be).
</P>
<P>
   For all practical purposes, Bush is now engaged in a general
election campaign. The primary phase (from a communications
standpoint) is simply the first wave of a three-part national
advertising and marketing effort. And it's all about brand
management.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a formidable force by himself (anyone twice elected
statewide with 54 percent and 69 percent of the vote in Texas is by
definition formidable), but his national strength is drawn largely
from people's fondness for his father. In consumer product terms,
President Bush is Pepsi and Governor Bush is Pepsi One.
</P>
<P>
   Defining what the new product stands for in the context of the
old product, is the communications challenge Bush faces. Sunday's
visit to Kennebunkport was smart politics because it magnified and
accentuated the power of the brand. Standing side by side, father
and son communicated both continuity and regeneration. Even
President Bush's mangled syntax seemed endearing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a very powerful brand that can do that. Governor Bush's
task will be to expand its reach, so that it includes not just his
father and him but his brother Jeb (the governor of Florida) and
eventually (if he is to be successful) the leadership of the
Republican Party as well.
</P>
<P>
   This requires sophisticated campaign management. On paper, the
Gore campaign is much easier to run. The message is simpler. The
record is known to all. Any fool could write the script. And the
iron law of politics says that when personal income rises, the
party in power remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow you get the feeling that Gore would trade places
with Bush in a second. In an age when voters are increasingly
disinterested in politics, the power of a strong brand may trump
the power of incumbency. This is Bush's great advantage. Week one
of the 2000 presidential campaign showed the power of that
advantage.

   KOSOVO-KLA _ UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia _ The estimated 4,000 Serbs in
this town were fleeing the American Zone in Kosovo Thursday after
Kosovo Liberation Army rebels began kidnapping members of prominent
Serb families. Hundreds of heavily-armed U.S. 82nd Airborne
Division soldiers rushed to the town and began the dangerous job of
going from one KLA-controlled building to another in an attempt to
locate and release kidnap victims. In one instance, the U.S. forces
found KLA soldiers beating an elderly Serb man who was bound and
helpless. In another case, U.S. soldiers pounced on a KLA rebel who
they feared was about to toss a hand grenade near the American
commander of the American Zone. Thursday's dramatic events here
show the task American and other peacekeeping forces face in trying
to control revenge-minded KLA guerrillas. (Albright, Cox News

   LIGHTHOUSE _ BUXTON, N.C. _ When Outer Banks native Dewey Parr

not at the majestic striped lighthouse, poised for a historic move

than the rescue of the 208-foot-tall beacon of granite and rosy-red
brick from threatening waves. Many residents who opposed the Cape
Hatteras Lighthouse's move now worry what will happen once the
129-year-old federally owned landmark is no longer perched over the
Atlantic. If the three manmade barriers which held back the sea are
allowed to deteriorate, townsfolk fear tides already eroding the
dunes would creep toward the motels, fishing tackle shops and

STOCK BUYERS HAVE STARS IN THEIR EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They buy fake stocks with fake money. They deal in a fake
economy based on the movie industry _ which, in itself, is the
ultimate in illusion. This is the Hollywood Stock Exchange, where
rising stars and and blockbuster films trade like the commodities
they are. Just Thursday, Ben Affleck's value soared 6.6 points to
$1,307 per share. Jason Alexander crashed, dropping 23 points to a
mere $133 per share. ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace'' was up;
``Notting Hill'' was down.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual reality has never been this much fun.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange, at www.hsx.com, seemed like a novelty when it was
founded by two Wall Street expatriots 2 1/2 years ago, but unlike
other ``cool'' Web sites that vanish over time, HSX has grown
exponentially. Some 250,000 users, er, investors, trade 300 million
shares a day on the site. What's the attraction? Power, money,
glamour, sex appeal, to start. It's the ultimate expression of the
seductive, vapid commerialism that fuels popular culture. It's
invest-tainment. It's Wall Street intersecting with Hollywood and
Vine. It's People and Fortune rolled into one. It is ``the
apotheosis of the American dream,'' claims co-founder Max Kleiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a template for the economy of the future,'' he says quite
seriously. ``More and more, the economy is celebrity-driven or
star-driven or hit-driven.'' The currency is attention itself;
quality is irrelevant. The market, Kleiser says, is a fascimile of
the real thing, so it's subject to collusion and manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   There's something inherently depressing about that notion,
although it does contain a degree of truth. So why not try and beat
the system? Why not try to manipulate the market and support
literate movies? It's only fake money, after all. There's nothing
to lose, right?
</P>
<P>
   I set up a free portfolio on the exchange, investing only in
film adaptations of compelling novels and memoirs. No doe-eyed
starlets or Hollywood hunks for this investor _ someone has to
trade with their ideals in mind. You get $2 million in play money
upon signing up, and I quickly snapped up 50,000 shares of Frank
McCourt's ``Angela's Ashes.'' I also bought 10,000 shares of Mona
Simpson's ``Anywhere But Here,'' which stars Susan Sarandon and
Natalie Portman, hardly a dumb investment. Ditto for ``The Shipping
News,'' ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' and ``Snow Falling on Cedars.'' My
portfolio includes 1,000 shares each of ``Breakfast of Champions,''
``Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant,'' and ``Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Big surprise: There was no run on these stocks. ``Angela's
Ashes'' went up a fraction of a point, but it was hardly a killing.
A losing strategy, no doubt. I called in the experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to play the players,'' advises Deanna Scoggins, a
Chicago-based marketing consultant and regular on the exchange.
(She also writes for one of the many Hollywood Stock Exchange fan
sites.) ``It's just like the real market. Anyone who says they buy
Internet stocks because they expect the companies to make money is
a liar or a fool. We buy them because everyone else is buying
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one is buying film adaptations of novels. The real money
is in glamour and glitz. ``The exchange mirrors Hollywood,'' she
explains. ``It's hype and glitz and not much substance, but it's
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoggins and other traders spend hours researching the
``market,'' scouring the trade papers and the fan zines to
determine which films and stars are solid investments. For some,
the exchange has become a form of entertainment unto itself, just
the way day trading on the real stock market has become a popular
pasttime. Keiser, who uses the screen name Max Broker, says that
some folks spend so much time researching a particular film, that
they don't even have to see the movie. They've already been
entertained.
</P>
<P>
   Keiser, who never breaks out of the lingo of the game and acts
as if the market is real, says Hollywood honchos monitor the
trading closely. He also says he receives anonymous calls from
agents who are disappointed with their clients' market value. A
fake market influencing an industry based on make-believe? ``This
is the Internet,'' says Keiser. ``Once you cross over the cyber
frontier, you enter the realm of oddness.''
</P>
<P>
   Successful traders know that you can't bet your money on
artistry; blockbuster films, after all, are just advertisements for
the toy companies. The smart money trades in hype.
</P>
<P>
   So, what are you going to do? Lose your virtual shirt or play
with the players? I traded 40,000 shares of ``Angela's Ashes'' to
buy stock in ``Toy Story 2,'' which went up more than six points.
(Sorry, Frank McCourt.) I also invested in ``Get Smart,'' an
adaptation of the '60s television comedy that is simply an idea in
some studio exec's mind. A few shares of Leonardo DiCaprio, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   The more superficial you get, the more virtual money you make.
That's the ticket. That's the appeal. So what if I'm ranked 209,633
in the Hollywood Stock Exchange ``community'' _ a few thousand
shares of the next Jim Carrey project might raise my standing.
Forget the substance; read the hype. ``I'm a big fan of (playwright
Luigi) Pirandello,'' says Keiser, who majored in theater at New
York University before jumping into the bull market on Wall Street
in the '80s. ``It's just absurdist theater.'' Call it ``Six
Characters in Search of a Virtual Fortune.'' Dump the literary
adaptations. Put the money on, say, ``Independence Day 2'' or
``Under Siege 3.''
</P>

<P>
   Literature does have a place on the Internet, at least at
Atlantic Monthly's Web site, www.theatlantic.com. The site has
launched a special section for short stories that only appear
on-line; the first entry is a folksy yarn by Alex Keegan called,
``Meredith Toop Evans &AMP; His Butty, Ernie the Egg.''
</P>
<P>
   For all those epistle writers who prefer e-mail to snail mail,
the rumor snaking its way around the Internet about a five-cent
surcharge on e-mail is not true. There is no Congressman Tony
Schnell trying to push a bill legislating such a tax through
Congress. There is no Washington-based lawyer named Richard Stepp
who is tirelessly fighting the bill. The US Post Office is not
behind it. So don't worry; e-mail is still tax-free. But maybe
there's a movie in it: ``The Stepp-Tax Files?'' It's got the right
buzz: Internet, government conspiracy, lurid e-mail. Watch for it
on the Hollywood Stock Exchange some day.

WALLPAPERS AND CARPETS WITH A PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI DOTEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKLAND, Mass. _ It's a big old yellow house that sits on the
main street in this town south of Boston. It's a very stately place
next to its more modest neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   At the side of the house is a very small sign: J. R. Burrows &AMP;
Company, Historical Design Merchants. John Burrows, 42 and the
owner, has found a market for what he loves best: re-creating
19th-century hand-printed wallpapers, lace, and carpets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came to the Boston area, people were just
beginning to get interested in Victorian homes,'' says Burrows, a
soft-spoken man with a burly beard. ``There was new interest
because people couldn't afford the Colonial homes of their parents'
generation. You could find some real bargains 15 years ago. Of
course, that's not true anymore, with skyrocketing real estate
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally from Wisconsin, then South Dakota and California,
Burrows says he was looking for a change in 1985. He'd always loved
New England, so he decided to move east and open his own small
shop. He chose Rockland (not one of the most beautiful of New
England settings) because it reminded him of towns in the Midwest
that were settled in the 1880s, his area of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   And with an interest in things Victorian growing in these parts,
Burrows thought he'd fill a needed niche by providing products for
people looking to furnish these large, creaky homes authentically.
Owners of historic houses, he says, are do-it-yourself people. They
tackle the plumbing and stripping themselves over years, and then,
finally, comes the fun part _ the decorating part. And they want to
do things affordably, but also authentically.
</P>
<P>
   His business began with people bringing him small pieces of old
wallpaper they'd found in their homes and wanted copied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created the artwork here and found the proper people to do
the printing,'' Burrows says. ``Initially, we did the painting for
the silkscreens in-house, but now a studio does the work. We
silkscreen instead of using woodblocks,'' which were used for the
19th-century originals, ``to make the papers less expensive to
produce.''
</P>
<P>
   The company now makes 15 patterns, which go by such terribly
British names as Sandringham, Priory Garden, and Kensington.
Perhaps the most gorgeous, and expensive, is The Stag. A single
roll, which covers 30 square feet, is $75.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lace from Scotland
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burrows also sells 10 patterns of Victorian lace _ the only
local company to do so. Others sell lace from France; Victorian
lace has larger patterns and a larger scale of weaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lace is made in Scotland,'' says Burrows, ``in the small
town of Kitmarize, near Glasgow. Many of the patterns are
representative of the Arts and Crafts movement _ a style that
suited Bostonians very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrows does a great deal of research. The pattern for his
Victorian Albertine lace panels, for example, was found while he
was doing research in an English textile museum archive. These
panels, he says, were used as the sole window covering or paired
with fancy valances.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps what Burrows &AMP; Co. is most known for is its
re-creation of 19th-century carpets. These are woven by Wood
Grosvenor &AMP; Co. Ltd., established in 1735 in Kidderminster, near
Birmingham, ``in the heart of England, but I usually only go there
in the dead of winter,'' says Burrows with a smile. ``They have
large archives, with 15,000 original designs dating back to the
1790s.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that Americans who could afford it during the Victorian
years bought their carpets from England because the weaving
techniques there were more advanced. He now markets his carpets not
only in the States but in England and Austria as well.
</P>
<P>
   The colors and patterns are spectacular, each painstakingly
matching the originals. His carpets are also not for the
financially fainthearted _ they run about $250 a square yard.
</P>
<P>
   Although Burrows works with the public, much of his business is
with house museums and interior designers. He was a consultant on
the carpet for the White House's Blue Room, and he is working on
carpeting for the Virginia governor's mansion, carpeting for the
Iowa state Capitol, and wallpaper for the Fred Holland Day house in
Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   Burrows says his interest in things historic began as a young
boy when his father, an English professor at the University of
Wisconsin in Whitewater, would take the family on summer treks to
museums and national parks, and then ``we did the grand European
tour'' when he was 10. The family often visited New England because
his father's family is from Reading. He said his passion for
England was solidified when he worked in a puppet factory in a
little town called Marlborough when he was 16.

<P>
   Architectural history
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He studied architectural history at Grinnell College in Iowa and
received a master's degree, also in architectural history, from the
University of Virginia, where he graduated in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first job after school was as state architectural historian
for South Dakota, because there weren't any job openings in the
preservation field,'' says Burrows. ``Then I worked for a wallpaper
firm in California (Bradbury &AMP; Bradbury), where I learned a great
deal. I got increasingly interested in interiors.''
</P>
<P>
   As did the rest of the country, he points out. When he graduated
from college, there were very few books out there and only the Old
House Journal, which was a newsletter. But color Victorian
magazines began to appear in the early 1980s, and now they cover
large sections of newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   Burrows said he bought his 1829 clapboard house in part because
it included a doctor's office _ a warren of small rooms that
Burrows uses as office space and a small showroom. He is slowly
restoring the rest of the house with his partner, Nelson Villafane,
and they are quickly filling it up with Victorian antiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wonderful about my job is making things available again
so people can live with them and not just see them in museums,''
says Burrows, who also lectures around the country. ``Being able to
re-create from history and use it _ to bring things into your own
environment _ it's an active way of using history.''

STAPLES.COM WILL HAVE TO IMPROVE TO OUTDISTANCE RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once companies worried about being taken over. Today they worry
about being ``Amazoned,'' which means waking up one day and finding
that an Internet upstart has stolen a big chunk of their business.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble got Amazoned by Amazon.com. Merrill Lynch got
Amazoned by E-Trade and a host of others.
</P>
<P>
   Staples Inc. isn't about to let that happen. ``If you don't
think about this offensively and defensively, someone could eat
your lunch,'' says Jeff Levitan, head of Staples.com, the on-line
arm of the Framingham office supply retailer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Staples is in little danger of being Amazoned. The
office supply business on line already looks an awful lot like the
office supply business in the real world. The three big players on
the retail side _ Staples, Office Depot, and OfficeMax _ are the
three big players on line. And like their stores, their Web sites
are somewhat hard to tell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of similarity among them,'' agrees Fiona
Swerdlow, an analyst with Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The Staples experience holds an interesting lesson for
investors, who have assumed that traditional bricks and mortar
companies will be vanquished by pure Internet firms. In many
industries, the established players may do just fine. As in
politics, the incumbents turn out to have some formidable
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Take Staples. It has a well-known brand name. Because it is a $7
billion operation, Staples can buy goods at discounts a small
upstart could not match. The company also has an existing
distribution system that would be very expensive to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   Staples already does $2 billion a year in sales outside its
retail stores. Much of that business is done by customers who leaf
through a catalog, order products over the phone, and take delivery
by truck at their offices. The leap from there to an on-line
ordering system is not a huge one. ``What we have today is pretty
much an electronic catalog,'' says Levitan. ``We haven't reinvented
the shopping experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Christner says Staples will eventually have to do
better. ``The winners on line will be those who do the best job of
figuring out how the new medium can solve problems,'' says
Christner, a consultant with Mercer Management. ``Just transferring
a catalog on line isn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Staples is trying. The company has created a number of features
in its Web business that do not exist elsewhere. On-line customers,
for instance, can easily get a history of their past purchases.
They can get e-mail reminders to reorder.
</P>
<P>
   Using a feature called Group Account Manager, individuals within
an office can order their own supplies, subject to approval from
the office manager. Levitan thinks the new feature will free up the
office manager, but still let him stop Jones in accounting from
ordering too many Cross pens.
</P>
<P>
   Staples is also trying to practice cross pollination. Customers
who are unhappy with products ordered on line can return those
products to any of Staples' 1,000 stores. There is advertising for
the on-line business in the stores and advertising for the stores
on line.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan thinks customers will find the channel that works best
for them. The same customer might come into a store to buy a chair,
a product that requires touching and feeling, but use the Internet
to buy paper clips. ``We don't think we have channel conflicts,''
says Levitan. ``The more points of contact we have with the
customer, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitan insists Staples can grow its Web business, estimated at
$200 million this year, even as its adds more bricks and mortar.
The company plans to erect 170 stores this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Temkin, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge,
suspects that at some point, Staples will have to make some hard
choices. ``They've got a finite amount of investment dollars,'' he
says. ``Eventually they may have to make some tradeoffs between
bricks and mortar and on line.''
</P>
<P>
   Temkin also suspects that Staples' stores may have to morph into
something more like showrooms as the buying action shifts on line.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan doesn't deny that moving to the Web requires some major
adjustments. He has struggled to find talented people, learned to
deal with new advertising media, and strained to work at a faster
pace. Staples.com was launched last November and the Web site has
already been redesigned twice. ``Our motto is fast and flexible,''
says Levitan.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan also constantly scans the competitive landscape, looking
for potential upstarts that might try to gain a foothold in the
on-line office supply business. So far he hasn't seen anybody who
poses a major threat.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan's second motto might be: Staples isn't about to be
``Amazoned.''

`HOT ENOUGH FOR YA?' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hot enough for ya? If I hear that once more I'll commit
something or other, although anything specific is not politically,
or legally, correct.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, someone could coin a phrase, and ask the handyman,
Hottonuff for ya? Ooh!
</P>
<P>
   A smart remark like one of the above is likely to get you even
hotter in these dog days of June. Not all the days of June are that
hot, but we can be confident that if a few days are cool, there
will be plenty of scorchers through September.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, let's see what we can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Easy and expensive &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Air conditioning is the easiest way, and the most expensive of
all the cooler-offers, but remember, central air is like your
heating system, burning fuel to create cool rather than heat, and
the season is much shorter, therefore, more affordable. And, you
don't have to run it all the time because the heat is not
consistent. While an air conditioner is expensive to run, because
it is electric, it is not that pricey to install.
</P>
<P>
   While central air is great, room units are good, too, allowing
you to cool individual rooms instead of the whole house. If you're
thinking of putting in only a few room units, pick and choose where
to put them: kitchen, bedrooms, and family room are good choices.
</P>
<P>
   Room units have become little dynamos in recent years, small
packages with a big cooling capacity. They are small but powerful,
and light in weight so they can easily be installed in a window and
removed for winter storage.
</P>
<P>
   Or, a unit can be installed permanently in a wall opening, with
better sealing against air loss than can be done in a window. A
hole-in-the-wall unit also frees up the window for ventilation and
the view.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Portable units, too &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relatively new on the market is a portable room air conditioner,
one that's on wheels so you can move it where it is needed. While
these units are portable, they are not free-standing, and still
must be exhausted through a window to the outdoors. They are sold
at appliance stores, and are more expensive than standard room
units.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you must be careful about room units is their size,
capacity and amperage. A large unit, rated, say, at 13 amps, is
likely to blow a fuse, trip a circuit breaker, or burn wires when
plugged into a 15-amp service. If you put such a unit on such a
service, you cannot plug anything else into the circuit, because
adding just a few lamps would bring it over 15 amps, resulting in a
short or overload.
</P>
<P>
   An important part of air conditioning is dehumidification. All
air conditioners are dehumidifiers, an important fact in keeping
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Short of air conditioning, is there anything else to do? Yes,
thank goodness.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
All kinds of fans
</P>
<P>
   Fans, for a start. After an initial heat wave, you may not find
fans in a store, but if you buy early, you will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   First, install window fans, which exhaust hot air out of the
house. Put a big one on the first floor and second floor. They work
best when the temperature outdoors is lower than that in the house,
when set on exhaust, not intake. Open several windows elsewhere in
the house, where cooler air will be drawn in as hot air is
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Window fans like these can cool the house overnight, even if
it's 90 in the house and 65 in outdoors late in the evening. By
wakeup time, it will be 65 in the house.
</P>
<P>
   A whole house fan works the same way as window fans, except that
it exhausts more air faster. Usually located in the attic floor, it
exhausts air from the house into the attic where it is vented
through vents. The vents are essential, and there should be enough
of them to handle the high volume of the fan.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of fan can bring relief. These are floor fans and
oscillating fans, ones that simply blow air, hot or cool, on you.
The blowing air is cooling on a hot, sweaty body; the evaporation
process does the cooling. You may feel clammy, but at least a
little cooler.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Some personal tricks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the personal tricks, all of which are temporary.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, avoid coffee and alcohol. These stimulants may
cool you off but soon you will be even hotter.
</P>
<P>
   Wear loose clothing. Cotton is your best choice. Avoid socks and
panty hose whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ice water and ice cubes are great coolers. One quick
cooler-offer is to run cold water over your wrists. This is
supposed to cool the blood, and it does help a little.
</P>
<P>
   Soak your feet in cool, cool water. Take tepid showers. Hot and
cold showers will make you hotter. Pat, don't rub dry; rubbing
creates friction, and you know what friction causes.
</P>
<P>
   Drink water, fruit juices and other non-alcholic goodies, and
avoid sugar as well. One of the best coolers is a tall glass of ice
cubes filled with orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is this trick, which is like hitting yourself
with a 2 x 4, because it feels so good when you stop.
</P>
<P>
   Find the dirtiest, hottest chore that you can do around the
house. Putting insulation in the attic floor comes to mind the
dirtiest, hottest of them all, except maybe laying an asphalt
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Finish the chore, take a tepid shower and sit down with a tall
glass of ice cubes and orange juice. No sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, that does feel good.

SOWING A GARDEN WITH PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's showtime in Dover, Mass. The palms and bananas and
oleanders are stage right. The cannas, brugmansias, and hibiscus
are stage left. And directing it all is Kevin Doyle, a garden
impresario cum designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The garden comes to life whenever it's full of people,'' Doyle
told me on a recent meander around his three-acre property. ``It's
an art form; it's a performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle discovered the joys of taking others on tours of his
garden, which he has named Cairn Croft, eight years ago, when he
shared his remarkable works with his garden club. Now he regularly
escorts visiting horticulture groups, such as the American
Horticultural Society this month, and outings from the Tower Hill
Botanic Garden in Worcester and classes from the Boston Learning
Society.
</P>
<P>
   He subscribes to a definition of a garden as ``a place where you
enter and quickly forget from where you've come,'' and while it can
offer peace and sanctuary, ``I like to think that a fair amount of
my garden is kind of jazzy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's putting it mildly. Doyle's garden, on which he has been
working for 22 years now, is wild and different, lush and colorful.
It's been called a tropical garden, and at first glance, it is. But
that's not what Doyle had in mind. He set out to have a garden with
four-season interest, and that means a design based on foliage, and
that requires some big, bold items. Those either are tropical or
look that way.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle also relies heavily on variegated plants, including
several superb mock oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are follies, topped by a semicircle of eight-foot
columns, which help form a garden room and also keep the eye from
wandering off to spy a nearby house. There is a bench that on
closer inspection is a brownstone cornice from the original Jordan
Marsh store. A 60-by-40-foot pond has a number of Asian glass
fishing floats in it. They look like bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle's garden is a brilliant, diverse composition. ``This is my
garden, and I'm crazy,'' he told me, as Ryan, the golden retriever,
dug up plants and performed other unspeakable acts to gain
attention. Just another actor on Doyle's stage.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle learned to love gardening as a young boy at his
grandfather's place in Kingston. ``I thought it was borderline
magic what was going on there,'' he said, before looking around his
own garden and adding, ``I think this is magic.''
</P>
<P>
   His other grandfather was a South Boston caterer, and so was
Doyle, for 14 years. Eventually, he inherited the business, but by
then he was taking gardening courses, developing Cairn Croft, and
traveling to great gardens in this country and abroad. He sold the
catering business.
</P>
<P>
   He began as a garden professional working for a landscape
architect, installing new plantings at an estate. Doyle still
maintains estate gardens, but ``now I basically live on designing
gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes pride in designing gardens that are all different, that
reflect their owners, not him. ``Gardens are all about people's
dreams and their aspirations and their ambitions.'' As a designer,
he applies psychology and good listening skills to solve the
problem of just what it is a client really wants.
</P>
<P>
   At his Dover home, he lets loose, he is impulsive: ``The most
magic occurs quite by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Gloria helped clear his then overly wooded site, which
amounts to a drumlin with a house on it. His garden rooms are on
various levels. Past the columns, a bare path turns grassy and
winds up to the left, a spot providing a view of the sloped back
gardens. To the right at the back of the house are a greenhouse and
terrace, with plants seasonally shuttling between. A level grassy
swarth separates the house and a perennial border that Doyle,
inspired by the borders at Great Dixter in England, is turning into
a mixed border, the shrubs providing backbone and extending
seasonal interest.
</P>
<P>
   A grass path leads down the hillside, between other beds, and
down to the pond, which Doyle likens to a field: ``It sets
everything off.'' Functioning similarly along the opposite bank of
the pond is a great patch of petasites, moisture-loving plants with
enormous leaves. They help pop the smaller actors into view. They
are invasive but also hardy, a good substitute for gunnera.
</P>
<P>
   A bridge leads across the pond to woodland trails, and they lead
to Doyle's latest efforts, stands of hardy bamboos, some huge, some
ground covers. There are sculptural elements scattered around,
pseudo-stone balls, echoing the fishing balls in the pool, and old
tools. Here there is peace and sanctuary.

 Surf's up! But be careful swimming
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Monica Bay, people who swam closest to a storm drain
had twice the risk of developing an ear discharge, while many of
those exposed to high levels of coliform bacteria got bloody
diarrhea and skin rashes, according to a study involving more than
13,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that, 25 to 40 cases of swimming-related illnesses for
every 1,000 swimmers can be expected, according to an editorial
accompanying the study in the journal Epidemiology.

   A second study, in the current Journal of the American Medical
Association, explored another hazard of water sports _ drowning.
While drownings have actually declined in the United States, from
5,700 in 1986 to fewer than 4,000 in 1996, researchers have been
mystified about the reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The study and an accompanying editorial conclude that the
decline may come from a drop in alcohol use, an increase in
sedentary lifestyles among young people and, even, fear of water
pollution.

   US funding for research has often come under fire, with some
people saying too much is going to AIDS and not enough to cancer,
for instance, while others argue the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the current New England Journal of Medicine tries to
look at funding based on each disease's burden on society.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1996, AIDS ranked No. 1 in overall National Institutes
of Health research funding, with 28.7 percent, or $1.4 billion,
while it was ranked 10th in mortality and 20th in new cases being
diagnosed every year.
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease ranked fifth in terms of funding, with 5.5
percent, or $269.1 million, while it was the No. 1 killer and No. 7
in new cases being diagnosed every year.
</P>
<P>
   But the study and an accompanying editorial by NIH director
Harold Varmus say mortality and newly diagnosed cases are not
necessarily the best measures of the burden posed by a disease.
Instead, they point to something called disability-adjusted
life-years, or the number of years of healthy life lost to a
disease.
</P>
<P>
   That measure was ``strongly predictive of NIH funding,''
according to the study's authors, who are from Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine. Nonetheless, they found that AIDS,
breast cancer, diabetes, and dementia received ``relatively
generous funding,'' while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
birth-related conditions, and peptic ulcer were relatively
underfunded.

<P>
   In response to controversy over the firing of its editor, the
Journal of the American Medical Association Wednesday laid out a
new plan to ensure editorial independence ``while also preserving
the AMA's responsibilities as publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   But JAMA has not named a permanent replacement for Dr. George D.
Lundberg, who was fired in January after the journal published a
survey of college students that backed President Clinton's
contention that oral sex is not ``having sex.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ``editorial governance plan'' calls for the creation of
a seven-member journal oversight committee to serve as a ``buffer''
between the editor and AMA management. The editor will continue to
report to management ``only for business and financial
operations,'' not editorial content, the plan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Editorial independence of the editor-in-chief will be
absolutely protected and respected by AMA management,'' according
to the journal, a widely cited source of medical news that was
roundly criticized for firing Lundberg. The editor can still be
dismissed if the oversight committee makes that recommendation, and
two-thirds of the AMA board agree, however.

 &UR; Exercise is found to help psychological disorders
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Exercise is good for the psychological health of people
diagnosed with depression, anxiety disorders, developmental
disabilities, and it may help those with schizophrenia, according
to a new in-depth review of the scientific literature.
</P>
<P>
   With the growing evidence of exercise's importance and its
relative affordability, ``It is somewhat surprising that it has not
become a more popular treatment alternative,'' write the authors in
the current issue of Professional Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest evidence of benefit comes from studies of patients
with depression. Major improvements were seen as soon as five weeks
after people begin exercising three times a week, for 20 to 60
minutes at a time, finds the report, which assessed nearly 20
years' worth of studies of exercise as therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The authors called for more research into the benefits of
exercise for people with schizophrenia, alcohol dependence, and
other psychiatric disorders.

<P>
   A mystery virus is contaminating blood supplies throughout the
world. No one knows whether this ''TT'' virus is dangerous, but
there are fears that it might cause liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology,
held in Chicago last week, researchers from California reported
finding the virus in apparently healthy blood donors. And a French
team announced that they had found TT virus both in blood donors
and in patients with liver disease undergoing transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   After the problems caused by HIV and various hepatitis viruses,
the discovery of any new virus in donated blood is worrying. But
while some TT virus carriers are suffering from liver disease, it
is not yet clear whether the TT virus is responsible. It's also
unclear whether the virus is spreading, or if it has been present
at about its current levels for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one knows the significance,'' admits Bernie Betlach of the
Sacramento Medical Foundation Center for Blood Research.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was named after the initials of the Japanese patient
in whose blood it was first found, two years ago. Its discoverers,
led by Hiroaki Okamoto of the Jichi Medical School in Tochigi,
isolated the virus from patients who had hepatitis-like symptoms
but no detectable hepatitis viruses in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Betlach revealed that he and his colleagues Paul
Holland and Malcolm MacKenzie have isolated the virus from 8 of 102
healthy blood donors in northern California. Blood from all of the
donors had tested negative for viruses including hepatitis B and C
and HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Bogard of the General Hospital in Meaux, France, also
presented new data. Out of a total of 140 patients receiving blood
transfusions for liver disease from Meaux or at a collaborating
university hospital in Rouen, 33 carried the TT virus. Only 17 of
the 140 tested positive for the virus that causes hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   From other studies on healthy donors, Bogard estimates that
between 4 and 6 percent of the French population is carrying the
virus. About 13 percent of people in Japan are thought to be
infected and in a paper published last July in The Lancet, the rate
in Britain was estimated at 2 per cent.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, Bogard says, is to find out whether the virus
poses any risk to health.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are following volunteers who have TT virus but are healthy
and clear of hepatitis viruses to see if they develop liver
disease,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Bogard says that blood from the volunteers will be monitored for
the enzyme alanine aminotransferase, levels of which are typically
three times as high as normal in people with chronic liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   Betlach, Bogard and other virologists studying TT virus around
the world are anxious not to cause panic, particularly given recent
experiences with a virus dubbed hepatitis G. This was linked with
chronic liver disease in 1995, but subsequently cleared. &QL;

WHAT'S THAT AWFUL FLAVOR IN ALCOHOL-FREE BEER?

<P>
   Alcohol-free beer may seem a contradiction in terms. And if the
lack of bite doesn't get to you, the nasty taste will _ as any
pregnant woman or designated driver will attest.
</P>
<P>
   Now Belgian scientists have identified the chemical to blame,
and they'd be halfway to solving the problem, but for public
mistrust of genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Real beer contains between 3 and 12 percent ethanol, while any
brew with less than 1 percent can be classified as
''alcohol-free.''
</P>
<P>
   All beers start out as wort, a mixture of ground, malted grain
and water, which is then fermented with yeast. This creates both
the alcohol and the mixture of esters, sugars and complex alcohols
that give a beer its unique taste and aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Most low-alcohol beers are fermented at 1 degree C, to keep the
yeast from making much alcohol. But this also stops the flavorful
chemicals from developing, says Philippe Perpte of the Brewing and
Food Industries Laboratory of the Catholic University of Louvain,
Belgium. ''The worty, 'off' flavor of alcohol-free beer comes from
chemicals that would ordinarily have been transformed by the
yeast,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His team analyzed the chemical make-up of alcohol-free beer,
ordinary lager and wort by passing them through a gas
chromatograph. This separates the compounds, letting researchers
smell each one as it travels past a ''sniffing port.''
</P>
<P>
   Four samplers took 20-minute turns to describe the scents that
wafted by. ''One person can't do the whole thing,'' says Perpte.
''You can't smell anything after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Using mass spectrometry to identify the chemicals behind the
smells, they discovered a particularly unpleasant one was
3-methylthiopropionaldehyde, or methional. Its scent persisted at
low dilutions, and was especially strong in both wort and
alcohol-free beer, the authors report in the Journal of
Agricultural and Food Chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Further experiments showed that the methional in wort is largely
broken down by subsequent fermentation. What little is left in
normal beer is masked by other flavors, says Perpte. Even the few
alcohol-free beers that are made by evaporating alcohol from normal
beer suffer from the ''off'' taste, he says, because the chemicals
that usually mask it are removed with the alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the American Society of Brewing Chemists in
Phoenix, Ariz., later this month, Perpte's team will announce their
bid to solve the problem: an artificial yeast in which the gene for
one enzyme, an alcohol dehydrogenase, has been snipped out. The
yeast needs the enzyme to make ethanol, but it also produces
methional.
</P>
<P>
   Perpte suspects the modified yeast would be perfect for
alcohol-free beer, but the food industry in Europe is nervous about
genetic engineering. ''No brewer is ready to use it.'' &QL;

   A twist of a dial on a gun can turn a deadly bullet into a
nonlethal projectile and back again, thanks to a new propellant
developed by scientists at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The invention may allow police to control rowdy demonstrators
with rubber bullets fired at a slower speed so that they don't
kill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though rubber bullets are intended to be less than lethal, at
short range, they can be fatal,'' says Carl Pocratsky, the project
manager for variable-speed bullets with the Department of Energy.
''But if you can adjust the velocity, you can avoid that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusi Taleyarkhan and his team at Oak Ridge have invented an
aluminum-based propellant. When aluminum reacts with water at high
temperatures, the aluminum oxidizes releasing energy and hydrogen
in the process. This reaction releases four times as much energy as
burning gunpowder.
</P>
<P>
   The key to varying the speed of the bullet lies in the light
weight of the propellant, making it suitable for handguns.
</P>
<P>
   However, the reaction is difficult to get started, says
Taleyarkhan. ''The aluminum forms a protective oxide layer, and
it's tough to get rid of the barrier.'' Taleyarkhan has managed to
destabilize the oxide with an additive so the reaction can start.
He refuses to say what the additive is, because patents are
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Because a charge made out of aluminum slurry is so light,
Taleyarkhan has been able to put four separate charges into a
shotgun cartridge. By controlling how many of the charges in the
cartridge fire and at what time, Taleyarkhan's team can manipulate
a projectile's speed. They can even accelerate a bullet so gently
that it can be made out of very fragile materials.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've shot little fluid slugs, bath balls with perfume, paint
balls, Jello slugs _ everything I come across, I use,'' says
Taleyarkhan.
</P>
<P>
   Pocratsky says it should be possible to link a rangefinder to
the control mechanism, so that rubber bullets will automatically be
fired with a reduced charge at close range. &QL;

<P>
   Seasick passengers and crew could soon be feeling much better in
rough seas thanks to a new way of damping the rolling of ships. The
Japanese invention can cut the rolling of ships by up to half and
can easily be fitted to both cruise ships and car ferries.
</P>
<P>
   The Hybrid Anti-Rolling System (HBARS) has already been tested
in open water on the Mirai, an oceanographic research vessel built
for the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center of Tokyo. From
waves up to 4 meters high, which are considered rough, to typhoons
where the waves are as high as 17 meters, it reduced the rolling
and also improved the ship's maneuverability.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that's going to reduce the motion will make people
feel better,'' says Neil Walker, a naval architect with the
consultants Global Maritime. He says that seasickness, and motion
sickness in general, are related to how much the vessel or other
vehicle moves and the frequency of the motion. Reducing the roll of
a ship cuts both the extent and frequency of motion.
</P>
<P>
   HBARS, which was developed by the engineering company IHI in
Tokyo, has a 100-ton mass of metal mounted on rails. Sensors
measure the motion of the ship and feed information about the roll
to a central computer, which controls the movement of the
counterbalance by means of electric motors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Saeki Aiichiro of the Strategic Planning Group at
IHI, this approach has distinct advantages over existing systems,
such as the fins in the water that help stabilize the motion of
most passenger ships.
</P>
<P>
   ''The system has good performance, even when drifting, while the
fin-stabilizer is efficient only for cruising,'' says Aiichiro.
Besides providing a more pleasant journey, on the research ship the
device makes it easier to lower delicate equipment into the water
and to take it out.
</P>
<P>
   The motor has two roles, says Aiichiro. One is to decrease the
speed of the mass while it is moving relatively quickly, such as in
the middle of the roll, and the other is to speed up the mass when
it is moving too slowly to damp the motion effectively. When the
mass is being slowed down, its kinetic energy is transformed into
electricity to save energy.
</P>
<P>
   According to IHI, this makes HBARS ideal for ships with limited
power supplies, including passenger and car ferries. By using a
weight that is less than 2 percent of the ship's displacement
weight, a 50 percent cut in roll can be achieved in choppy seas.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as the roughness of the sea increases the
effectiveness of the device decreases, but for those of a queasy
disposition even the slightest reduction in movement should be of
some benefit. &QL;

   The first question to ask about any new gimmick or gadget is
always the same: Who's this thing really for? Is this invention
meant to make life better and easier for lowly users like me? Or is
it mainly an opportunity to put another Porsche in the garage of
some bright young thing?
</P>
<P>
   Asking this question a couple of years ago would have
forestalled much of the hype surrounding ``push technology.'' You
remember _ the software that went onto the Internet on its own to
bring you news headlines and the like. After an early blaze of
enthusiasm, people finally came to see push as a solution to a
nonexistent problem. And so after an initial blaze of enthusiasm,
most of the old pushers are long since reduced to ash.
</P>
<P>
   This winnowing of clever but useless innovations will never end.
Indeed, another tech victim was flung onto the pyre just Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City Stores Inc. of Richmond, Va., last year rolled out
Divx, a variant of the popular DVD video format. The difference
with Divx was that you could rent one of these video disks without
having to return it.
</P>
<P>
   The disks worked only in special players connected to your
telephone line. Registered Divx users could play a disk for 48
hours. After that, the disk would become unplayable. The ``renter''
would then either trash the useless disk or use the modem in the
Divx player to reactivate the disk, and charge an additional
viewing fee to a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Divx was no engineer's dream. A Hollywood entertainment-law firm
came up with the concept _ there's a warning sign for you. But they
persuaded Circuit City to go along. Together they developed the
necessary software and special video players. Then they waited for
customers to come trooping in.
</P>
<P>
   Only they didn't. And so Circuit City Wednesday gave up on the
whole hopeless idea and wrote it off as a $114 million loss.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong? The usual. Divx brought more benefits to
Circuit City and its allies than it brought to consumers. The Divx
disks played only in Divx players, which were more expensive than
standard DVD devices. And the disks wouldn't even play in a
friend's Divx machine _ only yours. Granted, the system cut back on
return trips to the video store. But that's also the big selling
point of pay-per-view cable movies, which have never caught on.
</P>
<P>
   So, scratch one stillborn technology. There's plenty more to
come. I'm expecting not-so-great things from the recorded music
industry, still scrambling to minimize the impact of computers and
the Internet on record sales.
</P>
<P>
   The popular MP3 music format lets people make both legal and
illegal copies of popular music and pass them around over the World
Wide Web. Alarmed by the threat to their members' sales, the
Recording Industry Association of America has campaigned hard
against unrestricted MP3 use. The RIAA lost a big one on Tuesday,
as a federal judge upheld Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc.'s right
to sell its Rio portable MP3 player. The ruling means that other
electronics companies will soon peddle MP3 devices of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies are being forced to find voluntary means to
limit the spread of MP3. They've tried alternative Internet music
formats like Liquid Audio and A2B, which have features that prevent
unlimited copying of records. But neither format is making much
headway. After all, they bring almost no benefit to listeners; they
exist solely to protect the record companies. For most people
that's just not reason enough to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Now the RIAA is working on yet another solution. It's a set of
software standards that'll be compatible with MP3, but will also
allow companies to slap copying restrictions on the music. For
instance, you'll be able to make a personal MP3 copy of the next
Rolling Stones CD, but you won't be able to send the copy to
somebody else over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   I can't blame the RIAA for trying. Nobody has a right to steal a
musician's work. And yet, software companies have tried ``copy
protection'' systems like this for years. They've yet to find one
that can't be beaten. Even Liquid Audio and A2B have been hacked. I
expect the RIAA system to meet the same fate _ another clever idea
smashing head-on into the public's irrepressible desire to have it
their way.

THREE MILES DOWN 
A Hunt for Sunken Treasure 
By James Hamilton-Paterson 
The Lyons Press, 304 pp., $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Hamilton-Paterson's books, fiction and nonfiction alike,
assemble experiences and observations that no one else would think
to put in the same place.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Hamilton-Paterson's previous books centered on the sea,
like this one, which begins with a phone call from a friend the
writer had met during the research for ``The Great Deep: The Sea
and Its Thresholds'' (1992). ``How do you fancy coming on a hunt
for sunken treasure?'' the friend asked.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton-Paterson fancied the idea a lot, and signed on for an
expedition to look for a Japanese submarine and a British troop
ship buried 3 miles deep in the Atlantic, off the coast of Africa.
Both boats carried cargoes of gold, tons of it. Hamilton-Paterson's
role was to chronicle the voyage of the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh,
the ship that found the Titanic, and the efforts of the British
team, code-named ``Orca,'' to bring back the gold.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably Hamilton-Paterson's friend realized the writer would
not turn in a routine journalistic account of the trip, a work of
direct reportage; some of the others aboard, British and Russians
alike, probably didn't realize how they would figure in an offbeat
masterpiece by a writer who as unpredictable as his subjects, which
are nature and human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Miles Down'' is a work of history, of science, of
observation, of reflection; it is a narrative of adventure and an
explosion of thought and feeling _ exciting, unsettling, amusing,
and profound, often all at once. Before it is over, we journey with
the writer to a place few men have been before; it is an underwater
landscape, but it also carries us to some kind of center, as in
meditation.
</P>
<P>
   The history comes from the research carried out by the Orca team
on the final fatal voyages of the submarine and the troop ship;
these have all the excitement of an old-time war movie, but without
the romance _ there's nothing romantic about how men die in a
torpedoed submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The science comes through Hamilton-Paterson's fascination with
the ocean, its facts, its mysteries. Everything that occurs on the
sea is a kind of miracle; landlubbers, he writes, ``don't know in
their bones that the sea has no plans, that we don't belong here,
that every additional day successully spent afloat is a blessing.''
Science is most vividly represented in the work of the Russian
oceanographers aboard the Akademik Keldysh, including the great
Anatoly Sagalevitch, who invented the submersibles that can
withstand the pressure of water 3 miles deep on top of them.
Sagalevitch, an ironist worthy of a place in Turgenev, finds
himself in the position of hiring his invention out for commercial
purposes, fitting his own scientific interests and pursuits around
the edges of the journey. ``The quest for gold ingots has a certain
narrative suspense, but it is of no real interest compared to
biology or meteorology,'' the scientists believe.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure is the search for the gold _ will the Orca team
find it? will they be able to bring it up? An air of romance still
surrounds this quest, because deep salvage is an expensive and
risky operation _ Hamilton-Paterson points out that ``the business
of recovery is as specialized in its way as that of space
exploration, much more dangerous, and very nearly as expensive.''
Not all the dangers are underwater; the legal complications are
extraordinary. At all costs, for example, the Orca team wants to
avoid having the troop ship declared a war grave by the British
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in a modern salvage operation like this,''
Hamilton-Paterson observes, ``the central factor is not the gold at
all but the personalities involved. It is easy to center one's
attention on the technology: the dazzling science, precision tools,
electronic wizardry. But underneath are critical chains of command,
leadership issues, differences of opinion, alliances and
animosities which outweigh everything else. High stakes produce
high tension.'' So the drama of ``Three Miles Down'' becomes a
drama of character, a comedy of mixed and conflicting motives, of
language barriers, of functioning and dysfunctional technology, as
well a tragedy of irreconcilable goals. The American edition omits
several pages of color photographs that appeared in the original
British publication, photos that make these people visible;
Hamilton-Paterson's writing makes them real, and understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton-Paterson not only sees, records, and understands
everything before him; he feels it. ``Suddenly everything about
this enterprise, this chain of events which had its roots so long
ago, afloat on this ocean, seems trivial. The boundless waste of
human intelligence in war, the waste of lives and loves and time;
the futility of power; the sense that gold itself is no more than
compressed emptiness, a locus of dreams. All this contributes to a
melancholy which is never far away on this voyage, hanging like
dark smoke just over the horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the book is Hamilton-Paterson's own journey to
the ocean floor, his account of an experience few have had, of a
place few have seen. The writing here is as prosaic as a bathroom,
but at the same time, the matter-of-fact achieves the sublime.
Hamilton-Paterson is close to something primordial, to the engines
of creation; in writing about it, he comes as close to reverence as
any modern writer is going to get. By the end, the narrative of the
search for gold still interests us, but we don't really care how it
comes out because Hamilton-Paterson has engaged us on another level
of consciousness, and reawakened and renewed our sense of wonder.

MANY DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Photography is fast revolutionizing the world of home
computers, and PCs are fast becoming a basic staple of amateur
photography. People are using the technology to get better pictures
faster, and to get them for less money than conventional
photography methods.
</P>
<P>
   A friend drove this point home to me over Memorial Day weekend.
We were having dinner when he took out a photograph of himself and
his family. The picture, he told me, had been taken by his father
the day before with a digital camera and printed on an inkjet
printer using special photo-quality paper. The picture looked
great. ``It takes 10 minutes to print the picture, but who cares?''
he enthused.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to making great pictures with your computer _ besides
knowing when to press the shutter button _ is having a camera that
can take a fairly high-resolution image and using good paper in
your color inkjet. It also helps keep track of your photographs:
after all, what good is an award-winning photograph if you can't
find it?
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of a digital image refers to the number of pixels
used to create the photograph. A few years ago, a typical
resolution was 320 pixels across and 240 pixels high.
Unfortunately, while that is good enough for a photo on a Web page,
that same picture is likely to look blurry or pixilated when
displayed full size on a computer screen or printed. For a
good-looking picture, you want at least 640x480 _ a full-sized
picture on a 14-inch computer screen _ or higher resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Higher resolution images look better than their low-resolution
counterparts because they contain more information. Unfortunately,
this additional information takes longer to transfer from the
camera to the computer, takes up more space on your computer's hard
drive, and is slower for your machine to manipulate.
Higher-resolution cameras also cost more than low-resolution ones,
because they need a more expensive sensor and more memory to store
the images.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago I looked at two high-priced digital cameras
from Kodak. Both took high-resolution images (up to 1024x1536), but
they cost between $700 and $1,000. That's too much money for most
people.
</P>
<P>
   An exciting camera at the low end of the price spectrum is
Polaroid's new PDC700. The compact camera has an impressive
1024x768 resolution, a built-in flash, and costs just $300. The
camera has both an internal 4 megabyte memory card (enough for
between 20 and 40 images) and a slot for a compact flash module,
which you can load into your camera like a piece of electronic
``film.'' And unlike other low-end cameras, the Polaroid has both a
viewfinder and a small LCD panel on the back for looking at them
afterward: If you don't like the picture, you can delete it.
</P>
<P>
   Like other digital cameras, two problems with the Polaroid are
short battery life _ the camera requires AA batteries that are
fully-charged, and it quickly drains them _ and no lens cap. If you
don't use rechargeable batteries, you might spend $3 or $4 for each
set of 20 photographs you take. And after a few years of heavy use,
the lens might get so scratched it can't take decent photos.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting alternative to digital photography is Kodak's
Advantix Film Drive ($350). The Film Drive is a desktop scanner
that takes a roll of developed APS film (that new cartridge film
that is slowly replacing 35mm). With the provided software you can
preview your entire roll, find a picture you want, and then
transfer a specific image into your computer.
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage of the Film Drive is that today's APS cameras
are much easier to use than their digital brethren: The batteries
in film cameras last months, rather than hours; APS film cameras
are smaller, lighter, and more rugged; film cameras generally have
better optics; film takes richer pictures; and film has incredibly
high resolution. When you digitize it, you can choose a picture
that is 875x500 pixels, 1750x1000, or 2625x1500.
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage of film cameras is cost and speed. A
40-exposure roll of APS film costs about $7; add another $7 to $14
for processing. That's nearly five times the price of batteries for
the Polaroid camera. And unlike digital cameras, which make your
images available instantly, APS film must be developed _ so add a
few more hours.
</P>
<P>
   One issue photographers have had to deal with for generations is
how to store their pictures. For $8, you can buy a plastic APS film
storage box that neatly holds 12 rolls of film along with their
index prints.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid's camera comes with a program called PhotoMax that lets
you download images from the camera, save them in JPEG files, and
then organize the files into electronic albums. I don't really like
Polaroid's software. It's slow and a bit awkward to use. It would
really bog down if I had a thousand electronic images.
</P>
<P>
   My two big complaints with this digital stuff are interfaces and
code quality. The Polaroid camera connects to the PC with a slow
serial interface; the Kodak Advantix uses the parallel port.
Instead, both of these machines should be using the high-speed
Universal Serial Bus, which is faster, more reliable, and which
would also let these devices be used with Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is the programs that control the hardware.
Although both Kodak and Polaroid have spent a lot of money
developing software with flashy graphics and slick interfaces, the
programs themselves are awkward to use and crash from time to time.
Most people I know would prefer to use software that is simpler,
faster, and more reliable.

CRUSADER'S MESSAGE OBSCURED BY HIS STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ He was not exactly a household word, at least
not until February when the media picked up the story of Anthony
Porter, a man who was sprung after 17 years on death row. One of
his first acts of freedom was to embrace the Northwestern
University journalism professor who _ along with his students _
unearthed the evidence that Porter was slated to die for murders he
didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, David Protess has been inundated with roughly 2,000
emails, letters, and phone calls from prisoners, advocacy groups,
and clergy seeking his help in righting similar wrongs. The media
have descended upon him, Hollywood is abuzz with story ideas, and
maintaining his privacy has become a problem. From his newfound
bully pulpit, Protess criticizes ``corporate journalism'' for not
pursuing the kind of truth-seeking that has made him famous.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year old Brooklyn native has been working to reverse
``wrongful conviction'' cases since he was at Chicago Lawyer
magazine in the 1980s. (By his count, Porter represents his eighth
successful effort. Another one of his class projects, death row
prisoner Aaron Patterson, is currently awaiting a state Supreme
Court hearing and Protess is ``positive Aaron Patterson is going to
get relief.'')
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, Protess has turned his once traditional
investigative journalism class into a real-life detective drama. As
the syllabus for his C73 Investigative Journalism Class states,
``we will use advanced reporting methods . . . to investigate
evidence of real world miscarriages of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I believe we ought to be doing in journalism
is teaching how inspirational this profession is,'' says Ken Bode,
Dean of Northwestern's Medill Journalism School, when asked about
Protess.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Protess is unveiling The Center for Wrongful
Convictions, which will be connected to both Medill and the law
school. Once his journalism students unearth evidence of a
miscarriage of justice, the case will go to the law school ``to
bring it to the attention of the courts,'' he says. There will also
be a parallel effort to get these stories on the media radar
screen, since as Protess puts it, ``the truth not only has to be
found, it has to be told.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Protess takes a somewhat disapproving view of much of
modern journalism. (He tells reporters seeking an interview with
him that their time is better spent looking to unearth an
injustice.) He sees an industry beleaguered by ``corporate
journalism'' which he defines as ``decisions about allocations of
resources . . . based on the bottom line instead of on the need to
find the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he cringes at the idea that he is more activist than
journalist. When asked whether he is anti-death penalty, Protess
says his personal views are ``irrelevant. . . . For me, the issue
is `are we putting innocent people on death row?' which is an
empirical question. That is an issue that trancends ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one piece of popular Protess mythology that he says
originated in a 1996 People magazine profile. The story goes that
the foundation for his future career was laid when he read about
the executions of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg _ for spying for the
Soviets _ as a 7-year old in 1953. Protess says he felt sympathy
for the Rosenbergs' two young children, but denies the episode
``was a defining moment in my life. . . . I'm not even sure it was
a wrongful conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Protess actually gravitated toward investigative reporting
during the Watergate era when he was a political science professor
at Loyola University. ``It seemed like journalists were shaping
public consciousness about the issues of the day,'' he says. ``Here
I was standing in front of the class.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late '70s and early '80s, he worked at a Chicago civic
watchdog group, the Better Government Association, which aided two
infamous and controversial Chicago Sun-Times' undercover
investigations _ the infiltration of unscrupulous abortion clinics
and the Mirage bar, which the paper bought and operated to ensnare
local officials engaging in routine corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a rush when you hold a political official
accountable,'' says Protess. But he began to tire of the pursuit of
official misconduct, noting it simply reinforced the idea that
``the system isn't working'' and felt like ``just slinging mud.''
Once he channeled his energy into wrongful conviction cases, he
says, ``I had this tremendous sense of satisfaction'' _ of ``saving
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Protess now sees himself as a victim of his success,
saying the ``fun ended'' the day Porter marched out of jail. His
class was disrupted, demands on his time grew, the media hordes
invaded, and he became stressed out. Protess wants and needs the
spotlight to turn his investigations into ``a public education
experience.'' But the double-edged sword of media attention is
frustrating him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not uncomfortable with the amount of publicity,'' he says.
``I'm uncomfortable with the focus. . . . We're not the story.''
Both his admirers and detractors might debate that point.

   In a coup for Newsweek, Anna Quindlen _ who gained fame as the
voice of baby boomer feminism on The New York Times' op-ed pages in
the early '90s 90's before becoming a successful novelist _ will

columnist in October. Her journalistic comeback will likely to
provide readers with a distinctly different worldview than her

   You can chalk Medill Dean Ken Bode off the list of potential
hopefuls to succeed Marvin Kalb as director of the Kennedy School

says Bode, who is preparing to break ground on a major public
affairs facility at Medill and who couldn't wait for a Harvard
decision in the fall.

DESERVEDLY IN THE DOGHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I came home to find a notice from the dog officer on my door. It
read: ``CRUELTY INVESTIGATION. 10:45 _ 5/29/99 _ Dog left in car _
No water _ Windows up. VIOLATION OF THE LEASH LAW. Numerous
complaints from neighbors. Dog is loose constantly in
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   I knew what the cruelty to animals charge was about. I'd driven
to exercise class that morning. The sky had been overcast; rain was
predicted. It was cool enough so that I was wearing a light jacket,
but when I came out of the building after my one-hour class, I
noticed that the sun had come out and hurried to the car to check
on the dog. The woman who'd called the dog officer had the courage
to tell me she'd reported me, and to point out that the dog had
pooped in my car. Pandy did look pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't surprised. After eating a cake intended to feed 30
people, the dog had done nothing but poop and vomit for three long
days and nights, with such a demoralizing effect that Pandy could
have been cited for cruelty to humans. I'd brought her with me for
humanitarian reasons _ she was so miserable, I didn't want to leave
her home alone.
</P>
<P>
   And now here I was, being cited as a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   It was also true that I'd been running late and even though the
temperature was below 70 degrees, I'd been negligent in not opening
a car window. As for the water, if there had been any, Pandy would
have spilled it. When she's been in the car a while, I bring her
water and let her drink it outside on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   This is an example of how my mind was working: I have been bad.
I'm not so bad. Yes, I am. Well, maybe a little bad. Waves of
annoyance and resentment alternated with waves of shame and guilt.
I felt awful.
</P>
<P>
   Our anonymous neighbor's complaints came as a surprise, though
they shouldn't have. All spring Jack and I have been working in our
unfenced yard, only minimally aware of whether Pandy was in or out.
When I put the dog outside alone, I always attach her to a run in
our yard, but there had been several occasions this spring when I'd
said, ``Jack, where's the dog?'' only to discover she was still
outside without our having noticed her absence. I also knew Pandy
was stealing toys from a neighbor's dog, and early this spring,
after a conversation with the dog's mom, I'd filled a grocery bag
with dog toys and delivered them as a peace offering. I know now
that a state of peace between us and the neighbors was a figment of
my imagination.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question: We were entirely at fault for not obeying
the law and keeping Pandy on a leash at all times, though for the
life of me I still can't figure out how to keep Pandy from slipping
out when people walk in and out of our house. We're bad. Maybe not
so bad. Just a little bad. Here I go again. Perhaps, I thought,
people as disorganized and inattentive as I am shouldn't have dogs
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   What would life be like without the dog? No more hair on every
surface in our house, no more fleas, no more waking with the weight
of a 60-pound dog on my feet, no more veterinary fees, no more dog
sitters, no more 24-hour-a-day responsibility for another life.
Then I thought of lonely car rides, hikes in Vermont with only
human company, the loss of Pandy's warmth in our bed, an end to
early morning remember-me-I'm-ready-for-breakfast kisses. You make
a lifelong commitment when you adopt a dog, even if that dog can
feel like a mixed blessing if your name shows up in your local
newspaper's police log.
</P>
<P>
   I'm actually grateful that some woman cared enough about my dog
to report me. I like busybodies. I should. I am one, dropping
warnings about pesticides into people's mailboxes, slipping
reminders of the anti-idling law under violators' windshield
wipers. I believe we are each other's keepers, though I admit I
would have preferred a note on my windshield to a citation from the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is one merit of living in a small town. If I'm any
example, human nature is so seriously flawed that we occasionally
need other folks looking over our shoulder who will remind us of
our responsibilities. Although it may be disconcerting to be nudged
in the right direction when your attention wanders, it is also true
that chastisement is one of the ways a community shows that it
cares.
</P>
<P>
   To fiddle with the title of a sermon on Christians at our
Baptist church: Citizens aren't wrinkle-free. We all need pressing.

A SPECIAL EDITION OF THE FUN-LOVING MIATA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tenets of most religions include at least two shared and
powerful notions: rebirth and revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the House of the Two-Seat Sports Coupe, whose flock
declined through the 1960s, '70s and '80s, but for whom rebirth and
revelation came in 1989 at the Chicago Auto Show. For that is when
Mazda introduced the Miata, and affordable, two-passenger ragtops
became all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 10 years later, more than 500,000 Miatas have been
produced (half of them for the US market), and auto manufacturers
in Europe, America, and Japan continue to play catch-up in this
nifty little niche market.
</P>
<P>
   That is because, down the decade, the Miata has proved to be
just what its builder promised it would be: affordable, reliable,
and, most of all, fun. There are more than 30,000 members of the
Miata Club of America. Web sites for Miata enthusiasts abound.
</P>
<P>
   Drive the Miata and you are reaching back in time to the old
days of feel-every-bit-of-the-road sports car touring: snapping
through corners as you sit low in the seat, upshifting and
downshifting to translate power into control and control into
power, waving to other top-down enthusiasts as you meet them on the
road. It's like the old days and the best of the MGs _ without the
shaky wiring of Lucas, Prince of Darkness.
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate the success of this little sports car, Miata has
produced the 1999 Tenth Anniversary Editon, a sapphire blue coupe
with a light blue top and blue tonneau cover.
</P>
<P>
   It is easily recognized by Miata enthusiasts and will stay that
way because only 7,500 of them will be produced _ 3,000 of which
are for US sale. It has a lot of nice little touches that set it
apart from the 1999 MX-5, but with the 140-horsepower engine at its
heart, it is virtually the same automobile.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 body style is more muscular looking than past Miatas.
There is a pumped up look to the slightly bulging front fenders _ a
look that continues back through the door lines, which rise from
door to curved rear fenders. The raised lip on the trailing edge of
the trunk adds to the look.
</P>
<P>
   What the 10th Anniversary Edition has that the others don't is a
six-speed transmission, a delightful and snappy addition since the
car has only 119 lbs./ft. of torque and the extra gears,
particularly on the highway, keep it peppy moving through traffic.
Fourth, fifth, and sixth, used judiciously while commuting in
heavy, fast traffic on Interstate 93, are a useful combo.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, straight-line commuting (with some traffic weave
thrown in) is not the aim of most sports car manufacturers.
Handling and corners are.
</P>
<P>
   This special edition is set up as one stiff car for this
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   It has a Torsen limited slip differential, Billstein shocks, a
strut tower brace in the front for added stiffness, four-wheel
double wishbone suspension, rack-and-pinion steering, and
four-wheel disc brakes.
</P>
<P>
   What this gives you is a stiff but sure ride.
</P>
<P>
   Rip into a corner and you feel its pull in a way you don't in,
say, the BMW M Coupe. That is because nothing is being controlled
by computer to make your drive easier. The driver defines the edge
in the Miata.
</P>
<P>
   Oversteer, understeer, too much gas, too much brake _ they are
all up to you to fix.
</P>
<P>
   Discover, midway through the tight curve, that the road is not
perfect _ a crack here, a bump there _ and you get that familiar
hop, shake, rattle, or skip you might remember from the old days.
It's up to you to correct for it.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes driving this car fun, and you can see why
people are so attached to their Miatas.
</P>
<P>
   In the cockpit, all is simplicity. Five analog gauges are
packaged tightly behind the steering wheel. Wipers and lights are
on stems jutting from the steering column. Sound system and heat
controls are in the center of the dash.
</P>
<P>
   The special edition features two-tone leather and suede seats, a
high performance Bose music system, cruise control, power windows
and door locks, power mirrors, and a power antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's a collector car, a special badge on the driver's
side front fender gives it a serial number and also its own number
among the 7,500 to be built. This car was number 1744.
</P>
<P>
   These 10th Anniversary Editions will surely find their place in
the loyal congregation that is the cult of Miata, a gathering where
Web sites offer essays and odes to the car and fictional goddesses
write of their Miata experiences; where kinks and complaints and
tips are shared by Miata owners; where debates rage on color,
engine power, and Miata etiquette. There is, for instance, a Save
the Wave campaign that urges Miata owners to follow two rules when
encountering each other on the road: 1. Wave or flash headlights
and 2. Smile.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting debates on the Web is a debate over
power. This is, after all, no rip the road, roaring little car. It
is adequately powered and fun and that is what it was meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the supercharger and turbocharger backers get their say, as
do proponents of a rotary engine for the Miata. One Web poll found
11 percent backing turbo- or superchargers; nearly half supporting
more power, but only through normal aspiration. And significantly,
a quarter said, ``Leave it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want more power, get a different car,'' wrote one
respondent.
</P>
<P>
   `` '99 Mazdas rock, right out of the box,'' chimed another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about power; it's about fun,'' concluded a third.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a conclusion I agree with. This car was designed to
be a bit of a throwback (with modern reliability thrown in) and the
manufacturer ought to keep it that way. There are plenty of
aftermarket solutions for those who want more kick to their Miata,
and any move by the manufacturer to significantly pep up this car
would surely result in a much higher cost than the $20,000 base for
the regular 1999 Miata. The 10th Anniversary Edition, for instance,
is $8,000 higher than that, and a more powerful engine would not
only add to the cost, but so would the costs of the upgraded
suspension that would be needed to handle the extra power.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --I've never seen a manual convertible top that is so simple
(two quick clicks, no pulling and tugging) to put up and down.
</P>
<P>
   --The die-cast model of your special edition Miata, the key
ring, and the his-and-hers 10th Anniversary Miata Seiko watches
that come with this limited edition.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --I know it's limited and will be snapped up by collectors, but
$28,000-plus is getting away from the original purpose of the
Miata.
</P>
<P>
   --The rattling that the convertible top makes once it is stored
behind the rear seats.

CLAPTON AUCTIONING OFF GUITARS TO FUND REHAB CENTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The residential rehab center Eric Clapton is
funding on the West Indies island of Antigua is apparently turning
into something of a financial drain on the legendary guitar
slinger.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clapton is auctioning off 100 stage and studio guitars,
including Brownie, the famous 1956 Fender Stratocaster he used for
the ``Layla'' sessions, as well as a rare 1958 Gibson Explorer, a
1974 Martin 000-28 steel string, a 1959 Gibson ES-335, a 1952
Fender Telecaster and a 1956 Gibson ES-350TN, in order to fund the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Brownie, for example, is expected to fetch $80,000 to $100,000
at auction Thursday at Christie's in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Selected highlights from the collection were on display last
weekend at the Beverly Hills auction house.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange and frustrating feeling wandering through the
exhibit. Although only a couple of guitars were behind glass, the
last thing you were encouraged to do was touch the instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, some worry wart was loudly complaining that visitors were
getting too close to the precious Gibsons and Fenders, and the
velvet ropes would arrive the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   It was frustrating because you so badly wanted to play some of
the 40 rare instruments, especially the magnificent '52 Tele or the
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Clapton, 54, says the idea to sell the guitars came from a
member of the Crossroad Centre's fund-raising committee. The
auction is expected to earn around $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clapton wrote in the catalog that it wasn't an easy thing to say
goodbye to these guitars, ``but it's time to let others share in
these beautiful things that have given me such joy and brought such
meaning to my life.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 36-bed Antigua center, which Clapton founded last
year, is apparently not treating very many rich patients from
overseas. Instead, islanders are taking advantage of Crossroad's
free medical care for Caribbean residents, on Clapton's dime.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well, at least some lucky folks are going to get a dose of
the restorative powers of fine guitars when the auction closes.

PLENTY OF SIZZLE AT ITALIAN CAR DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say the names out loud:
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   Maserati.
</P>
<P>
   Lamborghini.
</P>
<P>
   Alfa Romeo.
</P>
<P>
   There is something evocative just in their sound.
</P>
<P>
   Now picture a couple hundred of them arrayed on a sprawling lawn
on a hot Sunday in June with a few thousand auto enthusiasts
milling about. You could call it an auto show. I prefer to call it
an art exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The event was the Tutto Italiano, the fourth annual Italian Car
Day Lawn Show at the Museum of Transportation in Brookline, Mass.,
and, owing to the presence of so many Ferraris, the dominant color
was red.
</P>
<P>
   So much red on all that green lawn. So many cool curves of
fender, curls of chrome, sharp edges, gentle rises. And that's only
on the outside. Inside, all that leather arrayed like fine
furniture, instrumentation like fancy watches, handles and knobs
and switches gleaming like expensive kitchen gadgets. So much art.
</P>
<P>
   And none of this by accident, because this is, after all, what
the designers of Italian autos do. Producing formidable power and
handling is left to the engineers; the designers are mandated to
produce works of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aesthetics mean a lot to them,'' says Neal Heffron, a
Brookline collector who, with wife Susan, owns two Ferraris and an
Alpha Romeo.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, when you look at a Ferrari or Maserati that you
just know will sizzle out on the pavement, you also get the sense
you are looking at something more. It might be the feeling you get
when looking at sculpted leather chairs from Design Centro Italia,
or cutlery from Firenze.
</P>
<P>
   On a tour of Ford design headquarters last month, Jac Nasser,
the Ford's chief executive, was heard by a Wall Street Journal
reporter telling his designers that he wanted them to know what the
furniture in Americans' homes looks like; what their kitchen
appliances look like.
</P>
<P>
   And that is precisely the point that Italian designers latched
onto years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Nuccio Bertone designed his first Alfa Romeo, he was
referred to not as a designer, but as a coachbuilder.
</P>
<P>
   Battista Farina, born in 1893 in Turin, Italy, designed his
first car at 17 _ the Fiat Zero. At 27 years old, the childhood
nickname ``Pinin'' having stuck, he turned down Henry Ford's offer
to go to work in Detroit and instead teamed up in Italy with
Vincenzo Lancia.
</P>
<P>
   Today, under the tag Pininfarina, you see the results of this
late artist's works everywhere _ most notably, of course, on
Ferraris. But the name Pininfarina, Heffron points out, is also now
associated with even pens and chairs.
</P>
<P>
   When you think style and think Italian, you can relate the
thought to furniture, clothes, shoes, neckties _ and superbly
designed sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   Walking the lawn at Brookline last week, it was hard not to be
struck by how many elements of all that Italian craftsmanship have
shown up down the years on other autos.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the 1964 Alpha Romeo Zagato Milano. With its sloping
hood and slightly clipped rear, it reminds you of the Nissan Z. And
then you notice, on the front quarterpanel just behind the wheel
well, the big Z. Curious.
</P>
<P>
   Noses and tails and grilles and fender lines and so many of them
make you wonder: Where else have I seen this?
</P>
<P>
   Picture a 1999 Corvette convertible, the lowest and sleekest
model yet. Now picture it beside a 1999 Ferrari F355 Spider.
</P>
<P>
   (If you want to play this game, pick up the June 1999 issue of
duPont Registry in the auto section at your nearest magazine rack).
</P>
<P>
   Compare any of the latest models of the Accura NXS with the 1999
Ferrari F355 TB.
</P>
<P>
   The 1985 Maserati Quattroporte? Picture the formerly sharp-edge,
chunky Audis before their rounding off.
</P>
<P>
   Go back in time even more and think of early 1960s Lincolns and
Buicks. Then stroll across the lawn to see the 1961 325 Dual-Ghia.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fun game to play: Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
</P>
<P>
   And it has its surprises.
</P>
<P>
   In what evidence suggests may have been a reverse derivation
there is the 1963 Maserti 3500, looking remarkably like the 1957
Ford Thunderbird.
</P>
<P>
   Did those bulbous fenders on the 1968 Alpha Romeo T33 Stradale
(the latter term meaning ``street'' as in this is a race car made
street legal) influence, say, designers of the new Audi TT or the
Dodge Viper GTS?
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Battista ``Pinin'' Farina must be chuckling.

CONFEREES GET A BARGAIN ON PERSONAL ORGANIZER

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sun Microsystems' JavaOne conference features
rooms full of computers with enough processing power to compile,
sort, collate and analyze every available piece of data on your
life, and use it to compute your life expectancy to the nanosecond.
</P>
<P>
   But the real hit of the show that opened Wednesday in San
Francisco was 3Com's Palm V, on sale to conference attendees for
$200, less than half the suggested retail price of $450.

   More than 10,000 Palm Vs have sold since the conference began
Tuesday, according to Curtis Sasaki, a director of product
marketing for Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The conference for Java developers kicked off with the
announcement that 3Com had licensed Java, a programming language
that runs on many different kinds of computer systems, for use in
its Palm Computing line of hand-held organizers. The Java II Micro
edition is aimed at the consumer electronics market, for products
like the Palm personal organizers and other small electronic
devices, including smart mobile phones to pocket-sized computers.
</P>
<P>
   The fire sale on the Palm V had a not-so-hidden agenda promoting
3Com's corporate purposes. By offering Java developers an
apparently irresistible discount on the Palm V, it hoped to get
more of them excited about developing software that runs on the new
Java II Micro edition platform.
</P>
<P>
   Like a personal computer or a home video game console, the Palm
V lives and dies on the strength of the software that developers
create for it. The theory is that putting the device into
consumers' hands _ and giving them their first peek at the Java II
Micro edition _ will get them to embrace 3Com's vision of the
device's potential.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, judging from both the buzz on the show floor and the
pace of sales, the strategy is working beyond expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not everyone was agog over the Palm V. David Smith of Rhode
Island-based American Power Conversion said that it seemed nice,
but he'd never really used a pocket organizer before.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a bargain at half the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't like it, I'll sell it to someone,'' he said, with a
shrug.

`SOCIAL CLUB' CATCHES THE VITALITY OF AFRO-CUBAN MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Buena Vista Social Club'' communicates the rapture of Ry
Cooder over the bubbling fusion of Afro-Cuban music in a single
scene. The camera tracks across a field to where Cooder sits on a
concrete abutment, which seems to be deteriorating before our eyes.
His head is down, down, he's puffing on one of Havana's finest
smokes, his eyes are closed and his head nods to a lovely, rhythmic
throb. As the camera closes in and enters the area, we see a
bassist and percussionist at work, slapping out a beguiling and
elegant beat. That's just one instance in which ``Buena Vista
Social Club'' shows that it's steeped in a sense of pleasure that
is rare in documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many documentary films about music have the earnest and
lifeless feel of the CD ``Buena Vista Social Club,'' for which
producer Cooder assembled the group of Cuban musical all-stars a
couple of years ago. The CD has the well-meaning drabness of an
archaeologist rebuilding a lost civilization _ an inability to get
across what attracted him to this stuff in the first place. But the
movie, directed by Wim Wenders, lets these robust, vital men, who
proudly bear in their faces the experience of having survived Cuba,
tell their own stories. As they explain how they work _ watching
the stylish old smoothie, vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer, chat is like
seeing a king restored to his natural place in the world _ and
their pleasure in jamming with each other is in evidence, we can
see why Cooder was drawn to them. That his affection for their
talents isn't the slightly patronizing notion of an archivist out
to commit their performances to tape for posterity. These cats are
the joint!
</P>
<P>
   Cooder, a superb musician in his own right, has a large,
camera-ready head that looks like it's struck for the side of a
coin. He's scored several films on his own, and unfortunately some
of the best of his music _ like his work on Walter Hill's
``Southern Comfort'' and the incidental score for ``Hearts of
Fire'' _ has never been released. He and Wenders have worked
together in the past, too. (Seek out the wonderful ``Paris, Texas''
soundtrack.) Unlike much of director Wenders' previous work,
``Social Club'' has the full-bodied zest of a director in love with
his subject.
</P>
<P>
   Wenders also displays an ease and authority, getting a warmth
and intimacy from the digital video cameras he used to shoot the
film that exploits what might be limits of the technology in the
hands of others. The mobility of the equipment makes the film light
on its feet, almost athletic. Nowhere is this kinetic aplomb more
apparent than in a sequence featuring a jam in a rotting hotel
ballroom as young dancers bounce around. The scene is simply
mesmerizing. The film ends with a triumphant session filmed in New
York, and ``Buena Vista Social Club'' is such a powerful and
involving film that it will make you rethink the musty good will of
the CD.

DIVORCED PARENTS CAN HELP KIDS ENJOY VACATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (First of two parts.)
</P>
<P>
   For children whose divorced or separated parent doesn't live
nearby, summer can loom large. Whether they are two or 12, and even
if they are excited about seeing a far-away parent, they feel the
stress of change. For them, the most successful vacation visit
focuses on what they are capable of handling rather than on a
parent's need or a legal agreement.
</P>
<P>
   For the parents, this is no small order.
</P>
<P>
   It means that the distant parent who's dying to spend time with
his kids may have to settle for a shorter vacation than he wants or
one that isn't even on his turf, keeping the big picture in mind
rather than seeking short-term gratification. For the primary
parent, it means encouraging collaboration all year long and
tolerating flexibility around the vacation itself, including having
your ex-spouse on your territory.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sheehy of Hingham, Mass. and her ex-husband, Steve, who
lives in Seattle, could be the poster parents of how it can work.
</P>
<P>
   Susan moved from the West to the East Coast when their son,
John, was 4 1/2, two years after the divorce. In that first year of
transcontinental parenting, Steve would come east three or four
times a year to stay with friends or in a hotel and see John during
the day. In the second year, John went to Seattle, but only after
his father came here first, refreshing their collective memory of
what it was like to be together and then flying with him in both
directions. It was costly financially, says Steve, but worth it
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of this was intuitive, believe me,'' he says. ``It just
seemed to make good sense for John. That's really all you can think
about. Neither Sue nor I wanted to do anything that would be too
disruptive for him.''
</P>
<P>
   With children 5 and under, that's key. Young children miss home
and routine sooner and with more intensity than we realize, says
psychotherapist Isolini Ricci, who heads the office of family court
services for the Family Court System of California.
</P>
<P>
   It's because they don't have the cognitive ability to hold two
different thoughts at once. ``They're immediate, concrete thinkers:
`If I can't see it, it's not there.' A 3-year-old knows there's a
mom, but if Mom isn't there, she's lost her anchor,'' she says.
That, along with changes in routines and unfamiliarity with the
physical place, can be so stressful for the 2- to 5-year-old that
Ricci does not even recommend an overnight visit with a parent a
child sees only infrequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you have a very sturdy child who is not only confident
in himself but can express feelings clearly _ and kids like this
are rare _ my recommendation is for the parent to come to the
child's town and spend a few days with him there. Even an overnight
at the hotel should be at his initiation, not yours: `Daddy, I want
to sleep with you!' '' she says. Ricci is author of an excellent
book for divorced parents, ``Mom's House, Dad's House (Revised
Edition)'' (Fireside Books).
</P>
<P>
   While this arrangement can be hard on a distant parent and even
harder on grandparents and relatives, don't take it personally,
says psychologist Carol Philpot of Florida Institute of Technology,
a specialist in issues of divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a reflection on you or on whether a child loves
you,'' she says. Even if you see your children three or four times
a year, she tells parents to expect to start each visit from
scratch. ``Children can be slow to warm up,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   If a child winces at your kiss or withers at your hug, it can be
incredibly hurtful, of course. But Philpot says if you push a child
of any age to accept your affection, she'll shut down. On the other
hand, if you offer no sign of affection, she may think you don't
love her. The solution is to tell her how you feel _ ``I'm so happy
to see you, I'd love to give you a hug and kiss!'' _ and ask
permission: ``Do you think that's OK, or would you rather I wait a
while?'' If she wants to wait, ask later in a playful kind of way:
``Any chance for that hug now?''
</P>
<P>
   It's through behavior that young children will likely show that
they're ready, perhaps snuggling closer as you read a book. ``If
you put your arm around her and she doesn't shrug it off, you're
golden,'' says Philpot.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The older child
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The older child poses different challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime between 5 and 7, evolving cognition makes him better
able to connect his two worlds and tolerate being uprooted from his
primary home. Nonetheless, Ricci would wait for his initiation _
``I want to stay at your house!'' _ and keep visits short. John
Sheehy, for instance, at first spent only a week in Seattle,
gradually stretching it as he got older, until he was there six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Between 8 and 12, expect a child to want more to say about the
vacation, not just what you do but how long it is. Three years ago,
when John was 11, he no longer wanted to go for six weeks
altogether. He missed his friends. So he split his visit between
June and August. He'll do that again this year and take a friend
for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Steve can cope. ``It's not that I don't get jealous (of time not
spent with me),'' he says. ``But I'm glad he's comfortable enough
to bring friends. It's normal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal'' is an important operative word.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Anthony E. Wolf urges parents not to get caught up
in entertaining a visiting child. ``It sets up false expectations
and gets in the way of having a relationship that is nurturing and
close,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The more normal the activities, the better, especially at the
onset of the visit, including things like grocery shopping. Ricci
recommends walking the neighborhood together, not just to reorient
your child, but also to renegotiate boundaries, which may need to
change in response to increased maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal'' also refers to behavior. ``When children are with you
for a day or two, they can be on their best behavior; it's more
like they are a guest. When they are with you for an extended
period, however, you get the real thing, from sibling squabbling to
noncompliance and defiance,'' says Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   When there's behavior you've never seen, it can throw a parent.
``Don't make it your mission to shape these kids up,'' he says.
``Set appropriate limits, accept that this is what's normal, and be
grateful they are comfortable enough to be themselves. That
conflict increases between you and your kids or between siblings is
not necessarily a bad thing at all.'' Wolf is author of ``Why did
you have to get a divorce? And when can I get a hamster?'' (Farrar,
Straus and Giroux).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Homesickness
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As normal as things may seem to you, homesickness may strike.
While this is more likely with a 5- to 7-year-old at the start of
the first long visit, it can also happen to an older child because
he's discombobulated from the strain of travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had kids tell me that when they first get to the
parent's, their `insides feel jumbled,' '' says Ricci. ``I tell
them it's what happens when you make a big change.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of empathetic response is good for a parent, too.
Equally important is the ability to tolerate calls to the other
parent: ``Not, `You want to call your mother again? but: `I bet it
feels good to talk to your mom,' '' says Philpot. Wolf, however,
suggests the call be made during the day rather than at bedtime
when a child is typically most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Not only should you facilitate your child calling his other
parent, but you should be calling, too, says Philpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the times when collaboration in the child's
interest is so important,'' she says. Whether your child is
homesick or acting out, brainstorming with the other parent can
make a big difference: Is this behavior typical? What will make him
feel more comforable?
</P>
<P>
   John Sheehy's parents talk throughout the year as well as when
he is in Seattle, but Sue remembers one call in particular when
John was 6 or 7. ``Steve called to tell me he thought John was
worried about me, about how I was doing and whether I was lonely,''
she says. That made her able to bring the subject up with John and
to reassure him. Without Steve's call, the topic might or might not
have gotten addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, when he was 8, John called and wanted to come
home. ``I asked if he had talked to his dad about it; I said he
needed to do that,'' says Sue. ``Once he did, he was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing it's OK to call the other parent is what will keep calls
to a minimum, says family therapist Suzanne Midori Hanna of the
University of Louisville, a specialist in custodial issues. But
it's not just phone calls or e-mail to the other parent that help;
Ricci says kids need to stay in touch with friends, too. John
Sheehy echoes the thought: ``I would tell another kid: Pick some
friends you want to stay in touch with so that when you get back
you aren't saying, `Whoa, when did that happen?!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's a veteran of summer stays with his dad, and
even though he's always glad to get back to his mom and his school
routine, John says he also always needs a little time to make the
transition back to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad to know I won't see my dad for a long time,'' he says.

   TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Even without a change in time zone, travel puts a strain on
children of all ages. Expect some fussiness as a result.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't assume children have the same likes and dislikes as the
last time you saw them. Ask: ``Do you still love pasta?''
</P>
<P>
   --Early in the vacation, go through photos from last year's
vacation together. It can speed the bonding.
</P>
<P>
   --If you've remarried, don't force the step-relationship, rather
allow it to develop at its own pace.
</P>
<P>
   --Help your children establish a network of friends in your
neighborhood.

THE IMMERSION METHOD OF CLEANING SILVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I'm looking for the formula for cleaning silver by the
immersion method. I think it has something to do with an aluminum
pan. Do you have it?
</P>
<P>
   E. J., Jamaica Plain, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure do. And the aluminum pan, please. Place the silver in
the pan. Each piece must touch the pan. Bring to a boil a solution
of one tablespoon baking soda in a quart of water. Pour this
near-boiling solution over the silver. After several minutes,
remove the silver, rinse, and wipe dry.
</P>
<P>
   Do not use this method on glued silverware; the solution will
melt the glue. And, if some of your silver is black in deep
crevices of the pattern, do not use this method. That black
oxidation is there for a purpose: to highlight the relief. If this
oxidation is removed, the silver will appear washed out and the
pattern hardly visible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You suggested putting plastic sheeting on the dirt floor of a
crawl space to prevent water vapor from coming through the ground
and into the crawl space. I understand the need to do this, but
what kind of plastic? Can it be walked on?
</P>
<P>
   DONALD LAMBERT, Concord, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   A. Use polyethylene plastic, 6 mil thick. The 6-mil plastic is
hard to find, so you can use 4-mil instead. You can walk on it,
carefully, but not if it is over crushed stone or any sharpish
objects. If it is torn, it defeats its purpose of blocking water
vapor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The saga of those big gaps between floorboards continues.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing, too, because D. Martin of Dedham, Mass. told
us how to fix those gaps, or at least disguise them.
</P>
<P>
   He writes: ``Another solution for gaps in hardwood floors which
worked beautifully on our dark floor was to use Dark 'n Rich liquid
paste wax. It is liquid enough to seep into the gaps, especially if
used in the winter when the gaps are most obvious. A thin coat
applied, rubbed in with a rag, then buffed has concealed the gaps
in our dark floor . . . This elminates relaying the floor or any
sanding!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it sure would, and why didn't the handyman think of that?
But the key to success here is the darkness of the floors. The wax
darkened the wood in the gaps, disguising them. And if you do have
a dark floor, the paste wax is not necessary; you can apply an
ordinary penetrating stain to the sides and bottoms of the gaps,
with a similar result.
</P>
<P>
   Such a trick may not work for a light-colored floor, but if the
gaps are lighter than the floor because they are bare wood, then
varnishing them may darken them enough to disguise them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, D. Martin. Your idea goes right into the handyman's
super electronic file for future reference.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've been having a discussion with friends, and have this to
ask: What are the stones on a tar-and-gravel roof for?
</P>
<P>
   WOODCHIPPER, Revere, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That's an easy one. The stones, called ballast, do two
things, which are closely related. It's a matter of protection. The
stones protect the tar underneath from the weather, and they
reflect heat, thus protecting the tar even further from getting too
hot and softening. The grit on asphalt shingles and roll roofing
does the same thing, in addition to providing the desired color.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am insulating my basement ceiling. Where does the vapor
barrier go? I'm also having a new burner installed. Can it be
vented through the side of the house, without a chimney?
</P>
<P>
   TED BRODERICK, Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The vapor barrier, usually kraft paper backing on fiberglass
insulation, goes paper-side up, toward the rooms above. And that
makes it difficult to hang. To do so, insert insulation hangers,
sharp-pointed wires between joists, spaced about 24 inches apart.
Some people have put the insulation in backward, paper-side down,
because it is easier to do. While this is ``wrong,'' it may not
cause any condensation damage.
</P>
<P>
   As for the side-venting burner, you can do it if the burner has
a power vent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I had a man apply a semitransparent stain on my
pressure-treated deck. Places where he sprayed the stain look light
and washed out. Where he had to brush on the stain, the color is
darker and better. Can I have more stain applied to even out that
color?
</P>
<P>
   LAURIE DIODATI, Hull, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The difference in color and intensity is a good example of
the inadequacy of spraying. Brushing is better, unless the spray is
a high-pressure one, which yours obviously was not.
</P>
<P>
   You could try having the stain brushed onto the light areas.
That might not work because even a thin layer of stain cannot be
recoated. If the new stain beads up on the old, you cannot do it.
If the new stain soaks in, then go ahead and brush it on.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the new stain does bead up, while you cannot restain
immediately, you can wait a year or so for the sprayed stain to
wear off; then you can restain. With a brush.
</P>

`LITTLE VOICE' :  HEAR HER SONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sometimes a film deserves a look despite its
failings. ``Little Voice,'' out on video this week, is one such
film. Michael Caine and Brenda Blethyn drew most of the critical
attention from the film, with Caine picking up a Golden Globe as
best supporting actor, though he was snubbed for an Oscar
nomination while Blethyn was nominated as best supporting actress
by the foreign press and the motion-picture academy.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason to watch ``Little Voice'' is for the performance
of the title character. Jane Horrocks is absolutely sensational as
Laura or Little Voice (``L.V.'') as she is known.
</P>
<P>
   The shy daughter of boozy, man-hungry Mari (Blethyn), L.V. has
been damaged by the death of her beloved father, and she escapes
into his beloved record collection, endlessly listening to female
vocalists like Judy Garland, Shirley Bassey and Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, L.V. has done more than listen; she has practically
channeled their performances so she can do note-for-note perfect
imitations. Garland and the others have become her voice.
</P>
<P>
   When a slimy theatrical agent, Ray (Caine), spots her talent
while on a romp with Mari, he sees dollars signs and a way out of
the small English coastal town he has been trapped in. ``Little
Voice's'' plot quickly becomes overwrought as Ray coaxes L.V. out
of her room to perform while Mari grows jealous. But whenever
Horrocks is on screen, you can overlook the sudsiness.
</P>
<P>
   And when she does sing, it's a revelation. For those of you who
haven't heard, those fabulous impressions are not a cinematic trick
but are by Horrocks, who first developed the character on stage in
Jim Cartwright's play, ``The Rise and Fall of Little Voice.''
</P>
<P>
   When L.V. eventually has her big night at a local club, and you
see Horrocks unleash her talent, you wish she really did have her
own stage show so you could buy tickets. What makes her performance
so interesting is that it goes beyond mere mimicry. While her
imitations of Garland and Billie Holiday are uncanny, she somehow
makes them her own. It becomes that magical moment when popular
music can transport us to another world, where emotions and
longings are released in a song.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that ``Little Voice,'' directed by Mark Herman
(``Brassed Off''), blunders so often that it undercuts Horrocks'
performance. He also underutilizes Ewan McGregor, who plays a
telephone repairman who falls for L.V. There is little in the role
for McGregor to do, but even here he brings enough nuance to his
acting to show he is consistently one of the most interesting young
actors around.
</P>
<P>
   Caine fares better, but, as with Horrocks, the subtlety of his
performance is lost in the film's excesses. For the veteran Caine,
who always seems to be working, it's too bad. For Horrocks, who is
little known here in the States, you only hope there will be more
chances to see her talents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A film that succeeds on all fronts and shouldn't be overlooked
is ``Gods and Monsters.'' Though it did only moderate business at
the box office, it was one of the most acclaimed films of last
year, winning the Oscar for best adapted screenplay for its
screenwriter/director Bill Condon.
</P>
<P>
   Taken from Christopher Brams' novel, ``Father of Frankenstein,''
the film tells of the final days of director James Whale
(1889-1957), who directed the horror classic ``Frankenstein'' as
well as some 20 other films.
</P>
<P>
   Whale (Ian McKellen) was openly gay in the Hollywood of the
1930s and '40s, when such an admission was tantamount to
professional suicide. As the retired Whale, McKellen proves why he
is perhaps the greatest actor of the day (he certainly should have
won the Oscar).
</P>
<P>
   The action slides between Whale's memories of fighting in World
War I, his heady days in Hollywood and love affairs and his
cloistered present-day world, where he sketches his hunky gardener,
played by Brendan Fraser, who shows he's more than a pretty face,
and is taken care of by his longtime housekeeper, played by Lynn
Redgrave, who also deserved the Oscar. A rich, intelligent film
about memory, loss and passion, ``Gods and Monsters'' should not be
missed. &QL;

<P>
   PRISTINA _
</P>
<P>
   Kfor died Monday morning. She was only two days old and lay
inside a colored dishcloth in the arms of a relative as her father,
Mehdi Lahu, walked up the filthy laneways of Vranjevac on his way
to the little makeshift graveyard beneath the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was conceived when the Serb police were oppressing us,''
he wept. ``She was carried inside her mother for two months on our
flight through the forests. And she died after her mother had to
hide with me for two hours in the basement while the police raided
our home.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the very last raid by the Serb police, on the night
British troops of KFOR arrived in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi and his wife Hajrie had wanted to celebrate the child's
birth as a moment of liberation but the baby came late and _
because of the last Serb looting spree _ was born without medical
aid. Mehdi's elderly mother had to cut the umbilical cord with a
Gillette razor sterilized in boiling water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it happened this morning. She just died. We wanted to
name her Kfor and we wished to ask Mr. Jackson to be the godfather
but this could not happen. We hope that the life of KFOR is longer
than this little girl's life and that they will bring us freedom
for the first time in 120 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant every word he said. He did believe that NATO General
Sir Michael Jackson would be his child's godfather. And all the
while that we talked, little Kfor lay under the dishcloth in the
arms of Lutfi Lahu, the father-in-law of Mehdi's sister. It was
heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Kfor is the last Albanian victim of the war. Or maybe
she is the first to die in the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi, standing beside his wife with his hands clasped in front
of him, had no doubt who was to blame. ``We are refugees from
Glamnik,'' he said. ``The Serbs ordered us from our homes the day
the OSCE delegates left Kosovo in March and we walked the forests
in hiding for the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hajrie was very pregnant. She was not in good condition and
the baby was five days' late when she was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a relative's house here in Vranjevac and every day
the police would break into our home. And each day we had to hide
in the cellar. We'd been there for two hours on Saturday and after
the police left, our baby was born.''
</P>
<P>
   A small crowd of Albanians had gathered round us in the cobbled
roadway with its open sewer, a burned Albanian home behind us, the
trees of the graveyard just up the street. Mehdi's tears trickled
down his cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go home to Glamnik. There were many houses there
that were burned. We had one of the three that were still
undamaged. But we've heard now that the police were living in it
and they burned it when they left.''
</P>
<P>
   Another man in a pink shirt asked if he could speak. ``I am
Mehdi's brother Nexhmi,'' he said. ``I arranged my brother's
wedding on May 24 last year and I want to tell you about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our tradition, the bridegroom's friends and family all
travel to the bride's family to collect the girl on the day of the
marriage. That day we could have had a hundred cars to go there.
But the Serb police would not allow it. We were so afraid. We could
send only two cars. And we couldn't fly our flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi listened to all this, wiping away his tears all the time.
From time to time, Nexhmi gently took the almost weightless bundle
in the dishcloth from Lutfi and held it to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our baby was born at nine o'clock in the morning,'' Mehdi kept
repeating. ``We had electricity but no water _ only enough to
sterilize the knife. I helped my wife to give birth but my mother
is too old and could not help much. Now my only concern is to find
medicines for my wife. I have lost my baby but I still have her.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi Lahu is 30 and a mechanic by profession. Hajrie is just
24. It was their first child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't blame NATO for the suffering of our people,'' he
said. ``We only blame them for starting the war late. Our baby
didn't die because of NATO but because of the lack of medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   Nexhmi interrupted him. ``Our people have a belief about life,''
he said softly. ``We say that it's never too late.''
</P>
<P>
   We all shook hands and they walked away beneath the trees, Mehdi
with clasped hands in front of him, Nexhmi clutching the bundle.
And then they disappeared around the corner of the burned house. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVO POLJE _ Kosovo Polje is not known for its cuisine. The
heartland of Serbism, site of Serbia's 1389 battle with the Turks _
the greatest defeat (so far) in Serbia's history _ and the location
of one of the country's ugliest Tito-style railway stations; Kosovo
Polje is all that. And, currently, parts of it are on fire.
</P>
<P>
   But anything is worth escaping from the cockroach-haunted
restaurant of the Grand Hotel in Pristina. We set off, therefore,
with something approaching desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop _ a pleasant garden pizzeria which I had
regularly visited last year _ was closed, its gate padlocked, its
owner already fled to what is now called ``Serbia proper.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a street away, there was a house on fire, its roof slowly
crumbling into blazing rooms, its tiles exploding in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   In any other country, there would be crowds, fire engines,
tearful homeowners. But all we found outside the crackling building
was a boy on a bicycle, practicing how to backpedal.
</P>
<P>
   I walked up the driveway and saw a figure retreat into the next
door house. And a pile of bottles and food cans _ military rations,
I suspected _ beneath a tree in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb owner _ or the policemen who had taken over his home
after his departure _ had simply torched the place to prevent
anyone else living there, in the same way that you or I might lock
the front door when we left.
</P>
<P>
   But where could we eat? There was a bar 400 yards away where
soldiers were drinking Sprite; or at least it looked like Sprite.
They gave us an address and the conversation went like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go down that street past the burned houses, take the
first turning to the left where there is a building on fire and a
bit further on, on the right, there's a good restaurant which
serves pork lunches.''
</P>
<P>
   We followed the directions to the letter and there was the
Zhivil Gaj taverna, an astro-turf terrace beside a real garden of
brilliant yellow and red roses.
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav Valikojic was a thin young man, not at all nervous of
all the fires, nor, it seemed, the cascades of rifle fire that
sprayed into the sky from every soldier's rifle in Kosovo Polje.
</P>
<P>
   He served a Serbian salad (too little cheese, far too many
onions) and hunks of pork that could have satisfied an army.
</P>
<P>
   Our fellow guests were an interesting bunch. There was a
Yugoslav army colonel and his pretty wife at one table while at
another sat three men, one with shoulder-length hair and a beard.
</P>
<P>
   All with knives in their belts, another with half a bottle of
brandy pushed into his camouflage trousers. Other patrons arrived
in black shirts and head scarves with pistols tucked into their
belts.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bright sunny day, despite the drifting smoke haze, and
we asked for mineral water and red wine. At this point a spent
round _ fired into the air no doubt by a celebrating Yugoslav
soldier half a mile away _ cracked onto the terrace floor beside
us.
</P>
<P>
   A militiaman picked it up with amusement. Just outside, 20 yards
away, two drunken soldiers were brawling, one of them beating the
other over the head with the butt of his Kalashnikov rifle until a
comrade intervened to prevent both men shooting each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wine _ it's against the law,'' Bratislav announced. Against
the what? ``There are very strict rules against selling alcohol in
Kosovo,'' he replied. Government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Of course. The Yugoslav authorities, anxious to prevent ``unruly
elements'' committing crimes, banned the public sale of alcohol in
Kosovo some weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Outside on the road, a Yugoslav armored column moved sluggishly
past our restaurant, tanks and artillery and rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when the other guests had left that Bratislav
invited us inside and said that we could ``order freely now.'' He
served the finest chilled red wine _ far too much of it _ and more
pork and salad.
</P>
<P>
   And he wanted to tell us about the local Serbs. ``If people from
(Kosovo) Metohija start leaving, no one is going to remain,'' he
said. ``But here in Kosovo Polje, the Serbs are the toughest. We'll
keep all this. The area is almost `etnicki cisto' (ethnically
clean).'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He talked about casualties. His nearest neighbor had been killed
by a landmine set by the Kosovo Liberation Army (who had in turn
stolen it from the Yugoslav army) along with 19 other Serb
soldiers, including the son of a woman who used to work in the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav's brother-in-law was killed by a sniper on his way to
a funeral in Glogovac. Again by the KLA. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav had few thoughts about the Albanians, no knowledge, it
seemed, of what every guest in his restaurant must have known, or
even _ the thought often crept through my mind _ participated in.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't see the young man with the knife and the long hair or

<P>
   KOSOVO POLJE _ Kosovo Polje is not known for its cuisine. The
heartland of Serbism, site of Serbia's 1389 battle with the Turks _
the greatest defeat (so far) in Serbia's history _ and the location
of one of the country's ugliest Tito-style railway stations; Kosovo
Polje is all that. And, currently, parts of it are on fire.
</P>
<P>
   But anything is worth escaping from the cockroach-haunted
restaurant of the Grand Hotel in Pristina. We set off, therefore,
with something approaching desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop _ a pleasant garden pizzeria which I had
regularly visited last year _ was closed, its gate padlocked, its
owner already fled to what is now called ``Serbia proper.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a street away, there was a house on fire, its roof slowly
crumbling into blazing rooms, its tiles exploding in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   In any other country, there would be crowds, fire engines,
tearful homeowners. But all we found outside the crackling building
was a boy on a bicycle, practicing how to backpedal.
</P>
<P>
   I walked up the driveway and saw a figure retreat into the next
door house. And a pile of bottles and food cans _ military rations,
I suspected _ beneath a tree in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb owner _ or the policemen who had taken over his home
after his departure _ had simply torched the place to prevent
anyone else living there, in the same way that you or I might lock
the front door when we left.
</P>
<P>
   But where could we eat? There was a bar 400 yards away where
soldiers were drinking Sprite; or at least it looked like Sprite.
They gave us an address and the conversation went like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go down that street past the burned houses, take the
first turning to the left where there is a building on fire and a
bit further on, on the right, there's a good restaurant which
serves pork lunches.''
</P>
<P>
   We followed the directions to the letter and there was the
Zhivil Gaj taverna, an astro-turf terrace beside a real garden of
brilliant yellow and red roses.
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav Valikojic was a thin young man, not at all nervous of
all the fires, nor, it seemed, the cascades of rifle fire that
sprayed into the sky from every soldier's rifle in Kosovo Polje.
</P>
<P>
   He served a Serbian salad (too little cheese, far too many
onions) and hunks of pork that could have satisfied an army.
</P>
<P>
   Our fellow guests were an interesting bunch. There was a
Yugoslav army colonel and his pretty wife at one table while at
another sat three men, one with shoulder-length hair and a beard.
</P>
<P>
   All with knives in their belts, another with half a bottle of
brandy pushed into his camouflage trousers. Other patrons arrived
in black shirts and head scarves with pistols tucked into their
belts.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bright sunny day, despite the drifting smoke haze, and
we asked for mineral water and red wine. At this point a spent
round _ fired into the air no doubt by a celebrating Yugoslav
soldier half a mile away _ cracked onto the terrace floor beside
us.
</P>
<P>
   A militiaman picked it up with amusement. Just outside, 20 yards
away, two drunken soldiers were brawling, one of them beating the
other over the head with the butt of his Kalashnikov rifle until a
comrade intervened to prevent both men shooting each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wine _ it's against the law,'' Bratislav announced. Against
the what? ``There are very strict rules against selling alcohol in
Kosovo,'' he replied. Government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Of course. The Yugoslav authorities, anxious to prevent ``unruly
elements'' committing crimes, banned the public sale of alcohol in
Kosovo some weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Outside on the road, a Yugoslav armored column moved sluggishly
past our restaurant, tanks and artillery and rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when the other guests had left that Bratislav
invited us inside and said that we could ``order freely now.'' He
served the finest chilled red wine _ far too much of it _ and more
pork and salad.
</P>
<P>
   And he wanted to tell us about the local Serbs. ``If people from
(Kosovo) Metohija start leaving, no one is going to remain,'' he
said. ``But here in Kosovo Polje, the Serbs are the toughest. We'll
keep all this. The area is almost `etnicki cisto' (ethnically
clean).'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He talked about casualties. His nearest neighbor had been killed
by a landmine set by the Kosovo Liberation Army (who had in turn
stolen it from the Yugoslav army) along with 19 other Serb
soldiers, including the son of a woman who used to work in the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav's brother-in-law was killed by a sniper on his way to
a funeral in Glogovac. Again by the KLA. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bratislav had few thoughts about the Albanians, no knowledge, it
seemed, of what every guest in his restaurant must have known, or
even _ the thought often crept through my mind _ participated in.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't see the young man with the knife and the long hair or
the guy with half a bottle of brandy in his pocket standing guard
duty in a barracks.
</P>
<P>
   We had sat, I'm sure, among the bad guys, among some of the
``cleansers'' in this town which was ``almost ethnically clean.''
</P>
<P>
   So we asked whether he realized how much the Albanians had
suffered, and he said this: ``Be sure that they did not. They were
harmed in a different way, forcing them to go out (of their homes)
but physically they weren't maltreated...
</P>

   ``We used to be on good terms. Albanians helped to build this

   &UR; FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PARRISH-EXHIBIT (Philadelphia) _ In 1925, a New York printing
company called the House of Art estimated that one of its
best-selling products, a lithograph of Maxfield Parrish's painting
``Daybreak,'' could be found in one of every four American homes.
Even allowing for a titanic dose of hype, the statistic rings true.
Like apple pie, the flag and indoor plumbing, ``Daybreak'' was,
indeed, an American fixture. So was Parrish himself. He was an art
machine. He turned out countless paintings, many of them intended
for print reproduction. Together, they made him one of the
country's first brand-name artists, and they helped define the mood
and style of an era. ``Maxfield Parrish, 1870-1966,'' which opens
tomorrow at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in
Philadelphia, is a first-time look at the full range of a career
that, almost preposterously, stretched from the post-Victorian
Gilded Age of the 1880s to the Pop world of the 1960s. By Holland
Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-FESTIVAL (New York) _ Take it as coincidence or take it as
synchronicity or take it as one more affirmation of the ways
musicians tune in ideas across boundaries and decades. The JVC Jazz
Festival, which starts its major concerts tonight and runs through
June 27, has two threads that connect its most promising events,
two pervasive influences that should intersect at many different
angles for 10 days. One is the ever-expanding recognition of
Brazilian music, past and present, as more American listeners break
the language barrier and more Brazilian musicians travel
internationally. The second is the lasting influence of Miles
Davis, who spawned entire schools of jazz with each phase of his
music from the 1940s well into the 1970s. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-WINE (Undated) _ A treasury of priceless glass in a land
of free-flowing wine: how good an idea is this? Good enough, it
turns out, if the combination pairs the strikingly expanded Corning
Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y., and the vineyard-ringed Finger
Lakes. You can taste your way through dozens of wineries hugging
the hillsides along the sky-blue waters and tour the world's most
comprehensive collection of art glass and high-tech exhibits in a
new section, opening Saturday, of a $62 million glass-sheathed
addition to the museum. (Or more prudently, perhaps, you can do it
the other way around.) By Ralph Blumenthal.

   SLAVE: While researching their genealogy in Missouri, two women
made a startling discovery. The ancestor of one had owned an
ancestor of the other, who was a slave. Now the two women _ from
Chicago and Seattle _ are using their ties to promote frank
discussion about race relations. They will travel the state this
summer presenting a talk called ``Entangled Lives: Facing Our
Slaveholding Past.'' A story about history and how it stays with
us. Their first presentation was in Jefferson City on June 11.

<P>
   REPARE (with SLAVE): Something called the Reparation Team of
Missouri is making plans for a national convention in St. Louis
this summer made up of groups and families seeking compensation for
slavery. Where does the reparation movement stand? And what drives
people who are pushing it? There is a bill in Congress that is
being debated on the subject. Convention starts Friday. Oscar
Avila. 18.

   DENTIST: Dentist Frank Meyer will be sentenced today for
Medicaid fraud. He overcharged and billed for procedures never

   THEATER-SHAKESPEARE: So, just how good was William Shakespeare,
anyway? Sure, he's the most-produced playwright in the
English-speaking world. He's also one of the hottest screenwriters
in Hollywood this year. His fictionalized love life was the subject
of last year's Oscar-winning film ``Shakespeare in Love.'' And,
yes, his plays have been translated into scores of languages. The
ubiquity of Shakespeare's work makes it clear: He must have been
doing something right. 54 inches. Derek Donovan.

   ORCHESTRA-MILLENIUM: Maybe every century has troubles with its
own music _ or at least some of it. Bach was criticized for
excessive complexity, Mozart for harmonic weirdness, Beethoven for
unruliness. But nothing in history has prepared us for the deep and
enduring hostility of concertgoing audiences toward large chunks of
20th-century music. 33 inches. Scott Cantrell.

A '90S GUY? HERO GETS MAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you didn't spend your innocent youth mowing through Claire
Bee's books about America's most clean-cut sports hero, here's a
quick description:
</P>
<P>
   Chip Hilton was the greatest sports hero ever. A student at
Valley Falls High School (and in later, lesser books, at State
College), he was the embodiment of squeaky-clean achievement. He
excelled at every sport. He was an excellent student. He had an
after-school job. He didn't get into trouble. He loved his mother,
who raised him by herself after his father (another sports hero)
died. No plot was too hokey, and Chip always did the right thing in
the end.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't he make you want to puke?
</P>
<P>
   Not when you're a kid, he doesn't. Problem is, Bee wrote these
books in the &UR; 1940s and '50s. They didn't age well. Chip's friend
Speed, for instance, drove a jalopy. Not exactly contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   A small publishing company is doing something about that. It's
republishing the books and modernizing them. Speed, for instance,
is now Black and drives a Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not enough. If we're really going to pull Chip into
the late '90s, we'll need to replace titles like ``Hoop Crazy'' and
``Clutch Hitter!'' with these:
</P>
<P>
   Papa's Got a Brand New Bag: Chip turns counselor when he
discovers Soapy has run into some paternity problems. ``I can't
make the game next week because I can't get a baby-sitter for my
son,'' he tells Chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're our point guard, Soapy,'' Chip says, ``and . . .
wait, I thought you had a daughter. With Nancy, the head
cheerleader. You remember the scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ``do'' have a daughter with Nancy,'' Soapy replies. ``I also
have a son with Beth. I may be having another one with Ellen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Soapy, you're taking your adoration of Shawn Kemp too far,''
Chip says, before asking his mother to baby-sit for Soapy's son and
scheduling him for family-planning classes at the local clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing With Myself: Chip and his buddies on the baseball team
go in together on a hotel room for the after-prom party. Chip
repeats to his mom the story Biggie and Lefty tell their parents _
the girls will have a room where they sip sodas and gossip, while
we guys will have a place to play cards and talk about sports.
</P>
<P>
   Things turn sour for Chip when he realizes this isn't really
what the other kids have in mind. ``You mean I ``lied'' to my
mom?'' he shrieks in a crucial confrontation with Biggie. Upset by
the deception and disgusted with the intended purpose for which the
kids plan to use the room, Chip rats on his pals to the baseball
coach, who tells the other kids' parents. Chip, meanwhile, goes
stag to the prom, where he is beaten up by Biggie and Lefty while
the rest of the students (and some of the chaperones) cheer. All is
forgiven in time for Monday's big game.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Agent Man: After a stellar sophomore season with the
State College basketball team, Chip faces the toughest decision of
his life _ whether to turn pro early. At first the prospect of a
million-dollar contract pales in comparison to his promise to his
mother that he would complete his education. But when an
underhanded agent begins illegally wooing Chip with the promise of
unlimited cars, mansions and women, he rethinks his commitment.
``Don't worry,'' he promises his distraught mother, ``one of my
tattoos will be a picture of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Sides Now: Chip learns a valuable lesson in diversity when
Speed, alone with Chip in the shower after practice, declares his
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you too, Speed,'' Chip replies. ``You're like a brother
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not ``that'' kind of love,'' Speed says. ``The other kind.''
</P>
<P>
   After several more explanations, it finally dawns on a horrified
Chip what Speed is saying. ``I'm sorry, Speed,'' he says, ``but I'm
afraid I could never have that kind of relationship with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm a guy?'' Speed pleads. ``Because I'm . . .
different?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Chip says. ``Because I've never, in any of these books,
had even a hint of that kind of relationship with anyone, male or
female.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good point,'' a relieved Speed says and heads for his locker. &QL;

THE VINE KING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the first few beats of tribal drums beneath Walt Disney
Pictures' familiar Cinderella castle logo, you know you're in for
something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' immediately immerses you in its world, where we're
introduced to two different families _ an enterprising couple and
their baby trying to survive in the jungle after a violent
shipwreck, as well as a group of gorillas led by the imposing
Silverback, Kerchak. Both clans are devastated by a bloodthirsty
leopard when the beast makes a quick meal of a runaway baby gorilla
_ leaving its mother, Kala, childless. It then turns on the human
couple _ leaving an infant Tarzan motherless.
</P>
<P>
   The stage is beautifully set, and much as in 1994's ``The Lion
King,'' all within the refrains of the opening song _ ``Two
Worlds,'' one of five new tunes crafted for the film by
vocalist/percussionist Phil Collins.
</P>
<P>
   But three deaths in the first 10 minutes of the movie? It may
seem like tough stuff for the folks who brought you fluffy fun like
``The Aristocats'' and ``A Goofy Movie.'' Although the studio used
to settle for kinder and gentler cartoons, Disney animation is in
the midst of a sophisticated growth spurt.
</P>
<P>
   Films like ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' and last year's
``Mulan'' have tapped into something more substantial than singing
candlesticks and dancing sea creatures _ not that ``Tarzan''
doesn't have its share of warm fuzziness. But the picture feels
like the beginning of a new breed of animated pictures, the kind of
movies adults will seek out, rather than attending as the reluctant
chaperons to their overeager children.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows Tarzan's growth after he is rescued from the
leopard by Kala (voiced sweetly by Glenn Close) and raised in the
gorilla family, much to the consternation of Kerchak (brought to
life perfectly with Lance Henriksen's booming, gravelly voice).
</P>
<P>
   As a young man (voiced sparingly, but effectively, by Tony
Goldwyn), Tarzan has become as agile as a monkey and almost as
strong as his surrogate gorilla father. But his world is about to
change when he comes across a new breed of jungle creature: humans.
</P>
<P>
   Enter gorilla expert Professor Porter (Nigel Hawthorne), his
headstrong daughter Jane (Minnie Driver, in a hilarious turn) and
their trigger-happy jungle guide, Clayton (Brian Blessed). Tarzan
quickly finds himself torn between these two worlds, cautious about
protecting his family from the intruders, yet anxious to introduce
his eager new friends to his other life _ a move that will surely
bring trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Along for comic relief are Tarzan's animal buddies, Terk, a
wiseacre female gorilla voiced by Rosie O'Donnell, and Tantor, an
accident-prone elephant voiced by former ``Seinfeld'' star Wayne
Knight.
</P>
<P>
   While fans of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs might take
exception to Disney's liberties with the story, they can't help but
be pleased with the ape man's stunningly agile performance, pulled
off with the help of the amazing new ``Deep Canvas'' technique,
which allows the two-dimensional Tarzan to swing through a
hand-painted, three-dimensional background that meshes together
seemlessly.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of Disney's best-looking cartoon features to date.
Thanks to the film's heightened pace, unobtrusive musical numbers
and engaging vocal performances, ``Tarzan'' promises to be a strong
contender for king of the box office jungle.

   &UR; FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PARRISH-EXHIBIT (Philadelphia) _ In 1925, a New York printing
company called the House of Art estimated that one of its
best-selling products, a lithograph of Maxfield Parrish's painting
``Daybreak,'' could be found in one of every four American homes.
Even allowing for a titanic dose of hype, the statistic rings true.
Like apple pie, the flag and indoor plumbing, ``Daybreak'' was,
indeed, an American fixture. So was Parrish himself. He was an art
machine. He turned out countless paintings, many of them intended
for print reproduction. Together, they made him one of the
country's first brand-name artists, and they helped define the mood
and style of an era. ``Maxfield Parrish, 1870-1966,'' which opens
tomorrow at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in
Philadelphia, is a first-time look at the full range of a career
that, almost preposterously, stretched from the post-Victorian
Gilded Age of the 1880s to the Pop world of the 1960s. By Holland
Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-FESTIVAL (New York) _ Take it as coincidence or take it as
synchronicity or take it as one more affirmation of the ways
musicians tune in ideas across boundaries and decades. The JVC Jazz
Festival, which starts its major concerts tonight and runs through
June 27, has two threads that connect its most promising events,
two pervasive influences that should intersect at many different
angles for 10 days. One is the ever-expanding recognition of
Brazilian music, past and present, as more American listeners break
the language barrier and more Brazilian musicians travel
internationally. The second is the lasting influence of Miles
Davis, who spawned entire schools of jazz with each phase of his
music from the 1940s well into the 1970s. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-WINE (Undated) _ A treasury of priceless glass in a land
of free-flowing wine: how good an idea is this? Good enough, it
turns out, if the combination pairs the strikingly expanded Corning
Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y., and the vineyard-ringed Finger
Lakes. You can taste your way through dozens of wineries hugging
the hillsides along the sky-blue waters and tour the world's most
comprehensive collection of art glass and high-tech exhibits in a
new section, opening Saturday, of a $62 million glass-sheathed
addition to the museum. (Or more prudently, perhaps, you can do it
the other way around.) By Ralph Blumenthal.

PLENTY OF SIZZLE AT ITALIAN CAR DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say the names out loud:
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   Maserati.
</P>
<P>
   Lamborghini.
</P>
<P>
   Alfa Romeo.
</P>
<P>
   There is something evocative just in their sound.
</P>
<P>
   Now picture a couple hundred of them arrayed on a sprawling lawn
on a hot Sunday in June with a few thousand auto enthusiasts
milling about. You could call it an auto show. I prefer to call it
an art exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The event was the Tutto Italiano, the fourth annual Italian Car
Day Lawn Show at the Museum of Transportation in Brookline, Mass.,
and, owing to the presence of so many Ferraris, the dominant color
was red.
</P>
<P>
   So much red on all that green lawn. So many cool curves of
fender, curls of chrome, sharp edges, gentle rises. And that's only
on the outside. Inside, all that leather arrayed like fine
furniture, instrumentation like fancy watches, handles and knobs
and switches gleaming like expensive kitchen gadgets. So much art.
</P>
<P>
   And none of this by accident, because this is, after all, what
the designers of Italian autos do. Producing formidable power and
handling is left to the engineers; the designers are mandated to
produce works of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aesthetics mean a lot to them,'' says Neal Heffron, a
Brookline collector who, with wife Susan, owns two Ferraris and an
Alpha Romeo.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, when you look at a Ferrari or Maserati that you
just know will sizzle out on the pavement, you also get the sense
you are looking at something more. It might be the feeling you get
when looking at sculpted leather chairs from Design Centro Italia,
or cutlery from Firenze.
</P>
<P>
   On a tour of Ford design headquarters last month, Jac Nasser,
the Ford's chief executive, was heard by a Wall Street Journal
reporter telling his designers that he wanted them to know what the
furniture in Americans' homes looks like; what their kitchen
appliances look like.
</P>
<P>
   And that is precisely the point that Italian designers latched
onto years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Nuccio Bertone designed his first Alfa Romeo, he was
referred to not as a designer, but as a coachbuilder.
</P>
<P>
   Battista Farina, born in 1893 in Turin, Italy, designed his
first car at 17 _ the Fiat Zero. At 27 years old, the childhood
nickname ``Pinin'' having stuck, he turned down Henry Ford's offer
to go to work in Detroit and instead teamed up in Italy with
Vincenzo Lancia.
</P>
<P>
   Today, under the tag Pininfarina, you see the results of this
late artist's works everywhere _ most notably, of course, on
Ferraris. But the name Pininfarina, Heffron points out, is also now
associated with even pens and chairs.
</P>
<P>
   When you think style and think Italian, you can relate the
thought to furniture, clothes, shoes, neckties _ and superbly
designed sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   Walking the lawn at Brookline last week, it was hard not to be
struck by how many elements of all that Italian craftsmanship have
shown up down the years on other autos.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the 1964 Alpha Romeo Zagato Milano. With its sloping
hood and slightly clipped rear, it reminds you of the Nissan Z. And
then you notice, on the front quarterpanel just behind the wheel
well, the big Z. Curious.
</P>
<P>
   Noses and tails and grilles and fender lines and so many of them
make you wonder: Where else have I seen this?
</P>
<P>
   Picture a 1999 Corvette convertible, the lowest and sleekest
model yet. Now picture it beside a 1999 Ferrari F355 Spider.
</P>
<P>
   (If you want to play this game, pick up the June 1999 issue of
duPont Registry in the auto section at your nearest magazine rack).
</P>
<P>
   Compare any of the latest models of the Accura NXS with the 1999
Ferrari F355 TB.
</P>
<P>
   The 1985 Maserati Quattroporte? Picture the formerly sharp-edge,
chunky Audis before their rounding off.
</P>
<P>
   Go back in time even more and think of early 1960s Lincolns and
Buicks. Then stroll across the lawn to see the 1961 325 Dual-Ghia.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fun game to play: Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
</P>
<P>
   And it has its surprises.
</P>
<P>
   In what evidence suggests may have been a reverse derivation
there is the 1963 Maserti 3500, looking remarkably like the 1957
Ford Thunderbird.

   Did those bulbous fenders on the 1968 Alpha Romeo T33 Stradale
(the latter term meaning ``street'' as in this is a race car made
street legal) influence, say, designers of the new Audi TT or the
Dodge Viper GTS?

A SPECIAL EDITION OF THE FUN-LOVING MIATA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tenets of most religions include at least two shared and
powerful notions: rebirth and revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the House of the Two-Seat Sports Coupe, whose flock
declined through the 1960s, '70s and '80s, but for whom rebirth and
revelation came in 1989 at the Chicago Auto Show. For that is when
Mazda introduced the Miata, and affordable, two-passenger ragtops
became all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 10 years later, more than 500,000 Miatas have been
produced (half of them for the US market), and auto manufacturers
in Europe, America, and Japan continue to play catch-up in this
nifty little niche market.
</P>
<P>
   That is because, down the decade, the Miata has proved to be
just what its builder promised it would be: affordable, reliable,
and, most of all, fun. There are more than 30,000 members of the
Miata Club of America. Web sites for Miata enthusiasts abound.
</P>
<P>
   Drive the Miata and you are reaching back in time to the old
days of feel-every-bit-of-the-road sports car touring: snapping
through corners as you sit low in the seat, upshifting and
downshifting to translate power into control and control into
power, waving to other top-down enthusiasts as you meet them on the
road. It's like the old days and the best of the MGs _ without the
shaky wiring of Lucas, Prince of Darkness.
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate the success of this little sports car, Miata has
produced the 1999 Tenth Anniversary Editon, a sapphire blue coupe
with a light blue top and blue tonneau cover.
</P>
<P>
   It is easily recognized by Miata enthusiasts and will stay that
way because only 7,500 of them will be produced _ 3,000 of which
are for US sale. It has a lot of nice little touches that set it
apart from the 1999 MX-5, but with the 140-horsepower engine at its
heart, it is virtually the same automobile.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 body style is more muscular looking than past Miatas.
There is a pumped up look to the slightly bulging front fenders _ a
look that continues back through the door lines, which rise from
door to curved rear fenders. The raised lip on the trailing edge of
the trunk adds to the look.
</P>
<P>
   What the 10th Anniversary Edition has that the others don't is a
six-speed transmission, a delightful and snappy addition since the
car has only 119 lbs./ft. of torque and the extra gears,
particularly on the highway, keep it peppy moving through traffic.
Fourth, fifth, and sixth, used judiciously while commuting in
heavy, fast traffic on Interstate 93, are a useful combo.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, straight-line commuting (with some traffic weave
thrown in) is not the aim of most sports car manufacturers.
Handling and corners are.
</P>
<P>
   This special edition is set up as one stiff car for this
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   It has a Torsen limited slip differential, Billstein shocks, a
strut tower brace in the front for added stiffness, four-wheel
double wishbone suspension, rack-and-pinion steering, and
four-wheel disc brakes.
</P>
<P>
   What this gives you is a stiff but sure ride.
</P>
<P>
   Rip into a corner and you feel its pull in a way you don't in,
say, the BMW M Coupe. That is because nothing is being controlled
by computer to make your drive easier. The driver defines the edge
in the Miata.
</P>
<P>
   Oversteer, understeer, too much gas, too much brake _ they are
all up to you to fix.
</P>
<P>
   Discover, midway through the tight curve, that the road is not
perfect _ a crack here, a bump there _ and you get that familiar
hop, shake, rattle, or skip you might remember from the old days.
It's up to you to correct for it.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes driving this car fun, and you can see why
people are so attached to their Miatas.
</P>
<P>
   In the cockpit, all is simplicity. Five analog gauges are
packaged tightly behind the steering wheel. Wipers and lights are
on stems jutting from the steering column. Sound system and heat
controls are in the center of the dash.
</P>
<P>
   The special edition features two-tone leather and suede seats, a
high performance Bose music system, cruise control, power windows
and door locks, power mirrors, and a power antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's a collector car, a special badge on the driver's
side front fender gives it a serial number and also its own number
among the 7,500 to be built. This car was number 1744.
</P>
<P>
   These 10th Anniversary Editions will surely find their place in
the loyal congregation that is the cult of Miata, a gathering where
Web sites offer essays and odes to the car and fictional goddesses
write of their Miata experiences; where kinks and complaints and
tips are shared by Miata owners; where debates rage on color,
engine power, and Miata etiquette. There is, for instance, a Save
the Wave campaign that urges Miata owners to follow two rules when
encountering each other on the road: 1. Wave or flash headlights
and 2. Smile.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting debates on the Web is a debate over
power. This is, after all, no rip the road, roaring little car. It
is adequately powered and fun and that is what it was meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the supercharger and turbocharger backers get their say, as
do proponents of a rotary engine for the Miata. One Web poll found
11 percent backing turbo- or superchargers; nearly half supporting
more power, but only through normal aspiration. And significantly,
a quarter said, ``Leave it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want more power, get a different car,'' wrote one
respondent.
</P>
<P>
   `` '99 Mazdas rock, right out of the box,'' chimed another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about power; it's about fun,'' concluded a third.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a conclusion I agree with. This car was designed to
be a bit of a throwback (with modern reliability thrown in) and the
manufacturer ought to keep it that way. There are plenty of
aftermarket solutions for those who want more kick to their Miata,
and any move by the manufacturer to significantly pep up this car
would surely result in a much higher cost than the $20,000 base for
the regular 1999 Miata. The 10th Anniversary Edition, for instance,
is $8,000 higher than that, and a more powerful engine would not
only add to the cost, but so would the costs of the upgraded
suspension that would be needed to handle the extra power.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --I've never seen a manual convertible top that is so simple
(two quick clicks, no pulling and tugging) to put up and down.
</P>
<P>
   --The die-cast model of your special edition Miata, the key
ring, and the his-and-hers 10th Anniversary Miata Seiko watches
that come with this limited edition.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --I know it's limited and will be snapped up by collectors, but
$28,000-plus is getting away from the original purpose of the
Miata.
</P>
<P>
   --The rattling that the convertible top makes once it is stored
behind the rear seats.

MAXFIELD PARRISH: LUSH IDYLLS IN NEVER-NEVER LAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa. N.H., N.Y.)   (editors: exhibit notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In 1925 a New York printing company called the
House of Art estimated that one of its best-selling products, a
lithograph of Maxfield Parrish's painting ``Daybreak,'' could be
found in one of every four American homes. Even allowing for a
titanic dose of hype, the statistic rings true. Like apple pie, the
flag and indoor plumbing, ``Daybreak'' was, indeed, an American
fixture.
</P>
<P>
   So was Parrish himself. He was an art machine. He turned out
countless paintings, many of them intended for print reproduction.
His images appeared in books and advertisements, on posters,
magazine covers, calendars, jigsaw puzzles and candy boxes.
Together they made him one of the country's first brand-name
artists, and they helped define the mood and style of an era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maxfield Parrish, 1870-1966,'' which opens Saturday at the
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, is a
first-time look at the full range of a career that, almost
preposterously, stretched from the Victorian Gilded Age of the
1880s to the Pop world of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   An example of almost every kind of thing the Philadelphia-born
artist did is here, from a hand-decorated ukulele to a nude
photographic self-portrait, to the original oil-on-board version of
``Daybreak,'' a classical fantasy bathed in pastel light, which
fetched a cool $4.2 million when it was sold at Sotheby's a few
years ago. Despite formal variety, however, Parrish's work boils
down to just a few general themes.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the fairy-tale narrative, comical or romantic,
set in Old World Europe, Colonial America or some exotic Middle
Easternish never-never land. Parrish often used such images for
private commissions. (His mural of Old King Cole, now installed in
the bar of the St. Regis hotel in Manhattan, is an example.) But
much of it appeared in book illustrations that show him working at
his inventive best.
</P>
<P>
   Another motif, one for which Parrish was celebrated in his day,
is the pastoral tableau. It often includes a gardenlike setting
populated by pre-pubescent girls and young women. The atmosphere is
idealizing (lots of classical pillars and pots) but also
genteel-erotic (sheer Grecian gowns galore). And the palette is
outlandish: an acid-bath mix of sulfuric-yellow, copper-orange and
what came to be dubbed Maxfield Parrish blue.
</P>
<P>
   The most extravagant example of this theme is a 50-foot-long
glass-chip mosaic titled ``Dream Garden,'' designed by Parrish,
executed by the Louis Comfort Tiffany studios in New York and
installed in the lobby of the Curtis Publishing building,
birthplace of Ladies Home Journal, in Philadelphia in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of those staggeringly elaborate visual trifles, at
once delicate and gross, of which Parrish and Tiffany were masters.
No one traveling to Philadelphia should miss it, particularly as
the mosaic recently came very close to being sold and removed from
its site. (Casino mogul Steven Wynn of Bellagio fame was the
purchaser who backed off after local preservationists protested the
sale.) Its future is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Everything Parrish did was an exercise in conspicuous
virtuosity. He developed his expertise at the Pennsylvania Academy
itself, where he was enrolled from 1892 to 1894, and even as a
student he was fixated on the challenges of craft.
</P>
<P>
   Early on he created entire drawings from stippled ink dots, a
kind of hand-done Benday effect, and he invented a time-consuming
painting method based on repeated glazing. He built his own frames
and packing crates and lettered his shipping labels in pretty
calligraphy. He contructed minute objects _ elf-size chairs,
tabletop houses and castles _ as models. He took photographs of
people and places for his photo-dependent work.
</P>
<P>
   He lacked, or suppressed, any natural feel for paint as an
expressive substance, or for organic composition. He was a
pictorial organizer, with a watchmaker's hand and the mind of a
computer programmer who, through adding, revising and patching,
gets every link and command in just the right place to produce a
preordained result.
</P>
<P>
   Given his high-precision bent, it's no wonder he was fascinated
with the technology of mechanical reproduction. Aubrey Beardsley
and other artists in England had elevated the printed poster to a
respectable art form by the 1890s. Book and magazine illustrations
earned a similar cachet as the American Arts and Crafts movement
gained momentum, in part as a reaction to continental modernist
trends like Impressionism.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish's reputation was secured by a cover he designed for
Century Magazine. And he genuinely relished his role as popular
artist, never viewing himself as a genius painter condescending to
do graphic work. (``I'm hopelessly commonplace,'' he once said.) He
actually conceived many of his paintings with an eye to how they
would look as prints.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia show, which has been organized by Sylvia Yount,
chief curator at the academy, pays particular attention to
painting, probably in part because it is still the medium of which
heavyweight shows are made, but also because Parrish's work, much
of it now in fragile condition, is seldom seen.
</P>
<P>
   He first explored the chromatic possibilities of pigment when he
visited Arizona; the light-drenched mountains of the Southwest
became part of his stock image pool. But most of his high-color
work came after his permanent move to the artists' colony in
Cornish, N.H., in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   In New England he found the idyllic, all-purpose settings that
served for the ubiquitous ``Daybreak'' and for the annual
promotional calendars he designed for Edison Mazda Lamps. He did
dozens of these, all with a sylphlike woman in a landscape: in the
1930 version, titled ``Ecstasy,'' she stands poised on a cliff,
wind blown and exultant, a New Woman perched like a supermodel on
an Aegean headland.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   By this point, Parrish's paintings and prints were physically
hard to tell apart, even up close. ``Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary,''
the oil-on-board painting for the Ferry's Seeds package, for
example, is so smoothly brushed as to be textureless, and the
lettering below the image, though painted by hand, looks print
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Such trompe l'oeil realism played a part in his popularity.
Americans have always had a thing for illusionist painters, from
William M. Harnett to Andrew Wyeth to Superrealism in the 1970s.
But Parrish's work also seems to have struck some strong
psychological chords.
</P>
<P>
   His larky women and his serious, sybilline girls (his daughter,
Jean, was often the model and posed for ``Mary, Quite Contrary'')
looked reassuringly benign in an early 20th century made jumpy by
Freudian revelations of the power of sex. His freeze-dried Arcadias
were a balm to many in the rapidly industrializing, urbanizing
America of the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s Parrish's harping on dreams, myths, make-believe
and the bliss of childhood bathed grim social realities in an
escapist haze. And one can easily imagine that his 1940s depictions
of farmhouses, sitting serene under a full moon, lights shining in
their windows, were like an I'll-be-home-for-Christmas lullaby to a
country at war.
</P>
<P>
   In the postwar years Parrish's reputation plummeted. His
association with commerce was suddenly suspect. His images began to
look like the calculated, anti-modern pastiches they were. His last
painting, appropriately titled ``Getting Away From It All'' and
done in 1961 when he was 91, is truly, deeply weird, a kind of
surreal version of 19th-century Luminism.
</P>
<P>
   Here the farmhouse has turned into a teensy frontier cabin,
dripping icicles and glowing like a blast furnace. The setting is a
surreal mountain landscape, part Rockies, part Mars. The snowy
surfaces have the look of sugar sprinkled on molten steel, and a
leafy New Hampshire tree pops up smack in the center as if spliced
in by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But it was just such trippy images that brought Parrish back
into vogue in the acid-dropping, poster-loving, Pop Art '60s. (Andy
Warhol was a big fan.) And his exoticisms have gained a New Age
following: the singer Enya adapted one of his images for an album
cover, and his paintings are hot collector's items in Hollywood
(George Lucas owns one), where special-effects wizardry of all
kinds is much admired.
</P>
<P>
   Even the art world has come around from the days when a Clement
Greenberg could peer down on the likes of Parrish from a great
height and dismissively thunder, ``Kitsch!'' A recent exhibition of
Victorian fairy painting at the Frick Collection in New York, a
traveling Norman Rockwell survey scheduled to open at the High
Museum in Atlanta in November and arrive at the Guggenheim in 2001,
and the scholarly catalog that accompanies the Pennsylvania Academy
show are all evidence that popular art is being seriously examined
and appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Examination is always a smart idea: art is packed with
information, often hidden, about who made it, who valued it and
why. Appreciation is trickier. Nostalgia, which is what Parrish's
work is about, is a powerful emotion, feel-good seductive but also
potentially dangerous, and something to be particularly wary of at
a conservative, self-satisfied moment in American art and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maxfield Parrish, 1870-1966'' is a chance to check out both
sides of the coin. It's definitely a gas, and its hefty gift shop
should probably be considered part of the show. But what makes
Parrish interesting is that for more than a century Americans have
 &UR; found &LR;  him interesting. His work still has sweet-tooth pleasures
aplenty, but it is also a mirror on which, however briefly, to
dwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maxfield Parrish, 1870-1966'' opens Saturday at the
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, 118 N. Broad St.,
Philadelphia, (215) 972-7600, and remains through Sept. 25. The
exhibition is organized by the Academy and the American Federation
of Arts and sponsored by the Henry Luce Foundation and Mellon Bank.
The show travels to the Currier Gallery of Art in Manchester, N.H.
(Nov. 6 through Jan. 23, 2000); the Memorial Art Gallery of the
University of Rochester (Feb. 19 through April 30, 2000) and the
Brooklyn Museum of Art (May 26 through Aug. 6, 2000).

<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a century after the gun smoke cleared, Americans still
are fascinated. Movies, books, Web sites _ all still wrestle with
the enduring controversy surrounding one of the most famous
shootouts in the Wild West.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfight at the OK Corral in Tombstone took 27 seconds and
about 30 shots. Three people died. Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp were
arrested but never tried.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, prominent Arizona attorneys and judges will stage a
public ``trial'' to determine what really happened in that rowdy
southern Arizona mining town in 1881.
</P>
<P>
   An all-star legal team _ including Arizona's assistant U.S.
attorney and a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge _ are
bringing the case to court at the Phoenician Resort on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   Holliday and Earp will be tried in the slaying of Tom McLaury.
Much of the testimony will be based on actual transcripts from an
official inquest held after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt Earp of Phoenix, the great grandnephew of Wyatt S. Earp _
and who is said to bear a strong physical resemblance to his
namesake _ will take the role of his famous ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix attorney Patricia Lee Refo, one of the trial organizers,
said prosecutors and defense attorneys have worked months to
prepare real strategies to argue a fictional civil suit filed by
McLaury's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the audience will act as the jury. They will issue a
verdict that could answer the century-old question: Who really
started the fight?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a zillion Web sites still today devoted to what
really happened at the OK Corral,'' Refo said. ``There are books
still being written about it, movies still being made about it and
arguments still being had over whose fault it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Counsel for Mrs. McLaury will be Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael
Johns and Flagstaff lawyer Deborah Fine. Phoenix attorneys Ed
Hendricks and Jeffrey Willis will represent the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses include Holliday's lady friend, Big Nose Kate, played
by Judge Bethany Hicks of Maricopa County Superior Court. Former
Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard will testify as Ike Clanton. Patricia
White, dean of Arizona State University's School of Law, will be
the grieving Mrs. McLaury.
</P>
<P>
   Although the case will be as historically accurate as possible,
modern technology will bring it to life.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-generated animation will be used to re-enact the
shootout, and images of the exhibits will be displayed on courtroom
monitors. The jury members _ or audience _ will cast their votes
using interactive electronic technology.
</P>
<P>
   The half-day trial is part of the State Bar of Arizona's annual
convention. The public is welcome to attend; tickets are $125 and
may be purchased by calling (602) 340-7308. &QL;

HIDEOUS KINKY: TASTELESS THRILLER WASTES FINE TRAVOLTA PERFORMANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Travolta is so vivid an actor, and his emotional life in
movies is so deep that to see him do what he does in ``The
General's Daughter'' is almost a revelation. Walking through the
picture as Paul Brenner, a military intelligence officer
investigating the particularly outlandish murder of a female
captain who turns out to be the daughter of a general with
political aspirations, Travolta gives off a spirit of acceptance.
After a career of playing characters who feel deeply _ in some
cases, maybe too deeply _ Travolta for the first time acts with a
sense of showy nonchalance. In one exchange, he says, ``My father
was a drunk, a gambler and a womanizer. ... I worshipped him.''
He's never had the chance to dry out his material in this way
before. Not even in ``Get Shorty,'' where the role was as much
about his delivery as it was about the dialogue. Some of the lines
here are the best material he's ever had. He's doing Bogart.
</P>
<P>
   If Brenner had been written as a man of deep cynicism who was
using the military as a way to create a career for himself, maybe
``Daughter'' would seem less opportunistic, less a movie willing to
do anything for an effect. But instead, ``The General's Daughter''
takes the easy way out. Travolta goes on about integrity and honor,
and you wonder how he manages to make these speeches without
laughing. It's a garish and obscenely over-directed thriller/buddy
movie. In ``Daughter,'' the buddy is a woman _ somebody's idea of
enlightenment, no doubt _ Sarah Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe), another
Criminal Investigation Division officer. And the staging of the
murder is baroque. The victim, Capt. Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie
Stefanson) is found naked, spread-eagled and tied to stakes. It's
such a freakish crime scene that you may find it hard to
concentrate on anything else as the investigation takes place.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are, of course, everybody in the movie, including
her father, Gen. Joe Campbell (James Cromwell). After Travolta and
Stowe bounce from one suspect to another, ``Daughter,'' set in the
sweltering South, attempts to blend the outrageousness of Tennessee
Williams with a murder mystery. James Woods is the victim's
commanding officer, who seems to be hiding enough information to
fill another movie. With his wolfish sneer and flamboyant contempt,
Woods, to quote a line used about him in the 1981 film
``Eyewitness,'' was born a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest scenes in the movie don't even revolve around the
climax, since the eventual reasons behind the murder are so
ridiculous. Instead, the most watchable scenes are between Travolta
and Woods, which are all about a perverse exhibit of machismo and
the psychological game of one-upmanship they play.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of the movie, as directed by Simon West (who
directed ``Con Air,'' perhaps one of the stupidest, most
ostentatious pictures ever made), has a lurid one-upmanship going
on as well. It's as if he's compelled to upstage the plot: e.g.,
``Daughter'' features one of the most insanely overdone rape scenes
ever committed to film _ it's as if rape isn't vile enough on its
own, and West has to raise the stakes. And the tacked-on legend
about life in the military for women is a real violation. As if,
with all of the news over the past few years of what women have had
to suffer at the hands of superior officers, we need half-baked
fiction to draw our attention to it.

FACTS HAZY ABOUT EPIC GUNFIGHT AT OK CORRAL  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CLAY THOMPSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ To begin with, ``OK Corral'' has a nice, snappy,
Western sound, perfect for the site of a shoot-'em-up.
</P>
<P>
   If the event had taken place at, say, Fred's Corral or the OK
Bathhouse, the Old West's most famous gunfight might not have
become so famous.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to the fuzziness of contemporary accounts _ plus all
the subsequent yarn spinning and moviemaking and book writing _ the
history of that bloody day is still not particularly certain and
the story is all the more enduring.
</P>
<P>
   This much, we think, we know for sure:
</P>
<P>
   About 2:30 p.m. Oct. 26, 1881, in a vacant lot behind the OK
Corral in Tombstone, Ariz., Virgil Earp, the marshal of Tombstone;
his brothers Wyatt and Morgan, and their pal John ``Doc'' Holliday
shot it out with brothers Ike and Billy Clanton, Tom and Frank
McLaury, and Billy Claiborne.
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting stopped 27 seconds later, more than 30 shots
had been fired. Wyatt Earp was unscathed, his brothers were
seriously wounded and Holliday had a scratch.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the McLaurys and Billy Clanton were killed,
Billy begging right up to the end for someone to hand him one
bullet so he could get another shot off at the Earps.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, 2,000 people turned out for the funerals of
Clanton and the McLaurys.
</P>
<P>
   The story Hollywood has given us casts the Earps and Holliday as
white-hatted lawmen, outnumbered but bravely facing the blazing
guns of a passel of no-good rustlers.
</P>
<P>
   The truth of course, if there is any, is less clear-cut. The
Earps and their hangers-on drifted into Arizona about 1880 from
Dodge City, Kan., where they had been known as the Fighting Pimps.
</P>
<P>
   The Clanton faction, on the other hand, were ranchers, though
not exactly noble sons of the prairies. They had been accused over
the years of rustling, thievery, harboring fugitives and general
orneriness.
</P>
<P>
   There was bad blood between the two sides for several months
before things came to a head at the OK Corral.
</P>
<P>
   The story of that bad blood fills several pages of colorful
Arizona history and involves stagecoach robberies, smuggling, women
of doubtful character and various people on both sides taking
potshots at each other and whacking each other over the head.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the feud boils down to this: Wyatt Earp, a
Republican, was banking on being appointed sheriff of the newly
formed Cochise County. Instead, the job went to a Democrat, John
Behan, a Clanton ally.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt's motives were not all based on his thirst for law and
justice. In ``Arizona,'' historian Marshall Trimble notes: ``Being
a law enforcement officer could be quite lucrative in those days
when the citizenry was more tolerant of certain extracurricular
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the shakedowns and tax-skimmings that could have been
his, Wyatt Earp was out about $30,000 or $40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   So the bad blood simmered and boiled until Oct. 26, 1881, a day
that left Tombstone on the western mythology map forever.
</P>
<P>
   In the months following the Gunfight at the OK Corral, Wyatt
Earp and Doc Holliday faced a monthlong hearing on murder charges
and were cleared. Virgil Earp was wounded in an assassination
attempt and Morgan Earp was murdered while shooting pool. Wyatt
Earp eventually killed three men he believed murdered his brother
and left Cochise County for Colorado, never to return. &QL; 
John Behan went on to serve as superintendent of the territorial
prison in Yuma.
</P>
<P>
   Ike Clanton eventually was shot and killed by a private
detective. Virgil Earp died in Nevada in 1905. Holliday died of
tuberculosis in Colorado in 1887.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt Earp died in 1929 in Los Angeles, hoping to the end that
William S. Hart would play him in a movie based on his life. He
didn't. &QL;

REBEL STATUS STARTED EARLY FOR GOV. BUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BUD KENNEDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, the truth has come out about Gov. George W. Bush's
rebel past.
</P>
<P>
   He got busted in Midland, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Not once. Three times.
</P>
<P>
   Busted with a paddle, that is. At 9, young George was nabbed for
disrupting the peace in his fourth-grade classroom _ by using a
ballpoint pen to draw himself a mustache and matching sideburns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, that landed Bush in the principal's office for a brief
lesson in personal responsibility and three whacks from the feared
``board of education.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, that's about it for dirt on George W. Bush. It took the
Midland Reporter-Telegram to unearth retired school administrator
John Bizilo, the principal who had to paddle the future governor of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good kid,'' Bizilo, 80, said Wednesday by phone from
Midland. He laughed as he remembered the day when a Sam Houston
Elementary School teacher escorted in a young boy with hand-drawn
sideburns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was when Elvis was big,'' Bizilo said. ``George came in
with these big ol' Elvis sideburns. Except he added a mustache and
goatee, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bizilo knew Bush's parents well. Father George Bush, the future
U.S. president, was then president of the school's parent-teacher
association, and lobbied the school board to create Midland's first
elementary school libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never said a word to me,'' Bizilo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know they still remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   They do.
</P>
<P>
   The young Bush's ``brush with authority'' came up in a recent
Texas Monthly profile. The way Barbara Bush heard it, her
first-born ``sort of swaggered in, obviously making light of the
fact that he was in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, plenty of boys swaggered into the principal's office.
Not many swaggered out.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's teacher, Frances Childress, asked Bizilo if she could
paddle him herself. ``I said no, let me see him,'' Bizilo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had marked all over himself with a ball-point pen,
something you couldn't just wash out. I paddled him for creating a
disturbance in her classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bizilo remembered Bush, he said, because ``he had made such a
mess. He became a laughingstock.''
</P>
<P>
   He described Bush in the Midland newspaper as ``a little old
bantam-rooster type.'' Wednesday, Bizilo said he meant the
fourth-grader ``was always taking a leadership role. He spoke his
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything but high praise for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoolhouse paddles are portrayed today as sadistic weapons, but
Bizilo said his ``board'' was a basic model, ``more like a big
ruler.'' In 34 years with the Midland schools, 20 as a principal,
he said he rarely paddled anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not every boy you paddle goes on to become the governor.''

BROADWAY SINGER SWINGS THROUGH PANTHEON OF POP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Apart from their shared penchant for white shoes,
David Bowie and Burt Bacharach aren't exactly musical twin sons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in her impressive new cabaret act, Karen Fineman manages to
yoke the two icons, confiding that as a teen-ager her gods were the
Thin White Duke and the World's Coolest Man.
</P>
<P>
   Fineman's pantheistic approach to pop music serves her well. In
her too-brief run last week at the Cinegrill in Hollywood, she
neatly balanced breezy, romantic sophistication, a la Bacharach,
with the husky, hard-edged sensuality of a '70s rock 'n' roll bad
girl. Though a respiratory ailment forced the L.A.-bred singer to
cancel two shows, on Saturday Fineman fearlessly pushed her voice
toward high-pitched emotional disclosures before slamming on the
brakes and touching down for graceful landings.
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished Broadway musical performer (``Les Miserables,''
``City of Angels''), Fineman probably is best-known in her hometown
for playing opposite Jason Alexander in the 1997 Reprise! concert
version of the 1968 Bacharach-Hal David hit ``Promises, Promises.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Cinegrill, she reprised that show's title song, along
with ``I'll Never Fall in Love Again'' and ``Knowing When to
Leave,'' confidently handling Bacharach's tortuous time signatures
and imparting a sadder-but-wiser feel to these uptempo tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off with a resilient rendition of ``Something's
Coming,'' she rolled through a challenging, well-paced set that
suggested what the Broadway musical needs now isn't love, sweet
love, but more rhythmic muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the steady quartet of guitarist Jay Condiotti, drummer
Mark Z. Stevens, bassist Trey Henry and musical director Michael
Orland on piano, Fineman brought a wailing bluesiness to numbers
like ``I Dreamed a Dream,'' the quasi-rock anthem from ``Les Miz''
and a slow erotic sizzle to ``Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   She also demonstrated a welcome willingness to showcase
contemporary songwriters like Lindy Robbins and John Bochino, the
best of which was a suddenly single woman's poignantly ironic plea
to a Starbucks latte boy to ``bring me java, bring me joy.'' &QL;

SAN FRANCISCO MEDIA COMPANY FOR SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMILY GURNON, JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 and SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a move that could result in dramatic changes
in the media marketplace here, the owners of the San Francisco
Chronicle and KRON-TV have authorized the sale of the parent
company, Chronicle Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing had told its investment bankers ``to
explore the sale of all or some of the company,'' a spokesman said.
The statement was released after a 3 1/2-hour meeting of the
company's board of directors Wednesday in a conference room of the
134-year-old Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Editor Matt Wilson and Managing Editor Jerry Roberts,
meeting with the newspaper's staff soon afterward, said an
``incremental step'' had been taken in a process that would unfold
over several months, at a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing consists of three newspapers, three
television stations, a cable television station, two book
publishing companies and an on-line information service. It employs
3,200 people nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Two sources familiar with the private deliberations Wednesday
said the vote to sell was 9 to 0, with one director absent. The
sources said the board expressed no preference as to whether the
company should be sold in its entirety or in parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no conflict. I think people have accepted this as an
inevitability,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   The investment banker authorized to sell the company, Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities of New York, said there were several
prospective buyers. They reportedly include the General Electric
Co., owner of the NBC television network; Fox; Gannett Co. Inc.;
Knight Ridder; the New York Times Co.; the News Corp.; and the
Hearst Corp., which owns San Francisco's evening newspaper, the
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The source declined to cite an asking price but said it would be
closer to $2 billion than $3 billion. If the company were sold in
its entirety, Chronicle Publishing's 44 shareholders would have to
approve the sale, but individual assets may be sold at the board's
discretion, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Previous estimates of the value of the Chronicle Publishing Co.
have ranged from $1.5 billion to $3.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Chronicle and the Examiner have shared all
business costs and split revenues while maintaining editorially
separate operations, under a joint operating agreement commonly
referred to as a JOA.
</P>
<P>
   The JOA grants Hearst the right of first refusal in any sale of
the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing's decision to hire Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette was announced May 10 by the company's chief executive
officer, John Sias.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good market now and a dynamic period,'' said
shareholder Francis A. ``Rani'' Martin II, who formerly headed
KRON-TV Channel 4, an NBC affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   John Morton, president of Morton Research Inc., a Silver Spring,
Md., media consulting company, said: ``It's a seller's market. I
have no doubt the company would be snatched up. Nine times out 10,
this ends up in a sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette will now create a prospectus that
outlines Chronicle Publishing's financial condition, Morton said,
and companies will then be given a period of time to bid.
</P>
<P>
   A Chronicle shareholder who attended the board meeting Wednesday
and spoke on condition of anonymity said he would not let sentiment
stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never fall in love with a business,'' the shareholder
said. ``There comes a time to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle staff members had anticipated the development and they
took it in stride Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Steven Rubenstein said the mood of the newspaper's
staff of more than 350 was apprehensive but far from bleak. Many
people joked about their employer's fate and their own; many also
resolved to bring as much dedication to their jobs as they have in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Hall, a Chronicle reporter and president of the
journalists' union, the Newspaper Guild, believes it will be months
before a decision to sell is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should all try to stay calm and do our jobs,'' Hall said.
``We have a union with solid agreements and strong protections
through 2005,'' when the JOA expires. ``The business realities and
legal and union realities are rather complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing is owned by descendants of co-founder
Michael H. de Young, or the legal trusts of those descendants. De
Young and his brother Charles founded the newspaper in San
Francisco in 1865, 22 years before William Randolph Hearst acquired
the Examiner, his first newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Chronicle and KRON-TV, the company owns ABC
and NBC affiliates in Wichita, Kan., and Omaha, Neb. It owns two
other newspapers, the Bloomington Pantagraph in Illinois and the
Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing also owns the on-line service SFGate, cable
news channel BayTV and two book publishers: MBI in Wisconsin and
Chronicle Books in San Francisco.

</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers have speculated that KRON-TV may command up
to $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Chronicle newspaper is more speculative,
sources said, because of its binding legal and financial
relationship with Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Morton estimated that the newspaper could sell for $400 million
to $1 billion. He based his estimate on recent sales of other
properties with comparable circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Chronicle Publishing Co. and the Hearst Corp. are
privately owned and neither discloses its financial data, but the
publisher of company profiles, Hoover's, estimated that Chronicle
Publishing's sales totaled $485 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst _ one of the nation's largest media companies, with
holdings that include newspapers, magazines and television stations
_ has expressed a strong interest in acquiring its morning
newspaper competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say officials of both organizations have been in contact
for several years, discussing scenarios under which the Examiner
would acquire its rival.
</P>
<P>
   No deal has been made in the past, however, because Chronicle
Publishing shareholders controlling a majority of the company's
stock were believed to oppose such a sale. That has changed in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been generally recognized by people in the business that
two-thirds of Chronicle family members have been ready to sell if
the price is right,'' said Ben Bagdikian, dean emeritus of the
Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``These days, prices are super-right.''
</P>
<P>
   A sale to Hearst would be reviewed by the Department of Justice.
Federal antitrust laws generally require the divestment of multiple
media outlets in the same market, although Chronicle Publishing has
an exemption permitting it to own the newspaper and TV station.
</P>
<P>
   Paid circulation of the Chronicle for the six-month period
ending March 31 was 475,244 Monday through Friday, and 435,792 on
Saturday, according to the independent newspaper auditing company,
the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   Like many major metropolitan dailies, including the Examiner,
the Chronicle's circulation has declined in recent years. In 1986,
the Chronicle's paid circulation was 551,545 Monday through Friday
and 500,747 on Saturday, according to the ABC. The evening
Examiner's daily circulation is 121,000.

   A treasury of priceless glass in a land of free-flowing wine:
how good an idea is this?
</P>
<P>
   Good enough, it turns out, if the combination pairs the
strikingly expanded Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y., and
the vineyard-ringed Finger Lakes. You can taste your way through
dozens of wineries hugging the hillsides along the sky-blue waters
and tour the world's most comprehensive collection of art glass and
high-tech exhibits in a new section, opening Saturday, of a $62
million glass-sheathed addition to the museum. (Or more prudently,
perhaps, you can do it the other way around.)
</P>
<P>
   Either way, when combined with visits to the region's other
attractions, it makes for a rewarding foray from New York City,
notwithstanding an almost five-hour drive. Corning, about 270 miles
northwest of Manhattan, is also home to the Rockwell Museum
enshrining the rich Western art and Carder Steuben glass
collections of a local magnate, Robert F. Rockwell Jr., and is
prettily bisected by the 19th-century throwback Market Street,
listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   Within short drives on blessedly uncrowded roads are Watkins
Glen with its waterfalls and car racing track; the National
Warplane Museum at the Elmira-Corning Regional Airport and other
aviation landmarks, and of course the lakes, more than 11 of them,
from Cayuga and Seneca (40 miles and 35 miles long, respectively)
to modest little fingerlings like Cayuta and Lamoka and Waneta,
clawed out of the earth as if by giant bear paws.
</P>
<P>
   Corning is New York state's third-biggest tourist attraction,
after New York City and Niagara Falls. It has been drawing growing
numbers of visitors since the Corning Glass Center opened in 1951,
becoming overnight a mecca for the Levittown generation happy to
pile into the station wagon for a scenic drive upstate and a free
(until 1981) tour of the glassworks.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a retro feel to the leisurely paced city and
resort region, from the old red-brick factory buildings and
push-button stoplights to the lakeview restaurants, tour boats,
dinner cruises and waving motor-boaters whose gentle wakes rock the
shorefront docks.
</P>
<P>
   But today's visitors to Corning coming off Route 17 onto 414 see
something new: tilting sheets of glass hung on delicate steel
spider supports, the crystal facade of a new entrance building and
galleries, designed by the Manhattan architectural firm
Smith-Miller &AMP; Hawkinson, that represent the second stage in a
three-part expansion under way since 1993 and set for completion
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how they make glass?'' I felt the need to ask our
8-year-old daughter as we drove up, determined, as parents are, to
turn everything into a Learning Experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They blow it,'' Sophie said, barely looking up from her Game
Boy. ``Don't act like I'm stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth I didn't really know myself how glass was made, except
that it came from sand. I didn't think much about glass at all in
fact, except when it held something potable. Like most people, I
looked through it, not at it.
</P>
<P>
   The museum set us straight. Glass isn't just one material, and
it isn't just made from sand. Glass is a hybrid of a solid and a
liquid, a glassy state of matter, and almost any material
(including metal) can be made into a glass by melting it so that
the molecules rearrange themselves randomly, as in a liquid, and
then rapidly cooling it so that it hardens before the molecules can
return to their regular positions.
</P>
<P>
   Nature makes glass in volcanos and from lightning strikes on
sand. Humans began making glass about 4,000 years ago; it's the
oldest man-made material after bronze.
</P>
<P>
   We could believe that after looking at some of the extraordinary
creations in the ``Treasures'' exhibition, a selection of 200 of
the finest and rarest objects in the museum's 30,000-piece
collection. It included the exquisite thumb-size head of a pharaoh
dated 1431 to 1411 B.C., once cobalt blue, now coated tan with age,
and a similarly coated tiny green glass Venus of Knidos, from the
first to second century A.D. There was a Roman ``cage cup'' from
about A.D. 300, carved almost impossibly intricately into a lacy
weave, and, on the large side, an 1878 French table assembled from
200 pieces of Baccarat glass. While my wife, Debbie, and I oohed
and aahed over the displays, Sophie was happily preoccupied with
one of the museum's ``explainers'' who specialize in entertaining
and informing young minds.
</P>
<P>
   In one new gallery devoted to windows _ shouldn't it have been
called ``Windows '99''? _ we saw how windows used to be made from
hand-blown glass bubbles spun rapidly into a disk, which explained
the wavy distortions of the glass in old houses. Although machines
were making flat glass by 1901, it was not until the late 1950s
that a British engineer, Sir Alastair Pilkington, figured out how
to create virtually endless sheets of perfectly flat glass by
floating molten glass on a river of liquid tin, a process that
helped revolutionize architecture.
</P>
<P>
   An egg-shaped theater was the setting for the story of the
struggle to make light bulbs once Edison harnessed electricity to
light. The first bulbs were hand blown from left-over blobs of
glass. When legions of glass blowers couldn't fill the huge demand
for light bulbs in the 1920s, a Corning worker developed a
mechanized process. (More than half the museum's 30 major exhibits
celebrate inventions outside Corning, and only a handful relate to
the company's products, which no longer include its name-brand
cookware.)
</P>
<P>
   No glass museum would be complete without glass blowing of
course, and Corning has a ``Hot Glass Show'' with orange-glowing
2,100-degree gas ovens where artisans melt glass at the end of long
steel pipes and blow and shape it into vases.
</P>
<P>
   We had booked accommodations at $330 for two nights with
breakfast in a Victorian bed and breakfast, the Rosewood Inn, an
1855 Greek Revival and English Tudor house on East First Street in
Corning, a few blocks from downtown and the museum. Children are
supposed to be 12 or older, but Suzanne Sanders, who runs the inn
with her husband, Stewart, was sympathetic when I told her over the
telephone that we had a young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lie to me,'' Mrs. Sanders urged. ``Tell me she's 10.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Our quarters were a parlor suite with its own entrance that had
once been a doctor's office. It had a canopy bed for us and a
daybed and television for Sophie and flounces and flocking galore.
(If we had been alone, we would have preferred one of the five
airier rooms upstairs.) The breakfasts were sumptuous affairs
served family style with other guests around a huge formal
Victorian dining table scattered with silk roses and strings of
costume pearls.
</P>
<P>
   It was a short walk to historic Market Street, five blocks of
old storefronts that called up words like ``dry goods'' and
``emporium'': the kind of street, Debbie said, ``where you call me
`ma' and you're `pa.''' We wandered into several glass galleries _
Noslo and Vitrix and Lost Angel Glass _ disappointed that the glass
blowers were off for the weekend and even more disappointed to find
that a nearby glass studio where you could blow your own glass,
Hands-on Glass on Baker Street, couldn't take us in the tight time
window we had available.
</P>
<P>
   We bought sweets at Heavenly Confections, where the gummy babies
were 2 cents apiece, and the saleswoman actually weighed out one
piece of pink grapefruit candy, costing 4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   After the glass museum, Corning's top attraction is the Rockwell
Museum, which is not named for Norman Rockwell but for the Corning
merchant who assembled the collection. The museum is unmissable
downtown in the towering 1893 former City Hall. With Sophie busying
herself making bookmarks and other handicrafts in what has to be
one of the best-equipped museum children's rooms anywhere, we
explored the extensive Western art and American Indian collection
of Rockwell, now retired, who ran a successful Americana-style
department store on Market Street: ``Ralph Lauren before Ralph
Lauren,'' in the words of the museum's director, Stuart A. Chase.
</P>
<P>
   There was one of Frederic S. Remington's last paintings, ``The
Winter Campaign,'' a beautifully lighted snowscape from 1909; an
N.C. Wyeth painting of an anxious prairie couple; canvases
romanticizing the noble Indian and cowboy (Western art for Eastern
audiences, Chase said), and, yes, an Indian hunting scene by Norman
Rockwell. From there we moved on to the glass collection, including
extraordinary pieces by Frederick Carder, whose Steuben (pronounced
stoo-BEN) Glass Works, later bought by Corning, produced some of
the most exquisite art treasures in glass.
</P>
<P>
   Fragile glassware safely behind us, we drove along the western
brow of Seneca Lake for wine tastings at the Castel Grisch Estate
Winery and Glenora Wine Cellars, returning to Watkins Glen at the
southern tip of the lake for an excellent dinner of shrimp, steak
and monkfish fillets in the new taupe-and-ivory Seasons restaurant
in the Watkins Hotel, a local landmark undergoing restoration.
</P>
<P>
   To Sophie's grave displeasure, we had to forgo an exploration of
the gorge with its waterfalls and 832 stone steps, as well as the
nearby race track.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we set off on another wine trail along the western
shore of Keuka Lake, stopping at Dr. Konstantin Frank's Vinifera
Wine Cellars, where some European grape varieties were first
successfully transplanted to the region, and Bully Hill Vineyards,
where a birthday celebration and wine tasting was in rollicking
progress.
</P>
<P>
   After exploring Hammondsport, with its postage-stamp village
green and several antiques shops, we dined on crab cakes, stuffed
lobster tail, steak and salad on the terrace of a lakeside
restaurant, Snug Harbor. We waved at passing boats, and Sophie went
down to the dock to leave bread for a creature she called a blue
heron or herring. We never got the story straight.

`TARZAN': MONKEY BUSINESS _ REWRITING THE JUNGLE BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every age gets the ``Tarzan'' it deserves, from the gung-ho
jungle swinger of Johnny Weissmuller's day to the culture-shocked
repatriated Englishman of the 1984 ``Greystoke: The Legend of
Tarzan, Lord of the Apes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time for the Disney version: a supple long-haired hunk
who so benefits from inter-species adoption that he thinks of
himself as a differently abled ape. ``I'll be the best ape ever!''
this young Tarzan declares, courting the same A for attitude to
which the movie itself aspires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best ape ever'' is a tall order. But it's nothing compared
with the film's own challenge of bringing new life to such
overworked material (this is the 48th Tarzan movie) and escaping
the stock characters and increasingly ironclad formulas of recent
Disney animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' initially looks and sounds like more of the same, to
the point where Phil Collins is singing the words ``trust your
heart'' by the third line of his opening song. But it proves to be
one of the more exotic blooms in the Disney hothouse, what with
voluptuous flora, hordes of fauna, charming characters and
excitingly kinetic animation that gracefully incorporates
computer-generated motion.
</P>
<P>
   Though it relinquishes some of Disney's toehold on an adult
audience for animation, ``Tarzan'' is sprightly and likable in ways
that are hard to resist. The exultant agility of its jungle scenes
makes it clear that an animated version of this story really is
something new. No tweeting and rustling in the undergrowth to
simulate wildlife here; this is a movie that can send flocks of
parrots or hordes of blue baboons flying whenever it cares to, and
can turn Tarzan into a gloriously athletic creature capable of
hurtling along on the branches of trees. (The star animator Glen
Keane borrowed Tarzan's daredevil moves from his skateboarding
teen-age son.) And for better or worse, this is a version in which
the apes can say what's on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   In a film with more traumatic experiences than its G rating
indicates, two families have to be destroyed before the
lighthearted part begins. One family is simian and the other human,
but the film treats that as a difference only the small-minded
would notice. ``Kala, look at it,'' says the ape whose mate brings
home the orphaned baby boy. ``It's not our kind.'' But Kala, who
has the soothing voice of Glenn Close, prevails and joins Collins
in a rousing ode to motherhood (a catchy bit of Oscar-bait called
``You'll Be in My Heart'').
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, it's a relief this time to find the songs used as
background music rather than narrative devices. That way Tarzan
never has to sing a soliloquy about his secret hopes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Little Tarzan's upbringing is presented in ways meant to draw
chuckles of recognition from parents in the audience. And Rosie
O'Donnell provides more overt comic relief as the voice of his
wisecracking little ape cousin. (``Tell me I'm not lookin' at the
hairless wonder!'') Cute childhood antics, interspersed with the
occasional unmotivated leopard attack, keep the first half of the
film going until Tarzan morphs into manhood during an especially
deft and fluid montage. This time, in a film directed by Kevin Lima
and Chris Buck, the mixture of two-dimensional backgrounds and
freewheeling computer-generated camera movements succeeds
beautifully in giving a fresh, vigorous look to such fanciful
action.
</P>
<P>
   The grown-up Tarzan is a wonderfully nimble Adonis, combining a
vocabulary of human and animal movements with an ease that only
animation can achieve. With sharply angular features and the smooth
voice of Tony Goldwyn, the actor who also directed ``A Walk on the
Moon,'' he cuts a romantic figure even before chattering Jane
Porter arrives on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   With Sir Nigel Hawthorne as Professor Porter, Jane's father, and
much verve from Minnie Driver as Tarzan's adorably drawn dream
girl, the film finds many ways to contrast English scientists with
carefree jungle creatures, as in a jazzy musical sequence that
monkeys with the visitors' travel gear. One nice and not unexpected
touch, given the film's overall sensibility, is a smart,
resourceful Jane who has science on her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Since Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan was not headed for a happy
ending, the Disney version flails noticeably in finding a sunny
resolution for its story. But the young viewers for whom this film
will play best are liable to be more interested in hummable tunes,
splendiferous jungle scenes and the hero's total lack of body fat
than in wondering in which culture he really belongs.

`THE RED DWARF': GROTESQUES AND CLOWNS IN SURREAL FANTASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deep in the heart of every man, an angry, persecuted dwarf is
screaming for revenge. But once that lonely inner dwarf realizes
that everybody else also has a goblin trapped inside, redemption is
possible. After all, human proportion is in the eyes of the
beholder. And in the end, aren't all of us ``little'' people crying
out for recognition and dignity in the rough-and-tumble traveling
circus of life?
</P>
<P>
   That is the sentimental-verging-on-mawkish message of the
Belgian director Yvan Le Moine's first feature film, ``The Red
Dwarf.'' The black-and-white movie, adapted from a short story by
the French writer Michel Tournier, is a labored allegorical fantasy
that belongs to the sad-clown European tradition of ``Les Enfants
du Paradis'' and ``La Strada.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Red Dwarf'' never comes close to matching those
forerunners in emotional power or symbolic weight, it has enough
bizarre imagery and plot twists to keep you chasing after its
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a surreal present that resembles the 1940s in some scenes
and more recent decades in others, ``The Red Dwarf'' is the story
of Lucien Lhotte (Jean-Yves Thual), a dwarf-size law clerk in his
30s who has a job writing incriminating letters used as false
evidence in divorce cases. One day, the firm's most important
client, the Countess Paola Bendoni (Anita Ekberg), a mountainous
fading opera diva intent on divorcing her unfaithful husband, Bob
(Arno Chevrier), summons Lucien to her villa to go over some bogus
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   Impulsively, the love-starved law clerk bares himself naked to
the countess, who welcomes him into her bed as an intriguing sexual
novelty. The affair ends abruptly when Bob and Paola decide to
reconcile, leaving Lucien heartbroken. Stealing into the countess'
house while she is upstairs making love with Bob, Lucien gets
drunk, dons one of her blond wigs along with eye makeup and
lipstick, and in a flamboyantly operatic gesture strangles her when
she comes down the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Bob, fearing he'll be accused of the murder, disappears, while
Lucien, chafing under the contemptuous thumb of his employers,
misbehaves at work, dressing foppishly and doing bird and animal
imitations. Then with one outrageous scatological gesture, he
quits. Lucien ends up joining a local traveling circus in which he
has already befriended Isis Colombe (Dyna Gauzy), an angelic
12-year-old acrobat who offers innocent, unconditional love. Lucien
eventually helps Bob escape the country, and they team up to form a
hugely successful clown act in which the tiny Lucien regularly
clobbers his loutish circus partner.
</P>
<P>
   With its smudged cinematography, raucous circus music, abruptly
shifting perspective (some scenes are shot looking up and close-ups
turn faces into grotesque caricatures), ``The Red Dwarf'' aspires
toward an Expressionistic grandeur. Although the film has plenty of
narrative energy, what is glaringly missing in the film is a
compelling central performance.
</P>
<P>
   Wide-eyed and poker-faced, Thual's suffering Everyman, Lucien,
is an expressive cipher who runs the gamut of primal emotions from
blankness to boredom. A face that should be etched with all the
sorrows of the world is devoid of poetry. The actor is at his
liveliest executing circus stunts. Ms. Ekberg, last seen a decade
ago as herself in Fellini's ``Intervista,'' has metamorphosed into
the kind of devouring gargoyle that the term Felliniesque was
coined to describe.

HOUSE REJECTS STRICT LIMIT ON SEXUAL OR VIOLENT MATERIAL FOR MINORS
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House rejected a proposal Wednesday that would
have placed strict prohibitions on the sale and dissemination of
explicitly sexual or violent material to minors as members began
consideration of juvenile crime and gun control bills in the wake
of the Colorado school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The 282-146 vote against restricting the sales of video games,
movies, music, books, art and other forms of entertainment followed
several hours of spirited debate over whether the measure sponsored
by Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., would violate
the Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the House approved an amendment in
direct response to the Littleton, Colo., school shootings and
bombings that would crack down harder on major juvenile crime by
imposing tougher penalties and making it easier for minors to be
tried and incarcerated as adults. The measure, sponsored by Rep.
Bill McCollum, R-Fla., was approved 249-181, despite attempts by
some Democrats to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said she was concerned that
the McCollum amendment ``ignores studies'' indicating that tougher
penalties don't necessarily result in reduced crime. She called on
her fellow lawmakers to do more in the area of prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The McCollum measure, she said, ``locks up our juveniles. It
throws away the key and it doesn't focus us on rehabilitation and
prevention programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The votes cleared the way for a debate today on several gun
control measures that were hammered out in response to the
Columbine High School tragedy in which 14 students and one teacher
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, over Democratic objections, succeeded in
separating most of the gun control issues opposed by the National
Rifle Association from the juvenile crime bill, hoping to avoid a
contentious debate that might end up killing legislation to
strengthen enforcement efforts targeted at the nation's youth.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate over the Hyde amendment and other crime measures
sparked a number of angry exchanges, including a few over GOP
efforts to focus the debate more on ``cultural problems''
associated with youth violence rather than the guns used to commit
much of that violence.
</P>
<P>
   Waving a gun and a television remote control at his colleagues,
Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., accused Republicans of trying to avoid
the hard decisions required to help limit youth access to guns by
muddying the waters with a debate over violence as depicted in the
entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of gun control, we're doing remote control,'' Wexler
bellowed. ``Instead of going after NRA, we're going after NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., said he was concerned that
Republicans were intent on spending ``more time debating why a
child shouldn't see a handgun on TV instead of how to keep a child
from getting his hands on a handgun in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the attacks on Republican motives, Hyde insisted that
while common sense gun controls are important in the fight against
juvenile crime, Congress has an obligation to ``stand with''
parents and help them ``slow the flood of toxic waste into our
kids' minds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's critical that Congress address some of the
cultural issues ... that cause children to get a gun and commit a
violent act,'' he said, adding that passing more gun laws ``won't
get at the heart of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is that many youngsters have been
overexposed to violence,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Hyde amendment, which included a number of his
Republican colleagues on the judiciary panel, said it amounted to
an unconstitutional attack on First Amendment rights. If passed and
upheld by the courts, they said it could lead to censorship of
family movies and even nursery rhymes containing references to
violent acts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas, called it ``an unparalleled attack
on the first amendment,'' while Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said it
would outlaw the rental and sale of Academy Award-winning movies
like ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A dealer who sells a `Shakespeare in Love' video would be
subject to criminal sanctions,'' she asserted, while a dealer who
peddles automatic weapons designed solely to kill people would not.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyde amendment would have placed severe restrictions on
youth access to art. For example, Democrat and Republican opponents
noted that it would prohibit minors in some instances from viewing
sculpture depicting female and male nude forms.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said his colleague's proposal would
``create a police force'' to decide what is decent, violent or
pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   He wondered whether popular movies with depictions of violence
like ``Home Alone'' or ``Saving Private Ryan'' would be subject to
censor.
</P>
<P>
   Included in some of the other measures passed by the House on
Wednesday were penalties designed specifically to address firearms
taken to school by students.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment approved 296-133 would prohibit federal courts
from imposing early release programs because of prison crowding or
other conditions. The measure was sponsored by House Majority Whip
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who told his colleagues that ``all the talk
about fighting crime and keeping children safe boils down to
nothing if we are not willing to keep prisoners behind bars where
they belong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already passed its own version of the juvenile
crime bill, including extending background checks to pawn shops and
gun shows. The House bill, which will be completed today, is
expected to be weaker on gun control but tougher on penalties for
juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills will have to be merged into one in conference before
a final version can be sent on to the White House for the
president's signature.
</P>
<P>
   A number of amendments could prove too objectionable to
President Clinton and might prompt a veto, including DeLay's
amendment that would severely curtail the authority of federal
judges.

TRACK THE ORIGINS OF WORLD'S FIRST PUBLICLY TRADED COMMERCIAL SPACE
COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All of the pieces for another technological revolution are
coming together. Just look to the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Between 400 and 1,200 miles above us is an area of space called
low-Earth orbit that is being developed for a high-tech
infrastructure that will make the Internet's current on-ground
cable system seem primitive.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't another space race between the U.S. and Soviet
governments. In fact, government has little to do with any of the
development.
</P>
<P>
   This is strictly a commercial endeavor. One with basic profit
motives. Some are calling it the Gold Rush of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The instruments linking this infrastructure have been around for
40 years but have only recently made great boosts in engineering
capabilities and cost reduction, primarily through the efforts of
one small, but brilliant, company.
</P>
<P>
   The company's name is Orbital Sciences Corp., the world's first
publicly traded commercial space company. Its main product stems
from its network of satellites. Orbital's story and that of its
celestial industry are revealed in the book ``Silicon Sky: How One
Small Start-Up Went Over the Top to Beat the Big Boys into
Satellite Heaven'' (Perseus Books, 332 pages, $26).
</P>
<P>
   The book is written by author Gary Dorsey, who spent hundreds of
hours with the company since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   It was just two years earlier when 35 young engineers built a
new kind of rocket they called Pegasus. Revolutionary in concept,
the small rocket was designed to be launched from a B-52 airplane
instead of from the ground. And it's a whopping 90 percent cheaper
than any rocket previously made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rocket ... was roundly dismissed as just another quirky,
blue-sky project when the concept was first unveiled,'' Dorsey
writes. ``But on April 5, 1990 ... the Orbital company ...
demonstrated the first successful expendable launch vehicle in this
country in twenty years. Not since the creation of the space
shuttle had any American company produced a new rocket that
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   The rocket has been used in the past few years to launch a
series of 28 Orbital satellites. The satellites now cover the
globe. With that network, Orbital can design, manufacture, operate
and market total space systems, Dorsey writes. That includes
satellite services, sensors, Earth stations, satellite navigation
and communication products and Earth-imaging products.
</P>
<P>
   And customers are beating down its Virginia door. Orbital space
products will generate more than $1 billion in revenues this year.
Orbital recently became one of the 10 largest satellite-related
companies in North America, with 1998 earnings of $750 million,
Dorsey writes.
</P>
<P>
   This was a company that 10 years earlier kept its doors open by
three of its employees maxing out their credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Orbital is run by a brassy entrepreneur named David Thompson,
who is ``potentially as remarkable in the field of aerospace as
Steven Jobs in the business of personal computing,'' Dorsey
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, in effect, took the exorbitant aerospace world and
turned it on its ear. He invented a concept called ``Microspace''
to explain his business proposal. Microspace is ``finding a way to
provide a level of affordability and ease of use with space
products that make smaller systems attractive to a much larger and
more diverse customer base,'' Thompson says.
</P>
<P>
   Among those customers is VisionStar, which wants Orbital to
build two geostationary satellites for high-speed Internet
connections and broadcasting. Another 12-satellite constellation is
being built for mobile phone service. Orbital's PathMaster vehicle
navigation system is being used on snowplows and herbicide trucks
in four states.
</P>
<P>
   And Thompson and his group have recently introduced the world's
first portable Global Positioning System receiver, priced at less
than $100.
</P>
<P>
   A man with a vision, Thompson says the next revolution in
aerospace would happen, if ``you plug the energy of private capital
into space technology and then get out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The time to step aside _ and watch _ is now.

pages, is one of the definitive bibles of the industry since its
first edition in 1991. This second edition includes changes in the
regulations of franchising made in 1995, as well as the impact of
technology and takeovers in the franchising industry. Issues from
management systems to financial strategies to licensing are
included in this new edition as well.

THIS `VIOLIN' PLAYS A TRAGIC TUNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Put your anger into your work,'' the violin maker Nicolo
(Carlo Cecchi) snarls at one of his apprentices. That chance
statement turns out to be tragically true in ``The Red Violin,''
the newest film from Canadian director Francois Girard, who last
flexed his muscles with the pleasing (if overdirected) ``Thirty-two
Short Films About Glenn Gould.'' After the death of his wife during
childbirth, Nicolo immerses his paintbrush in red and slowly takes
it to the violin he was making for his unborn child, a reminder of
the happiness he has lost.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the violin is cursed, sending a tragic slash through the
lives of those who touch it. Girard and his co-writer, Don McKellar
(who also acts in the film), use the violin for an anthological
touch, starting with Kaspar (Christoph Koncz), the young prodigy
who plays it after Nicolo's wife dies. Georges (Jean-Luc Bideau)
grabs the boy up, seeing a chance for fame and patronage if a
nobleman will take the child. After sawing away at the violin, his
little angel face silent with the strain, Kaspar finally gets an
opportunity to audition in the Royal Court.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one of a few stories _ spanning the globe, as they
used to say on ``Wide World of Sports'' _ in ``Red Violin,'' as the
instrument passes from a tribe of Gypsies (one of whom looks way
too much like Yanni) to China, ending up at an auction house. Here,
Samuel L. Jackson stands, his stately edginess on point, as bids
for the prized violin go on around him. The real star is not
Jackson, nor the violin, but rather Girard's elegant visual
compositions. He provides a picture that moves with courtly poise.
That jittery hunger of his early work has been replaced by
something more self-conscious. By the time Greta Scacchi shows up,
you may have lost interest.
</P>
<P>
   Girard's talent may be to link himself to the personality of his
subject, and with the jumpy, eccentric Gould, he plunged himself
deep into the pianist's rising and falling states. Here, married to
a shifting series of protagonists, he is robbed of a consistent
point of view. His grasp is clearly evident, as the movie changes
tempo from story to story. It lacks a heart, though, despite the
ominous fortuneteller who knows all. (And, given the cliches
stirred up here, so do we.) In the end, we feel as if we're in the
gallery with Jackson, pacing and waiting for something to grab our
attention. The John Corigliano score is so compelling, though, that
it does a lot of the movie's work.

URIS' LATEST BOOK CELEBRATES AMERICA AND A LONG CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Author Leon Uris isn't sure whether ``A God in Ruins''
(HarperCollins, $26), his latest novel, is also his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm old enough _ 74, 75 on Aug. 3 _ to think about gracefully
going out, retiring, like (hockey's) Wayne Gretzky and (football's)
John Elway,'' Uris mused in a phone interview from his home outside
New York City. ``If you've had a good long run, you don't want to
stay out in the public eye a little too long. It shouldn't be like
Frank Sinatra's first retirement, which, after a while, got to be a
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1953, when he debuted on bestseller lists with ``Battle
Cry,'' Uris' writing career has been anything but a joke, though,
like Sinatra, he has had career peaks and valleys.
</P>
<P>
   One dip came after ``QB VII'' in 1970. It took Uris six years to
follow up with the mega-bestseller ``Trinity,'' which he still
counts as his favorite among 11 novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it, it became a renewal of my career,'' Uris says.
``My trip to Ireland to research that book was ethereal. The whole
experience made me realize I must have been Irish in a past life.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``A God in Ruins'' is special to Uris, too, and not only
because he isn't sure he'll ever tackle another book project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say I wrote `A God in Ruins' because I still have to pay my
bills, but the truth is, I needed to write this book,'' Uris says.
``The millennium is here, I've been around for three-quarters of a
century, and it's time to sum up how I feel about America.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Exodus'' to ``Topaz,'' Uris' previous history-based
novels have often had predominantly foreign settings. ``A God in
Ruins'' is specifically American, focusing on the U.S. political
system and national religious prejudices. Protagonist Quinn Patrick
O'Connell, a governor of Colorado, running for president, discovers
in the middle of the 2008 campaign that he is Jewish. This is only
one of the plot twists; others involve terrorists, campaign dirty
tricks and White House sexual high jinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the concept of this book came to me quickly,
researching it took a year and a half,'' Uris recalls. ``There's an
art to researching a book. When you do it over and over as I have,
you learn to avoid a lot of extra information you don't need.
Earlier in my career I tried to learn every damn thing about every
damn subject. A lot of time was wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Even limiting research time hasn't prevented Uris' most recent
books from taking their toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research done correctly, exhaustively if need be, tears your
guts out,'' Uris says. ``You read the same things over and over,
and after a while it gets confusing. A writer has to wade through
differing opinions about moments in history and then, in print,
take a stance. It de-energizes you.''
</P>
<P>
   Once his research is completed, Uris says, the really hard work
begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell aspiring writers the same thing _ forget any glamour.
Writing is sitting down and working, working, working.''
</P>
<P>
   Uris realizes that each of his books is eagerly awaited by fans,
but he refuses to feel any pressure from high public expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope my readers know that I give them the best I can do at
all times,'' he says. ``That eliminates any sense of pressure from
the outside. I put the pressure on myself. And for that reason, for
me, for writers who care, each book destroys you a little bit. Each
ages you.''
</P>
<P>
   But Uris doesn't feel sorry for himself. He doesn't regret the
energy his books have drained from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big upside,'' Uris says. ``Look, I was a poor boy
from a poor Jewish family. It's amazing that I got to be where I
am. How can I in any way be dissatisfied? If, physically, some
results of a misspent youth are tumbling down on me, I'm not going
to complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not ``A God in Ruins'' is his literary swan song,
Uris says, he'd like his readers to know he has been grateful for
the chance to entertain and, he hopes, educate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has been wonderful,'' he says. ``Each writer has only
a few things to say, and I've tried to say my things as well as I
could.''

`PIRATES OF SILICON VALLEY': TWO NERDS TRY TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The swashbuckling title ``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' is
absolutely right for a film about the birth of the computer age.
After all, the tale of the battle for dominance between Apple
Computer and Microsoft is brimming with those age-old elements of
high drama: invention, big bucks and backbiting.
</P>
<P>
   Apple founder Steve Jobs (savvily played by Noah Wyle) is the
visionary and rebel here, as comfortable with cosmic consciousness
as bytes of information. ``It's better to be a pirate than to run
the navy,'' he tells his employees.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft founder Bill Gates (Anthony Michael Hall), now
commonly known as the richest man in the world, is more plodding,
the prototype of the socially inept computer nerd. They are the
tortoise and the hare of the computer age. Improbably, this timid
movie makes them seem as dynamic as a turtle and a bunny.
</P>
<P>
   The meandering ``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' doesn't have a clue
what it wants to be. At times it seems to be about Jobs' amazing
rise and fall. As the film depicts it, he starts Apple, becomes
immensely rich when it goes public, but is fired in the wake of his
own megalomania. The movie ends in 1996 with his return as an
executive to the company now partly owned by Gates. Or, is this the
story of a blood feud between the men and their companies?
</P>
<P>
   The film has a smashing opening scene that gives viewers false
hope. Ridley Scott (played by J.G. Hertzler) is directing his
eerily futuristic commercial for Apple based on the concept of
Orwell's ``1984.'' Jobs gazes into the camera with a seductive
sincerity that helps account for his success. ``I don't want you to
think of this as just a film,'' he says. He is talking to Scott
about the commercial, but of course he is also speaking directly to
us. ``We're creating a completely new consciousness, like an artist
or a poet,'' he says of Apple. ``We're rewriting the history of
human thought.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a grabber of a scene. The flamboyant commercial with its
clonelike humans and Big Brother on a giant screen contrasts with
the hypnotic allure of Wyle's close-up. ``Pirates of Silicon
Valley'' never comes close to such style or cleverness again.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the film is flashing back to the college days of Jobs and
Gates, cross-cutting between the two stories, skimming through
events in the superficial way that has made ``docudrama'' a foul
word.
</P>
<P>
   Each part of the story has its narrator. Jobs' is Steve Wozniak
(Joey Slotnik), who, in one of the more vivid scenes, helps start
Apple in Jobs' parents' garage. With his Hawaiian shirt and aviator
glasses, he is the picture of the California computer geek. Gates'
narrator is Steve Ballmer (John DiMaggio), his balding Harvard
classmate, whose colorless, bean-counting demeanor matches the
image of Microsoft. But if the Gates and Job characters had been
lifelike enough, the film would not have needed narrators to
explain them. And while the alternating structure suggests this is
the story of their competition, the real-life characters and the
casting yell that this should be Steven Jobs' tale.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wyle is famous for ``ER,'' he has also shown (in the film
``The Myth of Fingerprints'') that he can play characters more
complicated than John Carter. By turns high-spirited, sly and
evasive, he makes the most of this bafflingly underwritten role.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs briefly refers to his search for his birth parents, and
though the full story has been written about widely, it doesn't
come up here. (As an adult, he discovered that after he was given
up for adoption, his parents married and had a daughter, who became
the novelist Mona Simpson.) Yet the film's vague allusions to
adoption supposedly have something to do with the way Jobs cruelly
denies that he is the father of his girlfriend's child.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, there is no accounting for his bizarre transformation
from quasi-hippie to Captain Queeg, who makes Apple employees work
90 hours a week and enjoys humiliating them. There is a fascinating
psychodrama in Jobs, but Wyle can't add the inner life the script
denies him.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who is still best known for his long-gone Brat Pack days,
doesn't even live up to the movie's slim possibilities. When Gates,
in a moment that counts for goofiness, speeds along the highway
singing ``My Way,'' the scene should be a lot funnier. At times he
is presented as the pathetic, greasy-haired loner, wounded when the
arrogant Jobs snubs him at a computer fair. Yet even then he
doesn't seem human. The film never strays far from Gates'
conflicted public image as a power-hungry animatron.
</P>
<P>
   The film's failure has to be traced to its writer and director,
Martyn Burke. Though this is the first movie he has directed, he is
an experienced writer who has diminished other juicy subjects in
films like HBO's ``Pentagon Wars,'' a dull-bladed satire about that
easiest of targets, government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   This movie does have what every television movie needs today: a
soundtrack of familiar songs, which includes some refreshingly
appropriate choices like ``Synchronicity'' for the explosive '80s.
That doesn't help much. The last thing anyone needs from a film
called ``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' is a script with the daring of
a scared rabbit.

 By MITCHELL OWENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Design groupies, hold on to your fauteuils: the great
decorator Elsie de Wolfe never designed a single piece of clear
plastic furniture. And certainly not the major example that is
continually attributed to her: a sparkling Lucite side chair with a
plume-shaped back and a seat of luxurious silk velvet printed like
an ocelot's pelt.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the opinion of Alan Moss, a New York furniture
dealer who specializes in midcentury chic. Forget the apocryphal
stories, various de Wolfe biographies and the chair's constant
appearance in photographs of de Wolfe interiors of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grosfeld House made the chair; Elsie de Wolfe just bought
them,'' said Moss, who knows his Lucite lore, top to bottom. He
once owned the makeup diva Helena Rubenstein's clear Lucite sleigh
bed, which was hubristically emblazoned with her cosmetics
company's logo. The headboard and footboard glowed, too, thanks to
concealed fluorescent lights.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast trays as clear as crystal, tables that look as if they
are floating in midair, chairs with legs like columns of spring
water: Lucite is everywhere. One reason for this ubiquity could be
the style world's continued embrace of all things from the Age of
Aquarius. Or perhaps it has something to do with the popularity of
Austin Powers, the superspy portrayed by Mike Myers in the mock
James Bond movie caper ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,''
which opened last week.
</P>
<P>
   While Powers' esthetic sense is dubious, he certainly would have
felt right at home at the recent Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club
Decorator Show House. Peter Vaughn outfitted his acid-green sitting
room there with multicolored acrylic nesting tables, perfect for
the leering lothario to stash a drink before making his move on a
miniskirted model.
</P>
<P>
   And should one of Powers' capers have taken him to the wilds of
North Carolina, the dentally challenged hero could have found the
perfect breakfast tray at the High Point International Furniture
Fair in April: a sleek, clear Lucite breakfast tray by a Texas
company, Creations at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, however, prefers the color-enhanced alternative. ``My
favorite thing about colored Lucite is its hard shine,'' he said.
``From a distance you'd almost think it's lacquer.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Parish-Hadley associate, he recently formed Albrizzi
Design and is reproducing furniture, trays, ice buckets and other
plastic paraphernalia from the archives of Baron Alessandro
Albrizzi, an Italian furniture designer whose candy-color
minimalism was a hit with hip young members of the international
jet set in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The newlyweds Duane and Mark Hampton, for instance, placed
Albrizzi's Lucite occasional tables in their mod Upper East Side
Manhattan apartment in 1966, and the Baron's designs were a firm
favorite with Hampton's employer at the time, the English decorator
David Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   Though the ice-clear material is popularly associated with
disco-chic interiors of the late 1960s, Lucite was born more than
30 years earlier. In 1936 E.I. du Pont &AMP; Co. invented Lucite, the
trademark name for an acrylic resin formally known as polymethyl
methacrylate. Also known as Plexiglas and Perspex (in Britain), the
new acrylic resin was intended to be used for highway reflectors,
automobile taillights, radiator ornaments and airplane windshields,
said Scott Nelson, a spokesman for Du Pont.
</P>
<P>
   By 1938, according to an article in a Du Pont promotional
magazine of the day, Lucite had leapfrogged into the home, and
rarely for practical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``One well known designer,'' the article reported, was addicted
to Lucite, using it for ``doorways, framing pictures and in a
decorative fountain effect'' in her apartment. This unnamed woman
might well have been Cora Scovill, a New Yorker with a penchant for
designing Lucite furniture with bizarre ruffled edges and mirror
insets.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein's glow-in-the-dark bed was one of the campier of
Lucite renditions, although it pales beside some of Scovill's loopy
extravaganzas. In more cautious and considerate hands, the
synthetic material _ cold to look at but warm to the touch,
incredibly smooth, tougher than glass and able to be bent, poured
and molded into any decorative shape _ lent itself particularly
well to classical applications.
</P>
<P>
   A star of Moss' stock at his shop at 436 Lafayette St., at Astor
Place, is a majestic mahogany breakfront made by Grosfeld House in
the 1930s. Its sober neo-classical silhouette is jollied up with
all manner of crystalline plastic appliques: Greek-style helmets on
the mirrored lower doors, half-columns flanking the Lucite-grilled
upper doors and crowning it all a Lucite gallery. Now under
restoration, the breakfront will be priced at $15,500, Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other plastic treasures are a circa-1939
Directoire-style table with saber-style Lucite legs holding aloft a
gilt-and-mirror top, for $9,500, and a similarly dated side chair
with a carved Lucite splat, for $4,600.
</P>
<P>
   Few pieces of vintage Lucite furniture have survived the years
in perfect condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it was stylish but not very easy to maintain,''
Vaughn said. Vulnerable to scratches and scuffs, Lucite furniture,
even at the height of its popularity, was deemed a temporary vogue:
fun but not forever.
</P>
<P>
   But today there is Novus, a plastic polish and scratch remover
that Vaughn buys at Gracious Home and recommends to his clients.
The original Albrizzi designs cast an undeniably minimalist allure,
he admitted, but one of the main reasons ``I decided to reproduce
them was products like Novus,'' Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Products like that make Lucite a viable material
again.''

   RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS/``CALIFORNICATION'' (Warner Bros.)
</P>
<P>
   The Chili Peppers are supposed to be one of the pillars of the
alternative genre, which only goes to prove how musically bankrupt
the entire format is these days. This mediocre thrash outfit, which
long ago stumbled on a couple of Meters albums and thinks it knows
something about syncopation, here attempts a few rewrites of
``Under the Bridge,'' the yawn-inducing band's painfully overrated
1992 hit, along with heaping portions of the usual cliche-ridden
punk-funk.
</P>
<P>
   The much-heralded return of guitarist John Frusciante amounts to
little, since the guy was nothing special to begin with, although
he's on the same musical bottom rung as the rest of these stale
Peppers. ``Californication,'' the band's first album in four years,
simply treads water. 1 1/2 stars &QL; 
_ Fred Shuster &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CAETANO VELOSO/``LIVRO'' (Nonesuch)
</P>
<P>
   The veteran leader of Brazil's (ITALICS)tropicalismo(END ITAL)
movement offers a thoughtful new album replete with references to
his influences, his colleagues and his loves. ``Manhata'' is the
sweetest ode to Manhattan you can imagine _ or that town will ever
deserve; ``Doideca'' evokes the wacky Tom Ze in equally wacky
rhythmic invention. ``Pra Ninguem'' (``For No One'') invokes a
pantheon of fellow Brazilian singers, then says ``Better than this
there's only silence/and better than silence only Joao,''
presumably fellow musical pioneer Joao Gilberto.
</P>
<P>
   Veloso also explores history with an epic song of the slave
ships and a piece about Alexander the Great. Not simple music but
consistently rewarding. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ David Bloom &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CARLINHOS BROWN/``OMELETE MAN'' (metroblue)
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian Brown shows he's a man of many talents on this,
his second album, which is produced by fellow countryman Marisa
Monte. The 15 songs hit every genre _ there are pulsating dance
tracks, lush romantic ballads and joyous Latin-pop. The resulting
hodgepodge should please those drawn to musical eclecticism, not to
mention lively percussion-fueled music. This is a man who puts his
musical eggs in many baskets, and his audience is the better for
it. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CECILIA BARTOLI AND BRYN TERFEL/``IN PARADISUM: REQUIEM''
(Deutsche Grammophon)
</P>
<P>
   When omnipresent Italian mezzo-soprano Bartoli and Welsh
bass-baritone Terfel cut their first duo disc, ``Cecilia and
Bryn,'' a few cynics muttered that the recording was a way to make
fast bucks by regaling the masses with pretty snatches of Mozart
and Rossini. Nonsense. But in any case, this beautifully woebegone
recording, in subtle shades of gray, should silence such chatter.
Though certainly Gabriel Faure's signature work, the ``gentle''
Requiem of 1887, with its gloomy D-minor tonalities, is a bleak bit
of business, redeemed only sporadically by major-key glimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Bartoli and Terfel both are in top form with their reverent
solos, as conductor Myung-Whun Chung skillfully guides the Coro e
Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia through the
Gregorian gloom. Maurice Durufle's more eruptive version is
particularly moving in the plainchant melodies of the ``Agnus
Dei,'' gliding with graceful, impressionistic harmonies toward the
ultimate negation. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Reed Johnson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   10/``BUGGIN' OUT!'' (HiHo Records)
</P>
<P>
   This quartet _ produced by the Dust Brothers for their own label
_ makes happy, dippy pop and hip-hop _ hippy hop for want of a
better term. 10 is hard to dislike, but it doesn't mean you want to
take 'em home to Mom, either. Much of this disc is very
sweet-natured, all boops and tinkles and gentle harmonies. The only
song with a hint of menace, unsurprisingly, is ``Die on the
Ranch,'' which charges up their good time with a hint of something
darker.
</P>
<P>
   Think of this album as beach blanket music for the end of the
millennium, and Frankie and Annette have piercings and tats. 2 1/2
stars

</P>
<P>
   DAVE WECKL BAND/``SYNERGY'' (Stretch/Concord)
</P>
<P>
   After seven years with Chick Corea's electric and acoustic
combos, drummer Weckl has come into his own as a solo artist with a
fresh take on jazz-fusion. For his fifth solo effort, energetic
playing from imaginative groove-masters like guitarist Buzz Feiten
and bassist Tommy Kennedy fuel the lively feel of such standouts as
``Panda's Dream'' and ``High Life.'' Incidentally, the quintet,
also featuring tenor saxophonist Brandon Fields, appears Tuesday
through June 27 at Hollywood's Catalina Bar &AMP; Grill.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Shuster &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GREGG FIELD/``THE ART OF SWING'' (DCC)
</P>
<P>
   Field has played with all the greats _ Joe Williams, Ella
Fitzgerald, Ray Charles and Mel Torme. He was Sinatra's last
drummer (from 1991-96) and produced wife Monica Mancini's
well-regarded debut album. Here on his first solo outing, Field
romps through 11 big-band standards and originals that demonstrate
that he has put all his experience to good use. Working from
arrangements by the talented Sammy Nestico, Field capably propels
his band of local session aces from behind the drum kit,
demonstrating a knack for the very quality that is this album's
title.
</P>
<P>
   Crisp horn charts, great material, talented soloists _ it adds
up to an album that would help you work some magic on the dance
floor. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ Glenn Whipp &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OSEI TUTU/``AWAKENING'' (Tinder)
</P>
<P>
   Osei's Ghanaian high life is more closely related to Western
instrumentation, rhythms and song structures than most sub-Saharan
musical subgenres but still provides a delightful, exotic stew of
bouncing rhythms and skittering guitar. Much of the album is quite
upbeat, despite memorials to Osei's dead father, to Afro-pop
pioneer Fela Kuti and several other recently deceased friends.
Highlights include a paean to the loss of his father, ``Esua,'' a
sad-sweet apology to a lover in ``Waye Basa,'' and Kuti's
``Gentleman.'' 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ David Bloom &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALIOUNE KASSE/``EXSINA'' (Tinder)
</P>
<P>
   A young, second-generation Senegalese musician strongly
influenced by countryman Youssou N'Dour (who played with his
pianist-father in Starband decades ago), Kasse has a lovely voice
and sweet songs, though he works virtually the same upper vocal
register that N'Dour has abandoned in recent years. A solid but not
scintillating slice of Senegal. 2 1/2 stars

<TEXT>
<P>
   A treasury of priceless glass in a land of free-flowing wine:
how good an idea is this?
</P>
<P>
   Good enough, it turns out, if the combination pairs the
strikingly expanded Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y., and
the vineyard-ringed Finger Lakes. You can taste your way through
dozens of wineries hugging the hillsides along the sky-blue waters
and tour the world's most comprehensive collection of art glass and
high-tech exhibits in a new section, opening Saturday, of a $62
million glass-sheathed addition to the museum. (Or more prudently,
perhaps, you can do it the other way around.)
</P>
<P>
   Either way, when combined with visits to the region's other
attractions, it makes for a rewarding foray from New York City,
notwithstanding an almost five-hour drive. Corning, about 270 miles
northwest of Manhattan, is also home to the Rockwell Museum
enshrining the rich Western art and Carder Steuben glass
collections of a local magnate, Robert F. Rockwell Jr., and is
prettily bisected by the 19th-century throwback Market Street,
listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   Within short drives on blessedly uncrowded roads are Watkins
Glen with its waterfalls and car racing track; the National
Warplane Museum at the Elmira-Corning Regional Airport and other
aviation landmarks, and of course the lakes, more than 11 of them,
from Cayuga and Seneca (40 miles and 35 miles long, respectively)
to modest little fingerlings like Cayuta and Lamoka and Waneta,
clawed out of the earth as if by giant bear paws.
</P>
<P>
   Corning is New York state's third-biggest tourist attraction,
after New York City and Niagara Falls. It has been drawing growing
numbers of visitors since the Corning Glass Center opened in 1951,
becoming overnight a mecca for the Levittown generation happy to
pile into the station wagon for a scenic drive upstate and a free
(until 1981) tour of the glassworks.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a retro feel to the leisurely paced city and
resort region, from the old red-brick factory buildings and
push-button stoplights to the lakeview restaurants, tour boats,
dinner cruises and waving motor-boaters whose gentle wakes rock the
shorefront docks.
</P>
<P>
   But today's visitors to Corning coming off Route 17 onto 414 see
something new: tilting sheets of glass hung on delicate steel
spider supports, the crystal facade of a new entrance building and
galleries, designed by the Manhattan architectural firm
Smith-Miller &AMP; Hawkinson, that represent the second stage in a
three-part expansion under way since 1993 and set for completion
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how they make glass?'' I felt the need to ask our
8-year-old daughter as we drove up, determined, as parents are, to

   ``They blow it,'' Sophie said, barely looking up from her Game
Boy. ``Don't act like I'm stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth I didn't really know myself how glass was made, except
that it came from sand. I didn't think much about glass at all in
fact, except when it held something potable. Like most people, I
looked through it, not at it.
</P>
<P>
   The museum set us straight. Glass isn't just one material, and
it isn't just made from sand. Glass is a hybrid of a solid and a
liquid, a glassy state of matter, and almost any material
(including metal) can be made into a glass by melting it so that
the molecules rearrange themselves randomly, as in a liquid, and
then rapidly cooling it so that it hardens before the molecules can
return to their regular positions.
</P>
<P>
   Nature makes glass in volcanos and from lightning strikes on
sand. Humans began making glass about 4,000 years ago; it's the
oldest man-made material after bronze.
</P>
<P>
   We could believe that after looking at some of the extraordinary
creations in the ``Treasures'' exhibition, a selection of 200 of
the finest and rarest objects in the museum's 30,000-piece
collection. It included the exquisite thumb-size head of a pharaoh
dated 1431 to 1411 B.C., once cobalt blue, now coated tan with age,
and a similarly coated tiny green glass Venus of Knidos, from the
first to second century A.D. There was a Roman ``cage cup'' from
about A.D. 300, carved almost impossibly intricately into a lacy
weave, and, on the large side, an 1878 French table assembled from
200 pieces of Baccarat glass. While my wife, Debbie, and I oohed
and aahed over the displays, Sophie was happily preoccupied with
one of the museum's ``explainers'' who specialize in entertaining
and informing young minds.
</P>
<P>
   In one new gallery devoted to windows _ shouldn't it have been
called ``Windows '99''? _ we saw how windows used to be made from
hand-blown glass bubbles spun rapidly into a disk, which explained
the wavy distortions of the glass in old houses. Although machines
were making flat glass by 1901, it was not until the late 1950s
that a British engineer, Sir Alastair Pilkington, figured out how
to create virtually endless sheets of perfectly flat glass by
floating molten glass on a river of liquid tin, a process that
helped revolutionize architecture.
</P>
<P>
   An egg-shaped theater was the setting for the story of the
struggle to make light bulbs once Edison harnessed electricity to
light. The first bulbs were hand blown from left-over blobs of
glass. When legions of glass blowers couldn't fill the huge demand
for light bulbs in the 1920s, a Corning worker developed a
mechanized process. (More than half the museum's 30 major exhibits
celebrate inventions outside Corning, and only a handful relate to
the company's products, which no longer include its name-brand
cookware.)
</P>
<P>
   No glass museum would be complete without glass blowing of
course, and Corning has a ``Hot Glass Show'' with orange-glowing
2,100-degree gas ovens where artisans melt glass at the end of long
steel pipes and blow and shape it into vases.
</P>
<P>
   We had booked accommodations at $330 for two nights with
breakfast in a Victorian bed and breakfast, the Rosewood Inn, an
1855 Greek Revival and English Tudor house on East First Street in
Corning, a few blocks from downtown and the museum. Children are
supposed to be 12 or older, but Suzanne Sanders, who runs the inn
with her husband, Stewart, was sympathetic when I told her over the
telephone that we had a young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lie to me,'' Mrs. Sanders urged. ``Tell me she's 10.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' I said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Our quarters were a parlor suite with its own entrance that had
once been a doctor's office. It had a canopy bed for us and a
daybed and television for Sophie and flounces and flocking galore.
(If we had been alone, we would have preferred one of the five
airier rooms upstairs.) The breakfasts were sumptuous affairs
served family style with other guests around a huge formal
Victorian dining table scattered with silk roses and strings of
costume pearls.
</P>
<P>
   It was a short walk to historic Market Street, five blocks of
old storefronts that called up words like ``dry goods'' and
``emporium'': the kind of street, Debbie said, ``where you call me
`ma' and you're `pa.''' We wandered into several glass galleries _
Noslo and Vitrix and Lost Angel Glass _ disappointed that the glass
blowers were off for the weekend and even more disappointed to find
that a nearby glass studio where you could blow your own glass,
Hands-on Glass on Baker Street, couldn't take us in the tight time
window we had available.
</P>
<P>
   We bought sweets at Heavenly Confections, where the gummy babies
were 2 cents apiece, and the saleswoman actually weighed out one
piece of pink grapefruit candy, costing 4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   After the glass museum, Corning's top attraction is the Rockwell
Museum, which is not named for Norman Rockwell but for the Corning
merchant who assembled the collection. The museum is unmissable
downtown in the towering 1893 former City Hall. With Sophie busying
herself making bookmarks and other handicrafts in what has to be
one of the best-equipped museum children's rooms anywhere, we
explored the extensive Western art and American Indian collection
of Rockwell, now retired, who ran a successful Americana-style
department store on Market Street: ``Ralph Lauren before Ralph
Lauren,'' in the words of the museum's director, Stuart A. Chase.
</P>
<P>
   There was one of Frederic S. Remington's last paintings, ``The
Winter Campaign,'' a beautifully lighted snowscape from 1909; an
N.C. Wyeth painting of an anxious prairie couple; canvases
romanticizing the noble Indian and cowboy (Western art for Eastern
audiences, Chase said), and, yes, an Indian hunting scene by Norman
Rockwell. From there we moved on to the glass collection, including
extraordinary pieces by Frederick Carder, whose Steuben (pronounced
stoo-BEN) Glass Works, later bought by Corning, produced some of
the most exquisite art treasures in glass.
</P>
<P>
   Fragile glassware safely behind us, we drove along the western
brow of Seneca Lake for wine tastings at the Castel Grisch Estate
Winery and Glenora Wine Cellars, returning to Watkins Glen at the
southern tip of the lake for an excellent dinner of shrimp, steak
and monkfish fillets in the new taupe-and-ivory Seasons restaurant
in the Watkins Hotel, a local landmark undergoing restoration.
</P>
<P>
   To Sophie's grave displeasure, we had to forgo an exploration of
the gorge with its waterfalls and 832 stone steps, as well as the
nearby race track.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we set off on another wine trail along the western
shore of Keuka Lake, stopping at Dr. Konstantin Frank's Vinifera
Wine Cellars, where some European grape varieties were first
successfully transplanted to the region, and Bully Hill Vineyards,
where a birthday celebration and wine tasting was in rollicking
progress.
</P>
<P>
   After exploring Hammondsport, with its postage-stamp village
green and several antiques shops, we dined on crab cakes, stuffed
lobster tail, steak and salad on the terrace of a lakeside
restaurant, Snug Harbor. We waved at passing boats, and Sophie went
down to the dock to leave bread for a creature she called a blue
heron or herring. We never got the story straight.

</P>
<P>
   Glued to the Jerry Springer show on their surveillance screens,
NATO early-warning team members notice something truly alarming.
That bullet-headed nut case in the fistfight with the Ku Klux Klan
Grand Dragon looks suspiciously like Dr. Evil (Myers). Come to
think of it, bullet head's son, Scott Evil (Green), said it all
when he introduced the Springer segment: ``My Father Is Evil, and
He Wants to Take Over the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Unaware of Evil's escape from outer space (don't ask), Austin
Powers (Myers), the manic yellow-toothed international man of
mystery from the original Powers adventure (1997), parties on with
his bride, Vanessa (Ms. Hurley). Suddenly she reveals herself to be
Evil's robot, sprays him with bullets from her breasts, which turn
into machine guns, and detonates.
</P>
<P>
   That frees Austin to resume womanizing, which he celebrates with
a romp through a hotel wearing nothing but the simian hairdo
blanketing his chest. Charged with reapprehending Evil, he then
goes time traveling to 1969, where the Carnaby Street scene is
enlivened by the agent Felicity Shagwell (Ms. Graham).
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Evil schemes to destroy Washington with a laser
beam. ``Great plan, Einstein,'' says Scott Evil, a sarcastic
Generation X-er who accuses his father of a ``Star Wars'' rip-off.
The doctor also robs Austin of his ``mojo'' (this movie's version
of the Force), which fuels sexual appetite. Now there's a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Pure slapstick and always clearly so. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Continual references are part of the spoof. For example, a
rocket shaped like a penis inspires a long string of
double-entendres involving cameo appearances by guest stars. And
Austin prances nude, though not frontally so. It's silly stuff, but
where children are concerned it adds up to considerable sexual
content. &QL;

   In Alaska, Donna (Ms. Mastrantonio), a talented, hard-pressed
club singer, is attracted to Joe (Strathairn), a quiet former
fisherman who now works as a handyman. That displeases Noelle (Ms.
Martinez), Donna's deeply troubled teen-age daughter, who is tired
of her mother's seemingly never-ending parade of disastrous
boyfriends.
</P>
<P>
   Joe is a bookish, soft-spoken man with a mysteriously tragic air
about him who, it turns out, left the sea after a fatal accident 25
years earlier. It also happens that he and Noelle work for the same
employers and she even has a crush on him, which doesn't exactly
improve relations with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   All around them Alaska is being carved up by developers who
would allow the interior to be turned into a parking lot as long as
the spectacular coastal vistas are maintained to draw the floating
hotels for the elderly cruising north for a look at the proverbial
last frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Into the harder world of everyday Alaskans comes Joe's
half-brother Bobby (Siemaszko), a former resident who has gone
south for better pickings but has run into problems with some
associates over a boatload of drugs. To avoid these people Bobby
makes a run for it on his yacht through beautiful ice-flecked
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Unaware of Bobby's situation, Joe has taken Donna and Noelle
along for what they think will be a pleasurable sail. While
anchored one evening the three of them are below when they hear
shots on deck. Escaping through a forward hatch, they swim to shore
on a deserted island and hide, shivering in the forest while those
who dispatched Bobby search for them but finally leave.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 10 days they survive off the land and local waters,
huddle in the ruins of a fox farmer's shack and stoke a signal fire
that they hope will attract rescuers and not Bobby's attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Noelle, a fine writer herself, discovers a diary written years
ago by the fox farmer's daughter and reads excerpts by firelight.
</P>
<P>
   A depressing tale it is, too. But they persevere, confront and
comfort one another, giving rise to hope that they might make a
compatible unit once this is over. Then an aircraft engine is heard
in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Shots are heard but no violence is seen, nor is there
any in the rest of the film. Noelle, however, experiments with
self-mutilation, cutting herself slightly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Donna and Joe are shown in bed after love-making, and
embracing in the woods. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY A moderate amount, sparingly and tellingly employed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP Sayles (``The Secret of Roan Innish'') has made
another strong, thoughtful film about credible people under
pressure. Many older teen-agers will respond, and parents could
well decide that in this case the benefits outweigh the R rating.

LIKE A GOOD SOLDIER, DIRECTOR SIMON WEST DIDN'T FLINCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nelson DeMille's best-selling mystery-thrillers
may be great fun to read. But making the first DeMille novel to
reach the screen, ``The General's Daughter,'' palatable in the more
immediate, graphic medium of motion pictures was a tricky
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the likable John Travolta starring and a top-notch
cast of supporting actors that includes Madeleine Stowe, James
Cromwell, James Woods and Timothy Hutton, the film has enough
alarming elements to make it a potentially tough sell. The story's
central question _ ``What's worse than rape?'' _ is answered at
quease-inducing length. Besides violation, the film deals
extensively with sadomasochism, extreme sexual harassment and
raging misogyny.
</P>
<P>
   Its central image is a young woman's naked body tied to stakes
in the ground, brutalized and left to die. Not exactly the kind of
light entertainment Hollywood usually releases in the early part of
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to shoot and edit it in a way that you couldn't get off
on all of this weird stuff,'' explains the film's director, Simon
West, an award-winning British commercials director whose first
Hollywood feature, ``Con Air,'' was a substantial summertime hit.
``It had to be just enough to show what was going on, the pain and
bizarreness of it, but without enough for it to be salacious or
actually fun to watch in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the movie strives to be a ``Chinatown''-like
mystery that uncovers unimaginable personal corruption on a
Southern military base. Travolta plays Paul Brenner, a warrant
officer in the Army's Criminal Investigation Division who
originally came to town to bust an arms smuggling operation. The
fort is run by Brenner's admired Vietnam commander, Gen. Joe
Campbell (Cromwell), who is retiring to pursue a career in national
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The C.O.'s beautiful daughter, Capt. Elizabeth Campbell (Leslie
Stefanson), works at the facility's psychological warfare office
and, on the surface anyway, seems to be the spit-and-polished image
of her accomplished dad. But after her nude, bound corpse is
discovered in a training area, Brenner and a former flame of his,
fellow CID investigator Sarah Sunhill (Stowe), discover that
Elizabeth led a remarkably perverse _ and hardly secret _ private
life.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of all that, what's said is almost as appalling
as what's shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the stuff in the movie very much comes right out of
the book,'' Travolta says when asked about the film's extreme
sexual politics. ``Maybe some of the statements that are said are
how soldiers and cops truly talk, maybe some of it's their stream
of consciousness verbalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefanson, a young actress who has never so much as been kissed
on screen, had to do a lot more than verbalize. Not only was she
required to act out some of the most horrible trauma a woman can
experience, she had to make Psy Ops expert Campbell's erotically
charged vengeance seem emotionally credible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' admits Stefanson, who has played small roles
in the films ``As Good as It Gets'' and ``Flubber.'' ``I hadn't
done anything like this at all, and it was difficult. But everyone
was so supportive, Simon and everyone embraced me right away, and
the fear became strength, in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``rape disturbs me, for sure,'' Stefanson says. ``I went
to a rape counselor in Santa Monica, gave her the material and
said, `How realistic is this? Is this just completely out of line?'
She said that the way that Elizabeth reacts is the way some rape
victims act out. Some don't have any relationships with anyone at
all because they're terrified. And some can become very promiscuous
because they want to take control of their body by becoming the
aggressor rather than the victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I felt all right about doing it, because it does happen. I
don't want to do it all the time, but I don't feel bad about
playing women that are victims when it's a reality that women can
be victims.''
</P>
<P>
   While the stakeout sequences were certainly most trying for
Stefanson, they were also harrowing for everybody else who worked
on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really horrible, very traumatic for us to shoot and
really unpleasant to act in, too,'' West says. ``I could have done
it in a much less graphic and violent way, and shown a lot less.
But I didn't want to end up with a bland discussion about rape,
where the word is just thrown around and sort of loses its impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``So although it's kind of shocking and horrible, that stuff, I
think it has to be to make people remember how horrific that moment
was for her, so that you can feel sympathy for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Even irreverent cutup James Woods was uncharacteristically
respectful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so aware that this whole story was about the violation
of this woman, not just physically but emotionally and in terms of
moral trust,'' Woods notes. ``That was in the back of everybody's
mind, every day. I kept my usual jokes to a minimum.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential issue for Woods, who comes from a military
family, was the fact that ``The General's Daughter'' doesn't
exactly portray soldiers in a complimentary light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the movie's not saying that this is how the whole
military is,'' Woods admits. ``I think it's ascribing the problem
here to the overweening ambitions and machinations of particularly
unethical and immoral men. I'm very proud of my military heritage
and the American military.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Pentagon was understandably unwilling to
cooperate with the making of ``The General's Daughter,'' even
considering its longstanding relationship with producer Mace
Neufeld, who has made such pro-military films as ``The Hunt for Red
October'' and ``Flight of the Intruder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even attempt to get the Pentagon's blessing,'' West
reveals. ``It's quite obvious when you read the story: Why would
they? But they understand that Hollywood's got to make stories of
all sorts. It's not like they were against us; they just couldn't
openly support it because it's not a propaganda piece for
recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Decorated Vietnam veteran DeMille says he wrote the source novel
with the intention of taking a look at the role of women in today's
military. West feels that that's an important sidebar to the film's
more lurid content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost coincidentally about how women are treated in the
military,'' the director says. ``The other side of the question is:
If women were more integrated into the service at higher levels,
the issues of betrayal here probably wouldn't have even come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Will audiences be able to glean serious messages from ``The
General's Daughter'' or will its shocking aspects just make it seem
like another one of the violent, prurient films Hollywood has been
criticized for making lately? Travolta, for one, is sensitive about
the latter possibility, and understandably so. His comeback
picture, ``Pulp Fiction,'' is frequently attacked by those who
think fictional violence inspires real criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, often, films are the wrong target (of blame) for
what's going on,'' Travolta says. ``I grew up with violent movies,
my father grew up with `Public Enemy' and `White Heat'; it is not
that different now. Maybe the amount of it or the constancy of it
has changed, but your average fellow can differentiate. I'm not
saying that it couldn't contribute to the more vulnerable,
psychotic mind. But mostly, it's a taste thing, it's an editing
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it is. And whether or not mass audience sensibilities are
offended by ``The General's Daughter,'' West felt he had to make
the film the way he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's wimpy to shoot it like a TV show and kind of
imply what's going on,'' the director says. ``Unless you actually,
physically feel the horror of it, it's not an emotional discussion,
it's an intellectual discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to feel gut-wrenched by it.'' &QL;

COURT STRIPS FEDERAL JUDGES OF POWER OVER DEFENDANTS' ASSETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal judges cannot stop insolvent companies from
spending or giving away their assets while they are being sued by
investors trying to recoup their money, the Supreme Court ruled
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the court said that a U.S. District
Court judge in New York exceeded his authority when ordering a
consortium of Mexican companies not to transfer or assign their
primary asset _ $300 million in notes from the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district court had no authority to issue a preliminary
injunction preventing (the companies) from disposing of their
assets pending adjudication of (the investors') contract claim for
money damages,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jay E. Grenig, an expert on financial law at
Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wis., the court's decision
increases the risk and cost associated with international
investments and will likely persuade some investors to avoid some
overseas opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without this way of ensuring that their money is protected,
international investors will have to think twice about whether it
is worth it for them send their funds out of the country because
they might not get it back,'' Grenig said.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium, known as Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, took part
in the Mexican government's program to develop an intercity highway
network from 1990 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, the companies arranged private financing for
construction of the roads in return for the right to collect tolls.
When revenues from toll-road traffic fell in 1994 below anticipated
levels, the consortium sold notes to institutional investors _
including $82 million to 11 U.S. investors.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the consortium defaulted on an interest
payment on those notes, and the investors sued in federal court in
New York. The investors' lawyers told U.S. District Judge John
Martin Jr. that the consortium was favoring its Mexican creditors
by turning over to them some of its government money.
</P>
<P>
   Martin agreed, issuing a preliminary injunction that prohibited
the consortium from transferring or assigning its right to receive
some $300 million from the Mexican government in connection with
the road-building project.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
affirmed the District Court's action.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling overturned that decision.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Scalia agreed that the rights of investors and
companies should be more clearly defined but said the courts were
not the place for that issue to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate concerning the formidable power over debtors should
be conducted and resolved where such issues belong in our
democracy: in the Congress,'' he said.

ALBUM OF THE WEEK: `ENEMA OF THE STATE' BY BLINK 182 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLINK 182: ``Enema of the State'' (MCA Records).
</P>
<P>
   The makers of Top 40 pop are thanking heaven for the little
girls whose appetite for generic Romeos is stimulating a
music-business boom. But what's a little boy to do? Most adolescent
males find the pinup boys repulsive. They need artists who
understand that girls are a drag, parents are worse, and sometimes
you're your own worst pimply-faced enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Blink 182 serves the gawky guy audience through speedy music
that frees frustration. This San Diego-based trio, weaned on sunny
Southern California hard-core punk, chases frisky melodies the way
its members dream of chasing girls. Blink 182 is tight and light on
its feet, as interested in getting its harmonies right as in
mastering super-fast chord changes.
</P>
<P>
   The title of the band's latest Top 10 release summarizes its
sense of humor, but beyond the cracks lies insight, if not
profundity. The bassist Mark Hoppus and the guitarist Tom DeLong,
who write the songs and trade vocals, play goofs more self-aware
than they should be.
</P>
<P>
   They get mad at the girls who reject them and the boys who clean
up after their romantic messes. ``I need a girl that I can train,''
sings DeLong on ``Dumpweed.`` It's a nasty idea but the rest of the
song makes it obvious he is the one at heel.
</P>
<P>
   Songs like the lovesick ``Going Away to College'' and the hit
``What's My Age Again?'' paint similar portraits of the male psyche
as a slapdash work in progress. Girls may find this band icky, and
parents may wish it had some manners, but Blink 182 showers its
fans with laddish love.

HOME VIDEO: WARNINGS ON SEX AND DRUGS; NEW RELEASES

   (bl)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>

   `Warning' Films: Sex and Drugs
</P>
<P>
   ``Will tend to corrupt morals, will tend to incite to crime,''
said the New York Censors Board of Dwain Esper's exploitation films
``Maniac'' and ``Narcotic,'' which together with a new edition of
Louis Gasnier's ``Reefer Madness'' have been released in a series
from Kino International.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the 1930s (with reverberations today in the furor
over children gaining admission to R-rated movies), when the
Production Code cramped mainstream movie-making. Not so the
exploitationists, however. ``They really thrived when the rest of
Hollywood had to abide by the code,'' said Bret Wood, co-author
with Felicia Feaster of ``Forbidden Fruit: The Golden Age of the
Exploitation Film'' (Midnight Marquee Press, Baltimore) and
producer of the videos.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially they survived by making themselves look good _ or if
``good'' isn't quite the word, perhaps ``principled'' comes closer.
``The secret to endurance in the field of exploitation was an
ability to maintain a pretense of serving a high moral purpose no
matter how iniquitous one's films,'' Wood wrote in his book. As
with politicians who run against their own records, exploitational
films in the '30s and '40s were billed as warnings about the very
debauchery they were in business to depict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal was to make money by presenting taboo topics
_ drug use, sex _ and get away with it by proclaiming it
educational,'' Wood said in an interview. To drugs and sex _ both
staples of ``Reefer Madness'' and ``Narcotic'' _ add the crazed
criminality of ``Maniac,'' which proclaimed the mission of
examining mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, thrown together in typically chaotic Esper style,
Dr. Meirschultz, a mad scientist who is trying to bring the dead
back to life, is killed accidentally by Don Maxwell, his assistant
and a former vaudevillian. In his attempt to cover up the death,
Maxwell goes seriously haywire. Nudity and necrophilia make an
appearance, rats and cats are everywhere and an eyeball gets eaten.
``The film isn't sure of the point it wants to make, but every now
and then the word dementia flashes on the screen, indicating it's
educational,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   All of it is rather chaste by present standards, but provocative
nonetheless. ``Narcotic'' shows a needle sliding into an arm during
a ``wild'' drug party. ``She takes a shot of H and joins the first
flock of birds heading south,'' says one reveler. In ``Reefer
Madness,'' dapper drug dealers hook teen-agers on marijuana.
``Women cry for it . . . men will die for it! A Daring Theme!''
reads a poster for the film.
</P>
<P>
   The public was also hooked. If it was ``curiosity that drew
crowds to exploitation,'' Wood wrote in his book, ``it was the
paradoxical narcotic of fascination and revulsion also found in
horror and pornography that kept them glued to their seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Some exploitation films were submitted to the censors and some
weren't, which didn't seem to matter. ``Having a scroll saying
`This could happen to your child' made people less antagonistic to
these films,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes are $19.95 each. Information: (800) 562-3330.

   `PATCH ADAMS'
</P>
<P>
   Treated badly during his own mental illness, Patch Adams (Robin
Williams) becomes part doctor and part circus clown and goes to
look for the bright side of grim medical situations. Soon he is
amusing a ward full of child cancer patients and keeping the rest
of the hospital in an uproar with his antics. While that annoys the
medical establishment, one can appreciate Patch's approach, at
least until he goes maudlin and preachy. When his Gesundheit
Institute, the first fun hospital in the world, has to close, Patch
turns whiner, marooning Williams in a role, Janet Maslin wrote in
The New York Times, that ``is too full of prefabricated sentiments
to let an actor breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   1998. Universal. $107.37. 116 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.

   `A SIMPLE PLAN'
</P>
<P>
   When Hank Mitchell (Bill Paxton), his brother Jacob (Billy Bob
Thornton) and friend Lou (Brent Briscoe) come across a light plane
that has crashed with $4.4 million on board, Hank decides to hide
the money for a while to see if anyone comes looking for it. But
then his wife, Sarah (Bridget Fonda), persuades him to put $500,000
back, which leads to terrible consequences and makes the plan
anything but simple. As complications mount, Sam Raimi's film
```becomes ever more enveloping as a well-honed morality tale''
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Paramount. $102.99. 121 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
Release date: June 22.
</P>
<P>
   `HURLYBURLY'
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from David Rabe's play, Anthony Drazen's war between men
and women in '80s Hollywood chooses macho camaraderie, sexual
exploitation and drug abuse as its weapons. Eddie (Sean Penn), a
strident motor-mouth, and Mickey (Kevin Spacey) share a
mirror-lined condominium and start a day of cocaine ingestion with
runny noses and a row over Eddie's sometime girlfriend (Robin
Wright Penn). Phil (Chazz Palminteri) beats up his wife, and Artie
(Garry Shandling), a jaded bigwig, contributes a ``sexual care
package'' in the person of Donna (Anna Paquin). In evoking casual
cruelty, the film ``is a misanthropic triumph'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   1998. New Line. $105.77. 122 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
Release date: June 22.
</P>
<P>
   `JAWBREAKER'
</P>
<P>
   As a ``prank,'' three high school princesses gag and tie up a
friend and throw her in the trunk of a car. Later, when they go to
let her out, they make a discovery. ``That is not so funny! Our
best friend's dead!'' one of them exclaims. Time for a perfectly
engineered cover-up that causes not a ripple in the group's
preening domination of Reagan High.
</P>
<P>
   The carnal, vicious Courtney (Rose McGowan) takes the lead, but
will the others (Rebecca Gayheart and Julie Benz) stay cool? Darren
Stein gives his film tongue-in-cheek malice, but there's ``not
enough here that's new''(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Columbia Tri-Star. $105.77. 122 minutes. Closed captioned.
R. Release date: June 22.

<P>
   `FIVE AGAINST THE ODDS'
</P>
<P>
   Steve James of ``Hoop Dreams'' fame directs a fictional drama, a
TNT movie about a black basketball team at a Roman Catholic high
school in New Orleans that is less about the game than it is about
bigotry. The film draws deeply from two often-visited wells: the
inspirational sports movie about a group of underdogs and the Jim
Crowe race movie. The year is 1965, the inevitable big game is
against a white team, and, William McDonald wrote in The New York
Times, ``the story is a powerful one, even if it's easily
recognizable.'' 1999. Warner. $72.99. 94 minutes. Closed captioned.
No rating.

   `THE LIFE OF BIRDS'

   To cover the characteristics and peculiarities of 9,000 species,

   WASHINGTON _ Here comes the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian Institution this week unveils a unique traveling
exhibition of solar devices intended to show that virtually
anything under the sun can be powered by its rays.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, a showcase for solar design innovations, is
beginning a two-year national tour that will take it to Atlanta,
Houston, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Chicago. Dates for the visits
have not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the exhibit is to demonstrate how easily we can
generate plenty of power featuring the sun,'' said Lucy Fellowes,
curator and project director of the Smithsonian-affiliated
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, an organizer of the exhibit
with the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton has pointed to solar energy as one
answer to the problem of global warming, critics say federal policy
has been less than vigorous in promoting the alternative to fossil
energy sources, which contribute to the ``greenhouse effect'' by
pumping tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced a ``Million Solar Roofs Initiative'' in 1997
and set a national goal of increasing the number of solar electric
panels and heat collectors. To stimulate the trend, the president
said the government would make a ``down payment'' by installing
20,000 solar systems on federal buildings by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States programs are strongest in title, not in
implementation,'' said Seth Dunn, a research associate at
Worldwatch Institute, a natural resources think tank in Washington.
``The government has sort of taken baby steps. There have been
serious cutbacks in funding, and most of the innovation is at the
state level.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn pointed to some state policies that encourage use of solar
energy, such as ``net metering,'' which allows solar homeowners to
sell excess electricity back to power companies.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one percent of the country's energy budget is provided
by solar power, said Kert Davies, science policy director at Ozone
Action, an environmental group. He said other countries are moving
to solar energy much faster. Japan, for example, already has
``millions'' of rooftop solar units.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldwatch ``State of the World'' report for 1999 noted that
between 1990 and 1997, worldwide use of solar power to generate
electricity grew by an annual rate of 16.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian display _ it's titled ``Under the Sun: An
Outdoor Exhibit of Light'' _ is sponsored and funded by the U.S.
Department of Energy and BP Solarex, the world's largest solar
energy manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the relationship of the sun and Earth, it illustrates
the usefulness of photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight to
electricity. ``Under the Sun'' examines the various ways that solar
energy can be used in everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Among the solar-powered items on display:
</P>
<P>
   _ A garden chair with a photovoltaic-powered overhead light that
is designed for reading under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   A solar-powered lawn mower that can cover 13,000 square feet in
the course of a growing season. It's equipped with an edge sensor,
a personal activation code, an impact detector, a theft alarm and a
communications system to keep it on track _ all powered by the sun.
</P>

many of the items _ sun-powered lanterns, a clock and sundial,
garden lights, solar cookers and portable energy systems, for
instance _ already can be purchased at hardware stores, on the
Internet or through catalogues.
</P>
<P>

felt it was important to remain true to its mission of celebrating
the direct impact of design on daily life. ``It made sense to us to

setting for the exhibit, which opened in New York City last summer,
designed by architects Nicholas Goldsmith and Gregory Kiss.

space, trees, the museum's facade,'' Fellowes said. ``It was an
outdoor environment powered by the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellowes said the sponsors were so enthusiastic about ``Under
the Sun'' when it opened that they wanted it to go on tour. The
Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service worked with
them to develop a mobile version. For the national tour, Fellowes
said it was important to have a good geographic distribution and
one that would also allow the exhibit to ``follow the sun.'' The

note that the exhibition is entirely self-powered, which she said
is its most appealing aspect.

   WASHINGTON _ Here comes the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian Institution this week unveils a unique traveling
exhibition of solar devices intended to show that virtually
anything under the sun can be powered by its rays.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, a showcase for solar design innovations, is
beginning a two-year national tour that will take it to Atlanta,
Houston, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Chicago. Dates for the visits
have not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the exhibit is to demonstrate how easily we can
generate plenty of power featuring the sun,'' said Lucy Fellowes,
curator and project director of the Smithsonian-affiliated
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, an organizer of the exhibit
with the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton has pointed to solar energy as one
answer to the problem of global warming, critics say federal policy
has been less than vigorous in promoting the alternative to fossil
energy sources, which contribute to the ``greenhouse effect'' by
pumping tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced a ``Million Solar Roofs Initiative'' in 1997
and set a national goal of increasing the number of solar electric
panels and heat collectors. To stimulate the trend, the president
said the government would make a ``down payment'' by installing
20,000 solar systems on federal buildings by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States programs are strongest in title, not in
implementation,'' said Seth Dunn, a research associate at
Worldwatch Institute, a natural resources think tank in Washington.
``The government has sort of taken baby steps. There have been
serious cutbacks in funding, and most of the innovation is at the
state level.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn pointed to some state policies that encourage use of solar
energy, such as ``net metering,'' which allows solar homeowners to
sell excess electricity back to power companies.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one percent of the country's energy budget is provided
by solar power, said Kert Davies, science policy director at Ozone
Action, an environmental group. He said other countries are moving
to solar energy much faster. Japan, for example, already has
``millions'' of rooftop solar units.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldwatch ``State of the World'' report for 1999 noted that
between 1990 and 1997, worldwide use of solar power to generate
electricity grew by an annual rate of 16.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian display _ it's titled ``Under the Sun: An
Outdoor Exhibit of Light'' _ is sponsored and funded by the U.S.
Department of Energy and BP Solarex, the world's largest solar
energy manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the relationship of the sun and Earth, it illustrates
the usefulness of photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight to
electricity. ``Under the Sun'' examines the various ways that solar
energy can be used in everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Among the solar-powered items on display:
</P>
<P>
   _ A garden chair with a photovoltaic-powered overhead light that
is designed for reading under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   A solar-powered lawn mower that can cover 13,000 square feet in
the course of a growing season. It's equipped with an edge sensor,
a personal activation code, an impact detector, a theft alarm and a
communications system to keep it on track _ all powered by the sun.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``portable energy system'' that uses direct or indirect
sunlight to power and charge battery operated devices. It can
double the operating time of a laptop computer, for example.
</P>
<P>
   _ A solar cooker, which can help the estimated 1.5 billion
people who live in areas of the world where fuel wood is scarce. In
sunny areas, a family dependant on wood fuel can save about 30
percent of its annual wood consumption by using a solar cooker, the

determined by the intensity of the sunlight.
</P>
<P>

many of the items _ sun-powered lanterns, a clock and sundial,
garden lights, solar cookers and portable energy systems, for

   Tacking Down Two Musicals
</P>
<P>
   Summertime: slow and sultry and usually pretty darn silent on
Broadway. But in the comfort of air-conditioned offices, the
producers of two big-budget fall musicals have ironed out their
schedules and casts.
</P>
<P>
   First up is ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' the first Broadway revival of the
1948 Cole Porter musical. Previews begin Oct. 25 at the Martin Beck
Theater; opening night is Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   As long rumored, the show will be a reunion of two ``Ragtime''
alumni, Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie, who will portray
the bickering husband and ex-wife team of Fred Graham and Lili
Vanessi. Contract negotiations, which have dragged on for months,
were being wrapped up this week. Mitchell and Ms. Mazzie will be
joined by Amy Spanger and Michael Berresse as the romantic
sidekicks.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Berlind and Roger Horchow are the producers; Michael
Blakemore (``City of Angels'') directs.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the producer Cameron Mackintosh settled a knotty
casting problem by turning to one of his favorite actresses, Ruthie
Henshall, who is making her Broadway debut as Velma Kelly in
``Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Ms. Henshall, who is English, will go directly into
``Putting It Together,'' a revue of the work of Stephen Sondheim.
Ms. Henshall replaces Susan Egan, who opted out of ``Putting It
Together'' last month to take over the role of Sally Bowles in
``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   To make time for Ms. Henshall to finish her commitment to
``Chicago,'' Mackintosh has postponed the first preview until Oct.
29; opening night will be in mid-to-late November. Carol Burnett
headlines the cast, with George Hearn.
</P>
<P>
   Mackintosh said the recasting was serendipitous because Ms.
Henshall had been an early choice for the cast but had been unable
to do the show because of scheduling conflicts. ``I couldn't be
more delighted,'' Mackintosh said from London.
</P>
<P>
   Gone Fishing
</P>
<P>
   Good news: Ron Taylor, the star of `'It Ain't Nothin' but the
Blues'' who had a mild stroke late last week, was released from St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center on Wednesday. Taylor said doctors
had found a blood clot on his optical nerve, but that they expected
him to make a full recovery. He said he would take a four-week
break and rest at a friend's farm in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to sit at a fishing hole,'' Taylor said. ``And if I
don't catch anything, I will still come back with a smile on my
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Buzzing Off Broadway
</P>
<P>
   Like planes in a holding pattern, four plays have announced that
they will land in Off Broadway theaters soon. What they don't know
is where or in some cases when.
</P>
<P>
   The most peripatetic is ``The Vagina Monologues,'' which has
played at star-studded Valentine's Day benefits in London and New
York and has had stints in Athens, Berlin, Croatia and Jerusalem
and throughout the United States. Yet it has never had an
open-ended commercial run in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The piece was written by Eve Ensler and is a seriously funny
look at, well, the most feminine of topics. The monologues
developed from interviews with hundreds of women, and the show was
first performed by Ms. Ensler in 1996 at the nonprofit Here
performance space in the South Village.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sept. 21, Ms. Ensler will offer a reprise of the piece
at a mid-size Off Broadway theater, incorporating new material
gleaned from her travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans got the piece better than anybody,'' Ms. Ensler
laughed. ``The English took a few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Another well-traveled entry is ``An Almost Holy Picture,'' a
one-man drama by Heather McDonald about a lapsed Catholic priest
who finds solace in life as a groundskeeper.
</P>
<P>
   The play had a critically praised premiere in 1995 at La Jolla
Playhouse in San Diego and was produced a year later at the
McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The New York production will retain the creative core of the
original, with direction by Michael Mayer and the acting handled by
David Morse, most recently seen in New York in ``How I Learned to
Drive.'' The show plans to open on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Also looking for a berth in September is ``If Memory Serves,'' a
black comedy about show business by Jonathan Tolins (``Twilight of
the Golds''). Elizabeth Ashley is signed to star; Leonard Foglia
will direct.
</P>
<P>
   And finally there's ``The Exact Center of the Universe,'' which
closed a successful run with Frances Sternhagen at the Women's
Project's Theater Four in late April. Martin Markinson, the owner
of the Helen Hayes Theater, and Elsa Haft have picked up the option
and are looking for an Off Broadway theater for the early fall.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, producers say they have had serious talks with
theater owners, in some cases even putting down deposits. But most
of the top-shelf Off Broadway theaters _ like the Promenade, the
Lucille Lortel and the Century Center _ have shows running.
Theatrical courtesy and superstition hold that a producer must
never reveal his theater until its current tenant announces a
closing date. So as shows depart, anticipate a few arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Sound of Music,'' originally scheduled to close on June
27, will instead close on Sunday. Its producers and Actors' Equity
were unable to agree on the show's closing date and the starting
date of rehearsals for its national tour. Equity rules require a
six-week gap, but the show's producers wanted only a four-week gap.
They failed to work out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Playwrights Horizons said this week that ``Goodnight Children
Everywhere'' by Richard Nelson would likely close on Sunday, unless
ticket sales improved. The company also said that ``The Dead,'' a
musical version of James Joyce's short story, with a book by
Nelson, would open its fall season, produced in conjunction with
Gregory Mosher and Arielle Tepper. Stephen Spinella, Alice Ripley
and Daisy Egan are cast.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Tape,'' a play about two high school buddies with a secret
or two, has been extended through Thursday at the Access Theater,
at 380 Broadway in lower Manhattan. The play's director is Steve
Pickering, whose day job is playing Howard in the Broadway revival
of ``Death of a Salesman.''

ELEANOR ANTIN: PORTRAIT OF A CHAMELEON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _Throughout her innovative and resourceful career,
Eleanor Antin has frequently existed in some or other state of
exile, whether involuntary or slyly self-imposed.
</P>
<P>
   She has been a female artist in a male-dominated occupation, a
fervent but independent-minded feminist during the ``liberated''
'70s, and a bookish, Jewish ``New York brat'' transported to the
land of palm trees and blissed-out smiles.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, Antin has lived outside San Diego, where her
husband, David, accepted a teaching post at the University of
California campus in the late 1960s. Though she occasionally has
set the pace for certain aspects of the New York art scene, she has
chosen to stand slightly apart from that milieu, while making do
with minuscule budgets and rudimentary production values.
</P>
<P>
   So it was fitting when, a few weeks ago, Antin was spotted
wearing a ``Visitor'' sticker on her left hand while being feted as
the guest of honor at one of L.A.'s most prestigious cultural
venues.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the press preview of ``Eleanor Antin,'' the
first comprehensive survey of the pioneering feminist artist, at
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Organized by Howard N. Fox,
LACMA curator of contemporary art, the exhibition tracks Antin's
multiple artistic and personal reinventions of the past 35 years, a
period during which she repeatedly found new ways to insert herself
and her various ``fictional personae'' into the often exclusionary
world of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying unity among all of (her work) is this
insistence upon telling stories,'' Fox says. ``And so she tells
them in every way you can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   She also tells them in ways that often undercut and interrogate
each other. For example, in one of her fictional personae projects,
she portrayed an impoverished ballerina in a comically poignant
performance titled ``The Little Match Girl Ballet'' (1975). LACMA's
survey supplies an additional layer of commentary by juxtaposing
still photographs of Antin seeming to execute perfect pirouettes
and arabesques with a video of the same routine that captures her
every stumble and misstep.
</P>
<P>
   It's a characteristically complex portrait, both boldly
individualistic in its expression of a private fantasy and
comically self-effacing at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but be a little subversive and ironic,'' the
artist says amiably. ``That's my nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Antin is referring specifically to the tongue-in-cheek subtitles
that appear in the witty, retro-Yiddish ``silent films'' she began
making in the early 1990s. But she could as easily be speaking of
the ``guerrillalike motivation to a lot of her methodology,'' as
Fox puts it, that has characterized her entire career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her work is almost Talmudic,'' Fox says. ``It's like
commentary upon commentary, or layer upon layer.''
</P>
<P>
   Structured chronologically, the exhibition undergoes what Fox
describes as ``a deepening and darkening of mood'' as it moves
toward the present.
</P>
<P>
   It begins in the early 1960s, when artists like Robert
Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Jim Dine were deflating the
self-importance of abstract expressionism by plastering their works
with found objects and other household detritus, just as the
dadaists had done 50 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Antin's early experiments in conceptual art are represented at
LACMA by ``Blood of a Poet Box'' (1965-68), for which Antin
persuaded 100 poets such as John Ashberry, John Cage and Allen
Ginsberg, several of them friends, to each contribute a drop of
blood that she preserved on microscopic slides.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition also includes the famous ``100 BOOTS'' (1971-73),
a narrative series of 51 postcards chronicling the ``journey'' of
50 pairs of posed black rubber boots traversing a path from the
Pacific Ocean to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where they
were exhibited.
</P>
<P>
   Antin's explorations of gender and identity issues are
highlighted by the frequently exhibited ``Carving: A Traditional
Sculpture.'' In this 1972 series of 144 photographs, Antin
documented herself nude while in the process of losing 10 pounds
during a 36-day diet.
</P>
<P>
   This deadpan, pseudo-scientific skewering of conventional
notions of feminine beauty, along with other feminist-inspired
works by Antin, have been cited as major influences on their
careers by many subsequent female artists. (This aspect of Antin's
career is addressed in some detail in a catalog essay by Lisa E.
Bloom.)
</P>
<P>
   Antin also anticipated Cindy Sherman in her construction of
three distinct, made-up ``fictional personae'' _ the King, the
Nurse and the Ballerina _ which she acted out both in private and
public settings. Like some low-budget auteur operating on the
margins of Hollywood, Antin made all the costumes and props from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   As the King, Antin walked the streets of San Diego County,
collecting money in a tin cup and chatting with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little (leery), walking out there with a beard and a
bosom,'' she says. ``I think I was saved because I look kind of
like a Chaplin figure. I don't look scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The collective vision that emerges from these works is one in
which all the world's a kind of strange, tragic melodrama. We, the
hapless actors, ``are the comedy,'' Antin says.
</P>
<P>
   In person, in brown pullover and black pants, the petite artist,
at 64, has retained the slightly anonymous, Everywoman quality that
perfectly suits her identity-switching purposes. Only her
gunmetal-blue nail polish hints at the scrappiness within.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess in a sense I always prefer things when they're on the
downslope,'' she says, ``because to me that's a truer image of
life. I mean, the king's a loser, like I'm a loser, because the
king's my political self. I was always on the losing end. And
politically we're all losers, and we're all losers in life because
...''
</P>
<P>
   She lets the thought trail off, unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I guess the pathos is built in. You might as well enjoy it
while you're going downhill!''

A SLAPSTICK VIEW FROM THE BORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They've been married for, oh, about 150 years,
these strange, bilingual bedfellows with the wire fence running
smack down the middle of their nuptial resting place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, but you don't need me!'' the Mexican wife
complains bitterly to her English-speaking husband, who tries to
ignore her by pulling Old Glory over his head, as if it were an
electric blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a marriage counselor in the house? Or at least a NAFTA
negotiator?
</P>
<P>
   So goes life in the surreal no-man's land that separates San
Diego from its cross-border cousin, Tijuana and, by implication,
the smug, prosperous !bold!el norte!off! from poorer, oft-shunned
points south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, goes ``Culture Clash in Bordertown,'' the latest manic
exercise in slapstick sociology from the well-regarded L.A.-based
Chicano comic trio. Following several months of national tours, new
commissions and HBO specials, Richard Montoya, Ric Salinas and
Herbert Siguenza are back in their hometown, where they'll be holed
up for the next month at the Actors' Gang in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've just tuned in to this 15-year-old threesome,
Culture Clash came into being on Cinco de Mayo, 1984, as a kind of
agitprop clown show. In the following years, the group has kept its
ribald theatricality while adding narrative drive and political
nuance to its gender-reversing, ethnicity-swapping vaudeville
shtick. Grounded in the make-'em-yuk imperatives of stand-up
comedy, ``Bordertown'' is necessarily a hit-or-miss affair _ but
with a high ratio of the former to the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Carving its material into short, Brechtian !ital!actos!off! (as
El Teatro Campesino did), ``Bordertown'' scampers over more ground
in 1{ hours than an INS agent in a customized Range Rover. The
digressions and throwaway lines alone encompass Ralphs shopping
cards, Santeria, Carlos Santana, Octavio Paz, mural painting and
Gabriel Garcia Marquez novels. There are inside jokes about the
troupe's aborted HBO appearances and overly obscure ones about the
upcoming production of ``Hughie,'' with Al Pacino, at the Mark
Taper Forum (whose Latino Theatre Initiative is co-presenting
``Bordertown'').
</P>
<P>
   Taking its theme as whatever divides us _ culturally,
politically, sexually, even metaphysically _ ``Bordertown'' was
custom-built for the San Diego Repertory Theatre, where it
premiered. So we naturally meet Shuma the Sea World killer whale
(Salinas), San Diego's unofficial mascot, spilling his blubber to a
Teutonic psychotherapist (Montoya) and fretting because some
Mexican interloper whales are willing to work for fewer fish.
</P>
<P>
   In the bizarre universe of this metropolis of millions, parts of
which resemble ``a Hollywood version of a frontier town 100 years
ago,'' a wrap is another name for ``an overpriced, assimilated
burrito,'' and aging Chicano activists wistfully recall the good
ol' days of !bold!el movemiento!off!, when the people stood up to
the police and the bulldozers plowing under their homes in the name
of gentrification.
</P>
<P>
   The ``bordertown'' of the '90s, however, is a more complicated
place, inhabited not only by !ital!maquiladora!off! workers who
make Barbie doll accessories, and blissfully empty-headed Anglo
surfer dudes, but by openly gay Latino women and young Asian males
who affectionately call each other by a racist epithet for
``African-American.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the show's best-realized sequence, the trio don
priestly robes to recite an African prayer chant _ a not-unfamiliar
sound within San Diego's burgeoning Ethiopian enclave _ then strip
them off to reveal sailor suits underneath. Then they prance around
the stage like the happy-go-lucky guys on Manhattan shore leave in
``Wonderful Town,'' while the Village People belt out ``In the
Navy'' and one sailor grabs his fellow seamen's backsides.
 &UR; !ital!Machishmo!off! &LR; , anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ominous rumblings of the UFOs overhead, ready to
transport Heaven's Gate followers to a final frontier where ``there
are no borders,'' ``Bordertown'' is a show in which Angelenos are
sure to discern their own fragmented reflections. &UR;  &LR; We are all
aliens, ``Bordertown'' observes, lovers and enemies joined at the
hip in a mixed marriage from which there's no escape short of
death. &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

`SITCOM': AVERAGE SUBURBAN FAMILY (PET RAT AND ALL) 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (``Sitcom'' was shown as part of this year's New Directors/New
Films series. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review,
which appeared in The New York Times on April 9.)
</P>
<P>
   Francois Ozon's exquisitely unsettling ``See the Sea'' was one
of the high points at last year's New Directors/New Films series.
Now Ozon returns with a black comedy that means to be no less
disturbing than that expert thriller. But ``Sitcom,'' which is
sardonically filmed with the snappy look of a television comedy,
has a sour streak that eventually poisons its humor. Ozon pushed
the limits of shock value much more effectively with the carefully
measured violence of ``Sea'' than he does with this frontal
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitcom'' begins promisingly enough with the sounds of gunfire
and screaming at a picture-perfect suburban house. The father of
the family (Francois Marthouret) has evidently not been pleased by
the surprise birthday party that greeted him. Then the film flashes
back to presumably happier times, when the mother (Evelyne Dandry)
fussed demurely about the housekeeping and the son, Nicholas
(Adrien De Van), and daughter, Sophie (Marina De Van), looked like
model children. Needless to say, they're not.
</P>
<P>
   Two new members of the household, a pet rat and an insinuating
maid named Maria, touch off some amusing first rounds of trouble.
One night Maria arrives for dinner in unexpectedly formal dress and
accompanied by Abdu, her unexpectedly black husband. (The family is
white but the mother feigns interest in African history.)
</P>
<P>
   This is the same night on which Nicholas abruptly announces that
he is gay and stomps off to his room.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sophie has an erotic encounter with the rat, leaps out a
window, cripples herself and becomes a bad-tempered paraplegic
dominatrix. It is at about this point that the film's light touch
falls into jeopardy. As the rest of ``Sitcom'' dwells on broken
incest taboos and assorted other supposed outrages, we get the
point and then some. And in the end ``Sitcom'' isn't any more
barbed about middle-class complacency than many situation comedies,
however inadvertently, are themselves.

``RUN LOLA RUN'': IN A RACE WITH DEATH, THERE'S ONLY ONE SURE
WINNER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   (italics)``Run Lola Run'' was shown as part of this year's New
Directors/New Films series. Here are excerpts from Janet Maslin's
review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 26. The film
opens Sunday in New York City.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Run Lola Run'' is a furiously kinetic display of pyrotechnics
from the director Tom Tykwer, who fuses lightning-fast visual
tricks, tirelessly shifting styles and the arbitrary possibilities
of interactive storytelling into the best-case scenario for a
cinematic video game.
</P>
<P>
   Tykwer does this with a vigor and pizazz that offset the
essentially empty nature of the exercise. And he makes ``Run Lola
Run'' sufficiently hot, fast and post-human to pull that off. For
sheer cleverness and gamesmanship, its altered sense of emotion and
meaning in the face of breathless forward momentum, his film makes
a startling harbinger of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run Lola Run'' opens with typical smashing bravado, as a few
vague voice-over speculations about the nature of mankind give way
to a strikingly bold image. A crowd milling around suddenly forms
the word Lola as the camera shifts from ground level to aerial
view, and with that we're off and running.
</P>
<P>
   Or Lola (Franka Potente) is, anyhow, in a film that keeps her
hurtling forward almost all the time. The setup sounds like
something out of a game's rule book: Lola's boyfriend, Manni
(Moritz Bleibtreu), will be killed if she can't come up with a
large sum of money and meet him across town in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As Lola takes off, trucking along with a muscular R. Crumb look
and distinctive flaming-cranberry hair that sets her off from any
crowd, the fun is in the details. There are marking points along
her route that will be important later. A visit to her father's
office, an encounter between an ambulance and a sheet of plate
glass, assorted encounters of the street: all of these will be
refracted later in various ways.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile everything looks as dazzling as possible, like the way
the camera watches Lola run past her idle mother, spins around the
mother and then zooms in on a television screen where Lola is now
running as a cartoon version of herself.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Manni ends in death, but that hardly carries any
weight here. Soon everything is erased and we are back with the
flying red telephone receiver that sparked Lola's journey. And this
time each encounter is somehow different, just different enough to
alter the course of fate in playfully profound ways.
</P>
<P>
   Tykwer's visual virtuosity revels in the possibilities here, as
when he splits the screen between Lola and Manni, then lets a
ticking clock approaching zero hour (noon) slide up from the bottom
of the image.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference a day makes,'' the soundtrack croons
mischievously, while the destiny of each minor character (shown in
rapid-fire flash cuts, a whole lifetime in a matter of seconds) is
made utterly different each time. The story eventually replays yet
another time, and it takes on new sardonic twists with each new
permutation.

NEW THEORIES GIVE DAD A MORE ACTIVE ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 20)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CLEA SIMON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children learn by example, from what we do rather than what we
say, most parents and educators agree. Mimicking adults, watching
how they act in certain situations, children pick up clues as to
which behaviors work and which don't, and how to manipulate the
world to do one's bidding.
</P>
<P>
   This is conventional wisdom, certainly, but it is also the
underpinning of a revolution in thought about how fathers influence
their daughters, giving rise to new theories that grant the
paternal parent a greater role in developing daughters' self-esteem
and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Fathers, we are learning, may no longer be simply the ``other''
of traditional family psychology. According to standard Freudian
theory, fathers are supposed to be important to their daughters
simply because they are not mothers. As the first man, the first
person of the opposite gender, in a girl's life, a father in this
paradigm is the role model for later heterosexual partners.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is different from her, he makes her aware of her body
and teaches her about her femininity. And, by attracting her, he
serves as a counter to the potentially suffocating mother-child
relationship, basically by wooing her away from her mother and by
serving (again, loosely according to Freud) as a source of
conflict. It's a vital but secondary role: He influences her by
being different, by what he isn't, not by what he is.
</P>
<P>
   But a new school of researchers, psychiatrists, and theorists is
putting aside this sexuality-based theory to seek out more
comprehensive, positive models that fathers provide for their
children, particularly daughters. Their research is showing how
fathers, partly because of their societal gender roles and partly
because of biology, are more than ever before teaching daughters
how to live on their own. According to this emerging model, a
father's first lesson to a daughter is about independence.
</P>
<P>
   This is taught when daughters see that fathers can _ and do _
walk away from the family and safely return, their welcome home
assured. This freedom is not linked purely to the ideal of the
traditional American family structure, in which the father leaves
to work and the mother stays with the child. The quality of
``agency,'' that is the freedom to move in the world, explains
psychologist Virginia Goldner of New York's Ackerman Center for the
Family, exists in opposition to the primal physical bond a child
has with its mother. Unlike a father, however close, a mother for
nine months is there providing a constant physical presence, the
first that a baby knows.
</P>
<P>
   This bond _ and the father's very different role _ is, of
course, supported by societal standards. Fathers are still three
times less likely than mothers to take time off from work after a
birth or adoption under the 1993 federal Family and Medical Leave
Act. This is changing, certainly, as increasing numbers of fathers
take over the primary care duties of infants and children.
</P>
<P>
   But for now the care-giving mother and working father define our
cultural standard, explains psychoanalyst and author Jessica
Benjamin, and young children quickly pick up on these standard
roles. Fathers are, as Goldner puts it, the ``coming and going''
parent. They are free, as Benjamin explains, to realize their own
desires, without forfeiting security upon return. And that
combination of independence and security is just what a curious,
learning child wants. ``We think, `I love him because I want to be
like him. Free to come and go, says Goldner.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Such a simplification is not meant to downplay the great power
that mothers have in any child's life. Certainly a healthy
mother-daughter relationship enables a child to grow up strong and
independent. However, the relationships between mother and daughter
and father and daughter remain fundamentally different. ``Often
there's more of a companionate relationship from daughter to
mother,'' says Froma Walsh, a professor at the University of
Chicago and the author of ``Living Beyond Loss.'' ``There's also
the identification and the need to differentiate. That's less
strong between daughters and fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the father has a special power of pronouncing the
daughter worthy and acceptable,'' explains Terry Hargrave, a
Texas-based psychologist who specializes in family counseling.
``Women have mom more as a friend, but they depend on fathers more
in terms of who they are, in terms of identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of their particular role, fathers are in a unique
position to encourage children to learn about independence. They
are also in the position most likely to deny it. All parents are
reasonably wary about allowing children to make major decisions.
But fathers in particular, researchers agree, may have a hard time
allowing their daughters to explore, experiment, and venture into
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fathers are much more able to do this with sons than
daughters,'' says Goldner. ``They lend their agentic selves _
`You're like me' _ to boys more than girls.''
</P>
<P>
   When this identification and the freedom to act on it is denied,
she points out, the frustrated desire can surface in unhappy ways.
``Women can get in masochistic relationships (in which) they are in
love with the self they were forbidden to be,'' Goldner explains.
``Had there been a parent who acknowledged this concern, they would
be free of this, but only fathers can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   When fathers can encourage independence, however, the effect is
astounding. Discussions with women who have felt free to build
successful careers, particularly in male-dominated fields, clearly
recall the boost of paternal support. Boston lawyer Karen Berman
Cohen, for example, has established herself in the macho world of
litigation. ``My father,'' she says, ``was very accepting of us. He
basically gave us the feeling we could do anything if we tried.''
Key, perhaps, was his lack of gender stereotyping; he gave as much
encouragement to Berman Cohen's brother (a cardiologist) as to her
sister (a retail store manager) and his youngest child, Karen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the kids to be able to grow up and make their own
decisions and be strong personalities,'' says Marvin Berman.
``Karen was always a dynamic personality, a strong kid. That
strength was to be treasured, not controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the mother of two young daughters, Berman Cohen states her
intention of raising Margot and Briana with the same level of
encouragement, and her husband, Joel, concurs. ``We're always aware
of it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Brody, morning news anchor at WGBH-FM in Boston, is
another woman who has carved her niche in a competitive field. She
describes her career as one of words and opinions, both of which
were nurtured by her father, both explicitly and implicitly. ``The
only time in school I ever got in trouble was for mouthing off,''
says Brody. ``And I knew that he knew that he was supposed to be
angry with me. But he was so clearly proud of me. I knew that I had
his encouragement to tell off people who deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we probably took her side,'' recalls her father, Sam
Brody, laughing. Perhaps more to the point, he acknowledges that
both he and his wife, Eleanor, were careful to give Sharon, their
only daughter, the same encouragement and opportunities as they
gave their two sons. ``We worked very hard to treat the kids
equally,'' he now recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Women like Cohen and Brody, both in their 30s, are perhaps the
most obvious beneficiaries of such proactive fathering. They make
up what theorists call the hinge generation, women of the Baby Boom
and the lull just after. Brought up largely by stay-at-home moms
(unlike the up-and-coming Generation Xers) these 30- to
50-year-olds tend to hold jobs outside the homes, like their
fathers did. As a result, they often looked to dad more than mom as
they learned how to navigate day-to-day lives in a world shaped by
feminism and the modern economy.
</P>
<P>
   Fathers, rather than mothers, were the parents who could relate
to the particulars of job stress and boredom, the meetings and
deadlines and production quotas that these working women had to
meet, that often they were the first women in their families to
meet. If they were successful, often they credit their father's
farsighted and involved support.
</P>
<P>
   For today's fathers, coming after the first wave of feminism,
this historic change illuminates a new way to parent. Although
teaching freedom may go against a father's grain, current dads are
learning that it is their responsibility to raise strong, free
daughters. ``It all boils down to your child's confidence in
themselves and your willingness to trust them,'' says Joel Cohen.
``You have to take some chances. Self-esteem is something you have
to build.''

 &HT;    FIVE YEARS AFTER MASS EXODUS, SMUGGLING OF CUBANS TO FLORIDA IS
ON THE RISE
 &HT;    With CUBA-BOX-0618.
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING

<P>
   MIAMI _ Five summers ago, more than 30,000 Cubans fled their
homeland aboard inner tubes and homemade rafts, braving sharks and
storms, after Cuban President Fidel Castro effectively told the
Cuban Coast Guard to turn a blind eye to rafter departures.
</P>
<P>
   Now, years after Washington and Havana reached agreements to
stop such departures, the seas between Cuba and Florida have again
become the path to a better life for an increasing number of
desperate Cuban migrants.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, Cubans have foregone their flimsy crafts, and
are relying on smugglers who ferry them across the Florida Straits
in speed boats designed to dodge the U.S. Coast Guard and make the
trip in three hours or less.
</P>
<P>
   These Cubans and their families are willing to pay these
smugglers up to $8,000 to escort them from a country in which the
average monthly wage is only $20 to $30.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a worrisome increase,'' said Wayne Smith, a
senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington
and former head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. ``But
smugglers are becoming more efficient and the Cubans' families in
Miami are willing to pay the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is following a global trend in which illegal immigrants are
increasingly resorting to professionals to skirt beefed-up
interdiction efforts by U.S. and other immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted 272 Cubans at sea in May, the
highest monthly total since 1994, and three times the number for
May 1998. So far this year, 764 Cubans have been caught trying to
reach Florida by sea, compared with 1,186 in all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are expected to climb even more over the summer,
when seas are generally calmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smuggling is a cottage industry that's mushrooming because
people ... had time to hone their skills,'' said Damian Fernandez,
an expert on Cuba at Florida International University here.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over smuggling has grown since December, when 14 Cuban
refugees died just 30 miles south of Miami when their 29-foot speed
boat capsized in high seas.
</P>
<P>
   Hardline Cuban exiles here accuse the Castro's Cuban government
of enabling more of these risky, illegal departures by easing
border controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smugglers just can't show up on Cuba's shoreline without the
implicit authority of the Cuban government,'' said Ninoska Perez,
spokeswoman for the Cuban American National Foundation, the
country's most-powerful anti-Castro lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cuban government vigorously denies that charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been making great efforts to stop smuggling ... we
have put smugglers in jail,'' said Luis Fernandez, spokesman for
the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   A Cuban Interior Ministry statement published in the Communist
Party daily Granma earlier this month said that: ``There is not
even the most remote chance that the maritime borders of Cuba will
be opened to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. Coast Guard insists that Cuban authorities have
been cooperative in a joint U.S.-Cuba effort to stop smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work together well,'' said U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer
Gibran Soto. ``Whenever they notice a ship leaving their waters
they give us a heads up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubans on the island contacted by telephone say they've heard no
rumors that the Cuban government is planning to ease border
controls.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Cuban government officials contend that U.S. immigration policy
provides incentives for Cubans to not only emigrate, but to rely on
smugglers and speed boats to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, U.S. policy granted legal residency to virtually all
Cubans who left their communist island.
</P>
<P>
   But migration accords negotiated in 1995 between Cuba and the
United States changed that by calling for the repatriation of
illegal Cuban migrants who are picked up at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cubans who reach U.S. soil can count on sanctuary, while
Haitians and others face deportation.
</P>
<P>
   In the accords, the Cuban government promised to work to stop
all illegal departures for the United States, while the United
States agreed to help legal immigration by issuing 20,000 visas to
Cubans each year in a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The latest change in policy came in May when Immigration and
Naturalization Commissioner Doris Meissner ruled that Cuban
refugees are immediately eligible for a work permit. Before that
order, they were not guaranteed employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are policies in place that encourage people to leave
Cuba,'' Fernandez said. ``If new measures aren't adopted, more
people will be coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are other explanations as to why there's an
upturn in illegal departures.
</P>
<P>
   Some cite the miserably hot weather. Others cite drought-induced
food shortages coupled with Cuba's seemingly endless economic
troubles. There is intense frustration among Cuba's 12 million
people over an erosion in their standard of living since the fall
of the Soviet Union, Cuba's main benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Still others cite an increase in government repression on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions in Cuba are very volatile,'' Perez said. ``It
wouldn't surprise me if there was a big exodus this summer.''

HILLARY CLINTON DEFENDS ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN PARIS SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, on the cusp of
launching her campaign for the U.S. Senate seat from New York,
defended the role of government Thursday and urged expanded
government action worldwide to give everyone a chance to succeed in
the high tech age.
</P>
<P>
   In hour-long remarks at the Sorbonne, Clinton urged governments
to invest in education, health care and child care to equip
citizens for fast changing economic developments.
</P>
<P>
   Without citing any group by name, Clinton said: ``There are
those, particularly in my country, who insist on assaulting
government, who claim that if we would only abolish or severely
weaken it, then everyone's freedom and prosperity would blossom.''
</P>
<P>
   That is ``a very mistaken notion,'' said Clinton, who is making
plans for her campaign to succeed retiring veteran Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need strong and efficient governments, not oppressive or
weak ones, that are able to empower citizens to help them take
responsibilities for their families and their communities,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton decried Apocalyptic pessimism and anti-government
sentiment that she said has propelled some unnamed commercial films
in which ``we have space aliens who are always blowing up
Washington, D.C., and the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Her audience included her daughter, Chelsea, U.S. Ambassador to
France Felix Rohaytn and French First Lady Bernadette Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention her personal political plans during her
remarks. She later flew to Fez, Morocco, to inaugurate a maternity
operating room and to participate in discussions about ways for
non-governmental humanitarian organizations to become more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans an address on Friday in Palermo, Sicily, on ways
to build citizen action and activism before she flies to Cologne,
Germany, to join President Clinton for the annual summit of leaders
from the seven largest industrialized nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady defended her priorities against critics who, she
said, warn against the ``feminization of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some in my country and elsewhere who say once talk
turns to civil society _ to education, to life-long learning, to
health care, to empowering the voluntary sector _ that we have
strayed into soft politics that will lead to a feminization of
politics,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I prefer to think of this process as the humanization of
politics, the kind of kitchen table issues that are discussed by
parents in Paris and in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``By paying attention to these real life
political issues, we can reinvest in citizens and give them a stake
in their governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a glancing reference to her own ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to the leadership that will come in the public
and the private sectors to create the kind of future that is worthy
of our past ideals,'' she said.

`WALKER EVANS': PHOTOGRAPHER REMAINS IN THE SHADOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publications notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is to be done when a distinguished biographer dies suddenly
before his book is completed? Should the manuscript be preserved in
a library for researchers to use as reference? Should another
writer be commissioned to complete the work? Or should the
incomplete manuscript be published anyway?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of James R. Mellow, who died of a heart attack in
late 1997, the decision was made to publish his voluminous
unfinished work on one of this century's great American
photographers, Walker Evans. After all, Mellow was a noted critic
whose biographies include those of Gertrude Stein, F. Scott and
Zelda Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is a formidable artist who has remained as dauntingly
elusive as his work is sparingly direct. In 1995 Belinda Rathbone
published the first biography of Evans, who died in April 1975 at
71. She did not have access to Evans' personal papers: diaries,
letters, work logs and contact sheets; the Evans estate granted
that access to Mellow. The last chapter he wrote prior to his death
explored Evans' interactions with Robert Frank in the mid-1950s. It
is in the prologue, with its account of Mellow's 1974 interview
with a bleary-eyed and hard-drinking Evans, that a glimpse is
offered of the photographer's troubled late years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a generous and illuminating introduction by the critic
Hilton Kramer, Mellow's biography of Evans reads like a sprawling
work in progress awaiting judicious pruning and editing. Although
Mellow comes as close as anyone has to cracking the enigma that was
Evans, this is an exasperating book.
</P>
<P>
   It is plagued by the picayune, with Mellow seemingly believing
that the reader would be interested in every note and every list
that Evans ever wrote. Evans' student writings and translations in
Paris, which are not without charm, are treated as if they were
serious literary works.
</P>
<P>
   Mellow also tends to peel off and dwell at some length on the
background and accomplishments of the various people Evans came
into contact with. Or might have come into contact with. Or didn't
meet at all.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that Mellow sternly points out that ``there is
no evidence'' for this or that, he resorts to the frequent and
highly problematic use of ``it seems,'' ``may have,'' ``possibly,''
``probably,'' phrases like ``there is some reason for speculation
that'' or writing that something ``might or might not have been
true.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the subject of Evans' sexual adventures,
Mellow's passive-aggressive hedging can veer toward the
preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Evans formed close friendships with a number of men, including
the artists Hanns Skolle and Ben Shahn, the arts impresario and
critic Lincoln Kirstein, and the writers James Agee and John
Cheever. Mellow writes that it was during the early period of
Cheever's friendship with Evans, in the early 30s, that ``Cheever's
homosexual seduction by Walker Evans took place _ if, in fact, it
ever did take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a reader wading through all this is rewarded with a
tantalizing, often revealing portrait of one of photography's most
literary artists. A slight, fastidious, good-looking, charming man
with a domineering mother, Evans had gone to Paris in 1926, at 22,
intending to be a writer. The next year he was in New York, about
to begin his long career in photography.
</P>
<P>
   Mellow expertly charts the trajectory of Evans' soaring career
in the context of the times. Evans was a leading pioneer of what a
critic described as ``a pure photography without any romanticism.''
A 1929 photograph of a roadside gas sign, Mellow notes, ``has an
almost Abstract Expressionist quality, 20 years before the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Evans took some of the most memorably empathetic
photographs of the rural poor during the Depression, he indicated
early on that he had no illusions about people. ``I think the human
race should be kicked around a great deal more than it is,'' he
wrote his friend Hanns Skolle in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   As far as exhibitions of his pictures were concerned, Mellow
writes, Evans ``had made all the right connections'' and cultivated
the mystique of the purist. He wouldn't go to his own openings or
allow publicity shots of himself to be used in publications. He
wouldn't photograph celebrities. He wouldn't politicize his mind or
his work, believing that an artist could reveal the human
condition, not directly alleviate it.
</P>
<P>
   Mellow portrays Evans in private life almost as a character out
of a Camus story: the perpetual disengaged observer. Evans'
romantic entanglements were the stuff of bad television soap
operas. Invariably the wife of a friend would become enamored of
him. In one terrible episode one such woman taunted her husband by
openly pursuing Evans, who coolly played along.
</P>
<P>
   Mellow also discusses at some length a bizarre sexual experiment
involving the notorious Agee; his wife, Alma, and Evans. Accounts
of the threesome in bed by Agee and his wife differ. Evans would
later attribute the sexual goings-on among his contemporaries to
the tenor of the times: ``Everybody by rote went to bed with
everybody else, and the result was an emotional desert and
confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 Evans finally married Jane Ninas, a woman with whom he
had carried on an on-and-off affair for some years. For a while,
from the letters he wrote when they were apart, he was quite the
besotted husband. (The marriage was to last 10 or so years.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,'' with text by Agee and
photographs of destitute tenant farmers by Evans, was published the
same year. Lionel Trilling commented on the ``perfect taste'' of
Evans' pictures, ``taking that word in its largest possible sense
to mean tact, delicacy, justness of feeling, complete awareness and
perfect respect.''
</P>
<P>
   In fewer than 100 pages toward the end of the biography, Mellow
goes quickly over Evans' two-year stint (1943-45) as a movie critic
at Time magazine and his taking a job as staff photographer and
writer at Fortune, where he worked until 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Among the extraordinary nuggets that Mellow unearths are
portions of a late 1947 interview for Time that was never used. In
it, Evans said: ``My work is like making love, if you'll forgive
me. It has to spring from the moment, from what I feel at the
moment. That's all.''

JONATHA BROOKE'S INDEPENDENCE DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL DeYOUNG   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Getting dropped from MCA Records was a mixed blessing for
singer/songwriter Jonatha Brooke. While it meant less media
exposure, less radio play and a whole lot less money, the MCA boot
meant Brooke had to figure out how to do things for herself or go
back to waiting tables.
</P>
<P>
   She had to, perish the thought, grow up a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to be an artist who's cursed with somewhat of a
business sensibility,'' says the Boston-based performer, who's in
the middle of a solo tour. ``Or I like to think that I am. Perhaps
I'm fooling myself. But I've always been really involved in all the
aspects of what I do, so I kind of know the beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1998, Brooke started her own label, Bad Dog Records, and
sold 4,000 copies of ``Jonatha Brooke Live'' over the Internet.
``It's a tough one,'' says the 35-year-old musician, calling from a
Texas tour stop, ``because I do find myself overwhelmed from time
to time: `Oh my God, how much is that going to cost? There goes my
life savings!' '' Now available in stores, the album is doing a
brisk business.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' she says, ``I'm kind of enjoying the
education of it. I just have to really carve out time to shut the
phones off and put down that I'm creative, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a journalist father and a poet mother, Brooke
writes airy confessionals closer in spirit to dreamy Sarah
McLachlan than to strident Ani DiFranco, America's other
folksinger-turned-indie-mogul. A onetime ballet dancer, she began
her recording career in 1989 as frontwoman for the band The Story.
Six years and two critically acclaimed Story albums later, she went
out on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke's second solo collection, ``Ten Cent Wings,'' hit the
streets in November 1997, just as Seagram's, the liquor giant, was
buying MCA's parent company. Although the reviews were glowing
(said Billboard: `` `Ten Cent Wings' is essential, like taking a
deep breath after witnessing something magnificent''), the label _
or what was left of it _ failed to promote the album. In the middle
of a tour, Brooke received a pink slip.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much disagreement at the top about me and my
record,'' Brooke recalls. ``There was just no consolidated
consensus about who I was or what they were going to do, or what
they were willing to do. It was just a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   MCA first offered her a serious cut in pay _ and when she
refused, the ax fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you still have to hang onto the fact that they have not
touched your career _ you are completely intact. And once you get
out there in front of your fans, that's what's so clear. And that's
what was so reassuring about getting back on the road and making
this record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a daunting venture. I think if I weren't as established
as I am _ I have a pretty rabid following _ I wouldn't have been
able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   MCA wasn't the only major label doing serious housecleaning at
the time _ numerous established artists such as Me'Shell
Ndegeocello, Wendy &AMP; Lisa and Cowboy Junkies found themselves
without a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A gazillion more people have been dumped since then,'' Brooke
explains. ``And I'm really happy to have been one of the first! So
that I could turn it around and do something positive immediately
and be kind of ahead of the curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weird thing is that I can't rule out any possibility for
the future. I'm going to make a record over the summer, certainly
make it myself, and make it exactly what I want it to be. And then
make the decision what to do with it. Because you know, if a label
really has some heart and soul, and they really believe in you,
you're the luckiest girl in the world. And I can't compete with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooke grew up with mixed musical influences: While her two
brothers wore the grooves out of Rolling Stones and Who albums, her
mother played and sang hymns on the family piano. ``She'd put on
Rachmaninoff and walk around the house weeping to this beautiful
music,'' Brooke remembers. ``And so from an early age I connected
deep emotion to music.'' From her father, she learned to love
words, to ask questions and actually listen to the answers. He also
played a little trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   Young Jonatha's own taste's ran to soundtrack albums for ``The
Sound of Music,'' ``Godspell'' and ``Hair.''
</P>
<P>
   For a success blueprint, Brooke says she wouldn't mind looking
to her longtime friend Shawn Colvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, as I get older I'm happier and happier with
exactly what I have,'' she says. ``I appreciate it for what it is.
When I got to Austin yesterday, `Sunny Came Home' was playing in
the airport. And I wondered what it's like for her to finally, when
she was 40, have this kind of ironic success. After working her ass
off forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine that will probably happen to me, like some fluky
weird thing will happen and all of a sudden one of my songs will
finally be recognized. I can laugh about it, I think.''

AIRLINE INDUSTRY AGREES TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to ward off congressional action, the
nation's major airlines promised Thursday to improve customer
service by giving passengers more information about fares and
delayed flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have felt the whip from Congress; we've heard the bell ring
from the flying public,'' said Gerald Greenwald, chairman of United
Airlines and head of the Air Transport Association Executive
Committee, an airline industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Some frequent-flyers_ including Senate Commerce Committee
Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., and House Transportation Committee
Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa. _ were so irritated at the industry
that in February they introduced ``passenger rights'' legislation
mandating better customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Their move came in the wake of a highly publicized incident in
January when Northwest Airlines passengers had to sit on runways in
Detroit for as long as eight hours without access to food or usable
restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald said the threat of action from Congress and the
public's feeling ``that the airlines just don't care'' forced the
industry to agree on its own customer service plan.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal _ which apparently staves off, for now, a stronger
measure by Congress _ was announced after several months of
negotiations among the industry, the Department of Transportation
and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   It would require airlines to offer the lowest fare available on
any given flight and allow people to hold a reservation up to 24
hours without paying for it. Airlines would also have to give
up-to-date and accurate information about delayed and canceled
flights as well

   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to ward off congressional action, the

</P>
<P>
   ``We have felt the whip from Congress; we've heard the bell ring

   Their move came in the wake of a highly publicized incident in

</P>
<P>
   Greenwald said the threat of action from Congress and the

</P>
<P>
   The proposal _ which apparently staves off, for now, a stronger

negotiations among the industry, the Department of Transportation
and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   It would require airlines to offer the lowest fare available on
any given flight and allow people to hold a reservation up to 24
hours without paying for it. Airlines would also have to give
up-to-date and accurate information about delayed and canceled
flights as well as establish clear policies for accommodating
passengers who are delayed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The plan requires airlines to ``make every reasonable effort to
provide food, water, restroom facilities and access to medical
treatment for passengers abroad an aircraft that is on the ground
for an extended period of time without access to the terminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald admitted that parts of the plan, such as holding a
reservation for 24 hours without payment, are already followed by
many airlines.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said at a news conference he was not completely satisfied
with the industry proposal. He said he wants a provision that would
require airlines to notify passengers when flights are overbooked.
He also plans to push legislation that would require the Department
of Transportation to report to Congress periodically on whether the
industry is following its customer service program.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain spoke, Greenwald said the industry would agree to
that measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be watching very, very carefully,'' said Sen.
John D. ``Jay'' Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., one of the lawmakers who
negotiated the plan with the airlines. ``If this doesn't work, then
we'll have to move to a mandatory approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald warned that the plan ``is not a panacea for every ill
everyday that's out there, but it does provide a solid and
unprecedented effort by this industry address key issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuster called the plan a ``big step in the right direction,''
but said Congress must still consider ``whether federal legislation
is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Galloway, president of the American Society of Travel
Agents, a trade group, said he thinks it is needed. ``Most of this
proposal is merely a restatement of existing policy, though not of
existing practice,'' he said. ``It reflects little new or
innovative in the way airlines treat customers.''

AUTO COLLECTING: A CURIOUS POSTSCRIPT TO A PROUD BRAND'S TALE

<P>
   PASCO, Wash. _ In 1955, on the verge of collapse, Packard _ the
luxury automaker that was sometimes called America's Rolls-Royce _
designed an elegant show car in response to loyal customers'
requests for a Packard that resembled the ones of old. The $20,000
prototype was enthusiastically received but never made it into
production.
</P>
<P>
   When the company was shut down by Studebaker in 1958, it was
assumed that the only existing model of that show car _ the Request
_ had been consigned to the scrap heap. It was, in fact, driven out
of the factory in Detroit in broad daylight, rumored to have been
given to an executive's mistress.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to 1973: the car reappeared, damaged and rusting,
in a backyard in Portland, Ore., where Larry Dopps, a reclusive
collector from Pasco, bought it.
</P>
<P>
   Dopps rebuilt the car as an investment _ at one time asking
$325,000 for it. As Packard aficionados continued to debate its
value in the intervening years, the Request's public exposure was
limited to articles is a few specialty magazines and an appearance
at a car show in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, as Packard lovers celebrate the company's 100th
anniversary, the marque will be featured at the Pebble Beach
Concours in August, and the two main owners' clubs _ Packard
Automobile Classics and Packards International _ are planning
celebrations at Packard's birthplace in Warren, Ohio. A museum is
opening July 4, and the clubs have invited landmark cars, including
the Request, to a show on July 6.
</P>
<P>
   While Dopps, 62, will not be able to attend because of his
health, he is convinced the Request is an important piece of
American automotive history. After more than 25 years as its owner,
he is preparing to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't sell it to Europe or Japan,'' he said, ``even if
they offered me half a million dollars. It's American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a show car, the Request differed surprisingly
little from the 1955 Four Hundred coupe it was based on (unlike
Packard's last show car, the 1956 Predictor, which looked as if it
were patched together from a 1958 Lincoln and a 1961 Cadillac).
</P>
<P>
   But the Request's front-end styling still stuns enthusiasts. The
designer, Richard Teague, revived the classic upright Packard
grille of the 1930s and found a way to fit it to the new model.
</P>
<P>
   Teague, who died in 1991, was a major player in Detroit. He
worked for Packard from 1951-58 and then for American Motors until
1984. His 1963 Rambler Classic redesign was the Motor Trend car of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, General Motors developed dream cars to draw
people to auto shows. Although these show cars seldom made it to
full production, some of the ideas they featured were incorporated
in humbler vehicles. Packard's show cars included the Pan American
in 1952, the Balboa hardtop in 1953 and the Panther in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   For 1955, Packard had overhauled its line with new models, and
Teague was asked to develop a show car to match.
</P>
<P>
   Because time and money were problems, Teague took a cue from the
flood of letters from dealers and owners longing for the
traditional Packard touch. He grabbed the third new Four Hundred
coupe off the assembly line (No. 5587-1003) and sent it to Creative
Industries of Detroit, which specialized in building show cars.
</P>
<P>
   In less than 90 days, Creative produced a show car in pearl
white and copper to Teague's design. Its fiberglass hood featured a
distinctive badge and the words ``Packard Request'' in script on
the hood, trunk and fenders. Front bumpers were cast in huge loops
on each side of the tall grille, which curved underneath the car. A
salmon-and-cream interior and cloisonne hubcaps from a 1948 Custom
Eight topped off the chrome wire wheels. The rear fenders were
peaked with lead points to resemble the Packard Caribbean, the top
of the production lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 400 pounds of front bumpers, the new self-leveling
torsion-bar suspension was able to balance the Request, though the
space between the grille and the road was less than 6 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership cannot be traced further than Walter King of Portland,
who bought the Request for $1,500 in 1959 and owned it until 1973.
Merle Wolfer, a Portland collector, recalled that King wanted
$2,500 for the Request when he inquired about it in the late 1960s.
It had been through two crashes and was off the road several years
when Dopps first looked at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the bumpers was broken; we had to have it repaired, and
we were missing some grille bars and the grille surround,'' Dopps
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Dopps is disappointed that he will not make the trip to Ohio,
but he basked in the glow of Packard enthusiasts as least once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when we went to the Packard National in Oakland,
Calif., with the car in 1983,'' he said. ``We were definitely the
poor relations there, but when we drove the car in, they gave us a
standing ovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dopps keeps the Request in a tent garage in eastern Washington.
Beneath the dust, paint shines, chrome glitters and the
352-cubic-inch V8 engine still runs smoothly. With only 14,805
miles, it has plenty of life.
</P>
<P>
   And it still displays evidence of its show-car origins. There is
no body number on the fire wall, which was never painted and still
wears primer. The paint and trim plaque on the door jamb is also
blank.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that No. 1003 was indeed one of the first
1955's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the shifter,'' Dopps said. ``See how it's bent? That's
from trying to get it out of parking gear. The pawl was too long.
They fixed it early in the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Williams of the Blackhawk Collection estimated the car's
value at around $50,000. ``There'll be some interest,'' he said.
``There's always interest in dream cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles Morris, vice president of Christie's International
Motorcars, remembered the Request.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Dick Teague's design, isn't it?'' he asked, estimating
its value at $50,000 to $80,000. He quickly added, ``We'd be
interested in selling it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   While collectors seem to love the idea of driving a new
Duesenberg or Stutz, when revived classic marques are delivered,
they usually disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the 1970s General Motors coupes that were turned into
Stutzes. How about those huge Ford V8s with automatic transmissions
in Duesenberg clones.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the company that decides to make as many original
parts as it can only to discover what it must charge to make money.
There is a company that makes elegant copies of Talbot-Lago
Streamliners, but start counting out $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   And face it, most faux classics simply don't look right; their
proportions are seldom as refined as the originals'.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Roy Gullickson, a Phoenix businessman, is betting on a new
Packard. Promoted as ``an ultra luxury automobile,'' it is equipped
like a Cadillac Seville ($47,850), Lexus LS400 ($53,800) or Jaguar
sedan ($64,300). A spokesman confirmed the car has all-wheel drive
and a V12 engine. There is only one prototype, but the projected
price is $135,000 to $150,000, comparable with Mercedes and
Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
   The design falls into an area known as contemporary classic _
old styling cues stamped on a modern profile. The front resembles
the Packard Phantom show car, while the sides have fade-away
fenders like a Pontiac Grand Am. You can see it at
www.packardmotorcar.com/intro.htm.
</P>
<P>
   What do classic car experts think?
</P>
<P>
   Allen Stephens organized the Forest Grove Concours in Oregon, a
big West Coast classic car gathering, for 25 years. ``It's
admirable somebody wants to bring back the Packard name,'' he said,
``but that's all he's going to be bringing back.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JORDAN WON THOSE TITLES, NOT JACKSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LOWELL COHN   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excuse me for not getting all hot and worked up over the
appointment of Phil Jackson as Lakers coach.
</P>
<P>
   To read about this guy, you'd think a combination of Gandhi and
General George Patton had just set down in L.A. In newspapers and
on the radio, people keep referring to Jackson as: the Zen Master,
a former hippie, a philosopher. I don't know about any of that,
although if I'm in the market for a philosopher I go with Plato
over Phil Jackson any day of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I'm sure Jackson is a nice man, and a fine
and wonderful basketball coach. But I don't for a minute believe
he's responsible for those six NBA championships the Bulls won with
him in charge. He had a pretty good player on his team named
Michael Jordan. I bet Jordan made all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why I come to that conclusion. There's a clear pattern to
the last eight years of Jackson's coaching career. When he had
Jordan he won championships. When he didn't have Jordan, he didn't
win diddly.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordan Bulls won the NBA title in 1991, 1992 and 1993. Then,
as you recall, Jordan decided to play minor-league baseball.
Without Jordan in the 1993-1994 season, the Bulls got eliminated in
the Eastern Conference semifinals. The next season, when they had
Jordan for only 17 regular-season games, the Bulls again lost in
the conference semifinals. Both seasons they failed to finish on
top of their division.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the Zen wasn't working.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to the next three seasons, all with Jordan. The Bulls won
three championships in a row. Do we attribute that success to the
magical return of Zen, or the return of Michael? You tell me.
</P>
<P>
   Think about the last time Jordan ever played. It was the sixth
game of the NBA Finals, Bulls against Jazz. If you want to know the
truth, Jordan won the title all by himself. With 20 seconds to go,
Utah led, 86-85. Karl Malone got the ball down low, but Jordan
flashed to Malone's blind side and stole the ball. He then sank the
winning shot with 5.2 seconds to go. All in all, he scored 45 of
the Bulls' 87 points.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson really had his Zen working in that game.
</P>
<P>
   So here's what I want to say. No player in the history of
basketball ever equaled Jordan's impact. The Chicago Bulls didn't
need Jackson to win all those championships. They could have gone
to the store and purchased an inflatable dummy for 20 bucks and
made him the coach. The dummy's job would have been real simple:
Keep your mouth shut, dummy, and get the ball to Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the dummy couldn't actually say, ``Get the ball to
Michael.'' So the trainer, or some other Bulls insider, would have
taped a note to the dummy's chest: ``Get the ball to Michael.''
During timeouts, the players would read the note and remember the
Bulls strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, other teams would have seen the note, too. So the
Bulls could have taped misleading sentences to the dummy to keep
the other team in the dark. These could have said, ``Get the ball
to Ike,'' or ``Get the ball to Izzie,'' or ``Get the ball to
You-Know-Who.'' It really didn't matter if the other team knew,
anyway. They couldn't stop Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   We can be relatively certain that, because he is no dummy,
Jackson's coaching philosophy was the same as the inflatable
dummy's: ``Get the ball to Michael.'' Jackson probably went to bed
chanting that mantra, and woke up reciting it.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also had the sense always to stay on Jordan's good side,
which meant he knew not to louse up a good thing. In return, Jordan
gave Jackson the illusion the coach was running the show.
</P>
<P>
   All that's changed. Starting next season, Jackson will have to
coach the Lakers on his own because there won't be a Michael.
Somehow Jackson will have to create a unified squad in spite of all
those egos veering in opposite directions _ the Shaquille O'Neal
ego and the Kobe Bryant ego immediately come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Then we'll learn if Jackson actually can coach, and we'll see
how far Zen can take you in the NBA.
</P>

VACATIONS TAKE YOU TO ANOTHER WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday, June 24)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   What do you need out of a vacation? On my vacation I want
assurance that I am absolutely somewhere else. I want to be a
landed version of an astronaut on a lifeline floating around the
moon, looking back at Earth. I want something a little unexpected,
even a little surreal, to remind me that I am truly far, far from
home, like in some remote corner of Spain or France.
</P>
<P>
   The wind came up, not just any ordinary flutter but something
that toppled tables and shoved metal chairs so hard they scraped
like fingernails on the sidewalk. We were at an outdoor restaurant
in the border town of Portbou on the Spanish-French border on the
Mediterranean coast. The maitre d' said these winds come out of the
Pyrenees and can last for three days. He said they are like the
mistral winds in France that drive some people mad. He mentioned
that Salvador Dali had once lived here, as if there were a
connection.
</P>
<P>
   The wind did seem to have an effect. People picked up their
children and left the streets. Two waiters suddenly started
scuffling. All night the wind screamed and banged shutters, but in
the morning it was clear and people filled the square selling
pieces of salted cod at one table and women's underwear at another.
</P>
<P>
   The guidebook suggests that the mountaintop town of Alquezar in
northern central Spain is a good bet for people who like back
roads. It didn't say that the road itself ends in Alquezar and once
you finally reach it you may need to ask around for accommodations.
A guy sitting on a bench said he could help, squeezed into our car
and threaded us through the stone village on an impossible road,
where, seemingly, only goats dared to tread, and had us stop at the
back of a house. The woman inside provided her spare room and
quoted a price less than that day's lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The night delivered a full moon against the outline of a castle
along with strange animal sounds, which we never identified,
something between a convention of starlings and tiny pigs facing
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, as we sat in the square eating cheese with slices of
dried ham, a small white horse appeared. Unsaddled and
unaccompanied, it stood and stared and then went back down the
hill, past a 16th century church.
</P>
<P>
   A wedding reception was finishing up in a rose-filled garden of
an inn in the French country town of Saveterre-de-Bearn. The woman
who ran the inn didn't want names or passports, just gave us a
large skeleton key and nodded toward the red-carpeted wide
staircase. The bed was lumpy, the toilet shuddered in protest and
the one bath towel was as thin as a scarf. It would never qualify
for a B&AMP;B rating in California, but in terms of faded grandeur it
was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Given our own umbrella table and pitchers of red wine, we
watched the families kiss and tease each other, the little girls in
dresses and little boys in short pants shouting in singsong French,
everyone coming together for photos against some moss-covered tower
and finally collecting at long tables to take on platters of food.
</P>
<P>
   I kept thinking that if this were a movie and I were watching
I'd want to be in it. We met up with old friends in Mallorca who 12
years ago went in with others to buy a crumbling stone house
outside the village of Sant Joan. This is not the Mallorca where
Michael Douglas and Claudia Schiffer frolic but the hot, flat
middle of the island. For two months every summer they leave
teaching jobs in San Diego and live here without electricity or hot
water. Their well is in their living room. When they bought the
house it was a few walls and part of a roof, and so each summer
there is a building project. At night they walk into the village
and drink beer and eat ice cream with the locals. They are happily
without access to e-mail, CNN and English-language newspapers and
don't have a phone.
</P>
<P>
   We traveled with friends who were trying to locate relatives in
the Basque country in northern Spain. There was supposed to be an
old aunt in the fishing port of Bermeo but some men in a tavern
told them she had died. Our hostess, however, who runs a small
hotel in the nearby town of Mundaka, was not convinced. Quietly she
took it upon herself to further investigate and made a few phone
calls. By that night she had resurrected the aunt, who had been ill
but is alive enough to have a sweet reunion with her California
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it went. And oh, yes, only one person had
anything anti-American to say. It was the Spaniard who found us a
room for the night in Alquezar. He called the U.S. a bully and
pretty much blamed the Yugoslav war on America. But he thought we
were OK.

REPUBLICANS REVIVE DRIVE FOR WORKPLACE FLEX TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Republican senators introduced a bill Thursday
that would allow wage earners to choose time off instead of
overtime pay and to arrange with their bosses to work more flexible
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, endorsed by business groups, faces an almost
certain challenge from Democrats, who two years ago blocked a
similar bill on the grounds that it undermined labor laws and
risked the abuse of workers by their employers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said the Family Friendly Workplace
Act would help hourly workers better balance the competing demands
and tensions of work and home. Federal and salaried employees have
benefited from such flexible scheduling for decades, said Ashcroft,
who is sponsoring the bill with Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flexible job schedules could allow a working mother to leave
work early on Friday for a child's doctor's appointment, and then
make up the missed time next week without suffering a loss of
pay,'' Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said employers and workers should be able to hash out
their own scheduling agreements, ``but there's a government hand
that says you can't do this,'' she said, referring to the Fair
Labor Standards Act. Enacted in 1938, the law requires that
employers pay hourly wage earners overtime if they work more than
40 hours in one week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time that we let hourly workers who are often the most
stressed have the relief that they say they need,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   The senators cited a Rutgers University study released in March
that surveyed 1,000 adult workers and found that 87 percent rated
flexible work hours as important.
</P>
<P>
   The Ashcroft-Hutchison proposal, which is co-sponsored by 31
other Republicans, would allow employers and workers to structure a
two-week period such that an employee could work up to 50 hours in
one week and 30 the other. A worker also could choose compensation
at the rate of time-and-a-half off instead of time-and-a-half pay
for each hour of overtime worked.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents
small business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., led a filibuster of similar
legislation in 1997, saying it amounted to an assault on the
traditional work week, undermined labor law and could have resulted
in employers forcing workers to accept time off instead of overtime
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft and Hutchison said this bill would be more popular
because it includes changes such as stiffer penalties to prevent
employers from coercing workers into accepting time off instead of
overtime pay.

 &HT;    Scouting out Savannah's history
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ John Berendt's ``Midnight in the Garden of Good
and Evil'' may have created the appetite for stories about the
bizarre side of life in Savannah, but it doesn't hold a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Even tourists being ushered through the 19th century birthplace
home of Juliette Gordon Low, founder of the Girl Scouts, hear the
unusual story of how she became deaf.
</P>
<P>
   One ear went bad when she contracted an ear infection as a
child, and the doctor treated it with silver nitrate, says Jim
Varnedoe, one of several docents who give tours of Low's home.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at her wedding, a grain of rice lodged in her good ear,
and became infected. A different doctor, trying to remove it,
punctured her eardrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said it was so much trouble to listen to other people that
she just did all the talking,'' says Varnedoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrible story,'' says Sharon Katsos with a laugh,
adding that it's a story almost everyone who tours the home
remembers. She just finished a trip with 15 Girl Scout Cadettes
from Leesburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd been on a train all night, so you can imagine how much
sleep they got,'' Katsos says. ``But they were just entranced with
the lifestyle, even though they're teenagers.''
</P>
<P>
   Savannah as a whole can have that effect on visitors, even
though Low's home _ now officially the Juliette Gordon Low Girl
Scout National Center _ is just a small part of Savannah, one
antebellum mansion nestled under red oaks and Spanish moss at the
corner of Bull and Oglethorpe streets.
</P>
<P>
   And it's definitely not just for Girl Scouts. One recent day,
the tour groups were primarily two busloads of senior citizens and
a mob of French tourists, who brought their own translator, so that
Varnedoe would pause after every sentence of his practiced spiel
and wait for the French version.
</P>
<P>
   Low, who was born to a wealthy Savannah family, was only 3 years
old when Gen. William Sherman invaded the city in 1864, and she
could remember him paying a courtesy call to her parents (her
father ran a cotton brokerage) and holding her on his lap.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told (Low told it herself, true or not) that she
saw one of Sherman's soldiers missing an arm and asked him where it
was. ``Got it shot off by a rebel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose my father did it,'' the tyke supposedly replied.
``He's shot lots of Yankees!''
</P>
<P>
   Juliette, who was nicknamed Daisy (hence the youngest Girl
Scouts being called Daisies today), married William Low, the son of
a prosperous British shipping magnate, and the two spent much of
their life in England and Scotland. There she became friends with
Sir Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the fledgling Boy Scout
movement, who told her of the thousands of girls who had asked to
join the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Low returned to Savannah in 1912, widowed, childless, 52 years
old, feeling her life had been a failure, and founded the Girl
Scouts, who held their first meeting in the Low house.
</P>
<P>
   The history of Girl Scouts permeates the antiques-filled,
four-story, Regency-style house. In the family parlor is a bust of
Daisy Gordon Lawrence, Low's niece, whom Low registered as the
first official Girl Scout (Daisy, slightly peeved, felt her aunt
should have asked her first). Low was an artist and her oil
paintings hang on the walls of most of the rooms. The painted
porcelain plates in the dining room china cabinet _ depicting
wildlife and flowers _ are by her as well. She even took a ladies'
blacksmithing course and fashioned a set of wrought-iron gates that
stand in the garden behind the house, where Girl Scout troops
sometimes hold ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The house is not wheelchair-friendly (the first stage was built
between 1818 and '21), and the signage outside directing visitors
could be better (go downstairs under the porch to buy tickets
before you wait in line). But while everyone else in Savannah looks
for signs of the Lady Chablis or the statue from the ``Midnight''
cover, at least some go looking for the founder of Girl Scouts.

to Savannah . . .
</P>
<P>
   Getting here
</P>
<P>
   It's a four-hour drive from Atlanta. Take I-75 to Macon, then
I-16 to Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   Savannah is famous for the many bed-and-breakfasts in and around
its Historic District, and anyone who's settled into a good one
knows it's a pleasant way to stay here. (Check about air
conditioning when you make the reservation, though; not all
bed-and-breakfasts have it.) The Savannah Convention and Visitors
Bureau (number follows) can help with a selection.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative is to stay on Tybee Island, a strip of land about
4 miles long that borders the Atlantic Ocean and is linked to the
mainland by U.S. 80. Tybee is unlikely to impress visitors who want
to live in luxury, but for the budget-minded, young families, and
people who want to combine some serious beach time with their
Savannah trip, it's worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   While Savannah celebrates its past, from its founding through
the Civil War, through the events of ``Midnight in the Garden,''
Tybee is more like it's stuck in a time-warp of the late '50s to
mid-'60s. As you drive over several bridges to get there, you
wonder if maybe your car radio will revert to AM only.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny, slow-moving ``downtown'' (about four blocks long) has
an old-fashioned dime store called Chu's that's packed to the
rafters with everything imaginable; a place to rent bikes for $10 a
day; several restaurants that don't look as if they've been visited
by the Mobil Guide; and a few hotels. But the beach is enormous,
well-packed and very clean.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing is available from an old-fashioned pier. Some visitors
go to the Tybee lighthouse, which was built in the 1880s, with
stairs going all the way to the top (and landings on which to pause
and catch your breath).
</P>
<P>
   More information: Tybee Island Visitors' Center, 912-786-5444.
On the Web at www.tybeeisland.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around
</P>
<P>
   Savannah was voted one of the 10 Most Walkable Cities in America
by Walking magazine: small-scale, lots of shade and benches, and
James Oglethorpe's original design of town squares full of green
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most enjoyable ways to learn about the city and its
history is through the many walking tours. There are at least three
groups that offer them, and the largest is Savannah Walks
(1-888-728-9255, or www.savwalks.com/).
</P>
<P>
   There are several tours that concentrate on graveyards and ghost
stories (for best effect, do one after dark) and several that
concentrate on ``Midnight in the Garden.'' Tours generally cost
$10-$13 per person (less for children and senior citizens) and take
90 minutes to two hours. A good guide (and guides vary) will be
humorous, dramatic, filled with historical trivia, able to answer
questions, and won't let the occasional fact get in the way of a
really good yarn.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to walking tours, there are horse-drawn carriage
tours, bus tours, and guys who drive bicycle rickshaws.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   Like the bed-and-breakfast industry, Savannah is loaded with
good restaurants, the most famous of which is Elizabeth on 37th
(105 E. 37th St.; 912-236-5447). While Elizabeth's high-class
cuisine is worth a trip, if your plastic doesn't have much room,
there are lower-priced alternatives worth a stop.
</P>
<P>
   The 606 East Cafe (319 W. Congress St., 912-233-2887) is a funky
joint serving burgers, beers, onion rings (stacked by the foot) and
tasty bar food. But most visitors remember the decor, which makes
your typical TGI Fridays look minimalist. The crammed, kitschy
collection includes tons of cow-motif items, an overhead
clothesline, murals and aquariums. Even the waitresses apparently
must be multiple-tattooed before they are hired.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill's Pub (9 Drayton St.; 912-232-8501) had a brief scene
in the movie version of ``Midnight,'' but don't hold that against
it. The building dates to 1850, and although Churchill never came
near the place, the bar itself was shipped over from a British pub
in the 1920s. Traditional pub food includes bubble and squeak (a
casserole of mashed potatoes, cabbage, turkey and ham) and
shepherd's pie (ground beef and mixed veggies under a crust), and
the beers are a mix of British, American and European. Nothing is
more than $7.

`THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER': THRILLER WITH A FETISH FOR MOTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Murder on a military base was once a good enough pretext for a
detective thriller, but nowadays it takes more. The prevailing
sleaze quotient calls for kinks in a movie killing, and ``The
General's Daughter'' is eager to oblige. So the title character is
left worse than dead. She is found strangled, naked and
spread-eagled, pinned by tent pegs in an exposed outdoor setting.
And the camera lets her lie there for repeated long shots as the
investigation begins. Though the search for a culprit holds
surprises, this isn't one of them: the movie thinks she asked for
what she got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote this novel partly as a result of the Persian Gulf war
of January and February 1991,'' notes Nelson DeMille in an
introduction to the blunt best seller on which this movie is based.
The author, a Vietnam veteran, had been irked by how ``the media
personalized the gulf war with endless interviews of women doing
men's jobs,'' and in his book he expressed his view on the idea of
women in the military: that it should be bombed back to the Stone
Age. So his story concerns the havoc wrought by an incredibly
promiscuous female Army captain upon tough, disciplined men.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to imagining a military investigator to unravel
this case, DeMille wrote his camera-ready novel with Bruce Willis
in mind. But on screen, ``The General's Daughter'' gets some
much-needed mellowing from the presence of John Travolta, whose
Paul Brenner emerges as the voice of reason and the source of
enough sardonic wisecracks to keep the audience engaged. Travolta
again carries a film with enjoyable ease, even if this one remains
badly diminished by its perverse streak. The trouble with the
story's fetishistic touches is that they're so lazy. They seem
barely related to the characters, who are sketchy to begin with.
All we know about the general's daughter, played by Leslie
Stefanson in a truly thankless role, comes from a scene in which
she helps Paul Brenner change a tire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' was directed by Simon West, known for
a prize-winning Pepsi commercial at the 1995 Super Bowl and then
``Con Air.'' Moving into the ``Few Good Men'' genre in which
familiar players stiffly feign military discipline, he once again
shows a knack for underutilizing good actors while pumping up the
story's gratuitously ugly side. The fact that Paul Brenner is first
seen as an undercover agent pretending to deal in illicit weapons
isn't really reason enough for a houseboat shootout in which two
men wind up overboard, struggling near a slashing outboard motor.
The film's idea of tact is to let this sequence culminate in a shot
of reddening water and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   Next Brenner is called in to investigate the death of Capt.
Elisabeth Campbell along with Sarah Sunhill, played by Madeleine
Stowe as a sharp, appealing foil to Travolta's character. In a show
of the narrative cleverness so instrumental to much best-selling
fiction, DeMille made this heroine both a rape expert with the
army's Criminal Investigation Division and an old flame whom
Brenner hasn't seen for a while. Together they spar adroitly while
sifting through the nasty particulars of the case. ``What have we
got here?'' Brenner asks as he stumbles on a cache of pornographic
videotapes. ``Ten bucks says these are not the lost `Honeymooners'
episodes.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspects parade through the movie in a string of well-honed
individual encounters, even though the question of who may or may
not be guilty seems hardly to matter. Everyone has a motive, though
West's way of lending nuances to his characters doesn't go one step
beyond that. At least the screenplay by Christopher Bertolini
(previous credit: ``Frozen Hippo Whiplash'') and the Hollywood
veteran William Goldman often has enough smart, amusing banter to
keep the interrogation scenes crackling. ``Does that make me a
killer?'' asks James Woods as Col. Robert Moore, the most
entertaining suspect in the bunch, as he admits to having no alibi
on the night in question. ``No, it makes you lonely and
unpopular,'' replies Travolta without missing a beat.
</P>
<P>
   With James Cromwell as the dead woman's powerful, politically
ambitious father, and a parade of other stiff-lipped principals in
uniform (among them Clarence Williams 3d, Timothy Hutton, the
director John Frankenheimer and John Beasley in a memorable turn as
an Army psychiatrist), ``The General's Daughter'' runs almost
randomly through the crime investigation and its various leads. A
character who did not die midway through DeMille's book, for
instance, is killed off here just for the sake of a bloody jolt.
For all the stars' intensity as investigators, nobody in this
whodunit really seems interested in the upshot. All the movie cares
about is the deed itself and the way it was done.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``The General's Daughter'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes grisly rape and
other violence, frontal nudity, strong language and gleefully
discussed forensic details of a sex crime.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. (star) denotes a highly recommended film or series.
Ratings and running times are in parentheses.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``AFTER LIFE,'' starring Arata, Taketoshi Naito and Erika
Oda. Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda (not rated, 118 minutes). Much
of this transcendently compassionate, gently humorous Japanese film
is set in a drab office building where courteous caseworkers
welcome the week's new clients.
</P>
<P>
   The place turns out not to be a social service agency but a
metaphysical way station where the newcomers are people of all ages
and types who have just died and have three days to select one
memory to take with them into eternity. Before they depart, those
memories will be filmed.
</P>
<P>
   As they tell their stories and make their choices (those who
can't choose remain at the processing center as caseworkers), the
movie becomes a profound meditation on life's meaning and value and
the relationship of movies, memories and dreams (Stephen Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``ANALYZE THIS,'' starring Robert De Niro and Billy
Crystal. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title,
concept and teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the
lights go down, so think of this comedy as an offer you can't
refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, De Niro is
hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic
goodfella style.
</P>
<P>
   His mobster finds just the right comic foil in Crystal as the
psychiatrist who utters the immortal, ``When I got into family
therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind.'' There's a lot more
where that came from in this breezy comedic treat (Janet Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME,'' starring Mike Myers,
Heather Graham and Elizabeth Hurley. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13,
95 minutes). There may come a time when even Austin Powers tires of
the words ``Oh, behave!,'' but it isn't here yet.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sequel is several love beads short of its
predecessor and more than a few scenes play like outtakes, this is
still a crafty, intermittently hilarious comedy. Myers' neo-Sellers
multiple-personality act is fab even when the material is less so,
and this sequel makes the most of Dr. Evil, his most inspired
creation.
</P>
<P>
   A scatological Scotsman, the film's walking id and bathroom
joke, is more of an acquired taste. Costumes and pop references are
still a hoot, as is the adorably benighted Austin. Ms. Graham makes
terrific eye candy, but doesn't share Ms. Hurley's quick-witted air
of being in on the joke (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``ELECTION,'' starring Matthew Broderick and Reese
Witherspoon. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the
acerbically funny director of ``Citizen Ruth'' comes this caustic
satire of the American electoral process in a high school setting.
</P>
<P>
   Its leading candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms.
Witherspoon, has a mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from
Connie Chung and Elizabeth Dole. Broderick plays the hapless
good-guy teacher who thinks this wicked little front-runner needs
to be stopped. And the hunky newcomer Chris Klein plays Tracy's
reluctant opponent in a style best described as early Keanu.
</P>
<P>
   With a lovely ear for hypocritical conversation, the screenplay
specializes in keeping all the characters a few beats off what they
actually mean (Maslin). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``ENTRAPMENT,'' starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
Directed by Jon Amiel (PG-13, 105 minutes). This glossy caper
summons the days when being a thief was the profession of choice
among debonair movie heroes. And heroines: as the great-looking
insurance investigator who is supposedly investigating Connery's
glamorous super-burglar, Ms. Zeta-Jones makes a smashing gymnast
and heist expert in her own right.
</P>
<P>
   No need to believe the outlandish details of the story; there's
enough verve and charisma to the stars to make the escapade easy on
the eyes. The action sequence, in which the stars hang off the side
of the world's largest skyscraper, is a vertiginous show stopper.
And here's a nice bonus: nobody gets killed (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``LIMBO,'' starring Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and David
Strathairn. Directed by John Sayles (R, 126 minutes). Part
survivalist drama, part satirical portrait of contemporary Alaska,
Sayles' powerful new film is almost as vast as the great outdoors
it contemplates.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mastrantonio, as a well-traveled folk-rock singer working
Alaskan lounges, and Strathairn, as the brooding local fisherman
with whom she becomes involved, make one of the most compelling
adult couples to be seen in an American film in quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   When they find themselves castaways along with her teen-age
daughter on a remote Alaskan island, the movie becomes both a
suspense thriller and a sorrowful meditation on survivalism,
civilization and the ties that bind. Though marred by an abrupt
ending and glaring literary devices, ``Limbo'' is eminently
worthwhile (Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MATRIX,'' starring Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne.
Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120 minutes). The
time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will be all but
incomprehensible to anyone but techno freaks. And the film borrows
unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a big debt
to ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   But the storytelling is intricately bizarre and the special
effects are indeed special, notably when it comes to midair martial
arts with a gravity-defying gusto. And Reeves shows that you can
look like a Prada model while behaving like an action hero.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main stars here is Bill Pope, an inventive
cinematographer. He and the Wachowskis provide a couch-potato
epiphany; while the characters seem to be performing marvelous
feats, they're often lying stock-still in the grip of virtual
reality (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,'' starring Rupert Everett, Calista
Flockhart, Kevin Kline and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Michael
Hoffman (PG-13, 115 minutes). This is potluck Shakespeare, with a
wildly uneven range of performances and no clear style holding them
together. Rather than wonder why the actors are wrestling with
bicycles in 19th-century Tuscany (a setting used much less
enchantingly than it might have been), it's best to focus on the
most comfortably Shakespearean performances and not wonder what Ms.
Flockhart is doing here.
</P>
<P>
   Kline makes a perfect Bottom, Everett slinks seductively through
Oberon's role and Ms. Pfeiffer makes an appropriately gorgeous
fairy queen. The younger cast members are largely used as window
dressing for the Leo-Does-Romeo set (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``NOTTING HILL,'' starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant.
Directed by Roger Michell (PG-13, 105 minutes). The most romantic
notion here may be that a Hollywood star as famous as Ms. Roberts
might be out, unassisted, browsing for a book. But it's enough to
bring her together with Grant's bashful bookseller and let two
extraordinarily charming actors play out an intelligent flirtation.
</P>
<P>
   As written by Richard Curtis with frequent wit and welcome
echoes of his ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' this is a bright,
winsome romantic comedy that's as teasing as the characters
themselves, inviting the audience to ponder the movie star's
burdens of being world famous and desperately attractive (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE RED VIOLIN,'' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Flemying,
Greta Scacchi and Don McKellar. Directed by Francois Girard (not
rated, 130 minutes). ``The Red Violin'' follows the colorful
300-plus-year journey of a priceless violin from its construction
in an Italian workshop in 1681 to a contemporary auction in
Montreal. As it makes its way from Vienna to England to Communist
China, the instrument becomes the inspiration for some richly
photographed historical tableaux.
</P>
<P>
   If the movie's narrative energy is undermined by a plodding
screenplay and wooden acting, the music, composed by John
Corigliano and played by Joshua Bell and the London Philharmonia
Orchestra, is sublime (Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``RETURN WITH HONOR,'' a documentary directed by Freida Lee Mock
and Terry Sanders (not rated, 102 minutes). This moving story, in
which American pilots captured by the North Vietnamese and held
prisoner for as long as eight and a half years recount their
experiences, rides the wave of patriotism signaled by the successes
of ``Saving Private Ryan'' and Tom Brokaw's ``Greatest
Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The film doesn't question the rightness or wrongness of the
Vietnam War or investigate the prisoners' wartime activities before
they were captured. But as they describe enduring years of torture
and deprivation, their spirits intact, they emerge as traditional
American heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed include Sen. John R. McCain and the former
vice presidential candidate James B. Stockdale (Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,'' starring Joseph Fiennes and
Gwyneth Paltrow. Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty,
sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever
premise that only gets better as the film unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and
turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue, dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today and has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo
and Juliet,'' glitches and all.
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she
gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her
career (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,'' starring
Liam Neeson. Directed by George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes).
Stripped of hype and breathless expectations, Lucas' first
installment offers a happy surprise: it's up to snuff. It sustains
the gee-whiz spirit of the series and offers a swashbuckling
extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions that are even more
plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of ``Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   While the human stars here are indeed reduced to playing action
figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and hordes of
crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in Lucas is
given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier and
scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``TEA WITH MUSSOLINI,'' starring Cher, Dame Judi Dench, Joan
Plowright, Dame Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin. Directed by Franco
Zeffirelli (PG, 117 minutes). The screen divas (especially Dame
Maggie) who give ``Tea With Mussolini'' a patina of class obviously
relish chewing the scenery in this sudsy historical drama (adapted
from a chapter of Zeffirelli's autobiography) about a circle of
English expatriate women living in Florence on the eve of World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Maggie, a quintessential British snob, is the leader of the
pack, nicknamed the Scorpioni, whose comfortable lives are
shattered when the Fascists rise to power and they find themselves
carted off to another city where they are held under house arrest.
Cher is her usual likable self as a free-spending, free-loving
wealthy American heiress and art collector who befriends the group
(Holden). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``THE WINSLOW BOY,'' starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca
Pidgeon and Jeremy Northam. Directed by David Mamet (G, 110
minutes). Terence Rattigan's play about the 1910 schoolboy's trial
that created a furor in England has been artfully pared down to its
essentials in this adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   Played with unusually effective restraint by a fine cast, it
works as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family
of a cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the
consequences of that accusation. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch
acting style sets the film's tone and gives her suffragist
character a sharp edge (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Film Series &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``BORDERLINE: PAUL ROBESON AND FILM.'' The film career of Paul
Robeson (1898-1976) is the subject of this series opening Friday at
the Museum of Modern Art. The series, which includes all 11 of
Robeson's fiction features, as well as trailers, concert films,
documentaries and newsreels, is a complement to the museum's
exhibition ``Paul Robeson: Artist and Citizen.'' This comprehensive
retrospective traces Robeson's career beginning with his debut in
1925 in ``Body and Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   In that film, directed by Oscar Michaeux and scheduled to be
shown at 1 p.m. Saturday, Robeson stars in a dual role as twin
brothers, one a demonic escaped convict posing as a minister, the
other an unassuming aspiring inventor. The series, which also
includes ``The Emperor Jones'' (1933), ``King Solomon's Mines''
(1937) and ``Tales of Manhattan'' (1942), opens at 6:30 Friday
night with ``Show Boat'' (1936), in which Robeson sings ``Ol' Man
River,'' which became his signature.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing through July 5 at the museum in Manhattan, the series
is free with museum admission: $9.50 for adults, $6.50 for students
and people 65 or older; free for visitors under 16 accompanied by
an adult. Pay what you wish on Fridays from 4:30 to 8:15 p.m.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Take it as coincidence or take it as synchronicity or
take it as one more affirmation of the ways musicians tune in ideas
across boundaries and decades. The JVC Jazz Festival, which starts
its major concerts Friday night and runs through June 27, has two
threads that connect its most promising events, two pervasive
influences that should intersect at many different angles for 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   One is the ever expanding recognition of Brazilian music, past
and present, as more American listeners break the language barrier
and more Brazilian musicians travel internationally. The second is
the lasting influence of Miles Davis, who spawned entire schools of
jazz with each phase of his music from the 1940s well into the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem improbable that Brazilian music and the Davis
legacy would have any bearing on each other. But they keep
intertwining. What Davis shared with Brazilian taste _ a deep
respect for melody, a connoisseurship of rhythm and an appreciation
for subtleties of harmony, texture and mood _ has drawn jazz
musicians to the Brazilian repertory and Brazilian songwriters to
jazz. Both, of course, are creating Afro-Euro-American music,
mongrel styles constantly adapting to the new world. They draw from
everything they meet, including each other.
</P>
<P>
   Among both American and Brazilian performers this year, another
name besides Miles Davis keeps popping up as a model: Joao
Gilberto, the bossa nova singer and guitarist who is a grandmaster
of understatement. The Davis who created the serene, haunted
austerity of ``Kind of Blue'' (which is to be performed by a
tribute group on Tuesday) and the Gilberto who whisper-sang Antonio
Carlos Jobim's sketches of yearning and loss both have qualities
that have all but disappeared from public discourse: discretion and
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better than this there's only silence,'' Caetano Veloso sings
on ``Livro,'' his new album. ``And better than silence only Joao.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the likely pinnacles of the festival are concerts at the
Beacon Theater by songwriters from the Brazilian state of Bahia:
Veloso (on June 27), who has been making groundbreaking music since
the 1960s, and the New York debut of Carlinhos Brown (on Thursday),
a percussionist, songwriter, band leader and producer who has
galvanized Brazilian music in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian culture prides itself on a metaphoric cannibalism,
swallowing and digesting ideas from abroad, and Veloso has been one
of Brazil's most adept syncretists. Along with Gilberto Gil and
other songwriters and singers, he was a leader of the musical
movement called tropicalia, which conceived of Brazil as a
hot-wired nexus of musical information. ``What we did in the late
1960s was a very complicated _ not so sophisticated but complicated
_ comment on the history of the music of Brazil,'' Veloso said by
telephone from Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   The tropicalists tossed together Afro-Brazilian rhythms and rock
guitars, modernist poetry and advertising jingles, bossa novas and
psychedelia; deliberately and gleefully they warped history and
geography. Veloso has sustained and refined his inspiration through
the following decades with a gift for melody, an ear for unexpected
combinations and a preternatural grace in his gentle voice.
</P>
<P>
   His concert on June 27 revolves around one more pan-American
blend. Veloso will be featuring songs from ``Livro,'' which unites
two strands of his broad musical erudition: the Afro-Brazilian
percussion of Bahia and the airy, allusive arrangements that Gil
Evans did for Davis in the late 1940s and 1950s on albums like
``Birth of the Cool,'' ``Sketches of Spain'' and ``Porgy and
Bess.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Veloso's songs range through history and ideas:
there's a song about Alexander the Great, a lighthearted bit of
12-tone music, and ``Manhata,'' a limpid ballad that imagines
Manhattan as an Indian girl and a legendary goddess, ``that
beautiful girl biting the apple.''
</P>
<P>
   The title song of ``Livro'' is about the satisfying physical
presence of books: ``Books are transcendental things,'' Veloso
sings, ``but we can love them with our hands.'' He finished the
album after writing his autobiography, ``Verdade Tropical''
(``Tropical Truth''); Alfred A. Knopf is to publish a translation
next year. The music sets out to bridge his past and his present.
``The cool jazz thing is from the very beginning of my deepest
connection with music,'' Veloso said. He rediscovered it on tour in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were listening on the bus to the old albums by Miles Davis
with Gil Evans, and I was thinking of how much I used to love those
records, and how much I still love them. I think it's Miles' best
period. This new street percussion, from Bahia, from Salvador, is
something that I am living just now. As I composed the songs for
``Livro'' I was thinking of this mixture. I like the tension.''
</P>
<P>
   One song on the album, ``Navio Negreiro'' (``Slave Ship''),
reunites Veloso with Carlinhos Brown, who spent five years as the
percussionist in his band. ``I was amazed by his personal rhythm,
by his mind and by the way he played,'' Veloso said. ``He is a
leader, he has a sense of history, he knows everything about Bahian
carnival and he knows how to make comments on the past and to
create things for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's new album is called ``Omelete Man.'' It is a
declaration, he says, that he is a ``man of mixtures,'' like the
culture he comes from. ``In Brazil, we are already mature in the
mixture of races,'' he said through a translator. ``We learned
through our pain and our happy moments that it is the great way to
peace. Being mixed makes you like the other person a lot more,
because then you start believing that the other person really is
your brother because he has your blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's album includes funk paced by Bahian percussion, sultry
ballads, reggae, revved-up carnival music, old-fashioned samba,
Portuguese fado, a brass band waltz, even a tune steeped in the
Beatles; the lyrics toss in some English with the Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to speak a language that Babel didn't have,'' he
said through a translator. ``In my original culture, the dialect is
already gone. We have Yoruba origins, and we were a nation in
Africa, and here we got mixed. They destroyed the way we used to
speak, but they didn't destroy our discourse because we kept a lot
of things in our collective unconscious. Now I'm looking for newer
forms of communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, Brown deploys guitars, horns and plenty of percussion;
taking turns on various instruments and leading the group in fierce
funk workouts, he can seem like a Brazilian answer to Prince. Like
Prince or George Clinton, he keeps generating spinoff groups. He
discovered and encouraged Lactomia, a group of teen-age
percussionists who play instruments made from buckets, cans and
bottle caps. He introduced Timbalada, a percussion-driven Bahian
pop band that performs in tribal-style face paint. Ogans, a New
York-based band of Bahian drummers that appears most Saturdays at
SOB's, largely models itself on Timbalada.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is also rebuilding Candeal, the poor neighborhood in
Salvador where he lives; along with his own studio and outdoor
performance area, he is sponsoring the construction of housing, a
health center and a music school. ``Through music we can form great
citizens,'' he said. ``Music always comes out of the community, not
one person.''
</P>
<P>
   (more)
</P>
<P>
   Another major Brazilian songwriter is to perform through Sunday
at the Blue Note: Ivan Lins, a master of melody and labyrinthine
harmonies whose songs have been championed by American singers from
Sarah Vaughan to Manhattan Transfer (which is also headlining a
festival concert, on Tuesday at Avery Fisher Hall).
</P>
<P>
   He, too, has a heritage of mixtures. The Lins family moved to
Boston in 1947, when he was 2, and stayed for three years before
returning to Brazil. ``The first songs I remember were Stephen
Foster songs and Walt Disney songs,'' Lins said. Back in Brazil, he
was drawn to big-band music and then, when bossa nova arrived, to
jazz, which got him started playing piano. The guitars of the rock
era were too out of tune for him; he preferred bands like Blood,
Sweat and Tears or Chicago, which harked back to big bands. But he
also learned from songwriters like Milton Nascimento and the
tropicalia songwriters, and lately he, too, has been rediscovering
the bossa nova. ``Jobim influenced me dramatically, and it's coming
out much more now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks that harmony is the most important thing in
my music,'' Lins complained good-naturedly. ``But it's not; it's
the melody. When I start to write a song it's to tell a story
melodically. I try to be as simple as I can because that's what
moves me more, when the melody flows easily. But behind this melody
I need to put something like a soundtrack, and that's what the
harmony starts to do. It's like scoring films, to create some
atmosphere.'' Diana Krall's Bossa Nova
</P>
<P>
   Bossa nova, which gave American jazz one of its commercial peaks
in the 1960s, is easing into the music again. Diana Krall, the
pianist and singer who is to make her Carnegie Hall debut on
Wednesday, has been topping jazz charts by singing standards in her
breathy, gently tousled voice. Before making her new album, ``When
I Look in Your Eyes,'' she began listening seriously to Gilberto.
Her producer, Tommy LiPuma, had also produced Gilberto's 1977
album, ``Amoroso,'' which let a hushed orchestra waft chords above
his syncopated guitar. Hearing it led to her making bossa nova
versions of ``Let's Face the Music and Dance'' and ``I've Got You
Under My Skin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the album for quite a while, but I didn't really get
into it until three or four years ago,'' Ms. Krall said. ``There's
a time when you find something and it moves you, and you're glad it
did. I'm not an authority on Brazilian music, but all I really
needed was Joao, and Frank Sinatra singing with Antonio Carlos
Jobim. I might not understand the language, but I understand the
feel. There's a goose bump factor, just like there is when I listen
to opera, like Jussi Bjoerling singing `The Pearl Fishers' with all
that passion. Voices like Joao and Willie Nelson _ with that kind
of quiet _ are a tremendous influence. One day at sound check we
were doing `I've Got You Under My Skin.' I said, `Let's take the
tempo down,' and I realized that by changing a tempo and mood, you
can change the story a little bit without changing the lyrics. It's
fun to take things into a different context.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is to receive one tribute on Tuesday at Symphony Space
with `` `Kind of Blue' at 40,'' when a generation-crossing sextet
plays all the compositions from the 1959 album that established the
idea of modal jazz. The group includes Jimmy Cobb on drums, the
only surviving musician from the original album, and the tenor
saxophonist Ravi Coltrane, whose father, John Coltrane, was in
Davis' group for the album. Wallace Roney on trumpet, Vincent
Herring on alto saxophone, Geri Allen on piano and Buster Williams
on bass complete the sextet.
</P>
<P>
   To make ``Kind of Blue,'' Davis purposefully surprised the
group. ``We didn't have no kind of rehearsal,'' Cobb said. ``He was
like that. He liked to change things up.'' Davis handed the
musicians sketches that called not for songs with defined chord
changes, but for tunes that led to improvisations on modal scales,
which are more open-ended. ``He said, `A lot is up to you,''' Cobb
said.
</P>
<P>
   The music's radical simplicity was a liberation and a challenge,
and ``Kind of Blue'' emerged with a tentative, searching tone
that's also immensely romantic. The album became a durable hit.
``Lots of jazz guys try to make crossover records,'' Cobb said.
``This one just happened by itself. It was just a date that came up
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Davis Tribute
</P>
<P>
   Another Davis tribute takes place Saturday night at Carnegie
Hall, when Cassandra Wilson sings material from her album
``Traveling Miles'' _ selections that span Davis' repertory from
standards to funk, some with Ms. Wilson's own lyrics _ on a bill
with one of the very few singers Davis ever endorsed, Shirley Horn.
While Ms. Horn plays piano in her own poised jazz trio, Ms. Wilson
leads a mutable group including slide guitar and vibraphone. Both
women learned from Davis how to bring a pensive and profound
delicacy to their songs, letting implications linger in their
unhurried phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' reverberations at the festival don't stop there. John
McLaughlin, whose electric guitar work on ``Bitches Brew'' helped
Davis cut through to a rock audience, is performing on June 27 at
Symphony Space, playing acoustic guitar with Indian musicians. Dave
Holland, the bassist when Davis' groups made the transition from
acoustic to electric instruments, has long since returned to
acoustic jazz; he is to lead his quintet on Wednesday at Symphony
Space, sharing a bill with the pianist Brad Mehldau.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the JVC Jazz Festival is another tribute. The trumpeter
and composer Mark Isham, a longtime Davis emulator whose day job is
writing film soundtracks, made his homage official with his most
recent album, ``The Silent Way Project,'' which delves into Davis'
spooky late-1960s funk; he will be performing compositions from
that era on Wednesday and Thursday at the Knitting Factory.
</P>
<P>
   In a major jazz festival concert tonight, two members of Davis'
great mid-1960s quintet, the pianist Herbie Hancock and the
saxophonist Wayne Shorter, are performing as a duo tonight at
Carnegie Hall. Shorter, particularly in his years with Weather
Report and on his solo albums, has long recognized a kinship
between his own sinuous, harmonically ingenious compositions and
Brazilian music. Hancock was part of the studio group for Shorter's
1974 album, ``Native Dancer,'' which introduced many American
listeners to the music of Nascimento, one of Brazil's most
celebrated songwriters. Melody and nuance have a way of getting
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot nationalize music,'' Lins said. ``I understand
music to be like science. A scientist in one place makes a
discovery and finds a cure for a virus, and then later another
scientist uses his discovery to heal something else. Great
musicians give their contributions for the planet, not for one
country.''

   AIRLINES _ The airline industry and Senator John McCain,
chairman of a key Senate transportation committee, unveiled
voluntary reforms that would provide more consumer protections for
air passengers. The Air Transport Association, which represents the
largest U.S. airlines, said the plan would give passengers at least
24 hours to decide whether to buy a ticket after it's reserved and
guarantee that mishandled bags are returned within a day. It also
would give passengers the most recent details available on delays,
and provides for some amenities for stranded travelers. Looking for
local reax from passengers at Hartsfield, Delta and consumer
activists. (Joyner/Shelton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   Early clouds and a few sprinkles near the Northeast coast will
yield to increasing sunshine as a front moves slowly east off the
Atlantic Seaboard. Most of the day across the Northeast will have a
mixture of sunshine and puffy clouds with temperatures several
degrees below the seasonal average. Scattered afternoon showers
will form over the mountains of northern New England. High pressure
will crest over the region Friday night. As a result, clear skies
and calm winds will allow for rapid cooling tonight, especially in
rural areas of the interior Northeast where isolated frost is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will linger near the Southeast coast as breezes northeast
in the wake of a cold front continue to import moist air. Clouds
and bands of thundershowers will occur near the front from central
and southern Florida to the waters east of the Carolinas. Much of
the interior Southeast will be dry and cool for the season,
however, a few showers will form near the southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   A band of clouds and broken areas of thundershowers marking the
transition zone between the cool air in the East and much warmer
west in the interior west. will cover much of the central and
eastern Plains. Breezes from the south will draw increasingly humid
air north setting the stage for some locally heavy thundershowers
in parts of the central Plains late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the West will be very warm with ample sunshine. Isolated
afternoon thunderstorms will form over some mountain peaks.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Northwest will be cooler with clouds and a
few sprinkles near the coast.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Focus: Black Blizzards &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, visibilities near Tuscon fell to near zero in
blowing dust, a sign that the season of black blizzards is arriving
in the deserts of the Southwest. Strong solar heating leads to
invisible updrafts, precursors of desert storms. Each year during
the early summer, the air around 15,000 feet moistens providing
fuel for thunderstorms, while air near the surface remains rather
dry. Often, rain falling from the thunderstorms evaporates in the
dry air near the ground. Then, blasts of wind cooled by evaporation
raise palls of dust the so-called ``black blizzards'' that roam the
desert floor.

   SOC-MIAHAMM _ She's been called one of the most beautiful people
in the world, but it wasn't her idea. Appearing in a Gatorade
commercial with Michael Jordan is a good way to promote her sport,
as far as she's concerned. And the way she sees it, all the media
hysteria over a recent goal drought took away from the rest of the
team. Nike just named its biggest building after her, but she was
red-faced about the whole thing. The attention devoted to U.S.
soccer star Mia Hamm has spawned out of her phenomenal career for
the defending Olympic champions, who are setting their sights on
the Women's World Cup that begins Saturday. But the 27-year-old
forward's attractiveness has evolved into a ``Mia Mania'' that
causes teenage girls to shriek and men to wonder just who the lucky
guy is who's married to her. Hamm's passion shows most on the
field, where she recently became the all-time international
goal-scoring leader, but the extremely shy wife of a U.S. Marine
pilot is finding how difficult it is becoming to seek private
refuge away from it. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 16.

24 hours to decide whether to buy a ticket after it's reserved and
guarantee that mishandled bags are returned within a day. It also
would give passengers the most recent details available on delays,
and provides for some amenities for stranded travelers. Looking for

success. (Winkeljohn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 13.

CARS KEEP GETTING FASTER IN NASCAR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NASCAR is about speed, and no one demonstrated that better than
Dale Jarrett did Sunday when he whipped his Ford around Michigan
Speedway at a track record 173.997 mph to win the Kmart 400.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Jarrett's speed a Michigan record, it was the
fastest stock car race ever run at any track outside of Daytona,
Fla., or Talladega, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   And since 1988 when restrictor plates became mandatory at those
two tracks, it was faster than any race run anywhere except
Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   There have been four restrictor plate races at Talladega faster
than Jarrett's run Sunday, Mark Martin setting the record when he
won Talladega's Winston 500 May 10, 1997, with a speed of 188.354
mph, in a race that had no caution flags.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Jarrett ran in a caution-free event Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Daytona and Talladega have been NASCAR's fastest
tracks because they are the biggest at 2.5 and 2.66 miles,
respectively, and also the most steeply banked in the turns except
for the Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But Bristol, a half-mile oval, doesn't have nearly as much
straightaway speed as the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictor plates, which reduce horsepower by limiting the
air-fuel mixture reaching the engine, became mandatory at Daytona
and Talladega after the cars began turning laps at well over 200
mph.
</P>
<P>
   And with speeds on the rise again, they have been mentioned as a
possible way to slow the cars down at tracks such as Michigan,
Charlotte and Atlanta. Michigan is two miles in length, Atlanta and
Charlotte are 1.5 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   While Jarrett's run Sunday was an eye opener, the number of
caution flags and the length of the cautions can obscure how fast
cars are going in any given race.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying gives a better indication because it involves a
single car, set up purely to run fast, on the track by itself. Bill
Elliott holds the fastest qualifying time ever, a 212.809 mph lap
prior to Talladega's Winston 500 in May 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Already this season, drivers have shattered qualifying records
at seven of the 13 tracks they have run. There was no qualifying at
California because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy's Paul Andrews, who began the year as Jeremy Mayfield's
crew chief and now holds the same job for Steve Park, thinks NASCAR
rule changes have helped increase speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR gave us more spoiler and valence for the last race last
year at Atlanta and allowed us to keep those rules this year,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the valence _ an air dam that runs under the front of
the car and prevents air from getting under it, causing lift _ and
spoiler _ a metal strip across the back of the car that forces air
down on the rear deck _ creates more downforce, which means faster
corner speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that simple,'' Andrews said. ``We aren't going any faster
in the straightaways. Our increases are all in the corners.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Rusty Wallace agrees, and adds that ``we're creating more
horsepower than ever and the Goodyear guys are building as durable
and fast a race tire as has ever been built.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace also says that ``we're using setups in qualifying that
were unheard of a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Various spring-shock setups affect qualifying speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Another major factor is aerodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Either by themselves or by banding together in research and
development groups, the top teams are constantly reshaping pieces
on the car to get the slickest body possible.
</P>
<P>
   And some tracks, such as Michigan, allow for faster racing
because of their design or because they have recently been repaved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driver can do a lot to adjust the race car on the track,''
Pontiac's Ward Burton, who finished fourth Sunday, said of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   If a driver is running tight _ where the car doesn't want to
turn _ they can adjust and run lower, Burton said. Or, if the car
is loose _ where the back of the car wants to come around _ the
driver can run higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those places where the driver can adjust the car
just by trying a different line,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Jarrett found the fastest lines. But the cars have been
fast everywhere, and there's no sign they're going to slow down.

GORE AIDE SAYS GOP ATTACKS ON MRS. CLINTON HELP DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK, N.Y. _ Republican attacks on First Lady Hillary
Clinton will galvanize women voters to support her likely bid for
the U.S. Senate as well as Vice President Al Gore's presidential
hopes in the Empire State, Gore's campaign manager said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encourage the Republicans to attack her,'' said Tony Coehlo,
who is directing Gore's White House bid in the 2000 election. ``I
encourage it because not only will women in New York be upset, but
women all over the country will be upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Coehlo spoke to reporters during the second day of a campaign
swing that began Wednesday in Carthage, Tenn., where Gore
officially kicked off his presidential campaign before making brief
visits to Iowa, New Hampshire and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gore himself had little to say about the prospect of a Clinton
Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already addressed that issue,'' Gore told reporters.
``I'm all for it. It will generate enthusiasm (in New York) and
around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   It was left to Coehlo to try to make Republican attacks on
Clinton into a plus for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Led by New York City's feisty mayor, Rudolph Giuliani,
Republicans have criticized Clinton for seeking a Senate seat from
a state where she has never lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Republicans going after Hillary,'' Coehlo said.
``The Republicans want to beat up on Hillary, that's fine. She's
going to activate the Democratic base. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho dismissed speculation that the Gore campaign dreads a
Clinton Senate candidacy because it would keep the first lady away
from helping the Gore campaign, soak up Democratic campaign
contributions and attract more media attention than Gore's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is far along on its fundraising and won't
compete with Clinton's financing efforts, Coelho said. Clinton's
possible assistance to Gore is ``not an issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Gore campaign cannot survive without Hillary Clinton,
then it is doomed to fail anyway, Coelho said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a job to educate the American public on who Al Gore
is,'' he said. ``And Hillary is not a factor in that. If we can't
relate to the American people, we're not gonna last.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican attacks on Clinton will help not only Clinton and
Gore, but women Democratic Senate candidates in 2000 as well, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans reacted with disdain to Coehlo's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Mercurio, a New York political consultant who is a
spokesman for the New York County Republican Committee, teed off on
her lack of a New York background.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is only an issue because it's an issue with
voters,'' he said, citing polls showing that nearly half of New
York's voters are concerned about Clinton's lack of a New York
background. Clinton was born and raised in a Chicago suburb and
lived in Arkansas with then-Gov. Bill Clinton before he became
president in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's down a million votes because she's a carpetbagger,
there's not that many votes she's going to get from a heavy turnout
of women,'' he said.

   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Jet's is a rags-to-riches story.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in his two-year life, the black-and-white border
collie was a homeless stray. But now he's getting national
attention for his work here at Southwest Florida International
Airport. He even has his own business card and e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   Jet is believed to be the first dog in the nation to be employed
in a bird- hazard reduction program at a commercial airport. He was
specifically trained for that purpose after being brought as a
homeless pooch to Border Collie Rescue, a nonprofit dog-training
outfit in Melrose.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Jet seems to be getting the job done. Airport
operations agents say there has been a big drop in the number of
birds in the ponds and marshes that dot the airport landscape since
Jet began working in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're putting yourself out of business,'' operations agent
Gil Forgays told Jet on a recent morning, as the dog finished
chasing a handful of birds away from a small marsh.
</P>
<P>
   The airport is conducting a formal study to see just how
effective Jet has been, but here's one telling statistic: Last
year, the airport reported 13 instances of bird strikes interfering
with aircraft. So far this year, there have been none.
</P>
<P>
   Airport managers heard about Border Collie Rescue's program at a
conference for BirdStrike, an organization dedicated to finding
ways to prevent bird-related accidents at airports. According to
figures provided by the airport, birds collide with planes about
2,500 times a year nationally; such collisions have caused $48
million in damage since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is third in the nation in bird strikes reported, thanks
mainly to the stormwater retention ponds that many airports have to
maintain for pollution control. Birds love to stay in those ponds,
and often get in the way of aircraft taking off and landing.
</P>
<P>
   Jet is not one of the traditional approaches to bird control,
which include pyrotechnics _ fireworks blasted from a shotgun _ and
sirens. Forgays admitted he wasn't convinced when his bosses
mentioned the possibility of a dog performing that function.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of skeptical at first,'' he said. ``But then I saw
Dr. Nick Carter perform a demonstration with the dogs, and that
changed my mind as to what I thought was feasible.'' Carter is
director of Border Collie Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Laska Ryan, the airport's public relations manager, said
authorities at several airports and military bases have called or
come to watch Jet make his rounds. Officials at Border Collie
Rescue said they soon will supply a dog to Dover Air Force Base in
Dover, Del.
</P>
<P>
   It cost about $6,600 to buy and train Jet, and there's also the
cost of feeding him and housing him in a kennel with the airport's
drug-sniffing dogs. Forgays said that reducing bird strikes is
worth far more than Jet's cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can prevent just one of those incidents, it's worth
much more than $6,600,'' Forgays said.
</P>
<P>
   Border collies are intelligent and have an inherent tendency to
herd, making them perfect for this type of work, Forgays said. Jet
not only scares the birds away, but he also can push them in a
specific direction away from the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Jet is more effective than the traditional noise-making methods,
Forgays said, because birds can become desensitized to the
fireworks or sirens. The birds perceive Jet as a stealth predator
and rarely return after an encounter with him.
</P>
<P>
   Jet has had one small break in his stint as chief bird watcher.
Shortly after arriving in Fort Myers, he was sent back to Border
Collie Rescue for alligator training to make sure his instincts
didn't lead him to try to herd the reptiles.

MICHAEL WALTRIP: CLOSE, BUT STILL A 408-RACE LOSING STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a record Michael Waltrip has learned to live with, a
constant in his life he cannot get away from.
</P>
<P>
   During his Winston Cup career, which began in 1985, Waltrip, 36,
has run 408 races.
</P>
<P>
   He has never won.
</P>
<P>
   That is unmatched except by ageless Dave Marcis. Marcis, 58, has
gone 445 races without victory, but he has won, the last time at
Richmond in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Waltrip has come to winning was in 1996, when he
took NASCAR's all-star race, The Winston.
</P>
<P>
   But The Winston is not an official race and run under a
different format than a regular event. So it does not count.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '90s, I almost won a couple of races,'' said
Waltrip, whose brother, Darrell, is one of NASCAR's all-time win
leaders with 84.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat on a couple of poles. I just really felt that everything
was right there for me, like I was just an inch away from cashing
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got away from me,'' Waltrip said. ``It didn't happen. We
went from close to getting kind of away from it, and now I feel
like I'm close again, and that's an exciting feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Waltrip, the losing streak isn't all his fault.
For the most part, he's never been in a car capable of winning.
</P>
<P>
   His current car owner, Jim Mattei, has never won. Waltrip drove
eight years for Chuck Rider, who has never won, either. Neither did
his first car owner, Dick Bahre.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Wood brothers, for whom Waltrip drove from 1996 to 98,
had fielded a winning entry in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the confidence I need to win. It's just putting all the
pieces of the puzzle together,'' Waltrip said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who you are or how good you can drive or how
good you can set up a car if you and the team don't work closely
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really what I'm focusing on this year, trying to have a
relationship with my crew chief and my car owner and my team so we
all think alike and we do the same things to the race car and we
know what we want out of it. That's the key to getting to victory
lane,'' Waltrip commented.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip knows he needs to win. When teams don't win, they change
drivers, and the longer you go without winning, the harder it is to
get a ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started this year before the Daytona 500 thinking this could
be my last season,'' Waltrip said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a great ride, a great team, a great sponsor. If I
don't win races and run well, I might not be able to get a ride
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's reality. That's what I'm faced with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth listening to everybody remind me that I've never
won a race just so I can get to do what I want to do,'' Waltrip
said.

A CHANGE OF HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Do constituents really expect members of Congress
to keep their word or are people so jaded from years of partisan
hyperbole that they are cynically resigned to hypocrisy in public
office?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, voters are inconsistent. Which way they go depends on
the significance of the promise being broken and the importance of
the whatever group is most intensely offended. It also matters how
much, deep down, they really like the politician in spite of
everything.
</P>
<P>
   By those criteria, Republican Rep. George Nethercutt of
Washington state certainly is, in President George Bush's famous
expression in another context, down in deep doo-doo. He's got a lot
of explaining to do.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt was hailed as a hero in 1994 for defeating House
Speaker Thomas Foley, a congressional veteran of more than three
decades, largely by championing term limits. Nethercutt scoffed at
Foley's long experience, promised to serve only three terms and
announced that ``if I can't effect some change in six years, maybe
I'm in the wrong place.''
</P>
<P>
   By painting Foley as an out-of-touch career politician and
himself as a fresh outsider, Nethercutt won by a slim margin of
fewer than 4,000 votes out of more than 215,000 cast.
</P>
<P>
   Now that his ardent support for term limits collides with his
own political survival, however, Nethercutt sees it differently. He
has discovered the advantages of seniority. An outsider no more, he
says lamely, ``I made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The bitter laughter from the U.S. embassy in Tokyo, where Foley
is now our ambassador, can be heard all the way to Washington. What
goes around comes around.
</P>
<P>
   It's standard political practice these days for candidates _
from Vice President Al Gore to every Republican ever invented _ to
blame a perceived decline in American ethics, truth-telling and
moral values on President Clinton's bad example. But Nethercutt
couldn't get away with that if he tried.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman not only gave his word that he would serve only
six years but made a big deal out of it. And for selfish reasons
he's now trying to weasel out of his promise. It's his character on
the line, nobody else's.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Nethercutt's campaign got $300,000 from U.S. Term
Limits, the leading advocacy group for that cause. The support was,
needless to say, very helpful. Foley had angered the organization
by challenging the term limits idea, which he correctly viewed as
stupid, unnecessary and potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Now U.S. Term Limits is angry at Nethercutt, whose defection
reinforces the fact that term limits was never a legitimate
philosophical issue but merely a political tool for candidates to
use against incumbents they were trying to replace.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Term Limits threatens to spend $1 million to defeat
Nethercutt. It has already spent $100,000 in his district on ads,
which Nethercutt has ignored, warning, ``Keep Your Word, George.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman now dismisses the group as ``an outside''
organization with no business meddling in his district. For some
mysterious reason, he didn't care about its non-local nature when
he took its campaign money to defeat Foley. His change of heart is
no doubt due to some uplifting epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of the term limits movement are not kidding even
though Ross Perot has fallen silent on the cause and so have most
presidential candidates. The call for term limits is still in the
GOP platform.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's election may be the turning point that determines
whether the concept dies a deserved, overdue death or remains alive
to bedevil future incumbents. If Nethercutt can get away with
trashing it, others can too. The pledge becomes meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of Congress in addition to Nethercutt are seeking
re-election next year although their time is up under their term
limit pledges. They are Reps. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., and Scott
McInnis, R-Colo. They think their constituents don't care. We'll
see.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., leans toward running but has not yet
announced. Six others, all Republicans, facing similar deadlines
are sticking to their promise.
</P>
<P>
   The term-limits concept has been gradually falling from favor
since the Republicans took over Congress in 1994 and realized the
restrictions might apply to them rather than the Democrats who used
to have control. After the House twice failed to mandate term
limits with a constitutional amendment, the movement's backers have
concentrated on pushing state laws instead.
</P>
<P>
   We are only now seeing the early impact on states that fell for
this foolishness. In Michigan, for instance, a term-limits law
forced out 64 state legislators last year, prompting fears that too
much crucial institutional memory and power have passed from
elected officials to lobbyists, staff members and bureaucrats. U.S.
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., himself a Washington veteran of more
than four decades, complains that the state has sentenced itself to
be ``run by pygmies.''
</P>
<P>
   Silly as the term-limits concept is, the fact remains that
Nethercutt professed to believe in it so long as it applied to
others. He was an opportunist, seizing on an issue to gain power
for himself. Does that make him no different from any other
ambitious politician or an unreliable fast-talker not worthy of
re-election? Washington state voters have to decide.

`TARZAN' A DEPARTURE FROM DISNEY'S RECENT FORMULAIC ANIMATED
MUSICALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most critics believe the cycle of Disney animated musicals that
began with ``The Little Mermaid'' in 1989 peaked with ``The Lion
King'' in 1994. The follow-ups _ ``Pocahontas,'' ``Hercules'' and
``Hunchback of Notre Dame'' _ have been profitable but
progressively formulaic and underwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the company _ inspired by the competition from DreamWorks,
Fox and other studio animation wings _ may be edging toward a
comeback. Last summer's ``Mulan'' (minus its offensive and
intrusive Eddie Murphy sequences) was both a moving fable and a
stunning cartoon evocation of ancient China.
</P>
<P>
   And this summer's ``Tarzan'' is even more impressive. It not
only breaks the formula even further, it's a buoyant, often
thrilling piece of animation that more or less does for the Central
African rainforest what ``The Lion King'' did for the East African
savannah.
</P>
<P>
   It's basically the same old Tarzan-the-ape-man story that's been
endlessly recycled in every movie generation since Edgar Rice
Burroughs first wrote it _ though the animators have tried to take
the myth back to its roots with some of the purity of Hugh Hudson's
1984 ``Greystoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, an English family is shipwrecked on the African coast and
the parents are killed by pirates. Their infant son _ later dubbed
Tarzan _ is raised by a group of friendly mountain gorillas and
grows to hunky manhood while walking around on all fours.
</P>
<P>
   One day, an expedition stumbles into this impenetrable corner of
the jungle _ a scientist (Nigel Hawthorne), his daughter, Jane
(Minnie Driver), and a cad of a white hunter (Brian Blessed) _ so
Tarzan (Tony Goldwyn) is suddenly confronted with the culture shock
of his own kind.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie has Tarzan emotionally split between, on
the one hand, his growing sense of human identity and his love for
Jane; and, on the other, his loyalty to his adoptive ape family _
his ``mother,'' Kala (Glenn Close), the stern ape leader Kerchak
(Lance Henriksen) and his boyhood pal Terk (Rosie O'Donnell).
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Mulan'' and all the other recent Disney animated
features, the drawback of the film is its clumsy and unnecessary
comedy-relief secondary characters, who seem thrown in as an excuse
to sell toy figurines _ most prominently, the Rosie O'Donnell-ape
and a bumbling elephant (Wayne Knight, of TV's ``Seinfeld'').
</P>
<P>
   Still, this animated ``Tarzan'' mostly underplays the comic
schtick, and the script does a surprisingly good job of building
its hero's growing internal conflict _ thereby giving the film a
reasonably serious dimension and a theme to which anyone can
relate: the need to find the society in which we truly belong.
</P>
<P>
   The music is by Phil Collins, and his succession of distinctive
pop songs also represents a welcome change of pace from the Andrew
Lloyd Webber-ish style of Alan Menken (and his various lyricists)
that have dominated the scores of the animated musical genre since
the beginning of the cycle in the late '80s.
</P>
<P>
   And the movie definitely delivers in the animation department.
The long opening, which tells the whole story of Tarzan's
upbringing, may be the most rhapsodic and breathtaking animated
sequence the studio has ever created. Elsewhere, the design
imaginatively evokes the magical, idealized Africa of the Burroughs
novels.
</P>

Murphy, Bob Tzudiker and Noni White. Animated. Voices: Tony

`RED VIOLIN' NEVER REALLY BUILDS UP TO EMOTIONAL MOMENTUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 25th Seattle International Film Festival is history, but its
spirit will linger over the next year as many of its 200 debuts
return for a regular run. This weekend, two of the higher profile
entries are already back _ both, coincidentally, with a music
theme.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian drama, ``The Red Violin'' was the runner-up in the
best-film competition (it lost to ``Run Lola Run'') and its
director, Francois Girard, placed fifth in the best-director
competition.
</P>
<P>
   It borrows the basic story premise of the 1964 film, ``The
Yellow Rolls Royce,'' only instead of a luxurious yellow
automobile, an acoustically perfect red violin is the device used
to link the stories of the various owners through the years.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with the tale of the 17th-century Italian
craftsman who made the violin as a tribute to his lovely young
wife, then follows the instrument as it passes into the hands of
Austrian monks, a child prodigy, a band of Gypsies, a
self-indulgent British virtuoso, several owners in China over
nearly a century and a Montreal auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its heady SIFF reception and notwithstanding the eight
Genies (Canadian Oscars) it won (including best picture and best
director), the individual stories vary widely in quality and
dramatic interest, and the film never really builds the kind of
emotional momentum that might make its device seem more than a
storytelling gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   But the symphonic score (by John Corigliano) offers a
bittersweet counterpoint to the stories, the performances of Samuel
L. Jackson, Sylvia Chang, Christoph Koncz and Jean-Luc Bideau are
standouts; the Chinese segment (set mostly in Shanghai during the
Cultural Revolution) is strong enough to stand on its own; and the
script builds to a powerful, surprising ending.
</P>
<P>
   The other musical SIFF offering back this weekend for a regular
theatrical engagement is ``Buena Vista Social Club,'' a Cuban-music
concert film directed by Germany's Wim Wenders, which won the
Golden Space Needle Award for best documentary.
</P>
<P>
   It's an account of guitarist Ry Cooder's follow-up journey to
Havana after his Grammy-winning album, ``Buena Vista Social Club,''
revived the careers of a horde of aged Cuban musicians whose
careers had declined or even collapsed after the Castro Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows Cooder as he records a new solo album with
legendary singer Ibrahim Ferrer, intercut with talking-head
interviews with the various ``Buena Vista Social Club'' band
members (some in their 90s), plus footage from a concert in
Amsterdam and the band's 1998 (farewell) performance in Carnegie
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The music is ebullient and addictive, the musicians are
delightfully hammy and the movie is mostly great fun, though it
could definitely use some background narrative on Cuban music and
how it lost its way. And the film's numerous white subtitles
against white backgrounds are often impossible to read.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Violin. Directed by Francois Girard. Written by Don
McKellar and Girard. Cast: Samuel L. Jackson, Greta Scacchi, Sylvia
Chang, Don McKellar. Lions Gate. In English, French, German,
Italian and Mandarin, with English subtitles. 126 minutes. Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Buena Vista Social Club. Directed by Wim Wenders. Produced by
Ulrich Felsberg. Photographed by Robby Muller and Jurg Widmer.
Documentary. Artisan. 101 minutes. Partly in Spanish with English
subtitles. Rated G, suitable for all audiences.

APPRECIATING THE FULL MONTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Good, bad or indifferent, I set out to do a
Full Monty.
</P>
<P>
   And I did, all 4 hours 25 minutes of it. From the birdie at one
through the birdie at 18, and through the many aggravating holes
in-between, wherever Monty went, I went. In the morning mist. In
the mid-morning rain. In the afternoon clouds. Monty swung. I
watched. He doesn't know it, but I am his biggest stateside fan.
</P>
<P>
   I love Colin Montgomerie, every Tuna-looking inch of him. He's
real. He emotes. He says what he thinks. There is no filter. He's
been known to snap at fans. When he plays, there is always the
possibility of a heckler, hence the 18-hole presence of a statie.
``We look after marquee players,'' confided Trooper Walker of the
North Carolina Highway Patrol. ``Monty doesn't always think we're
behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie is also a bright fellow, and
there's something else I like: he is not obsessed with the game.
When he's home, he says, he doesn't play golf. ``That's possibly
why I've been as successful as I have, that I can get away from it
and don't miss it,'' he maintains.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Monty is The Man. Check the Ryder Cup standings. If
there's one guy we know will be at The Country Club representing
the Europeans on the final week in September, it's Colin
Montgomerie. Across the pond, he is royalty. He has won in
Portugal, The Netherlands, Spain, England, Germany, Ireland, and
Dubai, among other locales. The one place he hasn't won is the
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   He played 18 holes of US Open golf at Pinehurst No. 2 Thursday
and he didn't get one break. He was magnificent off the tee. He
struck his irons crisply. But if there was a difference between a
good bounce and a bad bounce, he invariably got the latter. Combine
that with a dicey putting day, and as he walked to the 17th tee he
was 4 over.
</P>
<P>
   But then he birdied the 191-yard par-3 17th with a superb tee
shot and an 8-footer. That was nice, but he wasn't through. He
likewise birdied the 18th, rolling in a 15-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was delighted to finish birdie-birdie,'' he said. ``That
will make dinner taste better; I can assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   He was all smiles at that point, but the post-round interview
session had almost been short-circuited before it started. A TV
sort, anchored to a spot while waiting for the world to present
itself for his perusal, had confused Monty with the following
opening query: ``What did you shoot?''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't what he expected. After a pause, he flashed a rueful
smile and announced that it had been a 72. Later he said, ``I
couldn't believe that question. What if I had shot 80?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a revealing round of golf, speaking, as it did, to the
vagaries of this fascinating course. His driving was robotically
pure. His second shots invariably looked good. But they didn't
always play well. On 4, 6, and 9 he hit what appeared to one and
all to be excellent shots. Each landed on the green. And each
rolled back off the green, as far as 25 feet in arrears. The most
excruciating was on No. 9, a 179-yard par 3. When the tee shot took
flight, things looked very well. But by the time the ball stopped
rolling backward, Monty was stuck with a delicate uphill approach
if he intended to salvage par.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridiculous, that!'' he declared after watching the ball roll
to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a shot that looked as if it might be a hole-in-one at
the US Open, and, my word, it winds up 30 yards away from the
hole,'' he would later say.
</P>
<P>
   The round was incident-free _ or so I thought. But there was a
rumor something had happened at 1. Somebody is supposed to have
said something. There was another story that Monty had stared down
a woman as he left the ninth green. I dunno. Like Sgt. Schultz, I
neither saw nor heard nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Paired with Vijay Singh and Jeff Sluman, Monty mostly kept
company with his caddy, although there were occasional chatty
moments with the man from Fiji. He is a pleasure to watch because
he doesn't fool around. He steps up to the ball, waggles and fires
away. It's the same when he putts. He lines it up quickly and hits
the ball. It wasn't his fault the round took damn near 4 1/2 hours.
His group spent a great deal of time waiting for someone in the
Jose Maria Olazabal-Tom Lehman-Nick Price group ahead of him to
take a shot every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   At least one somebody out there likes him. As he walked off the
10th, having just posted his fifth bogey, a man called out,
``C'mon, Monty, put it together. Let's Go!''
</P>
<P>
   He got his share of polite applause after hitting some nice
second shots, but I got the feeling a man standing near the 18th
green was more representative of his American audience. Informed
that he had birdied 17 and now had a good chance to do the same at
18, the patron said, ``I don't like the man, so I don't really
care.''
</P>
<P>
   The man obviously needs more time to work up an appreciation of
Monty's to rival mine, but time is on Monty's side. He's only 36.
He'll be coming back to play in our big ones for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   And he could have been a lot worse off Thursday without those
chirping birds on 17 and 18. ``You can't win a tournament on
Thursday,'' he says, ``but you can lose it.'' He hasn't lost it
yet. The sun will be out today, and you can forget about seeing a
lot of those 67s on Pinehurst No. 2.

`THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER' IS A WASHOUT FROM THE START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Producer Mace Neufeld has had great success turning Tom Clancy's
military-themed best sellers (``The Hunt for Red October,'' ``Clear
and Present Danger,'' ``Patriot Games'') into a profitable and
critically acclaimed movie franchise.
</P>
<P>
   With ``The General's Daughter,'' he tries to do the same with a
military-themed best seller by Nelson DeMille, but has considerably
less success. The movie is so bloated, self-righteous and
exploitative, it's hard to imagine anyone staying to the end, much
less demanding a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of Paul Brenner (John Travolta), a warrant
officer and investigator for the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigation
Division, who, while on an undercover assignment on a base in North
Carolina, happens on the rape-murder of a beautiful captain (Leslie
Stefanson).
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the victim was the only daughter of the Army's top
general (James Cromwell), a hero of the Gulf War, a U.S.
presidential contender and Brenner's personal hero. But,
incredibly, the general and his aide (Clarence Williams III)
basically want him to cover up the crime.
</P>
<P>
   And when Brenner and his partner, a rape investigation
specialist (Madeleine Stowe), discover the general's daughter was
having sex with almost every man on the base, as well as making
kinky sex videos in a secret dungeon in her house, the plot
thickens even further.
</P>
<P>
   As it does, there are a couple of unexpected twists and turns,
but as a murder mystery, most of it is highly predictable and, as a
military drama, it gets increasingly implausible, slanderous (to
the Army) and dumb as it rushes toward its not-so-surprising
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The script was co-written by William Goldman, but his
contribution seems to be in the way of pumping up several scenes
with his distinctively combative and ironic dialogue _ making them
seem contrived and glaringly out of sync with the rest of the
film's style.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Hollywood movies that deal with kinky sex (``8 mm''
springs to kind), it plays it both ways: It asks us to abhor the
violence and indignity of rape while it rubs our faces in it with
such explicit, full-frontal glee that it's pretty obvious somebody
behind the camera is turned on.
</P>
<P>
   The direction of Simon West is very much in the Jerry
Bruckheimer-inspired, overblown, sell-every-scene style of his
first film, ``Con-Air.'' Not a single scene or character rings
true, and shame on anyone who can't pick out the murderer in the
first reel.
</P>
<P>
   The cast _ Travolta, Cromwell, James Woods and Timothy Hutton _
is as competent as the script allows it to be, but Stowe is
criminally wasted in a part that requires her to stand around
making bimbo-ish statements or improbably interviewing potential
rapists in a men's locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The General's Daughter. Directed by Simon West. Screenplay by
Christopher Bertolini and William Goldman. Cast: John Travolta,
Madeleine Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton. 115 minutes. Rated
R for violence and rape theme.

`PIRATES OF SILICON VALLEY' A ROLLICKING RIDE SHOWING RISE OF
GATES, JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's all about power.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs says so in the early moments of ``Pirates of Silicon
Valley.'' And he's not kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, somewhere along the line from golden Apple to
wormy Apple, he seems to have forgotten his own mantra, believing
simply that being better would be enough to stay ahead of the
Microsoft/IBM duumvirate in the personal-computer game.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning moments of the film, Bill Gates says to a
prospective dead-end Jobs: ``You don't get it, Steve. That doesn't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   How true.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is all about power. And, as any pirate will admit
when not testifying before a Justice Department tribunal, having a
better ship might get you to Treasure Island first, but being more
devious will usually get you the buried treasure.
</P>
<P>
   As a film, ``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' is a rollicking ride
with punchy performances by the principal players, Noah Wyle and
Anthony Michael Hall. But it might have even more value as a primer
on how to succeed in business without really lying. It seems
stealing is easier and more effective.
</P>
<P>
   As Apple co-founder Jobs, Wyle plays a megalomaniac who takes
everything personally. As Microsoft co-founder Gates, Hall plays a
megalomaniac who takes nothing personally. In other words, sticks
and stones may break his bones, but his Windows will never shatter.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the film, writer/director Martyn Burke takes viewers
on an illuminating journey along parallel tracks, spanning about 15
years from the early '70s to the mid '80s, when Jobs, Gates and
their collaborators reinvented the computer business with a little
bit of genius and a lot of guile. Aside from the standard
``artistic license'' disclaimer as to specific times, places and
personalities, Burke vouches for the authenticity of everything in
the movie, right down to the bulldozer race between Gates and Chris
Larson (Marc Worden) in the early days of Microsoft and the nut-out
that Jobs had after his best friend, computer whiz Steve Wozniak,
decided to leave Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Wozniak is one of the few supporting players given a decent
portrayal in the film. Joey Slotnick paints him bright with
youthful innocence, and adds subtle brush strokes to convey a sense
of conscience. Microsofties Paul Allen and Steve Ballmer don't fare
as well. Josh Hopkins' Allen is more wooden than the real article,
and John DiMaggio's interpretation of the effervescent Ballmer is
more cartoon than character study.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Pirates of Silicon Valley,'' premiering Sunday at 8 on
TNT, is a good exploration of the so-called revolution that changed
the high-tech pecking order. And it's fascinating to see that, as
with so many other revolutions, ``power to the people'' is just a
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates of Silicon Valley. Two-hour cable movie about the rise
of the personal-computer industry on the skill and guile of Steve
Jobs and Bill Gates. Starring Noah Wyle, Anthony Michael Hall, Joey
Slotnick and John DiMaggio. Sunday at 8 p.m., 10 p.m. and midnight,
TNT. Repeats Wednesday, 8 p.m.; Friday, 12:30 a.m.; June 26, 8

FOX BROADCASTING'S CHAIRMAN TO HEAD NEW SPORTS GROUP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Hill, chairman of the Fox Broadcasting Co., is leaving
that post to become the chairman of a new entity, the Fox Sports
Television Group, which will oversee all the worldwide sports media
operations controlled by Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Those include not only the Fox television network, which
broadcasts the games of Major League Baseball and the National
Football League, but also the Fox Sports Net, a consortium of 22
regional sports cable channels like MSG and Fox Sports West. Hill
will also be an adviser with international sports operations owned
by the Fox parent company, the News Corp. Those include Sky Sports,
a division of the British-based Sky Television, and ESPN Star
Sports, a satellite sports operation based in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Hill is returning to day-to-day control of Fox's
growing empire in sports. But Hill emphasized he would not have any
involvement with the teams owned, or partly owned, by Fox
Entertainment Group, which include the Los Angeles Dodgers and the
New York Knicks and Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement had been anticipated for months. Hill has long
been expected to return eventually to sports, where he had spent
his entire career until three years ago when he was asked by the
Fox chairman, Rupert Murdoch, to take control of Fox Broadcasting.
In that capacity, he has been in charge of all the operations of
the Fox network.
</P>
<P>
   No replacement was named for Hill in his position at Fox
Broadcasting. Fox executives have denied in recent months that the
network leadership will be assumed by Sandy Grushow, the head of
Fox's studio, 20th Century Fox Television. One Fox executive said
Thursday that initially at least Peter Chernin, the president of
the Fox Entertainment Group, would assume more responsibilities for
the network.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who is 53, said he was ``absolutely thrilled'' to be
returning to a job exclusively connected to sports. He is credited
with establishing Fox as a credible sports broadcaster, starting
almost from scratch when the network first acquired the rights to
National Football League games five years ago.

   &UR; By RABBI ELI HECHT &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   We celebrate the third Sunday in June as Father's Day. Roses are
the Father's Day flowers; red is to be worn for a living father and
white if the father is deceased.
</P>
<P>
   But what does a child do if he or she doesn't have a living or
dead father? How can that be? you wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Bio-ethical dilemmas are on the increase. With the awesome
strides and discoveries made in the medical field we are now facing
fascinating and perplexing problems.
</P>
<P>
   A woman wanting a child may go to a sperm bank. She may use her
own eggs or someone else's. She might use a donor egg and a donor
sperm, have an in vitro fertilization procedure and become a
surrogate mother.
</P>
<P>
   Now, does that child have a father? Will he or she ever
celebrate Father's Day?
</P>
<P>
   I am very sensitive to the couples who want children and must
employ artificial methods to achieve their goals. ``God bless
them,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   My concern is about those who are using these methods because
they do not want to marry or have children in the conventional
manner.
</P>
<P>
   What does Jewish tradition have to offer in the way of
enlightenment? I look toward the Ten Commandments and I realize
that
</P>
<P>
   there are two tablets. On one side it speaks about man and God
while the other side speaks about man and man.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the tablets speak about God, the greatness of
God the relationship of man to God.
</P>
<P>
   The second tablet speaks about inter-human relationships, the
admonitions not to kill, covet, etc.
</P>
<P>
   One would expect the commandment to honor your parents to be on
the second tablet.
</P>
<P>
   I have wondered for many years why it was included in the first
group, where it speaks about the commandments of God? The answer
may be that the child/parent relationship is like God and man's
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   There are three partners to every birth -- God, father and
mother. The material substance is derived from the parents while
God grants spirit and soul, the vital form of man.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the fifth commandment is on the first tablet is to
show that there is a connection between God and man. Awareness of
the parents' role as creative agents leads to contemplation and
recognition of the third partner, the Almighty God, provider of
all. For this reason, God Himself gives honor to parents by
including the commandment of honoring your parents on the first
tablet.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth commandment is a religious principle as well as a
social one.
</P>
<P>
   Proper behavior toward parents is seen as a logical rung in the
ladder leading to the proper behavior toward God. As the saying
goes, ``He who heeds the parent will learn to heed other religious
obligations too.''
</P>
<P>
   If honor due to parents is on the same tablet that speaks of
honoring God, then we need parents who honor God.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Father's Day prayer created by the great Hassidic
master, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov (1772-1810) ``Dear God, teach me
to embody those ideals I would want my children to learn from me.
Let me communicate with my children wisely -- in ways that will
draw their hearts to kindness, to decency and to true wisdom. Dear
God, let me pass on to my children only the good; let them find in
me the values and the behavior I hope to see in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Children with good behavior bring honor to their fathers. A
happy Father's Day to you all.

<P>
   SURREALISM-GUGGENHEIM (New York) _ Surrealism, generally thought
of as melting watches and men in bowler hats descending from the
sky, began as a literary movement. The movement in its heyday
always had a literary bent _ a wide angle, in fact, to judge by the
large number of remarkable book illustrations and covers on view in
``Surrealism: Two Private Eyes,'' an exhibition at the Guggenheim
Museum running through Sept. 12. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved)

   CLEVELAND-MUSIC (Undated) _ Franz Welser-Moest's scheduled
ascendance in 2002 to music director of the Cleveland Orchestra is
hopeful news. Conductors and orchestras are sometimes about
individual and collective personalities, but in some places,
Cleveland among them, the subject is chemistry. By Bernard Holland.

</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-DISKS (Undated) _ For 20 years home video has thrived on a
simple process: choose a movie, watch it, engage in some thought
and discussion, move on. Now, though, operating on the principle
that nothing gets simpler, along comes the digital video disk (DVD)
to immerse one in films to a degree that will intrigue some and
repel others. DVD invites the average viewer to become a film buff,
defined as one who wants to know all about how the movie was made
and by whom. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved)
</P>
<P>
   CHOPIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Music history has its myths and its
debunkers of myths. Beethoven wasn't quite the political idealist
he seems in the story about tearing up the ``Eroica'' dedication
when Napoleon crowned himself Emperor; Schubert wasn't a cheerful
bohemian who died unknown. In the case of Chopin, it is so obvious
that his melodies and arabesques sound like the `bel canto'' opera
of his day that the conventional wisdom has him ``influenced'' by
opera. By Will Crutchfield. (Moved).

   ART-VANDYCK(Undated) _ Sometimes his royal patron was slow to
pay, but in the main England was good to Anthony Van Dyck. He first
crossed the Channel at age 21, summoned to the court of James I as
the outstanding disciple of the magisterial Rubens and already a
star in his own right. That brief stay, from late 1620 into early
1621, was a prelude to his reign as ``principalle Paynter in
ordinary their Majesties,'' beginning in 1632. Apart from an
interval back home in Brabant from early 1634 to early 1635, Van
Dyck remained in England for the rest of his too brief life. Death
claimed him at home in Blackfriars in 1641. His bones lie at St.
Paul's. Not that Antwerp ever neglected or forgot him. By Matthew
Gurewitsch. (Moved).

   ART-NY-GALLERY (New York) _ The rich and various history of art
in New York in the 1960s and '70s is being rewritten _ not at any
of the universities where graduate students avidly pore over the
origins of Pop, Minimal and Conceptual Art, nor at the uptown
museums that seem content to keep reinvestigating acknowledged

Schwabsky. (Moved).

   MOVIES-OPHULS (New York) _ Whatever the summer movies may bring,
it is a safe bet that the most ravishing, romantic images onscreen

FEDERAL PANEL APPROVES INDIAN MUSEUM ON MALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Commission of Fine Arts gave the Smithsonian
Institution final approval Thursday to build a museum dedicated to
the American Indian on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extraordinarily significant, at the foot of Capitol
Hill,'' said J. Carter Brown, chairman of the four-member
commission, shortly before it voted unanimously in favor of the
museum's final design. The commission, created by Congress, has the
last word on all designs for buildings in Washington's monument
area.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, to be called the National Museum of the American
Indian, will be built on the last vacant site on the Mall, just
east of the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the Smithsonian dismissed the project's original
architect, Douglas Cardinal, because of delays and contractual
disagreements. The Smithsonian then hired the Polshek Partnership
and Tobey &AMP; Davis, as well as four other design firms with Indians
as principals, to complete the project. The Smithsonian's own
architects also worked on the plans.
</P>
<P>
   In April the commission rejected the Smithsonian's completion of
the design because it did not follow the concept developed by
Cardinal, a noted architect who is of Blackfoot Indian ancestry. In
particular the commission objected to a column that had been placed
in the design to support an overhang that had been a free-standing
cantilevered structure in Cardinal's original version.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian again revised the plans, and that revision was
the design approved Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got rid of that ugly column,'' Brown said in an interview
after the commission voted. He said the Smithsonian's consultants
were confident the overhang would not fall without the column.
</P>
<P>
   The four-member team that made Thursday's presentation of the
revised design included three Indians. One, Donna House, a Navajo
and Oneida from New Mexico, said 30 percent of the museum site
would be forested and 30 percent would be a wetland growing
cattails, which have roles in many Indian ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. House said part of the site would be used to raise crops,
including ancient corn, to indicate the Indian contribution to the
present world's diet.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle will be what is essentially the museum building of
Cardinal's original design, a structure with undulating walls of
rough-hewn limestone, meant to resemble cliffs carved away.
Openings will be aligned so that sunlight will fall upon sacred
objects at the winter and summer solstices.
</P>
<P>
   In deference to Indian culture, Ms. House said, she wanted to
avoid marking the rocks, trees and lanes outside the building with
signs explaining their significance, a concept endorsed by Emily
Malino Scheuer, a designer who is a commission member. Many
Indians, Ms. House said, regard rocks as people. ``We thought that
would be rude'' to attach signs to rocks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the Smithsonian's consultants, Johnpaul Jones, a
Choctaw and Cherokee from Seattle, told the commission that the
museum's restaurant would serve ``an entirely native diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Smithsonian chief executive officer I. Michael Heyman, who has
announced that he will retire this year, said that the museum was
``clearly going to cost somewhat more'' than the $110 million
originally planned, but that Thursday's approval by the commission
assured that it would be built. The museum is scheduled to open in
2002.

LEARNING ABOUT GATES BECAME A MISSION FOR ANTHONY MICHAEL HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's got it down. The awkward hand gestures. The horrible
posture. The back-and-forth rocking motion. The nasal,
all-in-the-head voice.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Michael Hall became so wrapped up in playing the world's
richest man that, six months after finishing ``Pirates of Silicon
Valley,'' he was still seeking out material to learn more about
Bill Gates and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when ``Pirates'' was screened at the Seattle
International Film Festival, Hall admitted during a quick lunch
that he was halfway through Gates' newest book, ``Business  &LR;  the
Speed of Thought: Using a Digital Nervous System.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one resource that wasn't available to him during filming in
Los Angeles last October and November. Nearly everything else
written by or about Gates had found its way into Hall's personal
collection of research material.
</P>
<P>
   Martyn Burke, who wrote and directed the film, jokes now that
``the actor is way farther ahead than the writer/director.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hall, certainly more famous in the mid-'80s after appearing
in the films ``Sixteen Candles'' and ``The Breakfast Club and as a
regular on ``Saturday Night Live,'' admits that Gates has had a
salubrious effect on his life. He says that having played the
Wizard of Windows, he feels a new energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really invigorated my own appreciation for what I do,''
Hall said. ``It sort of gave me a new beginning to do due
diligence, to really make an investment in a performance and not
just show up ... and read the lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall theorizes it's because Gates is not a historical figure,
but someone who still walks among us, at least metaphorically, and
fascinates most of us because he's incredibly rich and incredibly
smart.
</P>
<P>
   Even his research into Gates' round-shouldered approach to life
was illuminating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from analyzing photos that he took on a whole
different physicality,'' Hall said of Gates' transition from geeky
college kid to corporate heavyweight. ``It's almost like from the
neck down he's a much older man.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pirates,'' which premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. on TNT, Hall
plays Gates in those early years. As the title suggests, he and his
rival at Apple Computer, Steve Jobs, were masters of _ how shall we
put this? _ assimilating the technogical achievements of others. At
the beginning of the film, both are enthusiastic young
entrepreneurs with lots of brains and even more brass. By the end,
neither is covered in glory.
</P>
<P>
   It means Hall had to portray an enigmatic sort of technocrat.
Or, in the words of director Burke, with Bill Gates, what you you
see is not what you get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael had to capture something that's so hard,'' Burke said.
``A kind of innocence, almost a fecklessness on the outside, but
inside there's this voracious creature that had to keep moving
ahead to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the prospect of playing such a character was
absolutely daunting. But he's thrilled to have had the opportunity.
Now 31, the same age at which Gates became a billionaire after
taking Microsoft public, Hall said, ``It's absolutely the most
incredible thing that's happened in my career.''

   KOSOVO-RDP (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ As Yugoslav forces completed
their withdrawal from the south of Kosovo and thousands of Serbs
continued to flee the province in long convoys, NATO and church
leaders intensified their appeals for Serbs to remain. By Steven
Erlanger.
</P>

   KUWAIT-VOTE (Kuwait City) _ Until three weeks ago, the law that
laid out who could vote and seek office began ``Each Kuwaiti man.''
Subject to ratification by the next Parliament, it now begins `Each
Kuwaiti.'' The change, which shocked even its supporters, would
bring an end to an era in which political life has been an all-male
preserve. By Douglas Jehl.

   CONGRESS-GUNS (Washington) _ Congressional action: A tense House
began considering its most significant gun control legislation in
five years, with advocates and opponents locked in a
down-to-the-wire struggle over a dozen proposals including
competing measures to regulate the sales of weapons at guns shows.
In a significant victory for cultural conservatives earlier
Thursday, the House voted 248-180 to include in the legislation a
provision giving the states the right to allow the display of the
Ten Commandants in public places including schools. By Alison
Mitchell and Frank Bruni.

<P>
   PAYDAY-LOANS (Kokomo, Ind.) _ An unexpected product of the
nation's most prosperous peacetime decade in this century, payday
lending companies are sprouting up all over the country, having
increased in number from 300 seven years ago to nearly 8,000 today.
Operating under names like Check Into Cash, Check 'n Go and Fast
Cash, payday lenders grant loans to workers against their next
paychecks. In return, the companies charge a ``fee,'' typically $15
to $35. At annual rates, the fees normally exceed 300 percent and
400 percent and in some cases they reach four digits. By Peter

   BORDER-BABIES (Brownsville, Texas) _ Griselda Vidrio thought
there was something oddly familiar about the smile on the infant a
Honduran woman was clutching in her arms at the Border Patrol's
illegal-alien processing center in Brownsville. Sure enough, when
officials looked into it they discovered that the same baby had
been used as a prop by phony parents on at least three and probably
many more occasions. Smugglers had discovered an inadvertent,
humanitarian loophole in the increasingly difficult game of begging
people across the Rio Grande and into the United States. By Rick
Lyman.

EX-CARTER AIDE SAYS KOSOVO ACCORD FACES CRUCIAL TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The fragile peace agreement in Kosovo faces a
critical test this weekend when the last Yugoslav forces are
scheduled to leave the province, former President Jimmy Carter's
national security adviser said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal of President Slobodan Milosevic's army to leave the
northern zone that borders Serbia could lead to a further crisis
with Russia if their forces team up to gain leverage with NATO,
said Zbigniew Brezinski, still an influential voice on foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a peace agreement Belgrade accepted last
week, Milosevic's forces are to withdraw in phases from Kosovo, a
Serbian province about the size of Connecticut. Troops in the
southern, eastern and western sections of the province have been
departing as NATO forces have moved in.
</P>
<P>
   But the area in northern Kosovo, which is to be under the
control of French forces, ``is the one zone, which conceivably
through Serbian and Russian collusion, a last-minute effort could
be made to somehow alter the arrangement'' by refusing to leave the
area, said Brezinski, who is associated with the non-partisan
Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   The region holds particular importance for Belgrade because it
is home to many Serbian Orthodox shrines and most of the province's
ethnic Serbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical time both for evacuating Kosovo and for resolving
some of the differences between NATO and Russia will be Saturday to
Sunday,'' Brezinski said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any surprises are to develop, (this weekend) would be the
time,'' he said. ``We do know already from experience that
surprises have taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   Brezinski was referring to the events of last week, when after
Russia successfully brokered a peace agreement, Moscow dispatched
200 paratroopers to the main airport at Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo, ahead of NATO forces. That happened after Moscow assured
the alliance it would not do so.
</P>
<P>
   The move has sparked high-level concern in Western capitals of a
possible confrontation between NATO and Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and NATO have had a fractious relationship over the
11-week NATO bombing of Yugoslavia that began March 24. Russia
initially sided with Yugoslavia, historically an ally, and then was
instrumental in persuading Milosevic to withdraw his troops from
Kosovo, where they were attacking the ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of States Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen met in Helsinki Thursday with Russian Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov in an
effort to resolve the airport standoff and Russia's overall role in
the British-led security force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have been snagged over a key Moscow demand that
Russian troops be assigned a sector to patrol as part of an
international peacekeeping force. The United States has objected,
fearing that such a deal could lead to the partition of Kosovo much
like the division of Germany after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, which will eventually deploy 50,000 troops in Kosovo, has
divided the province into five sectors controlled by the France,
Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, said Brezinski, the White House will need to
strike a delicate balance between punishing Russia when its foreign
policy collides with the West's as it has over Moscow's role in
Kosovo and accommodating Russian demands to prevent collisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is particularly dangerous with a power which might be
tempted to repeatedly engage in nuclear brink politics,'' he said.

 &HT;    CLINTON FOCUSED ON BALKANS REBUILDING, BRINGING RUSSIA ALONG ON
KOSOVO
 &HT;    With HILLARY-BALKANS-0618; KOSOVO-KLA-0618.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ President Clinton said he and his
counterparts from six other industrial powers would focus on
rebuilding the war-shattered Balkans in a weekend of talks opening
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The way forward remained occluded late Thursday, however, as
U.S. and Russian negotiators failed after a second day of
negotiations in Helsinki, Finland, to end a week-long squabble over
what role Russian troops might play in NATO peacekeeping operations
in the Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't resolved all the issues,'' Clinton told reporters
in Paris, just before leaving for Cologne. ``The next day or so I
think we'll get it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary
William Cohen are expected to resume negotiations with their
Russian counterparts, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The officials resolved key issues of how Russian troops would
fit into the NATO command and control structure and over control of
the Pristina airport, where some 200 Russian troops took up
postings last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point, however, is Russia's insistence on having
its own sector to patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and NATO reject that approach, fearing it
might lead to a de facto partition of Kosovo by carving out a
territory where only Russia's historic kin, the Serbs, would feel
welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon, in Helsinki with Cohen,
said the two sides' technical experts were working overnight
``refining the details'' of a possible deal. Cohen said there was
no deadline for the negotiations, but the U.S. delegation planned
to leave on Friday for talks with NATO allies in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Topping a crowded agenda before the so-called Group of Seven, or
G-7, is the issue of how the United States and its global partners
will pay the multibillion-dollar tab for the immediate
reconstruction needs in Kosovo and the longer range requirement to
stitch the Balkan countries into the rapidly modernizing fabric of
central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't want the Balkans and Southeastern Europe to be
torn apart in the future by ancient religious and ethnic hatreds,
we have to give them a better tomorrow to work for,'' Clinton said,
adding that he expects a joint G-7 statement on Friday to
underscore the point. ``We are strongly committed to doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Paris, Clinton ruled out using NATO forces to try to
apprehend Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia,
who has been indicted as an alleged war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that we not mislead people about what happens
next,'' Clinton said. ``I do not believe that the NATO allies can
invade Belgrade to try to deliver the indictment, if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been indicted by the United Nations tribunal
investigating war crimes in the Balkans. Milosevic is charged with
three counts of crimes against humanity and a single count of
violating the Geneva Conventions in connection with his role as
commander in chief of Serb forces charged with a long and
lengthening list of alleged atrocities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers, returning refugees and NATO peacekeepers
continued to turn up mounting evidence of war crimes inside Kosovo
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Just six days into the NATO peacekeeping mission in Kosovo,
officials have discovered so many mass graves and killing sites and
heard so many wrenching accounts of atrocities that they now
estimate at least 10,000 people were killed in the Serb crackdown
against Kosovar Albanians which began shortly before NATO began its
air bombardment March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, though, that so long as Milosevic remains in power
in Belgrade, his chances of arrest on war crimes charges appear
slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he remains inside the confines of Serbia, presumably he's
beyond the reach of the extradition powers of the other
governments,'' Clinton said in response to a reporter's question
during a news conference with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   ``That does not mean that this is not an important thing, or
that there won't someday be a trial,'' said Clinton. ``But we need
to focus on our obligations, our fundamental humanitarian
obligations to get the Kosovars home and to continue to uncover
whatever evidence of war crimes there is in Kosovo as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Chirac spoke with reporters on the sun-dappled lawn
of the Elysee Palace, where the two leaders met to take up Kosovo
and a host of other issues during the lead-up to the annual summit
of G-7 leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the summit has focused on global economic issues,
a subject to be touched upon here Friday as well. The G-7 leaders
will discuss, for instance, a plan to provide billions of dollars
in debt relief to four dozen of the world's most heavily indebted
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, the meeting amounts to something akin to a
victory meeting for the key members of the military alliance that
forced Milosevic to yield Kosovo to NATO control after a 78-day
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The G-7 nations are the United States, Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy and Japan. All except Japan are NATO members.

DESTRUCTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ NATO troops opened Mitrovica Thursday to
reveal a community of Serbs almost normal in the routine of life,
and a second city of devastation, death and fearful ethnic
Albanians just blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the two halves of the city, said to be the
pivot point of brutality exported to villages all around, was
formidable.
</P>
<P>
   The face of Mitrovica showed this conflict was not a war of
battling opponents, but a case of one people in power who held the
armaments and wielded them with abandon against undefended
civilians whose community was decimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just now we are getting out a little,'' said Nazmi Idrizi, 38,
who was walking with her three children down the main shopping
street in the Serbian district. There shops were open with window
displays of clothes or shoes, stores had food to sell, and people
strolled in the sunny afternoon licking at ice cream cones.
</P>
<P>
   Idrizi's children had no ice cream, however, because she said
she doesn't have enough money even to buy basic foodstuffs since
her husband was grabbed in a round-up of Kosovar Albanian men in
April and then sent off to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   A few ethnic Albanians ventured out this day because the French
peacekeeping troops of NATO rolled in Thursday morning in the push
to secure all of Kosovo. Tanks were stationed at key intersections
and soldiers warily watched their Serb counterparts who have not
yet withdrawn from this central sector of Kosovo, as they must do
by Sunday under the military agreement approved by the United
Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb troops mostly lounged around kiosks, but gunmen out of
sight periodically ripped off rounds of rat-a-tat-tat that sent
shudders at least through Albanian children of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Over on the Albanian side, there were no shops open and precious
few intact. Homes, too, have been blasted by grenades or shot up by
automatic weapons, and almost every building wears scars of assault
-- busted windows, holes blasted in roofs and walls, blackened
imprints from tongues of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the stores and some homes have been looted and trashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is only on that side where there are Serbs,'' said Zenel
Potoku, 34, who hunkered down in his home during more than 10 weeks
of intense ethnic cleansing by Yugoslav forces and Serb police and
paramilitary gangs. He spent a week in prison just before the Serb
troops agreed to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Potoku said he heard people -- especially men -- who ventured to
the Serb side often had their documents taken or were beaten. He
never went himself.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the sights here is a different experience altogether than
on the Serbian side.
</P>
<P>
   Potoku and his relative Abedon Potoku, 51, showed a burnt house
that was torched just Wednesday night amid a torrent of gunfire.
Some Serbs live in this half of the town that the older man
estimated has 70 percent ethnic Albanian population, and he said he
recognized one of the arsonists as a neighborhood resident.
</P>
<P>
   Telltale clouds of smoke puffed into the sky not far away,
suggesting other buildings had been set afire Thursday and still
were burning.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Potokus walked two news correspondents another 20
yards into the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   There in the garden of the mosque were found the too familiar
mounds of dirt marked by sticks. They are graves. The men said 18
neighbors perished in those 10 weeks, most killed by Serb forces,
though four were old men who died from lack of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some other neighbors and I collected the bodies,'' said Abedon
Potoku. ``We went to take the bodies at night.''
</P>
<P>
   They were afraid of being shot in the daytime, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most were found in their homes, and many had been mutilated,
said Abedon Potoku. Some had a cross cut into the face, others had
ears struck off.
</P>
<P>
   The Potokus and others spoke of larger numbers of dead in the
villages surrounding Mitrovica, but warned that the areas are
believed to be heavily mined.
</P>
<P>
   The death and even possible massacres in this area fit the
pattern emerging from around Kosovo. The British government on
Thursday estimated at least 10,000 ethnic Albanians were killed in
this latest round of Balkan conflict, and NATO troops were said to
have found around 100 sites of massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Risley, spokesman for the war crimes tribunal at The Hague,
said Thursday in Pristina that NATO is watching the sites
identified until they can be forensically studied for possible
trial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scope and scale of atrocities that happened to date
greatly exceeded our belief of what had occurred,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been too many incidents ``to write off as accidents
of war,'' he said, and investigators will try both to prove those
crimes happened and also document the chain of command leading back
to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.

SOBRIETY BRINGS A NEW FIRE ON THE ICE FOR OKSANA BAIUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They were only three years apart, but the contrast
between the two events could not have been more dramatic for Oksana
Baiul.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the 16-year-old figure skater from Ukraine won the gold
medal at the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. The sprite
with so much style and expressiveness on ice was the youngest woman
to win the gold since the immortal Sonja Henie in 1928 and she was
suddenly the toast of the sporting world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Baiul was in the headlines again, this time for driving
almost 100 mph and crashing her Mercedes into a grove of trees in
Connecticut, sustaining a concussion and also being charged for
driving under the influence of alcohol. Community service and an
alcohol class led to dismissal of the charge, but the troubled
Baiul seemed destined to become yet another young athlete who
burned out in the blaze of sudden fame, even with her 10-week stint
in alcohol rehab.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to a few weeks ago when Baiul was surprised by her
skating compatriots in the Champions on Ice tour, who rallied
around her to celebrate (without alcohol) the anniversary of her
first year of sobriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a nice thing for them to do,'' Baiul said this
week from Salt Lake City. ``I was drinking tea with lemon, my
favorite drink now, and having them all with me meant a lot. It
meant that I have their respect and that they love me and that I
feel like I'm a part of them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Champions on Ice rolls into Seattle on Saturday night, with its
usual complement of skating superstars, including Michelle Kwan,
Elvis Stojko, Surya Bonaly, Brian Boitano, Victor Petrenko, Nicole
Bobek and Todd Eldredge. This will be the last stop on the 45-city
summer tour of Champions on Ice, but one skater who will not be
glad to see it end is the rejuvenated Baiul.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, there will be a big sadness on Saturday,'' Baiul said.
``I love to be on tour with everybody, love to be on the road, love
to travel and I love to perform. I try to skate the best I can
every time I go on the ice. I face each performance as if it was my
last performance, which has been a trick of mine, and I try to do
everything I can to please those in the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a distinct sprightliness in the voice of Baiul, who has
lived in the United States for several years and speaks English
without hesitation. But long gone now is the diminutive figure that
so many people remember pulling
</P>
<P>
   off the upset win over Nancy Kerrigan at Lillehammer.
</P>
<P>
   Baiul has grown up. She is more than 6 inches taller and pounds
heavier than she was as a teen champion. Her good looks have turned
adult, as has her outlook, especially about her perilous fall.
</P>
<P>
   The self-discipline that helped her become a world champion at
such a young age is now helping her battle back from alcoholism to
what seems to her a much more normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had that before I won the gold medal,'' Baiul stressed.
``But after that, my head was spinning and everything was
different. Now I have a normal lifestyle _ I wish I could have done
that earlier. But, thank God, I only had three years of a
screwed-up life. Having two such different lifestyles were
definitely not good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Baiul has settled back into skating again, both in ice shows and
in competition, while she lives in Delaware with coach Natalia
Linichuk, a fellow gold medalist. Baiul has her own line of skating
attire and has penned two books, one about her life, another about
skating technique.
</P>
<P>
   What the skater longs for, surprisingly, is the chance to
compete in the Olympics again, she hopes in the 2002 games in Salt
Lake City. Her pro status precludes that under current rules, but
Baiul clings to the hope that Olympic figure skating will be
broadened to include professionals, as have many other Olympic
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Baiul does not expect to leave the limelight any time soon. Her
Olympic gold was followed by a TV movie, which dramatized her climb
to stardom against a host of personal setbacks _ her father who
left the family when she was 2, her mother who died of cancer when
she was 13, her later life with the family of her skating coach who
also left her when he moved to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Later came Baiul's bout with alcoholism, thoughts of suicide, or
at least quitting skating forever. But through it all, she has not
grown weary of being a celebrity whose ups and downs have taken
place under a public microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to hide anything from my public,'' Baiul
emphasized. ``I am a performer, and I am addicted to the public. It
truly is a form of addiction. I like to be in the public eye and
have been since I was 15, and I'm now 21. What I do not like to be
is a dishonest person. I like to tell the truth _ that's my
problem. My mouth is too loud, but I can't hide my feelings. What I
feel I have to say, I say.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   QYSHK, Yugoslavia _ Ask the farmers just starting to plow the
fields far off the two-lane paved road if there are any mass graves
around, and they wave you on ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A mile or so farther on, a small knot of ethnic Albanian
villagers could be seen gathered tearfully around two mounds of
dirt decorated with tributes to the dead, including a few strands
of what looks like tinsely Christmas garlands.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went for a little over two hours of wandering Thursday
afternoon in three small villages about 10 miles east of the city
of Pec. Ask anyone and they would bring you to graves or places
where people had been killed by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances, the villages were not Kosovo Liberation Army
strongholds, and did not seem to have been involved in any
fighting. There were no returning victorious rebels or Albanian
flags in sight. On the contrary, the men spoke of hiding in the
woods and mountains and shifting their hiding places depending on
where the shooting came from.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts in this tiny corner of Kosovo _ and others emerging
as journalists and human rights workers begin to range through the
shattered province _ suggest that the death toll and the carnage
may be greater than previously known.
</P>
<P>
   At the two grave mounds, Ajet Gashi, 30, said, ``Here are 35
people buried. Most of them were burned in their houses. We took
what was left of the people and put them in plastic bags, so there
are 33 people here, and in the other grave two people who were not
burned.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The women buried them, because the men were all
hiding in the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Another villager offered a crumpled piece of paper listing the
names of all the dead. Gashi motioned the way to the building where
the men had been lined up and shot dead by Serbian forces when they
said they had no more money to give them. The men were then set on
fire with the farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the villagers pointed out where the rich man of
the village was told by the Serbs on May 14 to stand in a primitive
wooden outhouse, assuring him he would be safe there. Then they
killed him in the privy, the bullet holes ripping through the thin
pine door, the villagers said.
</P>
<P>
   In Pec, where the Serbs had destroyed the Old Town marketplace,
burned the mosque and torched the shops, save a handful that
displayed Serbian Orthodox icons, the local KLA commander, Ethem
Ceku, said: ``Our young fighters are coming from the districts
informing us of massive graves in almost every village where
Albanians live.''
</P>
<P>
   Handed a map, he rattled off a half-dozen names of villages
where he had heard of mass graves of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The road east out of town, past the Italian NATO peacekeepers
and the last, ragged KLA checkpoint, seemed deserted, the large
brick houses nearby empty, the biggest ones burned.
</P>
<P>
   Shaban Kastrati, 50, was standing near some parked aid trucks
from the International Mercy Corps at the village of Zahaq.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said, he had buried four people himself and there had
been 24 people killed nearby.
</P>
<P>
   He piled into a car and pointed the way down a dirt path to a
farmhouse. From there, it was a trek over a board bridging a creek
and through some woods. He pointed out the lashed-together poles
which, when covered with plastic sheeting, had formed three tents
where his family hid from the Serbs. Then he moved on to four rough
grave mounds, covered with dead branches and a few drying red
poppies from the fields.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were Sokol Rama, 90; Zenel Neziri, 70; Ajshe Kastrati,
50; and Luljeta Kastrati, 22, he said. They didn't have any more
German marks to give the Serbian police he said, and that is why
they were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bodies were left in the house,'' he said, ``We dug the
graves during the night. We went into the houses and got the bodies
and we took them during the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramiz Zeqiri, who turned up with some other villagers to offer
coffee, said, ``There are also other graves. There is one from
another house and two more near your car.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way again, Kastrati dictated the names, ages and
occupations of 24 people from the area who, he said, had been shot
and then dumped in the grease pit of a garage where buses are
repaired. At the garage he pointed out small piles of brass
cartridge casings at the lip of the pit and then climbed down
inside to show the bloodstains.
</P>
<P>
   After the villagers in Qyshk had shown their graves, they urged
visitors on to the neighboring village of Pavlan.
</P>
<P>
   Graves, said two women in the yard of a farmhouse. Yes, keep
going just a little way down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man of 68, was burned alive here,'' said Haki Gashi, 40,
leading the way to mounds of earth on the edge of a garden marked
by sticks with upturned plastic buckets. ``Six people who were
burned are buried here, the old man and a 27-year-old man who was
shot dead. Also three men were executed in another part of the
village.''
</P>
<P>
   Other villagers gathered around, giving the names and more
gruesome details. Then Isa Gashi, 60, led a march through the
fields, past a cow whose flanks were charred when the Serbs burned
the barn, to two more graves. One, marked by a large juice can and
a pair of slippers, was that of a 44-year-old woman, the second,
that of a 74-year-old man shot when he tried to sneak back one
night to feed his cows. He was buried in the dark by his neighbors,
his grave marked by a plastic water bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were isolated,'' said Isa Gashi, wearing the traditional
white conical hat of the Albanian mountains and a fierce mustache.
``We have been living for five weeks in the mountains. This is the
first day we have been able to find out what has happened and who
was killed. In these three villages there were 80 people killed.''

REPUBLICANS REVIVE DRIVE FOR WORKPLACE FLEX TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Refiling for those needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Republican senators introduced a bill Thursday
that would allow wage earners to choose time off instead of
overtime pay and to arrange with their bosses to work more flexible
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, endorsed by business groups, faces an almost
certain challenge from Democrats, who two years ago blocked a
similar bill on the grounds that it undermined labor laws and
risked the abuse of workers by their employers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said the Family Friendly Workplace
Act would help hourly workers better balance the competing demands
and tensions of work and home. Federal and salaried employees have
benefited from such flexible scheduling for decades, said Ashcroft,
who is sponsoring the bill with Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flexible job schedules could allow a working mother to leave
work early on Friday for a child's doctor's appointment, and then
make up the missed time next week without suffering a loss of
pay,'' Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said employers and workers should be able to hash out
their own scheduling agreements, ``but there's a government hand
that says you can't do this,'' she said, referring to the Fair
Labor Standards Act. Enacted in 1938, the law requires that
employers pay hourly wage earners overtime if they work more than
40 hours in one week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time that we let hourly workers who are often the most
stressed have the relief that they say they need,'' Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   The senators cited a Rutgers University study released in March
that surveyed 1,000 adult workers and found that 87 percent rated
flexible work hours as important.
</P>
<P>
   The Ashcroft-Hutchison proposal, which is co-sponsored by 31
other Republicans, would allow employers and workers to structure a
two-week period such that an employee could work up to 50 hours in
one week and 30 the other. A worker also could choose compensation
at the rate of time-and-a-half off instead of time-and-a-half pay
for each hour of overtime worked.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents
small business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., led a filibuster of similar
legislation in 1997, saying it amounted to an assault on the
traditional work week, undermined labor law and could have resulted
in employers forcing workers to accept time off instead of overtime
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft and Hutchison said this bill would be more popular
because it includes changes such as stiffer penalties to prevent
employers from coercing workers into accepting time off instead of
overtime pay.

 &HT;    FIRST LADY: GLOBALIZATION MUST ADDRESS NEED FOR CIVIL SOCIETY
 &HT;    With CLINTON-KOSOVO-0618.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton took her plea for
nurturing civil society to one of the incubators of Western thought
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the Sorbonne -- the University of Paris, which
traces its academic roots to the 11th Century -- Mrs. Clinton
addressed a crowd that included several hundred students, faculty
and her daughter, Chelsea, U.S. Ambassador to France Felix Rohaytn
and French First Lady Bernadette Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   If globalization -- economic, political and social -- is to
shape the next millennium, Mrs. Clinton said, world leaders have an
obligation to fashion the shape of that globalization, so as to
extend its benefits to the widest possible array of people.
</P>
<P>
   In the most moving part of a speech that lasted nearly an hour,
Mrs. Clinton recounted a story told to her last month by an ethnic
Albanian living in a refugee camp in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   While herded by Serb forces into a railroad station at Kosovo's
provincial capital of Pristina, Mrs. Clinton said, the woman had
lost the grip of three of her children's hands, and thus lost the
children.
</P>
<P>
   In such a world, Mrs. Clinton said, the need to nurture civil
societies -- where tolerance and rule of law win out over hatred
and violence -- is at least as important as harnessing the new
technologies behind accelerating globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it mean, in a world where cell phones connect us, if
a mother loses three of her children because of a forced
expulsion?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to absorb what we are now learning about mass
graves,'' said Mrs. Clinton. ``It is hard to imagine that this
still goes on, but I can, in my mind's eye, see a little hand
slipping out of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton left Paris for a visit to Palermo, Sicily, where
she was to pay tribute to community efforts to transform a violent
area into a magnet for tourism. She planned to join President
Clinton at the Group of Seven leaders' summit in Cologne, Germany
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is expected to announce soon her candidacy for the
U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y.

CHINESE WORLD CUP ATHLETE STRIKES A DIPLOMATIC GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ China's Gao Hong, the Charles Barkley of
women's soccer, fearlessly jumped into the political fray. She took
on questions as if they were shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Did she worry about playing the Women's World Cup in America,
given the frosty state of relations between this country and hers?
What did she think of the U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade? And, by the way, what does she think of the food in
Silicon Valley?
</P>
<P>
   ``The food isn't good,'' her interpreter said, ``but she doesn't
know if it's true it's related to the politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gao had obviously been well-coached on the subject. Her initial
reply was: ``We are always nervous before a big game.'' But the
food line was all her own. To paraphrase the typical sports scout,
you can't coach wit.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, like Sir Charles, maybe Gao will run for governor of
Alabama. Right now, she is here to play a game. She and her
teammates, seeded first in the World Cup, take on Sweden at San
Jose State on Saturday at 5 p.m. The whole world will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Gao will probably be laughing.
</P>
<P>
   She is 31, media-savvy and irrepressible. At Wednesday's news
conference, while 11 other people sat stiffly at the dais,
delivering careful, dull answers, Gao whispered in her coach's ear
a couple of times, giggling openly.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese team has been training in seclusion down in Silicon
Valley, forbidding interviews to American reporters. One observer,
however, has watched practices and noted that when the coach
delivers his stern instructions to the team, Gao usually drops in a
remark that sends her teammates into fits of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, her interpreters had a hard time doing their jobs.
She'd finish talking, and they'd laugh. Even a question as simple
as how she began playing soccer brought on smiles. One interpreter
gave a dry version of the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why,'' a reporter asked, ``was that so funny?''
</P>
<P>
   The interpreter explained: ``It was how she said it. She made it
into a poem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' I thought, ``another athlete who wants to be a rapper.''
</P>
<P>
   Gao turned seriously political for a few seconds. When she was
asked whether women were treated as second-class athletes in China,
much as they have in the United States, she started nodding her
head before the translator was finished posing the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the problem of women all over the world,'' the
interpreter said, distilling Gao's long, impassioned reply.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that she had been a Christian for the last 10
years, that she considered the opportunity to play in the World Cup
a gift from God. She could have been Charlie Ward on his way into
the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   This is supposed to be the point of international sports, to
strip away assumptions that we are all so different. The Chinese
team reportedly never considered a boycott of the World Cup, even
though the host country bombed one of its embassies, purportedly by
accident, and launched accusations about stealing military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe sports transcend these squabbles, leading to more
understanding. Or maybe every country on Earth has become so
sports-crazed that no disagreement can impede the athletic mission.
</P>
<P>
   Win, smile, wink, nod, win, smile, nod, wink, raise an index
finger, sell a few more Nikes. We are the world.
</P>
<P>
   Gao fits neatly into this global village. Her charm will carry
her anywhere. ``OK?'' she asked reporters in English, near the end
of the interviews. ``It's OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Gao did say something mildly critical of the host country, but
even then it was a subtle dig. ``She felt very shocked'' that the
U.S. would bomb the embassy, an interpreter said, ``especially
since the U.S. is a country that respects human rights so much.''
</P>
<P>
   As the interpreter translated that answer, a woman stepped up to
the press table and asked Gao to pose for a picture. She flashed a
huge smile and raised her right hand in the air, two fingers
splayed. She was giving the peace sign.

TIM DUNCAN EARNS THE ACCOLADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Tim Duncan drew a lot of attention and a lot of
praise Thursday. Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy called Duncan ``the
best player in the NBA'' and the modest Spur, while acknowledging
he is comfortable on the court, suggested he also was still
``pretty boring'' off it.
</P>
<P>
   When you score 33 points, collect 16 rebounds, block 2 shots and
lead your team to victory, accolades are going to come your way.
But in Van Gundy's mind, Duncan was Duncan in San Antonio's 89-77
win in Game 1 and that's exactly what he expected.
</P>
<P>
   The coach did not expect his team to get into quick foul trouble
or get scorched from the perimeter by Jaren Jackson. That makes you
wonder if Van Gundy has been paying attention to the Spurs as they
have steamrolled through the playoffs, which continue Friday night
at the Alamodome with Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   They are where they are in large part because of Duncan, but
also because of their perimeter sharpshooters, who take turns
sharing the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need it,'' Duncan said Thursday, referring to the outside
shooting needed to balance his inside game. ``Their confidence has
grown more and more and different people are stepping up. We don't
have just one guy who does it every night. But we do need those
guys to hit those shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was the guy in Game 1, hitting five 3-pointers and
scoring 17 points. At other times, it has been Mario Elie, Steve
Kerr, Avery Johnson, or Sean Elliott. It is the recipe for success
in the NBA these days when you have a low-post presence, something
the Rockets did to perfection in winning their two titles in 1994
and 1995 with snipers such as Kenny Smith, Vernon Maxwell, Robert
Horry, Clyde Drexler, and even Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, coaches will let the perimeter players try to beat you
and work hard to stop the inside game. The Knicks couldn't stop
Duncan, couldn't stop David Robinson, and then had to watch Jackson
knock down all those treys, a couple of which were right out of the
World B. Free School.
</P>
<P>
   The perimeter was a major source of concern for the Spurs this
season. Coach Gregg Popovich felt San Antonio lost its series to
Utah last year because of inconsistent perimeter shooting (although
the team, as a whole, shot well in that series). He worked to
address that and brought in Kerr and Elie to join a rehabilitated
Elliott and an improved Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Vive la difference. Elliott has been a big contributor and
basically won Game 2 of the conference finals against Portland with
six treys, including the one known locally as the Memorial Day
Miracle. He didn't play in the postseason last year because of
injuries, but killed Portland with 47 percent 3-point shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr and Elie have come up huge in NBA Finals for other teams;
both have struggled this season. Jackson basically exists in the
league for his 3-point shooting and he had a huge series against
the Lakers (10 of 23 from international waters).
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year,'' Robinson said, ``it was a pitch out and a guess.
You pitched it out to the shooters and hoped the made it. I don't
think we were as confident as we are now. Even Jaren wasn't this
good last year. The confidence level wasn't flowing. This year,
it's just a different feeling when I kick it out now. Even Steve
Kerr, whose struggling, I'll give it to him anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps, of course, to have two big men in the post who not
only like to pass, but are very good at it. Robinson had seven
assists in Game 1, many of them inside feeds to Duncan. Asked
specifically about Duncan, Van Gundy said, ``The way he's playing
now, there's not one man on the planet who can stop him. Even if
you double him, he's still going to get his 25. He wasn't the
reason we lost. We lost because of foul trouble and Jaren
Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, but it's also defining the Spurs to a tee.
Friday night, it could be Robinson and Elliott. Or Duncan and
Johnson. The Spurs have their constants and their unknowns. The
combination has been deadly.

GORE, BUSH BEGIN DUEL EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ More than 16 months from the general
election, it already seems like a Bush vs. Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days after Texas Governor George W. Bush swept into
town to cheering Republican crowds, Vice President Al Gore blew in
to a slightly less frenzied reception Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the two men haven't wrapped up the presidential
nominations of their parties, their dueling announcement tours
prompted inevitable comparisons of the two front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   Bush brought about 150 reporters here, while Gore arrived with
half that number. Twenty-nine television cameras recorded Bush's
words, while a dozen focused on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Substantively, Bush stuck to broad themes about his philosophy
of ``compassionate conservatism'' and appeared to be aiming for
moderate voters in the general election more than the conservatives
who dominate the GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sought to distinguish himself from Bush at a forum on the
high-tech economy at Hesser College Thursday morning. In the
afternoon, in a speech on New York's Wall Street, he promised to
have a federal budget in balance or surplus every year, and to seek
``the authority to negotiate labor and environmental protections in
(new trade) agreements, whenever necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gore's supporters were unnerved by the glowing reviews Bush
received earlier in the week, they weren't showing it Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When nobody knows what he stands for and there's a big swell
of support, then it's built on sand,'' said Debby Butler, an
accountant from Concord who served as a cochairwoman for Gore
during his 1988 run for president. ``At the moment, it's not based
on reality, so it's not scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hoe Burling, the Democratic leader of the New Hampshire
House, said big Republican crowds in New Hampshire are no novelty.
``I'm more interested in how he handles himself in the luncheonette
in Franklin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Burling said, Granite State voters will begin
questioning Bush on his record, asking him about the escalating
rate of executions in Texas, as well as what Burling contends is
Bush's lack of commitment to cutting property tax rates there.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire voters are highly trained at being critical,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's supporters did agree that Bush performed
well on his initial voyage to the first-primary state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously charming. He's likeable on a personal level and
good with people,'' said Joe Keefe, a Gore adviser from Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Coelho, Gore's campaign chairman, said Gore is the
candidate with the answers to America's problems. ``They're not
providing solutions, they're saying, `Trust me,' '' Coelho said of
the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   At Hesser College, several hundred people arrived early in the
morning for a chance to cheer Gore and talk to him about the
economy. The crowd was overwhelmingly in support, with the
exception of about six protesters who jumped up next to the vice
president and raised a banner that said: ``Gore Kills. AIDS Drugs
for Africa.'' The demonstrators shouted ``Gore kills'' over and
over, just inches away from him.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd booed the protesters as Gore told them he would be
happy to talk to them later. A group of firefighters then jumped up
with their own banner in support of Gore, and the crowd began
chanting ``We Want Gore.'' Campaign organizers hustled the
demonstrators out of the hall as Secret Service agents looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Gore's strategy in New Hampshire is to remind voters
that before he and President Clinton took office, the economy was
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of the biggest deficits in history, we now have the
biggest surpluses. Instead of quadrupling our national debt, we've
seen the creation of almost 19 million new jobs. Instead of a deep
recession and high unemployment, America now has our strongest
economy in history,'' he said, to sustained applause.
</P>
<P>
   To continue the strong economy, Gore said he would make
permanent tax cuts for research and development. Currently,
companies cannot count on those tax cuts because they are
reauthorized annually. Gore also said he would double the nation's
spending on information technology to $3 billion a year in order to
help create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will craft these tax cuts specifically to help the small
businesses and startups that are crucial to our high-tech future,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very lengthy list of specific and hard-hitting
proposals to make this country a better place,'' said Gore. ``I
haven't heard any of the others support this.''
</P>
<P>
   During a question-and-answer period, Larry Morris of Andover
stood and told the vice president that they were classmates at
Harvard in 1965. ``I wanted to say how proud your classmates are
about what you are about to do,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   When Chip Moynihan, a Gore supporter from Hampton, stood to ask
his question, he avoided public policy altogether. ``How's Karenna
doing?'' he asked, referring to Gore's pregnant oldest daughter.

HOUSE OK'S POSTING OF COMMANDMENTS IN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House, continuing to distance itself from the
Senate's recent approval of several tough gun control measures,
Thursday sought a religious solution to violent juvenile crime,
approving legislation that allows the Ten Commandments to be posted
in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The chief sponsor of the ``Ten Commandments Defense Act
Amendment,'' Representative Robert Aderholt, said the measure
``will not change the moral character of our nation overnight.''
But, the Alabama Republican said, ``it is an important step to
promote morality, and an end of children killing children.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure, approved by 248-180, was castigated by groups such
as the Americans United for the Separation of Church and State as
an unconstitutional blow to religious freedom. The organization's
executive director, the Rev. Barry Lynn of the United Church of
Christ, called the measure ``frighteningly silly,'' adding in an
interview: ``Congress always seems to turn to religion as a
political football when they can't solve the problem they are
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn said the Supreme Court previously has ruled that it is
unconstitutional to post the Ten Commandments in schools due to the
constitutional separation of church and state. But Aderholt
disagreed, saying that his amendment protects the posting of a
``religious symbol'' and does not endorse a specific religion.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the measure came as gun control opponents expressed
optimism that the House would not back Senate-passed legislation
that requires a three-day background check on gun show purchases.
The Senate last month approved that measure with a tie-breaking
vote from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the House was preparing to vote late on a proposal
backed by the National Rifle Association and sponsored by
Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and former NRA
board member. The measure would provide a 24-hour waiting period
for gun show purchases, which the Justice Department says is too
brief to perform an adequate investigation of potential purchasers.
Dingell predicted Thursday that his measure would pass and that he
would have the support of perhaps 50 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The potential of such a large defection was a blow to the
Democratic Party and drew the ire of President Clinton. In a
last-ditch effort to stop approval of the Dingell amendment,
Clinton Thursday called at least four Democrats on the phone while
traveling aboard Air Force One during a European trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something in which we have a profound disagreement,''
Clinton told reporters. ``And I believe that John Dingell believes
he's doing the right thing. But I know that most members of
Congress in both parties agree that the gun show loophole, if
closed, would keep more guns out of the hands of criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that while the majority of Americans tell pollsters
that they back gun control, the NRA has used its political
contributions and influence to stop legislation. In the wake of the
Senate's surprising approval of the three-day background check for
gun show purhcases, the NRA has launched an all-out assault on the
legislation in an effort to kill it in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House's effort to pass gun control legislation may
have been hurt inadvertently by Gore, who on Monday asserted that
anyone under 21 years old can walk into a store and buy a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredibly, while these 18 to 20 year olds cannot legally buy
a beer, cannot purchase a bottle of wine, cannot order a drink in a
bar, they can walk into any gun shop, pawn shop, or gun show in
America and buy a handgun,'' Gore said, according to a White House
press release.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides later acknowledged that Gore was mistaken because a
federal law prohibits anyone under 21 years from buying a handgun
at a gun shop, although they can possess firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's statement provided an opening for the NRA to charge that
the White House campaign for gun control is based in
misinformation. ``Members of Congress don't like being misled any
more than the American people,'' NRA executive vice president Wayne
LaPierre said, referring to Gore's comments. ``And this is a matter
of important public policy and a constitutional right. This is not
a time to play fast and loose with the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat who was
elected to Congress after a gunman on a Long Island train killed
her husband, led the fight to pass a three-day waiting period for
gun shows. McCarthy, urging the House to adopt a measure similar to
that passed by the Senate, cited the success of a Boston program in
curtailing juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're trying to do, save lives,'' McCarthy said.
``Please don't forget that's what we're trying to do, is save
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The approval of the Ten Commandments amendment marked a success
for Republicans who have been trying to shift the blame from guns
to cultural issues, saying violent images in the media, coupled
with a spiritual vacuum in today's youths, were the root causes of
juvenile violence.
</P>
<P>
   The vote earlier Thursday on the Ten Commandments amendment
prompted debate over whether proponents were abridging religious
freedom. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York,
stressed that there are numerous interpretations of the Ten
Commandments and questioned which one would be posted in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose Ten Commandments? Which version?'' Nadler said. ``The
Catholic version? The Protestant version, or the Jewish version?
They are different, you know. The Hebrew words are the same, but
the translations are very different, reflecting different religious
traditions and different religious beliefs...It was precisely to
avoid divisive questions like this that the First Amendment
commands no establishment of religion, and that is what this
ignorant amendment would overturn.''

GIVING WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE TURNS INTO HOT ISSUE IN KUWAIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT CITY _ Under floodlights in these sweltering nights, the
men who gather to talk politics in outdoor tents are talking now
about whether Kuwait will ever be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Until three weeks ago, the law that laid out who could vote and
seek office in Kuwait began ``Each Kuwaiti man ....'' Subject to
ratification by the next Parliament, it now begins ``Each Kuwaiti
....''
</P>
<P>
   The change, which shocked even its supporters, would bring an
end to an era in which political life in Kuwait has remained an
all-male preserve. Announced in an edict by the emir, Sheik Ahmed
al-Jaber al-Sabah, it has left some Kuwaitis jubilant, many others
aghast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone has to remind the people that this change is against
Islamic law,'' said Mahmoud al-Hobeshi, 43, a businessman, who sees
all-male parliamentary elections for next month as a referendum and
is trying to rally support for candidates who would try to block
the emir's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The religious issue, in fact, is open to interpretation. Sunni
Muslims, prevalent in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, cite a Koranic
injunction against women holding leadership positions. In Iran,
home of the Shiite branch, which has an influential minority in
Kuwait, women can vote and hold office.
</P>
<P>
   With its tradition of a raucous, elected Parliament and a record
of accomplishment for women, Kuwait comes closer than any other
Arab gulf monarchy to being free and democratic. Many people had
expected Jaber, the reclusive 73-year-old leader, to extend the
franchise to women after the Persian Gulf War of 1991, but years of
inaction had raised doubts in many circles about whether it would
ever happen.
</P>
<P>
   In an outpouring of delight, scores of Kuwaiti women flocked to
the emir's palace after his decision to thank him in person. At
least seven women have already announced plans to run for
Parliament in 2003, the first year they would be eligible. But even
in Kuwait, conservatism may yet act as a brake.
</P>
<P>
   In the windows of Villa Moda, a fashionable women's shop along
the Gulf Road, the mannequins hold aloft signs saying, ``Yes to
women's voting.'' But at campaign tents of candidates like Walid
Tubtabai, a strict Islamist, the answer has been a powerful no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do they write, no, no, no,'' said Youssef
al-Falakawi, a Kuwait University professor who has been polling
voters at the nightly gatherings, a staple of Kuwait's highly
personal political system, ``but they tell me, `You've got to tell
the people this is a bad idea.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait may be small, with a population of just 2 million, but
the emir's initiative is being closely watched as a test of Arab
willingness to move further toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, among many American politicians who prodded
Kuwait for years to take the step, welcomed the emir's edict with a
congratulatory letter. Arab and Islamic countries like Egypt, Iran,
Pakistan and Indonesia, where women already play prominent roles,
have also hailed the step.
</P>
<P>
   But from Kuwait's neighbors, including Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates, there has been mostly silence. Among Arab
gulf states, only Qatar has allowed women to vote, in a municipal
election in March. In Oman, two women, elected indirectly, sit on
the Consultative Council.
</P>
<P>
   With a directly elected Parliament, Kuwait was already several
steps ahead of the rest, and the idea that it should now go
further, by allowing women to take part, is likely to unsettle the
Saudis in particular, where women are still quietly crusading for
the right to drive.
</P>
<P>
   Already Kuwaiti women represent 31 percent of the work force;
the prominent positions held by women include rector of Kuwait
University, head of the Kuwait News Agency and ambassador to
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Most Kuwaitis, from both ends of the political spectrum, say
they expect the new Parliament to ratify at least the idea of
allowing women to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a majority of the 50 members to be elected on July 3
turn out to be opposed to the idea, the government would have
insurance because under the Kuwaiti system, another dozen or so
members of the royally appointed Cabinet would also be allowed to
take part in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   To reject the edict outright would also be an extraordinary act
of defiance against the emir, who has remained in the background of
Kuwaiti politics but whose family has ruled Kuwait for more than
200 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs that a new Parliament may be willing to
go along with only a half-measure, with members trying to draw the
line at allowing women to hold office. Most Islamist candidates
strongly oppose the idea of women holding office, as do most
candidates from Kuwait's powerful rural tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any problem with giving women the vote, but for a
woman to be a member of Parliament, this is refused,'' said Falih
al-Azab, 34, a police investigator, as he sat among 2,000 other men
on Astroturf and rugs at an outdoor rally for opposition
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment worries women like Fatima al-Abdali, who has
declared herself a candidate in 2003. ``Halfway is not enough,''
said Ms. Abdali, a 40-year-old environmental engineer who has spent
the last 10 years campaigning for a woman's right not only to vote
but also to hold office.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, Kuwait's elections are held in October, when the
evenings are pleasantly balmy. This election is a rare departure,
brought on by the government's abrupt dismissal in early May of
what it denounced as a do-nothing Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   With daytime temperatures routinely in excess of 115 degrees,
and evening temperatures still in the high 90s, the nightly
politicking now takes place in a kind of perpetual sauna, in which
cold water and lemon juice, not the usual coffee and sticky sweets,
are the favored repast.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the biggest political battles in Kuwait have
been fought over what critics have cast as litmus tests of Islamic
faith: the mixing of the sexes at Kuwait University and the
distribution of un-Islamic books and misprinted copies of the
Koran. To most Kuwaitis, the issues are peripheral, but the effect
of the fights has been a political stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   With the focus now shifted to women's rights, the government has
plunged deliberately into a politically hot issue, one that neither
it nor its allies in Parliament had previously been willing to take
on for themselves, for what may well have been sound political
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kuwaiti conservatives are going to vote now for people who
will not let the ladies vote,'' said Duwaij al-Shammery, a
prominent Islamist whose regular Saturday night open house has
become a setting for even more spirited political talk.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Kuwaitis say they welcome the emir's unexpected
boldness, seeing it as a welcome change from the years of passivity
that followed the Gulf War. They say it reflects not only the
emir's frustration at the legislative standoff, but a decision to
sideline, at least for now, the crown prince and prime minister,
Sheik Saad al-Abdullah, who is the emir's brother and has a
reputation for indecisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   According to diplomats and prominent Kuwaitis, the government is
now effectively run by the deputy prime minister, Sheik Sabah
al-Ahmed al-Jaber al-Sabah, a cousin from the emir's branch of the
family. Sabah, who is also foreign minister, had led a committee
that recommended voting rights for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was coming,'' said Ahmad E. Bishara, a leading Kuwaiti
liberal. ``Kuwaiti women had achieved, de facto, everything there
was to achieve in the professional world. But this was the final
wall they had to cross, and the fact that they have had to wait so
long has been frustrating.''

   Ancient Egypt Still Thrives
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one years after New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art
created a sensation with its ``Treasures of Tutankhamen'' _ a
blockbuster exhibition that set the Met's all-time attendance
record, with more than 1.2 million visitors _ the museum is bracing
for a repeat performance. ``Egyptian Art in the Age of the
Pyramids,'' a landmark show that has been four years in the making,
opens Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Met isn't the only museum capitalizing on the fascination
with Egyptian art. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Va., have also scheduled
Egyptian shows. But the Met, which has always had exceptionally
rich Egyptian holdings as well as an exhibition program devoted to
the subject, is considered the leader in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit by the Met, the Reunion des Musees Nationaux in
Paris and the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto will include about
230 works compiled from private collections and 30 museums
worldwide. Many have not been seen publicly for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fantastic exhibition that marks a seminal moment, the
start of it all,'' said Met director Philippe de Montebello.
``Everything we know about Egypt began here.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is on view through July 12 at the Grand Palais in
Paris, where it has been highly praised by art critics and
particularly well attended.
</P>
<P>
   The show explores the formative time of ancient Egyptian
culture, the Old Kingdom period between about 2650 and 2150 B.C.,
when artists working in all mediums created images that have come
to define Egyptian art.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting new scholarship about dating some objects, exhibition
will include examples of mediums including wood, stone, precious
metals, paintings, reliefs and statuary intended for temples and
tombs.
</P>
<P>
   The Met's installation will include a group of ``reserve
heads,'' three-dimensional portraits excavated from the tombs of
high officials who served King Khufu, the builder of the largest of
the Great Pyramids at Giza. Only 32 of these carvings are known to
exist, and 4 will be on view.
</P>
<P>
   The show will also include a monumental seated statue
representing Khufu's relative Hemiunu, who is thought to be the
architect of one of the Great Pyramids at Giza; a painted stele
depicting Prince Wepemnofret, who was the overseer of the royal
scribes, and a group of heads representing King Khafre, builder of
the second Great Pyramid at Giza.
</P>
<P>
   The show closes at the Met on Jan. 9 and travels to the Royal
Ontario Museum in Toronto, where it will be from Feb. 12 to May 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Met is lending about 16 objects from its collection to
``Pharaohs of the Sun: Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Tutankhamen,'' opening
at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston on Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The show includes 250 pieces _ sculpture, reliefs, ceramics,
jewelry, clothing, tools and furniture _ from the Boston museum's
collection as well as from 35 museums and private collections
around the world. It runs through Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit then moves to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,
the Art Institute of Chicago and the Rijksmuseum Leiden in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   A third exhibition, ``Splendors of Egypt,'' at the Virginia
Museum of Fine Art through Nov. 28, includes more than 200 works
from 5,000 years ago, compiled from the Pelizaeus Museum in
Hildesheim, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   A Home Run
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Whitney Museum of American Art redefined its
collecting mission 20 years ago, focusing exclusively on
20th-century art and particularly on the work of living Americans.
Yet it still owns a few outstanding examples of folk art and
19th-century paintings.
</P>
<P>
   In January at Sotheby's it sold a group of 23 folk-art paintings
given to the museum in the late 1960s by Edgar William Garbisch and
his wife, Bernice Chrysler Garbisch. But some works that do not fit
the museum's mission remain. One is the sculpture ``Baseball
Player,'' by Samuel Robb, which depicts a mustachioed figure with a
baseball bat resting on his shoulder. The Whitney received it from
the Haffenreffer Collection in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an icon of American folk art, and it was important to me
that it end up in a museum,'' said Whitney director Maxwell
Anderson. So he called Gerard Wertkin, director of the Museum of
American Folk Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max knew we were in the middle of building our collection in
anticipation of our new building,'' Wertkin said. ``We knew the
`Baseball Player' well. It had been in a show in 1986, organized by
us, that was at the IBM Gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   But because the Museum of American Folk Art is busy raising $30
million for its new building, at 45-47 W. 53rd St. in Manhattan, it
wasn't a good time to try to buy the sculpture, which experts value
at between $300,000 and $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wertkin approached William and Mildred Gladstone, collectors of
baseball art and major supporters of the folk-art museum. They
bought the piece from the Whitney for an undisclosed sum and will
let the Museum of American Folk Art show it whenever it likes. The
Gladstones keep the sculpture when it is not on view. Ultimately,
it will go into the museum's collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those arrangements where everyone benefits,''
Wertkin said. ``The Gladstones, the museum and the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   Richard Koshalek, who has been director of the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Los Angeles for 19 years, has been named the
president of the Arts Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif.
He succeeds David R. Brown, who had run the school since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Koshalek said he expected a major expansion. ``My goal is to
make the school a center of international dialogue for the arts and
design,'' he said.

   &UR; THE NEW MATINEE IDOL IS KING-SIZE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Brian Dennehy &LR; , who won a Tony last week for his performance in
the current New York production of ``Death of a Salesman,'' is
Manhattan's unlikely new sex symbol, reports the New York Observer.
Sixty-year-old Dennehy, who the Observer says ``could eat  &UR; Dustin
Hoffman  &LR; for breakfast,'' appeals to women of a certain age, but
women younger than that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe his appeal, one fan, who had seen ``Salesman''
three times, said, ``I would characterize it as steam heat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about f_ time,'' Dennehy's agent,  &UR; Susan Smith &LR; , told the
weekly. ``We've got this idea of a matinee idol all ass-backwards.
It's been these 12-year-old boys with no brains in their heads who
emote nothing. Brian is that old-fashioned sense of what a man
is.''

   The BBC says that Italian newspapers report _ we're two tongues
away from the sole of this matter _ that  &UR; Daniel &LR; 
 &UR; Day-Lewis &LR;  is working as a shoemaker's apprentice in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   Day-Lewis is said to be apprenticed to  &UR; Stefano Bemer  &LR; in the
art of making shoes, which should call to mind using the finest
leather and other materials _ oh, grosgrain, velvet, satin _ to
create fabulous footwear, quite a different image from replacing
the Vibram soles on your worn hiking boots.
</P>

   All this is happening in Florence, where the actor lives with

   &UR; _ George Stephanopoulos &LR;  is the new anchor of ABC's ``World
News Now,'' which airs after midnight, but media critic  &UR; Marvin &LR; 
 &UR; Kalb &LR;  told the Washington Post it's a terrible idea. ``You're not a
journalist simply because you're a star,'' he said. ``I find all of
this profoundly upsetting, but certainly consistent with the trend
in television news.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Mancow Muller &LR; , the disc jockey who left San Francisco after
a stunt on the Bay Bridge resulted in hours of commuting delays and
multiple lawsuits, is being sued for $110 million by the wife of a
rival in Chicago, where he's star of a morning show.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Janet Dahl &LR; , whose husband,  &UR; Steve &LR; , presides over a show
that's on at the same time as Muller's, claims that Muller defamed
her, invaded her privacy and intentionally inflicted emotional
distress by ``repeatedly and falsely (referring) to (her) as
engaging in adultery, fornication and sexual promiscuity in the
vilest of terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Muller said recently, when rumors of the suit were rampant, that
Dahl, who often appeared on her husband's show, is a public figure
and thus is harder to legally defame.
</P>
<P>
   _ MSNBC reports that &UR; Dan Quayle &LR;  uses M.A.C. cosmetics to get
ready for public appearances, a revelation that puffs the chest of
 &UR; John Demsey &LR; , president of the company. ``Isn't this country
wonderful,'' he asked, ``where  &UR; RuPaul &LR;  and Dan Quayle both use
M.A.C. cosmetics?''

PRACTICAL VIEW SUITS THE REVOLUTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ The Revolution are not compiling many points,
either for style or in the Major League Soccer standings. But they
are establishing an identity as pragmatists.
</P>
<P>
   Aesthetic values are out, but so also are the lengthy losing
spells that marked the team in 1997 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the primary concern of player-coach Walter
Zenga as the Revolution prepare for a third match in seven days at
Tampa Bay Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, we have 20 players now,'' Zenga said after the
Revolution tied Columbus, 1-1, then lost the shootout Wednesday
night. ``When we started the season, six or eight players were
always out and we had to work every week with 13 or 14 players.
Now, we have good choices on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three games this week, and it was very hot at Sunday's
game, so it is better for some players to rest. But now we can have
a rotation of players.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga left midfielders Paulo Dos Santos, Edwin Gorter, Jair, and
Kris Kelderman out of the lineup against Columbus. They traveled
with the team, as Zenga brought the entire roster on a trip that
continued to Tampa Thursday. But the Revolution went with a direct
style of play against the Crew, and most of the available
substitutes were likely to only redouble effort rather than help
control the pace of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Zenga and assistant coach Giuseppe Galderisi are only
confirming a style that seems to fit the predilections of most of
the Revolution players. There was little attempt at subtlety with
John Harkes directing the midfield. Harkes is the most direct of
midfielders, and most of the Revolution seemed comfortable with his
methods.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Harkes and Joe-Max Moore provided some excellent
opportunities for Jamar Beasley as the Revolution nearly pulled off
an upset. Instead of collapsing near the end of the contest, as
they often have in compiling a 3-12 record against the Crew, the
Revolution assumed the role of the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   This was a sign of changing disposition of the Revolution, who
have endured MLS-record nine-game losing streaks the last two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy about the personality of the team,'' Zenga said.
``It's not easy to change a team's mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining possession still does not seem to be a Revolution
priority, so the team often must resort to chasing the game, then
attempting to strike quickly. If Beasley can continue to improve,
this style could be effective at times.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley, 19, had three excellent scoring chances after replacing
Giovanni Savarese in the 58th minute. Beasley botched the first and
third of those opportunities, but on the second one he carried the
ball into the penalty area, protected it, and fired an excellent
shot just wide of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley has now played 10 MLS games without scoring, indicating
he is not a pure goal-scorer in the mold of, say, Savarese, who
converted for the Revolution against Columbus. But Beasley has the
ability to create chances, especially as a substitute, even when
the Revolution offense is struggling.

   The New York Times plans 2{ pages of Kosovo coverage:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Pristina) _ As Yugoslav forces completed their
withdrawal from the south of Kosovo, the NATO-led peacekeeping
forces have been slow to move into the west of the province,
creating a vacuum of authority and the mass reverse exodus of Serb
civilians fearing revenge from the Kosovo Liberation Army. But
after the Bishop of Rasca and Prizren fled the city for his safety
on Wednesday, despite the presence of German troops, NATO and
United Nations officials today moved into higher gear to try to
contain the damage to their reputation for impartiality. By Steven
Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DIPLO (Helsinki, Finland) _ Secretaries Albright and
Cohen continue talks with their Russian counterparts trying to
agree on a Russian peackeeping role in Kosovo. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CLINTON (Cologne, Germany) _ Still trying to sort out the
untidy aftermath of the Kosovo war, President Clinton suggests that
the indictment of Slobodan Milosevic by the war crimes tribunal
would serve to isolate Serbia on the international stage but would
not immediately affect Mr. Milosevic's personal position in
Belgrade. He also urged patience on what the ultimate outcome of
Mr. Milosevic's indictment would be. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-GRAVES (Qysky) _ In a little over two hours of wandering
in three small villages near the city of Pec, it became clear that
anyone you asked could point you to graves or places where Kosovo's
Albanian civilians had been killed by Serbs. The accounts in this
tiny corner of Kosovo, emerging as Kosovo Albanians return to their
homes and as journalists and human rights workers begin to range
through the shattered province, suggest that the death toll and the
carnage may be even greater than previously known. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CHINA (Beijing) _ China calls ``unconvincing'' the
explanation of the NATO bombing of its emabssy in Belgrade offered
during a visit here by Thomas Pickering, the undersecretary of
state. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Vermitca) _ Aid workers put up two big signs
with red skulls at the border here today, and they are thinking
about showing a videotape of a cow exploding in a mine field. But
nothing, it seems, can dam the flow of Kosovar refugees: Ignoring
all dangers, more than 13,000 refugees today squeezed through the
crowded crossing point here on the way, finally, home. By Ian
Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERBS (Podujevo) _ A jumbled line of tractors, horse
carts and broken-down tanks stretched for nearly six miles into
Serbia from Kosovo today, bringing thousands more displaced Serbs
and a potentially troublesome burden for the Belgrade government.
By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    THOUSANDS OF PANICKED SERBS FLEE AFTER A WAVE OF KLA
KIDNAPPINGS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    Optional trim at 1,000 
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia Panicked by a wave of about 10 kidnappings
aimed at prominent Serb families, at least 4,000 ethnic Serbs on
Thursday fled the American occupation zone of Kosovo in a convoy
under NATO protection.
</P>
<P>
   For 90 minutes, a ragtag column of about 1,000 cars and farm
wagons choked the road north to Serbia from this predominantly
Albanian city of some 100,000 people that has largely escaped the
ravages of the war.
</P>
<P>
   A heavily armed assault team of American peacekeepers rescued
one elderly Serbian kidnap victim when they burst into a military
barracks that the Kosovo Liberation Army had recently taken over as
its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   About six other Serb civilians were also released, some after
agreeing to give their kidnappers weapons that they had hidden in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, at least two kidnap victims had not been found.
One was the 15-year-old sister of a Serb militiaman allegedly
associated with the Black Hand paramilitary organization blamed
with terrorizing Albanians before and during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of kidnappings underscored the difficulty NATO
peacekeepers face in trying to control revenge-minded KLA soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community allowed this to happen,'' raged
computer programmer Marjan Milenkovic, 40, a Serb with lifetime
roots in Urosevac who was preparing to leave. ``I personally
expected to have peace when the military forces of NATO entered
Kosovo, but it happened differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Tomislav Simic, an ethnic Serb, blamed the
kidnappings on undisciplined factions of the KLA eager to seize the
Serbs' stocks of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Surprised by the speed and ferocity of the backlash by ethnic
Albanian factions against local Serbs, the U.S. Army first sent
loudspeaker vehicles into the city streets late Wednesday to appeal
all night for the release of at least a half-dozen reported Serb
kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning Thursday, a crowd of more than 1,000 worried Serbs
gathered with their cars in the city square to await a NATO convoy
to the Serbian border. Around 11 a.m., their worry turned to anger
and panic when word spread that KLA kidnappers had just seized the
21-year-old son of the chief manager of the town's steel pipe
factory.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Serbs then led a correspondent three blocks past the
town's Serbian Orthodox Church to the factory owner's white Audi.
There, the kidnap victim's mother, Danica Kotorcevic, was weeping.
``Five men with guns came and took my son as we were preparing to
join the convoy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As she and her two other sons were giving their account of the
kidnapping, an ethnic Albanian wearing black pants and a straw hat
appeared at a street corner thirty yards away. He could be seen
handing what turned out to be a small hand-written ransom note to
one of the Kotorcevic sons.
</P>
<P>
   Written in Serbian, it enumerated a small arsenal of weaponry _
an automatic rifle, two pistols plus ammunition. ``Just give us
these guns,'' the note said. ``When you give us the guns, your son
will come back in five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, reports of the kidnapping had reached the American
peacekeepers stationed in the city square and a detachment of about
20 U.S. paratroopers rushed up to the victim's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Told what had happened, the paratroopers double-timed around the
corner. They grabbed the man who delivered the kidnap note and an
alleged accomplice, throwing both on the ground and confiscating
pistols from each.
</P>
<P>
   The two ethnic Albanians claimed they didn't know how to find
Mitchko Kotorcevic, the kidnap victim. But then, 15 minutes later,
Mitchko was freed and rejoined his family amid shouts of delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was freed because my mother turned over to the KLA guys one
Kalashnikov (rifle) and promised them one pistol also,'' Mitchko
explained.
</P>
<P>
   As the Kotorcevic family and thousands of other Serbs were
starting their car engines to leave for Serbia, the ranking U.S.
Army commander in Urosevac, Lt. Col. Joe Anderson of the 82d
Airborne Division, met at town hall with the deputy mayor, an
ethnic Serb, and two mid-level commanders of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Chastising the KLA commanders for an overnight surge of
robberies and kidnappings allegedly committed by those with KLA
ties, Anderson said that in two hours American peacekeepers would
begin a sweep of KLA-controlled offices in search of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will start going through buildings,'' Anderson said. ``And
we will force you to surrender all arms or apprehend those who do
not do so.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-afternoon, four U.S. Army armored Humvees topped with
50-caliber machine-guns rolled up in front of the former Serbian
Army barracks that the KLA had seized for a headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 paratroopers of the 82d Airborne Division and about a
dozen Army ``psy-ops'' specialists took up positions in front of
the handful of KLA guards holding the front door of the
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Given permission to enter, the paratroopers burst in and began
searching room to room. They confiscated at least six Kalashnikovs
and an assortment of World War II-vintage rifles, pistols and
ammunition. Some of the weaponry was found hidden under a KLA
soldier's mattress.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a U.S. Army captain was seen running out to the street
to send a top-priority radio message to the headquarters of the
American occupation zone. ``They've kidnapped someone,'' he yelled
to another soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the barracks building, two Army sergeants opened the door
of a closet and found an ethnic Serb in his mid-sixties, severely
beaten and with his hands trussed behind his back and tied to a
pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat him up and broke some ribs,'' said Sgt. Raymond
Varsel, 27, of Fayetteville, N.C., one of two soldiers from an Army
unit who found and freed the unnamed victim. ``He told us the KLA
were interrogating him for being a war criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten KLA soldiers, found inside the headquarters building, were
forced to lie face down on the floor and to give up their weapons
while Army medics gave the kidnap victim first aid.
</P>
<P>

   Tension between the KLA and American soldiers rose further when
a U.S. soldier noticed that one of the KLA soldiers had concealed a
hand grenade.
</P>
<P>
   When the KLA soldier appeared to be reaching for it, the
American soldier yelled ``grenade!'' The more than 30 soldiers,
three U.S. Army translators and two news correspondents in the room
scrambled for cover.
</P>
<P>
   The shouted ``grenade'' warning occurred minutes after the
commander of the U.S. occupation forces, Army Brig. Gen. John
Craddock, had entered the headquarters building to meet with a top
KLA official. Craddock, who was standing within close range of the
grenade, was hustled to safety by his security guards.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA soldier was disarmed, shoved to the pavement outside,
and handcuffed while one U.S. soldier put a boot to his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   When night fell Thursday, about 500 more Serbs and members of
the pro-Serb minority of Gypsies took refuge overnight under
protection of the 82d Airborne Division in the municipal building.
</P>
<P>
   The stranded Serbs begged Army peacekeepers to help them leave
for Serbia on Friday. Anderson, the airborne division's commander
on the scene, asked KLA representatives to help arrange so that any
Serbs wanting to leave the city could ride to the Serbian border on
Urosevac municipal buses.

 &HT;    On a day for fathers, sons have their special memories
 &HT;    EMBARGOED for Sunday, June 20
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To showcase their dad's colorful character, our
daughters would have chosen a dramatic family moment.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the time he scoffed at our warnings _ and those of
firefighters the world over _ not to burn a Christmas tree in the
fireplace, or the night he helped a rancher deliver a calf by
Caesarean section, or the Christmas Eve he nailed a brass plaque to
the living room mantle to memorialize ``Baby Doe,'' the family's
black Labrador, hit by a car.
</P>
<P>
   But sons and their fathers are different. Maybe it's because
dads call on sons more to help ``fix'' things _ cars, stereos,
mowers, whatever. What John Jr. remembered as evidence of his dad's
unique qualities was the knotted fishing line.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trivial ``fix it'' incident my son shared as part of a
toast to his dad at a party given by friends when we moved from
Colorado back to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr. had stopped by home with his date on the way to a
movie. It was during the three years my husband John and I were
commuting. I was working in Atlanta and he was practicing medicine
in Denver. John Jr. had just returned from a year in Europe after
college, and he was ``batching it'' with his dad for a while.
</P>
<P>
   As our son recalled the story, it was a Saturday afternoon and
my husband was fresh from a fishing trip on the North Platte River.
Before putting away his gear, he decided to untangle a line that
any reasonable person would have tossed. He asked John Jr. to hold
one end, twisting it this way and that, then told him to help
stretch the tangled mess out across the living room floor. My son
and his girlfriend escaped to the movie only after contributing
tediously to the maddening effort _ leaving my husband totally
absorbed in untying multiple knots, one by one.
</P>
<P>
   When John Jr. returned, about three hours later, his father
hadn't budged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, my dad could have bought a new fishing line at the tackle
store or the hardware 15 minutes from home for a few bucks,'' John
Jr. recounted with a chuckle. ``But he didn't. And you know what I
learned from that?''
</P>
<P>
   My oldest daughter and I rolled our eyes. That his father was
stubborn as a mule? Frugal to a fault? Incapable of throwing
anything away? Able to ruin a great outing by obsessing over a
stupid fishing line?
</P>
<P>
   ``That details are important,'' my son declared. ``That details
are very important if you want to succeed in life.''
</P>
<P>
   The story made me think about the things my husband absorbed
from his father. They relate to the values parents convey
unknowingly _ a scary thought for dads and moms.
</P>
<P>
   For John, a surgeon, details are everything. For my
father-in-law, a farmer and a military man, honoring the land, the
living and the dead were primary. Those values were ingrained in
his children. To this day, John is a master at making squash mounds
in the vegetable garden. And he reads every war story he can get
his hands on.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a columnist for the local paper in Clayton, where my
late father-in-law farmed, wrote about passing the Ezzard farm
several years ago in a funeral procession. She looked across the
field and saw a man climb down from his tractor, take off his hat
and bow his head. Col. Ezzard had stopped plowing until the
procession moved past.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of sons and dads abound, like those in our family. Some
are captured in photos, some in family lore, and some in memories
that surface only on Father's Day.

GORE FURTHER DEFINES HIMSELF AS A CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK, N.Y._ Vice President Al Gore sought Thursday to bask
in the Clinton administration's years of prosperity while insisting
that the country needs ``a brand new agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of his 2000 presidential campaign, Gore seemed
less interested in distancing himself from President Clinton, as he
did in small ways on Wednesday, than in using his experience as
Clinton's second-in-command to promote his own vision of where the
nation should be in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, campaigning in Manchester, N.H., Gore called for
tax cuts for businesses that invest in high-tech research and said
he would ``invest aggressively'' to create information-age jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to contrast himself with Republican presidential
frontrunner George W. Bush, who has often spoken in generalities,
Gore said, ``I'm going to be talking about my economic ideas in
real specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of his program to spur job growth in the next century was a
restatement of themes he has favored as vice president: continuing
a strong economy, keeping budgets balanced and making
``revolutionary improvements'' in public education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore talked about hooking classrooms up to the Internet _
something he has spearheaded in the Clinton administration _ and
giving tax incentives to workers who set up savings accounts to
help pay for job training.
</P>
<P>
   On Air Force Two, flying between Manchester and New York, Gore
told reporters that the issues of 2001 _ the year the next
president will be inaugurated _ are different from those in 1992
when he first ran with Clinton. A key issue then was the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But now ``our country needs a brand new agenda for dramatic
changes in order to prepare for this brand new era,'' Gore said.
``That's what I represent: new priorities, a new approach while
continuing the prosperity'' that has occurred in the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was only natural that he would want to differentiate
himself from Clinton. ``Any two people are different and I don't
think the American people find that to be a mystery,'' Gore said.
``Certainly the president and I are different.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he has spent the last six years ``trying to help
(Clinton) be the best president he can possibly be.'' Now, however,
Gore said he is ``focused on presenting an agenda for change for
our country as I campaign in my own right, and I'm enjoying it
tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore's campaign manager Tony Coelho insisted that in
distinguishing himself from Clinton, Gore is not seeking to divorce
himself from the president,
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton understands that Al Gore needs to go out and say
who he is,'' Coelho said. ``It's a step we need to take to identify
who this guy is, and Bill Clinton has no problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho dismissed a suggestion that Gore was turning his back on
Clinton by mentioning ``my own values of faith and family'' in his
speeches Wednesday as well as earlier criticizing Clinton's
behavior in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore talked about his disappointment with the president,
but the president talked about his disappointment with himself,''
Coelho said. ``There's not a lot of difference there.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in New York, standing in front of historic Federal Hall in
the city's financial district, Gore offered more campaign pledges
including pre-schooling for every child, improved teacher quality,
Medicare coverage of senior citizens' prescription drugs, and
``more cops walking the beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a theme he offered Wednesday when he officially
announced his candidacy, Gore said national prosperity and people's
material possessions alone are not the barometer of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we will ultimately be judged by whether we have
strengthened or weakened the families that are the hope and soul of
America,'' he said. ``I am not satisfied. Indeed, I am restless. I
believe we can do better. I believe we must build on our success,
not rest on it.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did Wednesday, Gore found a strong Republican
counterattack. He was greeted Thursday morning in New Hampshire by
a full page newspaper ad paid for by the Republican National
Committee accusing the vice president, a staunch environmentalist,
of wanting ``to eliminate the automobile as we know it.'' The ad
also asked why, after the House voted to impeach Clinton last year,
Gore called him ``one of our greatest presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS activists, as they did Wednesday, dogged his steps,
accusing him of not doing enough to get anti-AIDS medicines to poor
people overseas. In Manchester, they unfurled a banner proclaiming
``AIDS drugs for Africa'' behind the podium where Gore was
speaking. Four protesters were escorted out by police as they
chanted ``Gore's greed kills! Gore's greed kills!''
</P>
<P>
   Here in New York, AIDS activists blew whistles and chanted
similar slogans as Gore was speaking. As he did Wednesday, he said
he was grateful for the First Amendment that guarantees free
speech. He also called for applause for ``those who are exercising
their First Amendment rights.'' Amid the cheers, six demonstrators
were led away by police.

   KOSOVO-KLA _ UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia _ The estimated 4,000 Serbs in
this town were fleeing the American Zone in Kosovo Thursday after
Kosovo Liberation Army rebels began kidnapping members of prominent
Serb families. Hundreds of heavily-armed U.S. 82nd Airborne
Division soldiers rushed to the town and began the dangerous job of
going from one KLA-controlled building to another in an attempt to
locate and release kidnap victims. In one instance, the U.S. forces
found KLA soldiers beating an elderly Serb man who was bound and
helpless. In another case, U.S. soldiers pounced on a KLA rebel who
they feared was about to toss a hand grenade near the American
commander of the American Zone. Thursday's dramatic events here
show the task American and other peacekeeping forces face in trying
to control revenge-minded KLA guerrillas. (Albright, Cox News

baroque cupolas' graceful arches, landing on a cracked floor at the
state university of Puebla. Stunned by the death of 17 people in
the region _ a toll that was expected to rise _ residents of this

NEW THEORY ON EINSTEIN BRAIN MEETS SKEPTICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What about Einstein's brain made him a genius?
</P>
<P>
   In a study in the latest medical journal Lancet, a Canadian
neuroscientist and her colleagues say they have detected
significant differences in the structure of Einstein's brain that
might help account for his superior intellect, supporting findings
from a 1985 study by California researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Einstein died in 1955 from a ruptured abdominal
aneurysm, and his brain taken out during an autopsy by pathologist
Thomas Harvey, it has been the subject of fascination. Einstein's
family did not give permission for his brain to be excised at the
time, and only later consented.
</P>
<P>
   At least three groups of researchers have analyzed Einstein's
brain and found differences, including the 1985 California study, a
1996 Alabama study and the new Lancet study, written by
neuroscientist Sandra Witelson, Harvey, and a colleague.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest analysis, the researchers report that a part of
Einstein's brain _ the inferior parietal region, long considered
the seat of mathematical thought and visual and spatial ability _
was 15 percent wider when compared with the brains of people with
normal intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein's brain was also unique for not having a groove, called
a sulcus, that normally runs through this part of the brain. The
researchers theorize that that absence of a groove may have allowed
more neurons _ the brain cells that do the thinking _ to establish
connections between each other.
</P>
<P>
   But other scientists were critical of these findings, deploring
the circumstances of the brain being taken out without the family's
permission nearly 45 years ago, and questioning the effect of the
chemicals the tissue has been steeped in all this time. One even
called the examination of Einstein's brain ``macabre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A case could be made that it was stolen, and it caused anguish
to the family that this was done,'' said Gerald Holton, a Harvard
professor of physics and the history of science, who has written
several books about Einstein and his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are medically informed might say that there is some
merit in doing it. I myself could not say that. I just maintain my
suspicion,'' said Holton, adding that to him, the pursuit is ``a
macabre business.''
</P>
<P>
   The study in Lancet is just the latest example of mankind's
fascination with trying to understand the brain, particularly that
of Einstein and other exceptional people.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1800s, there was the ``science'' of phrenology, or the
attempt at understanding a person's character by examining bumps on
the skull. Today, there are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
positron emission tomography (PET) scans of living brains in
action, in the continued attempt to match brain structure with
function.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. Allan Hobson, a Harvard psychiatrist and
neurophysiologist who has also written about Einstein, raised
questions about these findings as well. ``We've been burned so many
times by strong claims of concrete correlation between area X and
symptom Y. It's phrenology revisited. `He's got a parietal bump,
therefore he's a genius.' I'd be very cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of the authors of the 1985 California paper,
neuroscientist Marian Diamond, said these latest findings support
what she and her colleagues found _ an unusually large number of
glial cells, which nourish the neurons that do the thinking _ in
the same inferior parietal region of Einstein's brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where we found our differences,'' said Diamond, who is
a professor at the University of California at Berkeley. She
co-authored the paper with her husband, Arnold B. Scheibel, a UCLA
professor of neurobiology and psychiatry, pathologist Harvey and
another colleague.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Canadian-led group found the significant
difference in both the left and right inferior parietal regions,
Diamond said her group found a statistically significant difference
in the glial cells only in the left side. Nonetheless, she said,
``it's saying essentially the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the researchers who have found the differences in
Einstein's brain say that does not prove why he was so much smarter
than everyone else, however. The Canadian-led group writes in the
Lancet that ``this report clearly does not resolve the
long-standing issue of the neuroanatomical substrate of
intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Harvard physics professor Holton, who is on the editorial
board of a Boston University project editing Einstein's papers,
``If you want to talk about the brain of Einstein, you ought to
talk about what went on in that brain, what historians of science
and scientists are interested in. On that, we have a great deal of
information. He published enormously.''

A GROOVY KIND OF LIFE  
 A FREE AGENT  
 SEEKING TOLERANCE 
</HEADLINE>

 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Four years ago, Jay Roach was a somewhat struggling
cinematographer and screenwriter who yearned to direct movies. His
wife, Susanna Hoffs, a singer, was close friends with Robin Ruzan,
the wife of comedian Mike Myers. Every few weeks the couples would
get together at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of discussions about everything from Mel Brooks
to Kafka,'' Roach recalled. ``We were both students of Joseph
Campbell, we talked about him a lot and the idea that storytelling
was a universal experience, that everyone is connected by the need
to tell stories. It got pretty heady. We also laughed our heads off
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers showed Roach his script for ``Austin Powers: International
Man of Mystery,'' and asked for his thoughts. Roach also began
suggesting possible directors. After several months of seeking a
director, Myers approached New Line Cinema, the producers, and
asked that Roach take over. Top executives were appalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it without telling me,'' Roach said. ``New Line said,
quite justifiably, `Who is this guy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Roach put together a reel of some of the projects he had worked
on, and perhaps more important, a separate reel of excerpts from
some 1960s films that was meant to convey what he called ``the kind
of exaggerated, overly composed, Pop Art style that evoked that
moment.'' The films included James Bond movies, ``Beyond the Valley
of the Dolls,'' ``In Like Flint'' and more obscure Italian and
French comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Roach recalled his final meeting with Robert Shaye, co-chairman
of New Line, who said, ``Nothing in your reel suggests you're funny
and can direct a comedy.'' Expecting this, Roach presented a
scene-by-scene breakdown, or storyboard, of the film, showed
way-out costume designs and performed scenes with Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the meeting Shaye was laughing,'' Roach said.
``He said, `OK, you have the job.'''
</P>
<P>
   Roach doesn't have to worry anymore about jobs; he is now one of
the hottest filmmakers in town. The success of the first Austin
Powers film, which was released in 1997, as well as the latest one,
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' still amazes him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredible act of blind faith on the part of Mike,''
Roach, 42, said. ``He put his whole career on the line for me. And
to New Line's credit, they trusted Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Roach's next film, ``Mystery, Alaska,'' written by David E.
Kelley, the creator of the television shows ``Ally McBeal'' and
``The Practice,'' is to be released by Disney in October. He has
been swamped with offers to direct other movies, being handed good
scripts and introduced to people he has always wanted to meet. He
is trying to savor the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Roach earned a master's degree in film production at the
University of Southern California. After making a short film that
was nominated for a student Academy Award, he directed a play at a
small theater in Hollywood; wrote the story for the film ``Blown
Away,'' which starred Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones, and was the
co-writer, co-producer and second-unit director of a futuristic
television film for Fox, ``Life Pod,'' an update of the Hitchcock
classic ``Lifeboat.''
</P>
<P>
   Roach said he knew last Friday night that the new Austin Powers
film was a hit when he went to a Los Angeles theater showing the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the 10:15,'' he said. ``People of all ages were
coming out of the theater. There were people dressed up like Austin
Powers, people shouting the lines. And when I went into the
theater, which was then packed with college kids, they were having
this great time. The audience was caught up in the pure fun of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `This is going to be good,''' Roach said.
``I went home and went to sleep for 12 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   A Free Agent
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Ron Shelton has never quite fit into a studio
mold. His films, like ``Bull Durham,'' ``White Men Can't Jump,''
``Cobb'' and ``Tin Cup,'' dealt with sports themes and studios were
often reluctant to make them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My films have always been one foot in and one foot out of the
studio,'' Shelton said. ``I've done very well making movies at
arm's length from studios. But in the last few years it's been
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   So Shelton formed his own company, Shanghai'd Films, with a
partner, Stephen Chin, a former Washington lawyer who has been
involved in producing independent movies. The new company's first
venture is ``Play It to the Bone,'' Shelton's new film, about
boxing, with Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas.
</P>
<P>
   Successful directors of studio films usually do not go the
independent route, but Shelton said he felt he had little choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an audience for the kinds of films I make,'' said
Shelton, a former minor-league baseball player. ``But, for me at
least, the studios don't know how to be a partner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios used to be in the moviemaking business, but now
they are part of giant corporations run by committees and
bureaucracies,'' he continued. ``It's simply very difficult to move
things along. I've had three pictures fall apart since `Tin Cup.'
They were on the verge of going, but studio budgets kept shifting,
and they took a very narrow view of casting. There are only about
three stars that everyone wants. It was all corporate politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Chin said independent films were far less expensive than studio
movies because of lower overhead and stars willing to work for
lower fees. Independence from a studio also gave Shelton almost
complete creative control.
</P>
<P>
   Chin and Shelton met only a few years ago. ``We'd have a drink
every now and then and we'd exchange war stories,'' Chin said. ``We
come from totally dissimilar backgrounds. I'm a short Chinese guy
and Ron's a big white athlete. I went to law school and did
financial training and Ron was in professional baseball. He was
studio and I came out of edgy independent films. But there was an
odd vibe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we both come from extremely religious, devout Baptist
families,'' he continued. ``Both of us pursued the arts after being
involved in other lines of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Beside Shelton's movies, the new company plans to release a few
other films each year costing anywhere from $14 million to $25
million each. The company will seek out studios to acquire its
movies for distribution. Disney is releasing the latest Shelton
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can provide the studio distribution system with the kind of
movie they need but don't make,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>

   Seeking Tolerance
</P>
<P>
   A Pakistani family in an industrial town in northern England.
The father is a hard-working taxi driver who has happily provided
his 20-something son with every Western trapping. But the youth
abruptly drops his English fiancee, sells his possessions and _ to
his father's puzzlement and amazement _ turns to Islamic
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it's a naughty film that deals with tolerance,''
said Rachel Griffiths , one of the stars of ``My Son the Fanatic,''
a modest film to be released by Miramax on June 25. ``It's about
how we use God's name to hate people, but it's also a very moving
story about the power of what people can experience when they
surrender their prejudices.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on a short story in The New Yorker by Hanif
Kureishi, who also wrote the screenplay. Kureishi's first film, in
1985, was ``My Beautiful Laundrette.'' The cast of the new film,
directed by Udayan Prasad, includes Om Puri, an acclaimed Indian
actor, who plays the taxi driver, and Ms. Griffiths, who was
nominated for an Academy Award for ``Hilary and Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current film, Ms. Griffiths plays a prostitute who,
against her better judgment, falls in love with the married taxi
driver.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Griffiths said that before filming began in northern
England, she met with some prostitutes to research her role and was
struck by their defiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They refused to see themselves the way society sees them,''
she said. ``These women also have a lot of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress said that at one point a hostile crowd was watching
the filming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear I was an actor, but I was dressed for the role,''
she said. ``People yelled things at me. They were fundamentalists.
There was a hatred there that I've never felt. They didn't think a
woman should have this freedom. They hated my autonomy, they hated
my way of life, they hated my power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt this kind of extraordinary hatred,'' Ms.
Griffiths continued.
</P>
<P>
   The actress is now in Hollywood to meet studio executives,
directors and producers. At home in Australia she is a well-known
stage and film star. In Hollywood she is relatively unknown.
</P>
<P>
   What has been the response so far?
</P>
<P>
   She laughed: ``I walk into the room and they fall at their feet
and say, `We thought you'd never come.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then she followed with, ``No, no. The general reaction is
really, `Rachel who?'''

SOBRIETY BRINGS A NEW FIRE ON THE ICE FOR OKSANA BAIUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They were only three years apart, but the contrast
between the two events could not have been more dramatic for Oksana
Baiul.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the 16-year-old figure skater from Ukraine won the gold
medal at the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. The sprite
with so much style and expressiveness on ice was the youngest woman
to win the gold since the immortal Sonja Henie in 1928 and she was
suddenly the toast of the sporting world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Baiul was in the headlines again, this time for driving
almost 100 mph and crashing her Mercedes into a grove of trees in
Connecticut, sustaining a concussion and also being charged for
driving under the influence of alcohol. Community service and an
alcohol class led to dismissal of the charge, but the troubled
Baiul seemed destined to become yet another young athlete who
burned out in the blaze of sudden fame, even with her 10-week stint
in alcohol rehab.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to a few weeks ago when Baiul was surprised by her
skating compatriots in the Champions on Ice tour, who rallied
around her to celebrate (without alcohol) the anniversary of her
first year of sobriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a nice thing for them to do,'' Baiul said this
week from Salt Lake City. ``I was drinking tea with lemon, my
favorite drink now, and having them all with me meant a lot. It
meant that I have their respect and that they love me and that I
feel like I'm a part of them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Champions on Ice rolls into Seattle on Saturday night, with its
usual complement of skating superstars, including Michelle Kwan,
Elvis Stojko, Surya Bonaly, Brian Boitano, Victor Petrenko, Nicole
Bobek and Todd Eldredge. This will be the last stop on the 45-city
summer tour of Champions on Ice, but one skater who will not be
glad to see it end is the rejuvenated Baiul.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, there will be a big sadness on Saturday,'' Baiul said.
``I love to be on tour with everybody, love to be on the road, love
to travel and I love to perform. I try to skate the best I can
every time I go on the ice. I face each performance as if it was my
last performance, which has been a trick of mine, and I try to do
everything I can to please those in the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a distinct sprightliness in the voice of Baiul, who has
lived in the United States for several years and speaks English
without hesitation. But long gone now is the diminutive figure that
so many people remember pulling
</P>
<P>
   off the upset win over Nancy Kerrigan at Lillehammer.
</P>
<P>
   Baiul has grown up. She is more than 6 inches taller and pounds
heavier than she was as a teen champion. Her good looks have turned
adult, as has her outlook, especially about her perilous fall.
</P>
<P>
   The self-discipline that helped her become a world champion at
such a young age is now helping her battle back from alcoholism to
what seems to her a much more normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had that before I won the gold medal,'' Baiul stressed.
``But after that, my head was spinning and everything was
different. Now I have a normal lifestyle _ I wish I could have done
that earlier. But, thank God, I only had three years of a
screwed-up life. Having two such different lifestyles were
definitely not good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Baiul has settled back into skating again, both in ice shows and
in competition, while she lives in Delaware with coach Natalia
Linichuk, a fellow gold medalist. Baiul has her own line of skating
attire and has penned two books, one about her life, another about
skating technique.
</P>
<P>
   What the skater longs for, surprisingly, is the chance to
compete in the Olympics again, she hopes in the 2002 games in Salt
Lake City. Her pro status precludes that under current rules, but
Baiul clings to the hope that Olympic figure skating will be
broadened to include professionals, as have many other Olympic
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Baiul does not expect to leave the limelight any time soon. Her
Olympic gold was followed by a TV movie, which dramatized her climb
to stardom against a host of personal setbacks _ her father who
left the family when she was 2, her mother who died of cancer when
she was 13, her later life with the family of her skating coach who
also left her when he moved to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Later came Baiul's bout with alcoholism, thoughts of suicide, or
at least quitting skating forever. But through it all, she has not
grown weary of being a celebrity whose ups and downs have taken
place under a public microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to hide anything from my public,'' Baiul
emphasized. ``I am a performer, and I am addicted to the public. It
truly is a form of addiction. I like to be in the public eye and
have been since I was 15, and I'm now 21. What I do not like to be
is a dishonest person. I like to tell the truth _ that's my
problem. My mouth is too loud, but I can't hide my feelings. What I
feel I have to say, I say.''

 &HT;    Historic lighthouse move more a dud
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUXTON, N.C. _ The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse has begun its
historic move, but nobody in Thursday's crowd could tell for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lighthouse is officially moved 4 inches,'' National Park
Service manager Dan McClarren told several hundred rain-soaked
onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled under umbrellas in the blustery afternoon, the crowd had
little choice but to take the park ranger's word for it.
</P>
<P>
   The initial move was so slow that not even the five officials
atop the 208-foot-tall beacon felt the move, powered by hydraulic
rams pushing the 4,800 tons of brick and granite.
</P>
<P>
   Some onlookers had waited since early morning on the stormy
eastern tip of North Carolina's Outer Banks, hoping to glimpse the
start of the federal government's $11.8 million rescue of the
black-and-white striped landmark from pounding Atlantic waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping they would give us more of a countdown,'' said
Peggy Granger, wearing a pale-green T-shirt emblazoned, ``I swear I
saw it move.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, she did not. But she said, ``It was worth it. It
was history.''
</P>
<P>
   Many left disappointed, but not altogether surprised that the
outset of the beacon's long-awaited journey would be such a visual
dud. Officials of the park service and the moving contractors had
warned that the initial move of a few inches would be nearly
impossible to see. And there was some dispute over just how far the
first push took the lighthouse. One of the movers said later that
it was actually 5 inches _ not 4.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation of the move proved more exciting for the crowd
gathered in a sandy parking lot 100 yards from the crews making
final preparations amid the grid of steel guiding the lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Three men joked they had arrived to help pull the rope that
would drag the tower. An elderly couple pondered whether they
should yell ``timber'' or ``lighthouse'' if it began to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it is not moving yet,'' park service volunteer Nancy
Giannotti repeated again and again to passersby.
</P>
<P>
   Mud-covered members of the work crew had given advance notice of
the move, but an unexpected crimp in a hydraulics hose delayed it.
</P>
<P>
   The rain fell so hard that some people took refuge in their
cars. They came out after a worker shouted, ``Any minute now.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial move of 5 inches _ or 4 _ was designed as a test of
the sophisticated hydraulics system that last week hoisted the
lighthouse 5 feet 4 inches above its sandy hole. Over the next
month, it will propel the beacon to its new foundation 2,900 feet
inland, supposedly a safe perch for the next hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday afternoon, the lighthouse had been moved an
estimated 9 feet 7 inches. The contractors said they were pleased
by the day's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did what it was supposed to do,'' said Joe Kakubik, project
manager for contractor International Chimney Corp. of Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The park service allowed the last lighthouse keeper's
granddaughter, Terry Jennette Ponton, a final trip up to the
iron-railed balcony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was flying,'' she said after her final look
across the rough gray sea, a view Unaka Benjamin Jennette had
promised his young granddaughter years ago would last forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather always said, `The ocean will never take her,'''
Ponton said. ```It will always be there.

MILOSEVIC SAFE FROM PROSECUTION IN SERBIA, CLINTON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, GERMANY _ President Clinton Thursday said that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic is probably safe from arrest for war
crimes in Kosovo as long as he remains in Serbia. He said NATO's
focus would be on getting the ``Kosovars back home to safety''
rather than hauling the indicted Serbian leader into court.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who arrived here Thursday for a weekend meeting with
the heads of the leading industrial nations and Russia, made the
comments during a joint appearance with French President Jacques
Chirac before leaving Paris, the second stop on a weeklong trip to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo will be high on the agenda when the leaders meet,
particularly the return of ethnic Albanians to Kosovo and
implementation of an aid plan to rebuild the bomb-damaged Serbian
province and southeastern Europe neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they hope to have resolved the confusion
over Russia's role in implementing the NATO-led peacekeeping force
by the time the summit opens here Friday, although negotiations
continued Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Defense Secretary William Cohen and
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, joined Thursday by
Secretary of State Madeline Albright, had resolved several sticking
points and were continuing to talk, despite some reports that
Russian officials had left the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton expressed optimism that the talks taking
place in Helsinki over Russia's role in the peacekeeping efforts _
after its forces took up position last week at the airport near
Kosovo's capital, Pristina, ahead of NATO troops _ would yield
satisfactory results for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major stumbling blocks is NATO's demand _ resisted by
Russia _ that all countries participating in peacekeeping in Kosovo
operate under a single NATO-led command. Another is Russia's desire
for its own geographic ``zone of responsibility'' within a section
of Kosovo. The United States opposes this, fearing it would amount
to partioning of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Paris, Clinton said he had been updated on the
talks. ``They have made pretty good progress,'' he said. ``I think
we'll bring this to a successful conclusion in the next little
while _ the next day or so I think we'll get it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the president was more specific. ``They have worked out
command and control, they have worked out arrangements for the
airport. But they still need to work out the sector,'' he said.
``Everybody will see it is a very elegant solution.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I don't know if they'll finish it today and then
take the weekend to announce it.'' And he said that what they will
have worked out ``is something that is satisfactory to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials said that Russian President Boris Yeltsin, whose
attendance on Sunday, the final day of the industrial leaders'
meeting, has been unconfirmed, was indeed planning to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Russia aside, Clinton said at the appearance with Chirac in
Paris, ``It's important that we not in any way mislead people about
what happens next,'' in Kosovo, adding that NATO's ``heaviest
responsibility'' was ensuring the safe return and automony of
refugees, and rebuilding the region.
</P>
<P>
   He said that if Milosevic, who has been indicted as a war
criminal by an international tribunal in the Netherlands, ``remains
inside the confines of Serbia, persumably he's beyond the reach of
the extradition powers of the other governments. But sometimes
these things take a good while to bear fruit. I think we'll just
have to wait and see how that develops.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I do not believe that the NATO allies can invade
Belgrade to try to deliver the indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Chirac, however, agreed that Belgrade should not
receive reconstruction aid as long as Milosevic remains in power.
``Development aid is one thing; humanitarian aid is a different
thing,'' Chirac said. He said that Serbs also were victims of
NATO's 78 days of bombing, ``Hence, humanitarian aid, yes;
development aid, economic aid, no.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Chirac and Socialist Prime Minster Lionel
Jospin on Kosovo, and a round of last-minute lobbying by phone
members of Congress to pass a proposal to require background checks
on gun show purchases, Clinton arrived here behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   With First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton flying on to Italy for a
few days, Clinton spent his last hours in Paris shopping and
sightseeing. His outing delighted shopkeepers and visiting
Americans, but aggravated Parisian motorists _ who saw their
traffic ensnarled by his motorcade. At several points,
white-helmeted paparrazzi on motorcycles weaved in and out of the
official line of cars traveling with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Tired and jetlagged when he arrived in Cologne, Clinton,
nonetheless went for a dinner of highly seasoned German-style beef,
with apple puree and dumplings, with a small group of White House
reporters. He held forth on variety of subjects _ movies, novels,
food and a board game called ``Upwards,'' he brought along and
often plays with the first lady, and which he described as a
five-level version of Scrabble.
</P>
<P>
   But asked about the first lady's possible run for the Senate in
New York, the president demurred, ``I really don't know if she's
going to run.''

COMPAQ COMPUTER LOSSES TO RESULT IN LAYOFFS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Stung by tough competition, plunging prices and its
own inefficiencies, Compaq Computer Corp. on Thursday said it will
lose money this quarter and launched a reorganization that will
result in layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq executives said they expect to post a loss for the
quarter ending June 30 of up to 15 cents a share. Wall Street
analysts had been projecting a profit of about 20 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-based computer maker will realign its core
businesses into three different groups _ combined enterprise and
services, business PCs and consumer _ and whack more than $2
billion in costs.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving those cuts will require layoffs. When that would
happen, and how many people would be let go, has not yet been
determined, said Michael Capellas, Compaq's acting chief operating
officer, during a conference call Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be the most extensive realignment of the
company since 1991,'' said Benjamin Rosen, Compaq's board chairman
and acting chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The pain will continue into the third quarter, when Compaq will
take a ``substantial'' charge because of the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent Compaq's stock on a roller coaster ride Thursday,
at one point dropping as much as 2 1/4 to as low as 20. It closed
at 22 9/16, up 5/16 on a volume of 36 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second quarter in a row in which Compaq has warned
analysts to dramatically lower their expectations. Compaq is
scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings July 28.
</P>
<P>
   In April, former Chief Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer said the
company would only make half the profit in the first quarter that
Wall Street was expecting. Less than two weeks later, Pfeiffer was
forced out of his job, and a slew of key executives since have
followed him out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Compaq has been caught flat-footed by changes in
the computer industry at a time when it is also trying to digest
its $9 billion acquisition of Digital Equipment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Computer prices are dropping quickly, and as a result
manufacturers' profit margins are getting slimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with efficient operations _ such as Dell Computer
Corp. of Round Rock, Texas _ are driving the changes. But Compaq is
having a hard time weathering this storm because its own internal
structures are too complex, Rosen acknowledged Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pricing pressures in the PC segment, inadequate revenue
growth, and a noncompetitive cost structure are the contributing
factors to our expected shortfall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to streamline, the company will move operations
that are now separate entities into each of the three new product
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, marketing currently its own division. But Compaq
will give the enterprise/services, PCs and consumer divisions their
own marketing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said each division will be responsible for its products
``from end to end'' _ from concept and design to delivery of the
finished goods. This should enable Compaq to respond more quickly
to market changes, as well as being able to get finished goods to
market quicker, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some operations, such as the global sales force, manufacturing
and other components, will remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   And Capellas stressed that the sales force will not change.
Customers will still deal with their current sale representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq will create a customer advocate division that will act as
a kind of ombudsman for its customers, as well as a group dedicated
to the company's online sales initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also will strive to sell more of its computers directly
to customers. Currently, most of its products are sold via a
network of resellers. The company announced last month that it was
cutting the number of those resellers from 40 down to 4.
</P>
<P>
   To further its direct sales, Compaq will open 17 call centers
around the world, and it will expand its Internet-based sales.
Capellas said the company expects to sell 25 percent of its
computers directly by the fourth quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new structure, Enrico Pesatori will head the combined
enterprise and services group. This group will sell the
high-dollar, high-powered products it got in the acquisitions of
Digital and Tandem Computer, as well as Compaq's own PC-based
servers. Services refers to everything from customer support to
running entire computer departments on behalf of big companies.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Winkler will continue to head up the PC products group,
responsible for desktop and portable personal computers for
business.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Blackmore was named senior vice president, sales and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Larson will remain as the chief of the consumer
division, which sells the Presario line of home PCs. Larson took
over earlier this year from Rod Schrock, who is now the president
of the AltaVista Co., a subsidiary built around the search engine
of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   During the conference Thursday, Rosen said Compaq still intends
to spin off AltaVista as a public company, but added: ``In the
world of the Internet, anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen also said that Compaq's search for a new chief executive
was going well, and that a new CEO should be announced ``in the
not-too-distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   Buried in the news of Compaq's expected loss and reorganization
was the fact that yet another top-level executive is leaving.
Andreas Barth, who was general manager of Europe, the Middle East
and Africa, is retiring effective June 30. He will be replaced by
Werner Koepf, who previously was a vice president responsible for
managing Compaq's business in 11 European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally said the moves should help Compaq overcome
its problems, but that a lot more needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   William Conroy, an analyst in Houston with Sanders Morris Mundy,
said Compaq needs to further streamline the buying process for its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq does not make this process straightforward'' because of
its reliance on resellers,`` he said. ''There's this problem for
the buyer of, `What can I buy and where can I buy it?'``
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Kumar, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in
Minneapolis, predicted June 8 that Compaq would post a loss for
this quarter. Kumar said Thursday that the company is hampered by
the complexity it took on when it acquired Digital, which was known
for its internal bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq was a company that was struggling; Digital was a
company that was struggling,'' he said. ``It was a marriage made in
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Neff, an analyst with Bear Stearns in New York, said
Compaq could follow the lead of Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Like Compaq, Apple was reeling from changes in the market but
was debt-free and had plenty of cash in the bank, Neff said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, returned to the company and
turned it around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped to simplify the model,'' Neff said. ``Compaq needs
to figure out a way to do that.''

 By JOYCE MAYNARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Next Tuesday, Sotheby's will auction 14 letters by J.D. Salinger
written to me when I was 18 years old.
 &HT;    When I first read these letters, and for many years after, I
believed they represented the heartfelt expressions of the most
tenderly devoted soul mate. Later I learned that I was one of many
teen-aged recipients of such letters.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, my choice to break a quarter-century-long silence
concerning my relationship with Salinger has unleashed accusations
of exploitation and betrayal made all the more outrageous, in the
eyes of my critics, because the one whose privacy I am charged with
violating is a man whose reclusiveness has become an American
legend.
 &HT;    The debate has raised questions about what constitutes invasion
of privacy and exploitation, alleged victimization versus personal
responsibility. It speaks to the heart of an issue every writer I
know struggles with: How much of my story do I have a right to
tell? Above all, it speaks to the experience of countless young
girls and women drawn into relationships with vastly more powerful
older men, the obligation placed upon these women to protect those
men's secrets, and the enduring consequences.
 &HT;    With the sale of Salinger's letters, I mean to lay to rest an
event that has haunted me all my adult life. Before I close this
chapter, though, I want to explain my actions.
 &HT;    Twenty seven years later, I can still bring myself back to the
moment in the spring of 1972 when I opened and read that first
letter J.D. Salinger wrote to me. I was a freshman at Yale and had
received hundreds of pieces of mail in response to an article I had
just published in The New York Times Magazine.
 &HT;    In a voice so distinct and funny and wise that I could almost
hear him talking, the author expressed the view that he and I were
kindred spirits.
 &HT;    That idea struck at my heart's core. Like so many readers of
``Catcher in the Rye'' I felt this man understood me as nobody ever
had. We began to correspond.
 &HT;    For the remainder of that semester, everything else fell away. I
made Jerry my religion, the only one I ever had. I withdrew from
Yale and moved in with him, leaving no forwarding address. I
believed _ despite he 35 years separating our ages _ that we'd be
together always.
 &HT;    From the moment the relationship took on a physical reality away
from the page, it began to fray. The same things he had once loved
about me _ my naivete, my eagerness for experience _ now made him
angry and impatient. He said I acted like a teen-ager. I was 19.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1973, Jerry and I took a trip with his
children. On the beach in Florida he told me with chilling
abruptness to fly back to New Hampshire, clear my things out of his
house and be gone before he and the children returned.
 &HT;    In the years that followed, I fell in love, married, had three
children. Throughout my 20s and 30s _ years in which I wrote
novels, tended my children, witnessed the deaths of my parents and
the end of my marriage _ hardly a week went by that someone didn't
ask about Salinger.
 &HT;    Rumors that I'd lived with him had been around for years. I kept
my silence, even with friends, even with my husband, and never
mentioned Salinger in any of my published work.
 &HT;    But though I didn't speak of him or reread those letters from
him for two decades, my knowledge that I had once been adored by a
great man, and later condemned by him, remained a source of deep
shame.
 &HT;    There is something about the mythologies we create when we're
young that remains more powerful than any we construct in later
life. If I'd seen Jerry Salinger again with the eyes of a mature
woman, I might have been able to view him with a less purely
reverential eye, and to reshape my image of him to one of more
realistic and human proportions.
 &HT;    The same holds true, I suspect, for the legions of worshippers
for whom the name Salinger and the concept of his legendary privacy
continues to remain sacred, in the absence of any information that
might call the mythology into question.
 &HT;    The process of re-evaluating my obligation to protect the
Salinger legend began one night when a woman I'd never met
approached me (pregnant with my third child) and said, lightly,
``Oh, you're the one who got letters from J.D. Salinger. I had an
au pair girl who had a bunch of letters from him too.''
 &HT;    All those years I'd held onto the notion that I was once his
soul mate unlike any other. If that wasn't true, what else should I
question?
 &HT;    Over the years stories kept coming back to me, of other girls
with letters from Salinger, other avowals of unmatched kinship and
connection.
 &HT;    Three years ago, when my own daughter reached the age that I was
when Jerry Salinger wrote to me, I found myself exploring the
profound effects, on a young person, of the kinds of the
all-too-common experiences I had gone through at her age. I didn't
set out, then, to write about Salinger, only to write about myself.
But there was no way to explore my story without speaking of the
crucial role he played in it.
 &HT;    After my book ``At Home in the World'' was published last fall,
two more women who also had relationships with Salinger when they
were 18 wrote to me, describing correspondences and subsequent
rejection eerily like my own.
 &HT;    Before I parted with his letters to me, I read them one more
time. I could still see humor, tenderness and utter originality in
the voice that rose from the pages. I saw something else too:
psychological manipulation and a form of emotional seduction.
 &HT;    His demand for privacy, viewed by many as evidence of his purity
of character, seemed now like the cloak of a man well aware of the
fact that his activities, viewed in the light of day, might not
reflect favorably on him.
 &HT;    I didn't weep, reading Salinger's words to my 18-year-old self,
until I came to the passage in one of his first letters, warning of
the extraordinary danger of letters from strangers, and the power
of words on the page. He was right _ a letter can be a dangerous
thing, as I now know well.
 &HT;    Ironically, no letter I ever received exerted a more destructive
force than the one I was then holding in my hand.
 &HT;    I will not feel moved to tears when my letters from Salinger go
up for bid. My decision to sell them is grounded in the practical
realities of one whose two younger children are now approaching
college.
 &HT;    I am not selling the letters as an act of vengeance, but neither
do I feel compelled not to sell them as an act of loyalty. For me
now, Salinger's letters constitute nothing but the record of a
damaging experience. But to admirers of one of the most important
literary voices of the century, they provide a rare glimpse of a
deservedly celebrated writer.
 &HT;    Some will say that the virtues of loyalty, fidelity and good
taste require that for the rest of her life a woman must tenderly
protect the secrets of a man who has demonstrated something
considerably less than tender protection toward her. As for me, I
believe the letters are better entrusted to a lover of Salinger's
prose than they are to one who made the costly mistake of trying to
live out fictions best left on the page.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Next Tuesday, Sotheby's will auction 14 letters by J.D. Salinger
written to me when I was 18 years old.
 &HT;    When I first read these letters, and for many years after, I
believed they represented the heartfelt expressions of the most
tenderly devoted soul mate. Later I learned that I was one of many
teen-aged recipients of such letters.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, my choice to break a quarter-century-long silence
concerning my relationship with Salinger has unleashed accusations
of exploitation and betrayal made all the more outrageous, in the
eyes of my critics, because the one whose privacy I am charged with
violating is a man whose reclusiveness has become an American
legend.
 &HT;    The debate has raised questions about what constitutes invasion
of privacy and exploitation, alleged victimization versus personal
responsibility. It speaks to the heart of an issue every writer I
know struggles with: How much of my story do I have a right to
tell? Above all, it speaks to the experience of countless young
girls and women drawn into relationships with vastly more powerful
older men, the obligation placed upon these women to protect those
men's secrets, and the enduring consequences.
 &HT;    With the sale of Salinger's letters, I mean to lay to rest an
event that has haunted me all my adult life. Before I close this
chapter, though, I want to explain my actions.
 &HT;    Twenty seven years later, I can still bring myself back to the
moment in the spring of 1972 when I opened and read that first
letter J.D. Salinger wrote to me. I was a freshman at Yale and had
received hundreds of pieces of mail in response to an article I had
just published in The New York Times Magazine.
 &HT;    In a voice so distinct and funny and wise that I could almost
hear him talking, the author expressed the view that he and I were
kindred spirits.
 &HT;    That idea struck at my heart's core. Like so many readers of
``Catcher in the Rye'' I felt this man understood me as nobody ever
had. We began to correspond.
 &HT;    For the remainder of that semester, everything else fell away. I
made Jerry my religion, the only one I ever had. I withdrew from
Yale and moved in with him, leaving no forwarding address. I
believed _ despite he 35 years separating our ages _ that we'd be
together always.
 &HT;    From the moment the relationship took on a physical reality away
from the page, it began to fray. The same things he had once loved
about me _ my naivete, my eagerness for experience _ now made him
angry and impatient. He said I acted like a teen-ager. I was 19.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1973, Jerry and I took a trip with his
children. On the beach in Florida he told me with chilling
abruptness to fly back to New Hampshire, clear my things out of his
house and be gone before he and the children returned.
 &HT;    In the years that followed, I fell in love, married, had three
children. Throughout my 20s and 30s _ years in which I wrote
novels, tended my children, witnessed the deaths of my parents and
the end of my marriage _ hardly a week went by that someone didn't
ask about Salinger.
 &HT;    Rumors that I'd lived with him had been around for years. I kept
my silence, even with friends, even with my husband, and never
mentioned Salinger in any of my published work.
 &HT;    But though I didn't speak of him or reread those letters from
him for two decades, my knowledge that I had once been adored by a
great man, and later condemned by him, remained a source of deep
shame.
 &HT;    There is something about the mythologies we create when we're
young that remains more powerful than any we construct in later
life. If I'd seen Jerry Salinger again with the eyes of a mature
woman, I might have been able to view him with a less purely
reverential eye, and to reshape my image of him to one of more
realistic and human proportions.
 &HT;    The same holds true, I suspect, for the legions of worshippers
for whom the name Salinger and the concept of his legendary privacy
continues to remain sacred, in the absence of any information that
might call the mythology into question.
 &HT;    The process of re-evaluating my obligation to protect the
Salinger legend began one night when a woman I'd never met
approached me (pregnant with my third child) and said, lightly,
``Oh, you're the one who got letters from J.D. Salinger. I had an
au pair girl who had a bunch of letters from him too.''
 &HT;    All those years I'd held onto the notion that I was once his
soul mate unlike any other. If that wasn't true, what else should I
question?
 &HT;    Over the years stories kept coming back to me, of other girls
with letters from Salinger, other avowals of unmatched kinship and
connection.
 &HT;    Three years ago, when my own daughter reached the age that I was
when Jerry Salinger wrote to me, I found myself exploring the
profound effects, on a young person, of the kinds of the
all-too-common experiences I had gone through at her age. I didn't
set out, then, to write about Salinger, only to write about myself.
But there was no way to explore my story without speaking of the
crucial role he played in it.
 &HT;    After my book ``At Home in the World'' was published last fall,
two more women who also had relationships with Salinger when they
were 18 wrote to me, describing correspondences and subsequent
rejection eerily like my own.
 &HT;    Before I parted with his letters to me, I read them one more
time. I could still see humor, tenderness and utter originality in
the voice that rose from the pages. I saw something else too:
psychological manipulation and a form of emotional seduction.
 &HT;    His demand for privacy, viewed by many as evidence of his purity
of character, seemed now like the cloak of a man well aware of the
fact that his activities, viewed in the light of day, might not
reflect favorably on him.
 &HT;    I didn't weep, reading Salinger's words to my 18-year-old self,
until I came to the passage in one of his first letters, warning of
the extraordinary danger of letters from strangers, and the power
of words on the page. He was right _ a letter can be a dangerous
thing, as I now know well.
 &HT;    Ironically, no letter I ever received exerted a more destructive
force than the one I was then holding in my hand.
 &HT;    I will not feel moved to tears when my letters from Salinger go
up for bid. My decision to sell them is grounded in the practical
realities of one whose two younger children are now approaching
college.
 &HT;    I am not selling the letters as an act of vengeance, but neither
do I feel compelled not to sell them as an act of loyalty. For me
now, Salinger's letters constitute nothing but the record of a
damaging experience. But to admirers of one of the most important
literary voices of the century, they provide a rare glimpse of a
deservedly celebrated writer.
 &HT;    Some will say that the virtues of loyalty, fidelity and good
taste require that for the rest of her life a woman must tenderly
protect the secrets of a man who has demonstrated something
considerably less than tender protection toward her. As for me, I
believe the letters are better entrusted to a lover of Salinger's
prose than they are to one who made the costly mistake of trying to
live out fictions best left on the page.

teen-aged recipients of such letters.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, my choice to break a quarter-century-long silence
concerning my relationship with Salinger has unleashed accusations
of exploitation and betrayal made all the more outrageous, in the
eyes of my critics, because the one whose privacy I am charged with
violating is a man whose reclusiveness has become an American
legend.
 &HT;    The debate has raised questions about what constitutes invasion
of privacy and exploitation, alleged victimization versus personal
responsibility. It speaks to the heart of an issue every writer I
know struggles with: How much of my story do I have a right to
tell? Above all, it speaks to the experience of countless young
girls and women drawn into relationships with vastly more powerful
older men, the obligation placed upon these women to protect those
men's secrets, and the enduring consequences.
 &HT;    With the sale of Salinger's letters, I mean to lay to rest an
event that has haunted me all my adult life. Before I close this
chapter, though, I want to explain my actions.
 &HT;    Twenty seven years later, I can still bring myself back to the
moment in the spring of 1972 when I opened and read that first
letter J.D. Salinger wrote to me. I was a freshman at Yale and had
received hundreds of pieces of mail in response to an article I had
just published in The New York Times Magazine.
 &HT;    In a voice so distinct and funny and wise that I could almost
hear him talking, the author expressed the view that he and I were
kindred spirits.
 &HT;    That idea struck at my heart's core. Like so many readers of
``Catcher in the Rye'' I felt this man understood me as nobody ever
had. We began to correspond.
 &HT;    For the remainder of that semester, everything else fell away. I
made Jerry my religion, the only one I ever had. I withdrew from
Yale and moved in with him, leaving no forwarding address. I
believed _ despite he 35 years separating our ages _ that we'd be
together always.
 &HT;    From the moment the relationship took on a physical reality away
from the page, it began to fray. The same things he had once loved
about me _ my naivete, my eagerness for experience _ now made him
angry and impatient. He said I acted like a teen-ager. I was 19.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1973, Jerry and I took a trip with his
children. On the beach in Florida he told me with chilling
abruptness to fly back to New Hampshire, clear my things out of his
house and be gone before he and the children returned.
 &HT;    In the years that followed, I fell in love, married, had three
children. Throughout my 20s and 30s _ years in which I wrote
novels, tended my children, witnessed the deaths of my parents and
the end of my marriage _ hardly a week went by that someone didn't
ask about Salinger.
 &HT;    Rumors that I'd lived with him had been around for years. I kept
my silence, even with friends, even with my husband, and never
mentioned Salinger in any of my published work.
 &HT;    But though I didn't speak of him or reread those letters from
him for two decades, my knowledge that I had once been adored by a
great man, and later condemned by him, remained a source of deep
shame.
 &HT;    There is something about the mythologies we create when we're
young that remains more powerful than any we construct in later
life. If I'd seen Jerry Salinger again with the eyes of a mature
woman, I might have been able to view him with a less purely
reverential eye, and to reshape my image of him to one of more
realistic and human proportions.
 &HT;    The same holds true, I suspect, for the legions of worshippers
for whom the name Salinger and the concept of his legendary privacy
continues to remain sacred, in the absence of any information that
might call the mythology into question.
 &HT;    The process of re-evaluating my obligation to protect the
Salinger legend began one night when a woman I'd never met
approached me (pregnant with my third child) and said, lightly,
``Oh, you're the one who got letters from J.D. Salinger. I had an
au pair girl who had a bunch of letters from him too.''
 &HT;    All those years I'd held onto the notion that I was once his
soul mate unlike any other. If that wasn't true, what else should I
question?
 &HT;    Over the years stories kept coming back to me, of other girls
with letters from Salinger, other avowals of unmatched kinship and
connection.
 &HT;    Three years ago, when my own daughter reached the age that I was
when Jerry Salinger wrote to me, I found myself exploring the
profound effects, on a young person, of the kinds of the
all-too-common experiences I had gone through at her age. I didn't
set out, then, to write about Salinger, only to write about myself.
But there was no way to explore my story without speaking of the
crucial role he played in it.
 &HT;    After my book ``At Home in the World'' was published last fall,
two more women who also had relationships with Salinger when they
were 18 wrote to me, describing correspondences and subsequent
rejection eerily like my own.
 &HT;    Before I parted with his letters to me, I read them one more
time. I could still see humor, tenderness and utter originality in
the voice that rose from the pages. I saw something else too:
psychological manipulation and a form of emotional seduction.
 &HT;    His demand for privacy, viewed by many as evidence of his purity
of character, seemed now like the cloak of a man well aware of the
fact that his activities, viewed in the light of day, might not
reflect favorably on him.
 &HT;    I didn't weep, reading Salinger's words to my 18-year-old self,
until I came to the passage in one of his first letters, warning of
the extraordinary danger of letters from strangers, and the power
of words on the page. He was right _ a letter can be a dangerous
thing, as I now know well.
 &HT;    Ironically, no letter I ever received exerted a more destructive
force than the one I was then holding in my hand.
 &HT;    I will not feel moved to tears when my letters from Salinger go
up for bid. My decision to sell them is grounded in the practical
realities of one whose two younger children are now approaching
college.
 &HT;    I am not selling the letters as an act of vengeance, but neither
do I feel compelled not to sell them as an act of loyalty. For me
now, Salinger's letters constitute nothing but the record of a
damaging experience. But to admirers of one of the most important
literary voices of the century, they provide a rare glimpse of a
deservedly celebrated writer.
 &HT;    Some will say that the virtues of loyalty, fidelity and good
taste require that for the rest of her life a woman must tenderly
protect the secrets of a man who has demonstrated something
considerably less than tender protection toward her. As for me, I
believe the letters are better entrusted to a lover of Salinger's
prose than they are to one who made the costly mistake of trying to
live out fictions best left on the page.

GENETICALLY ALTERED FOOD DECRIED BY ACTIVISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American consumers become unwitting guinea pigs in
a poorly understood experiment every time they go food shopping, a
diverse group of scientists, activists and even a British
supermarket executive warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That's because rapidly growing amounts of corn, soy beans and
other crops in groceries come from seeds that were genetically
altered in a lab, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered for a ``National Summit on the Hazards of Genetically
Engineered Foods,'' the group presented petitions with 500,000
signatures to Congress and the US Food and Drug Administration
calling for the government to require genetically modified foods to
carry labels so consumers will know if the tomato has been treated
with fish genes or the corn chips contain genes from bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's demonstration was the first sign that a deep distrust
of genetically altered foods that has swept Europe could catch on
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't I have a right to know what's in the food I select for
my children so I can decide for myself what I feed them?'' asked
Laura Ticciati, executive director of the Iowa-based Mothers for
Natural Law that headed the petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   But FDA officials, as well as seed company and grocery industry
executives, said labeling would only stigmatize the foods, without
providing real information. They said the foods are just as
nutritious and safe as crops grown from conventional agriculture
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a safety issue. (Federal researchers) reviewed this
for the past 20 years. ... They felt comfortable that it was one
step further than the selective breeding that scientists have done
for years,'' said Lisa Katic, director of science and nutrition
policy at the Grocery Manufacturers of America.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists at Thursday's conference questioned how well
anyone understands the long-term impact of genetically modified
foods. They pointed to a new study showing that pollen from
genetically modified corn kills monarch butterflies as proof that
these crops haven't been studied enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't even know what questions to ask because of the time
it takes for some of these impacts of genetic modifications to show
up,'' said Richard Strohman, a retired molecular and cell biologist
from the University of California at Berkeley and frequent critic
of genetic research.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Gary Kaplan, director of North Shore University Hospital
in New York, said inserting genes from other species into plants
for human or animal consumption is dangerously unpredictable. He
said a diet supplement called tryptophan, produced by genetically
engineered bacteria, killed 37 people in 1989, though the exact
cause couldn't be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Yet American farmers are unquestionably embracing genetically
modified seeds, which have only been commercially available for a
few years. Already, a quarter of the US corn crop, 35 percent of
soy beans and smaller percentages of everything from potatoes to
sugarbeets have been genetically modified to increase pest
resistance or improve yields.
</P>
<P>
   Because federal regulators don't require that the foods be
labeled, conventional and genetically altered crops are freely
mixed, making it impossible to say definitively what consumer goods
contain altered genes.
</P>
<P>
   But the American debate over the subject has been remarkably low
key. Most politicians, including the Clinton Administration, back
the industry as the way of the future for agriculture, boosting
agricultural output to match a growing population. Only one member
of Congress, David Bonior of Michigan, sent a representative to
Thursday's meeting at the Capitol Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, meanwhile, have been far more nervous about the
trend, especially the British where tabloids call the products
``Frankenfoods.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences have fueled growing trade tensions between the
US and Europe as the European Union slows its approvals of
genetically engineered products, virtually all of which are coming
from American fields. Last month, 36 senators wrote a letter to
Clinton warning of a ``looming trade conflict'' with Europe if
Europeans don't ease restrictions on genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Druker of the Alliance for Bio-Integrity, which has
sued FDA to require labeling, believes that Americans would be just
as nervous as the Europeans if they knew more about what was in
their food.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials have moved to dismiss Druker's lawsuit and
promised to review the petitions, but Thursday, they referred
reporters to their 1992 policy that no labeling would be required
unless there is a reason, such as a potential for causing allergies
or increasing antibiotic resistance in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Katic of the Grocery Manufacturers Association, who attended the
conference, said she saw no reason to change the labeling policy
either. ``There was a lot of hype. It was not science-based,'' she
said.

 &HT;    Next Tuesday, Sotheby's will auction 14 letters by J.D. Salinger
written to me when I was 18 years old.
 &HT;    When I first read these letters, and for many years after, I
believed they represented the heartfelt expressions of the most

the voice that rose from the pages. I saw something else too:
psychological manipulation and a form of emotional seduction.
 &HT;    His demand for privacy, viewed by many as evidence of his purity
of character, seemed now like the cloak of a man well aware of the
fact that his activities, viewed in the light of day, might not
reflect favorably on him.
 &HT;    I didn't weep, reading Salinger's words to my 18-year-old self,
until I came to the passage in one of his first letters, warning of
the extraordinary danger of letters from strangers, and the power
of words on the page. He was right _ a letter can be a dangerous
thing, as I now know well.
 &HT;    Ironically, no letter I ever received exerted a more destructive
force than the one I was then holding in my hand.
 &HT;    I will not feel moved to tears when my letters from Salinger go
up for bid. My decision to sell them is grounded in the practical
realities of one whose two younger children are now approaching
college.
 &HT;    I am not selling the letters as an act of vengeance, but neither
do I feel compelled not to sell them as an act of loyalty. For me
now, Salinger's letters constitute nothing but the record of a
damaging experience. But to admirers of one of the most important
literary voices of the century, they provide a rare glimpse of a
deservedly celebrated writer.
 &HT;    Some will say that the virtues of loyalty, fidelity and good
taste require that for the rest of her life a woman must tenderly
protect the secrets of a man who has demonstrated something
considerably less than tender protection toward her. As for me, I
believe the letters are better entrusted to a lover of Salinger's
prose than they are to one who made the costly mistake of trying to
live out fictions best left on the page.

 &HT;    
 By JOYCE MAYNARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Next Tuesday, Sotheby's will auction 14 letters by J.D. Salinger
written to me when I was 18 years old.
 &HT;    When I first read these letters, and for many years after, I
believed they represented the heartfelt expressions of the most
tenderly devoted soul mate. Later I learned that I was one of many
teen-aged recipients of such letters.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, my choice to break a quarter-century-long silence
concerning my relationship with Salinger has unleashed accusations
of exploitation and betrayal made all the more outrageous, in the
eyes of my critics, because the one whose privacy I am charged with
violating is a man whose reclusiveness has become an American
legend.
 &HT;    The debate has raised questions about what constitutes invasion
of privacy and exploitation, alleged victimization versus personal
responsibility. It speaks to the heart of an issue every writer I
know struggles with: How much of my story do I have a right to
tell? Above all, it speaks to the experience of countless young
girls and women drawn into relationships with vastly more powerful
older men, the obligation placed upon these women to protect those
men's secrets, and the enduring consequences.
 &HT;    With the sale of Salinger's letters, I mean to lay to rest an
event that has haunted me all my adult life. Before I close this
chapter, though, I want to explain my actions.
 &HT;    Twenty seven years later, I can still bring myself back to the
moment in the spring of 1972 when I opened and read that first
letter J.D. Salinger wrote to me. I was a freshman at Yale and had
received hundreds of pieces of mail in response to an article I had
just published in The New York Times Magazine.
 &HT;    In a voice so distinct and funny and wise that I could almost
hear him talking, the author expressed the view that he and I were
kindred spirits.
 &HT;    That idea struck at my heart's core. Like so many readers of
``Catcher in the Rye'' I felt this man understood me as nobody ever
had. We began to correspond.
 &HT;    For the remainder of that semester, everything else fell away. I
made Jerry my religion, the only one I ever had. I withdrew from
Yale and moved in with him, leaving no forwarding address. I
believed _ despite he 35 years separating our ages _ that we'd be
together always.
 &HT;    From the moment the relationship took on a physical reality away
from the page, it began to fray. The same things he had once loved
about me _ my naivete, my eagerness for experience _ now made him
angry and impatient. He said I acted like a teen-ager. I was 19.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1973, Jerry and I took a trip with his
children. On the beach in Florida he told me with chilling
abruptness to fly back to New Hampshire, clear my things out of his
house and be gone before he and the children returned.
 &HT;    In the years that followed, I fell in love, married, had three
children. Throughout my 20s and 30s _ years in which I wrote
novels, tended my children, witnessed the deaths of my parents and
the end of my marriage _ hardly a week went by that someone didn't
ask about Salinger.
 &HT;    Rumors that I'd lived with him had been around for years. I kept
my silence, even with friends, even with my husband, and never
mentioned Salinger in any of my published work.
 &HT;    But though I didn't speak of him or reread those letters from
him for two decades, my knowledge that I had once been adored by a
great man, and later condemned by him, remained a source of deep
shame.
 &HT;    There is something about the mythologies we create when we're
young that remains more powerful than any we construct in later
life. If I'd seen Jerry Salinger again with the eyes of a mature
woman, I might have been able to view him with a less purely
reverential eye, and to reshape my image of him to one of more
realistic and human proportions.
 &HT;    The same holds true, I suspect, for the legions of worshippers
for whom the name Salinger and the concept of his legendary privacy
continues to remain sacred, in the absence of any information that
might call the mythology into question.
 &HT;    The process of re-evaluating my obligation to protect the
Salinger legend began one night when a woman I'd never met
approached me (pregnant with my third child) and said, lightly,
``Oh, you're the one who got letters from J.D. Salinger. I had an
au pair girl who had a bunch of letters from him too.''
 &HT;    All those years I'd held onto the notion that I was once his
soul mate unlike any other. If that wasn't true, what else should I
question?
 &HT;    Over the years stories kept coming back to me, of other girls
with letters from Salinger, other avowals of unmatched kinship and
connection.
 &HT;    Three years ago, when my own daughter reached the age that I was
when Jerry Salinger wrote to me, I found myself exploring the
profound effects, on a young person, of the kinds of the
all-too-common experiences I had gone through at her age. I didn't
set out, then, to write about Salinger, only to write about myself.
But there was no way to explore my story without speaking of the
crucial role he played in it.
 &HT;    After my book ``At Home in the World'' was published last fall,
two more women who also had relationships with Salinger when they
were 18 wrote to me, describing correspondences and subsequent
rejection eerily like my own.
 &HT;    Before I parted with his letters to me, I read them one more
time. I could still see humor, tenderness and utter originality in
the voice that rose from the pages. I saw something else too:
psychological manipulation and a form of emotional seduction.
 &HT;    His demand for privacy, viewed by many as evidence of his purity
of character, seemed now like the cloak of a man well aware of the
fact that his activities, viewed in the light of day, might not
reflect favorably on him.
 &HT;    I didn't weep, reading Salinger's words to my 18-year-old self,
until I came to the passage in one of his first letters, warning of
the extraordinary danger of letters from strangers, and the power
of words on the page. He was right _ a letter can be a dangerous
thing, as I now know well.
 &HT;    Ironically, no letter I ever received exerted a more destructive
force than the one I was then holding in my hand.
 &HT;    I will not feel moved to tears when my letters from Salinger go
up for bid. My decision to sell them is grounded in the practical
realities of one whose two younger children are now approaching
college.
 &HT;    I am not selling the letters as an act of vengeance, but neither
do I feel compelled not to sell them as an act of loyalty. For me
now, Salinger's letters constitute nothing but the record of a
damaging experience. But to admirers of one of the most important

<TEXT>
<P>
   After sitting in pieces in a jar for more than 40 years, Albert
Einstein's brain could make yet another contribution to science.
Now scientists in Canada say they have spotted something that might
explain the great theorist's brilliance _ and might eventually
offer clues to brainwork in general.
</P>
<P>
   They say a key region in Einstein's brain _ a region that
processes mathematical thought, three-dimensional visualization,
spatial relationships and other mental processes _ was
significantly larger than the same area in people with normal
intelligence. Known as the inferior parietal lobe, the region is
situated about the level of the ear, starting in the front of the
brain and extending about two-thirds of the way back.
</P>
<P>
   In his life, Einstein had submitted to brain studies and at
least one biography says he hoped his brain would be studied after
his death. When Einstein died in 1955, in Princeton, N.J., a
pathologist who performed the autopsy removed the brain and kept it
when he left Princeton. According to several journalistic accounts,
the pathologist, Dr. Thomas Harvey, kept Einstein's brain in a jar
and at one time it sat in a cardboard box that once held apple
cider behind a beer cooler in his office in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey had permission from Einstein's estate and his son, Hans
Albert, to conduct studies of the brain. Toward that end, he
photographed and measured the brain and then cut it into 240 pieces
of varying size for further study, but he published nothing of his
findings. He did give a few sections of the brain to a few
researchers, two of whom reported that Einstein had an unusual
preponderance of certain brain cells, oligodendroglia, which
support the brain's networks of neurons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, though, a one-sentence fax from Harvey arrived at
McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Did researchers
want to study Einstein's brain? Dr. Sandra F. Witelson, the leader
of a team of neuroscientists there, did not even know who he was.
</P>
<P>
   But the result was a research project combining a method similar
to long-rejected system of phrenology with the newer techniques of
neuroscience. Dr. Witelson's team made use of McMaster's vast
library of brain samples, probably the world's largest collection
of normal brain samples. These samples enabled them to determine
which features of Einstein's brain were ordinary, and which were
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The results of their work are reported in Saturday's issue of
the medical journal The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if the unusual physical features of
Einstein's brain can explain his phenomenal success as a theorist
of physics. Over the years, scientists have often theorized that
one aspect or another of the brain's shape related to mental
functioning, only to have the theories fail.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the researchers in Canada feel they have strong
scientific backing for their theories. Einstein's inferior parietal
lobe was 15 percent wider than that of normal people; his brain did
not have a groove that normally runs through the parietal area, a
finding a ``unique'' among the brains the team studied, Dr.
Witelson said. The absence of the groove may have allowed more
brain cells, or neurons, in the area to establish connections
between each other and work together more easily, the team's report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But he apparently chose the McMaster researchers after reading
Dr. Witelson's reports of research conducted at a brain bank that
she started in 1982, largely through funding from the U.S. National
Institutes of Health. The bank contains brains from more than 100
individuals who willed their brains for research, and who underwent
many tests of verbal, mathematical, IQ and other psychological
functions. The aim was to relate structure and function in the
normal brain, said Dr. Witelson, who veered into neuro-anatomy
after earning her Ph.D. degree in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   At least 35 brain banks exist in North America and Europe, but
most collect brains of people with various neurological and
psychological disorders. The McMaster University bank has what is
believed to be the largest collection of brains from people
documented to be cognitively normal.
</P>
<P>
   So Harvey's invitation offered an extraordinary opportunity to
study an extraordinary mind. In an interview, Dr. Witelson said she
realized at the outset that the work might conclude in a dead end.
But she said, ``If there is going to be any relationship between
structure and function, you might see it more clearly in an
extraordinary case.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have long conducted studies of brains of scientists
and brilliant people after their death, but this work has been
seriously hampered by several factors. Such studies were confined
to the brain of a single person and brains from other people with
different levels of intelligence were not available for comparison.
And scientists lacked theories about the relation between brain
structure and psychological function to test in such studies.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In examining Einstein's brain, Dr. Witelson relied on findings
from other scientists that relate the size of a brain region and
level of certain cognitive abilities. Such findings suggest that
differences in people's ability to perform certain cognitive
functions may be due in part to physical differences in the regions
of their brains that control the functions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Witelson theorized that if any difference was found it was
most likely to be in the parietal lobes. But she said she did not
confine her studies to that region.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Witelson began examining the photographs and measurements
that Harvey had made of Einstein's brain from a number of different
angles. Harvey also brought to Dr. Witelson's laboratory about 50
pieces, or a fifth of Einstein's brain, so she could also study
them through a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Witelson then compared the measurements of Einstein's brain
with those from 35 males and 56 females, all Canadians. Their
average IQ was about 115, a little higher than average. They
included singers, architects and blue collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   Because Einstein's brain was being compared with those of people
who died at age 60 on average, and Einstein was 76 when he died,
the scientists also compared his brain to the eight oldest members
of the study. Their age averaged 70. Beyond the anomalies in
Einstein's parietal lobe, there was no significant difference.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein's brain weight and the front-to-back, top-to-bottom
measurements were within the normal range of the comparison group
and of individuals from other published studies, Dr. Witelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That clearly shows that you don't have to have a big brain to
be brilliant,'' Dr. Witelson said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Witelson found two anomalies in the parietal lobes.
</P>
<P>
   One was quantitative. Einstein's parietal lobes were about 15
percent wider on each side, a finding that was statistically
significant.
</P>
<P>
   The second anomaly was ``unique,'' Dr. Witelson said. A large
groove known as the Sylvian fissure was absent. ``The inferior
parietal region was not separated by this big fissure as is present
in every other brain we've seen and in every other depiction in any
human atlas of postmortem brains,'' Dr. Witelson said.
</P>
<P>
   A few areas of Einstein's brain, such as his temporal lobes and
the top-to-bottom measurement, ``looked a bit smaller'' than the
average, Dr. Witelson said. ``When you put that all together, this
is why the overall brain was not different'' in size.
</P>
<P>
   The Sylvian fissure, which is also called the lateral fissure,
is a major anatomical feature of the brain and is well-established
at birth. Thus, Dr. Witelson said, her team theorizes that the
anomaly was present from birth and was not the result of an
environmental factor.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Witelson said the theory is supported by an oft-repeated
story that Einstein's mother was worried that he might be retarded
because his head seemed large and misshapen at birth and his speech
was slow to develop. Einstein did not speak until he was 3 years
old and later had trouble forming sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if it was genetic, but if I had to guess I'd say
it was genetic,'' Dr. Witelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Witelson said that fear of media attention kept her from
discussing the findings, even with other scientists who had
received a small number of pieces of Einstein's brain from Harvey.
On Thursday, Dr. Witelson said she could not answer all the calls
from news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Witelson said she did not know what further studies of
Einstein's brain she will pursue. A hope is that she and other
scientists will use modern imaging techniques such as CAT scan
X-rays, MRI scans and PET scans to determine whether similar brain
anomalies can be identified in other people with exceptional,
normal and low intellect.

CLINTON SAYS NATO SHOULD NOT SEIZE MILOSEVIC IN SERBIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ Even as new Serb atrocities were uncovered in
Kosovo, President Clinton made it clear Thursday that NATO's
priority should be returning ethnic Albanian refugees to the
province and not seizing President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
so he can be tried for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he remains in Serbia, inside the confines of Serbia,
presumably he's beyond the reach of the extradition powers of the
other governments,'' Clinton said. ``I do not believe that the NATO
allies can invade Belgrade to try to deliver the indictment, if you
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came in Paris, after a meeting with French
President Jacques Chirac and before he flew to this city on the
Rhine for the weekend meeting of Russia and the world's leading
economic democracies. The summit is expected to be dominated by the
Kosovo conflict and its contentious aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Progress was reported Thursday in the standoff over Russian
insistence that its military be given a distinct role in the Kosovo
occupation force being led by NATO, the old Soviet nemesis. Clinton
and his NATO colleagues contend they welcome Russian participation
but insist that the Russian detachment at the airport in the
Kosovar capital of Pristina stand down.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official traveling with the president said the talks
were going well. ``They have worked out command and control, they
have worked out arrangements for the airport, but they still need
to work out the sector.'' The Russians have said they want their
own sector of the province to police. ``Everybody will see it is a
very elegant solution,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and four top aides were indicted for war crimes May 27
by the international war crimes tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands.
Clinton praised the action at the time and repeated that view
Thursday as he stood by Chirac on the lush back lawn of Elysee
Palace, the French president's working residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I strongly support the decision of the war crimes
tribunal ... , I think it's important that we not in any way
mislead people about what happens next,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's heaviest responsibility, Clinton said, ``is to get the
Kosovars back home in safety, and then to give them self
government, autonomy, and rebuilding assistance and then work on
the region.''
</P>
<P>
   As Serb troops withdraw from Kosovo and NATO forces move in,
grisly evidence of mass killings of ethnic Albanians continued to
come to light. Residents of the village of Poklek said Thursday
that Serbs herded 62 people into a room April 17 and tossed in a
grenade, finishing off survivors with gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that trying Milosevic for such crimes would
be particularly difficult if he chose not to leave Yugoslavia. He
said NATO member nations were not prepared to use their military
forces in the region to invade Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, and
attempt to capture him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's soft-pedaling of the issue contrasted with the strong
denunciation of the Milosevic regime that Hillary Rodham Clinton
gave moments later in a speech at the University of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nations, our leaders, our citizens stood up to a giant
evil,'' the first lady said in the 19th-century grandeur of the
Sorbonne's amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are some who, I know, would quibble with my use of
that word, but I think that it fully describes the conflict we have
been waging these last months,'' she said. ``We will not turn away
if human beings are being cruelly expelled. When crimes against
humanity rear their ugly heads, we have to send a message as an
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, who fielded questions from the media alongside the U.S.
president, sidestepped the issue of how forcefully the NATO
countries should be in attempting to apprehend Milosevic and bring
him to trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the French leader did agree with White House policy that one
of the ways to ostracize Milosevic was to deny his country any
reconstruction aid as long as he holds power.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac reiterated the NATO stand that Serbia, the central
Yugoslav region, should receive only humanitarian aid and not funds
to allow it to rebuild an infrastructure devastated by almost three
months of alliance bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no economic development aid to a regime which is
not democratic and whose present leader, furthermore, has been
indicted with crimes against humanity by the international war
crimes court,'' Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
   The question of what kind of financial assistance and how to
administer it will be on the agenda as Clinton and Chirac meet with
other world leaders Friday in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also must deal with their latest dust-up with
Russia, which is demanding a bigger role in peacekeeping efforts in
Kosovo. Talks in Helsinki, Finland, between Defense Secretary
William Cohen and Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev have not
resolved the matter. Clinton said he believed progress was being
made as the two sides discuss several options acceptable to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the Russians to be involved in this mission in a
comprehensive way,'' he said. ``But we also think it is important
that we maintain clear unity of command'' under the NATO
peacekeeping force.

<P>
   One blessing of American democracy is the system's diffusion of
power. That same system of checks and balances, however, tempts
individual officeholders to exercise every last ounce of power that
may be institutionally accessible to them.
</P>
<P>
   This is a temptation that the chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, has often
failed to resist, and his current cat-and-mouse game with Richard
Holbrooke's nomination to be ambassador to the United Nations
demonstrates the mischief one senator can cause if he is determined
to magnify the powers inherent in his position.
</P>
<P>
   William Weld, the former Massachusetts governor, learned last
year how impotent a would-be ambassador can become when his
nomination falls victim to the caprices of the hyper-conservative
Helms. Although logic might suggest that Helms ought to have been
happy to have a fellow Republican serve as ambassador to Mexico,
Weld found to his chagrin that party loyalty was no match for
Chairman Helms's will to avenge perceived slights.
</P>
<P>
   Helms has been hinting that if he is not satisfied on certain
points, he will prevent a Senate vote on Holbrooke's nomination, as
he did with Weld. Nobody questions Helms's institutional
entitlement to entomb an ambassadorial nomination in this way, but
there is a crucial difference between what a powerful senator is
entitled to do with his powers and what he ought to do.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has settled a dispute about diplomatic contacts he
used just after he returned to the private sector, a misstep that
hardly disqualifies him to represent this country at the UN. The
other matter Helms has said he will raise in hearings on
Holbrooke's nomination is ``his role and responsibility for this
administration's misguided policy of appeasing Slobodan
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   This charge is either absurd or disingenuous. Holbrooke
outbullied Milosevic at the Dayton peace conference and was, if
anything, too hawkish in pushing the administration toward bombing
Yugoslavia. Helms should not subordinate principles of fairness to
a capricious demonstration of power.

NATO'S PYRRHIC VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   There is an aura of self-congratulation emanating from
Washington following the administration's air war in the Balkans.
Although NATO's forces ultimately prevailed at virtually no cost of
life to its own troops, Madeleine Albright's war was the result of
a blatant diplomatic failure. The Rambouillet agreement was so
fatally flawed that it helped precipitate what it was meant to
prevent _ the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Biship Artemija, the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which
has called on Slobodan Milosevic to step down as president,
published an open letter recently saying that ``the bombs gave the
pretext to the expulsion of a great number of Albanians and gave
the pretext to the exodus of the Serbs.'' And democratic forces in
Serbia are now almost nonexistent, and Milosevic is triumphant in
his phantom victory, and there is a lot of anti-Western feeling
among Serbs that will stop democratic processes.
</P>
<P>
   We may never know to what extent the air war made things worse
for the Kosovar Albanians. Milosevic had already begun a vicious
campaign of repression in his rebellious province before the
bombing. But Western reporters in Kosovo have written that once the
bombings began, the Serbian paramilitaries went on a rampage and
the bombing made the ethnic cleansing worse. The cause of
containing Milosevic was just, but the execution was lacking.
</P>
<P>
   A smarter diplomatic approach that kept the monitors of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on the ground
and engaged the two sides in a genuine political negotiation might
have prevented much of the Kosovo catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, both Kosovo and much of the rest of Yugoslavia
have been smashed, with hundreds and thousands of livelihoods
ruined. Surrounding countries have been destabilized. It is true
that to be successful against an evil such as Milosevic, diplomacy
needs force to back it up. But in the case of Kosovo, brute force
prevailed over diplomatic skills that might have won the day.

 &HT;    Jackson never relaxing
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Jaren Jackson has arrived. The post-game national
TV interview Wednesday night said so. The horde of media around him
Thursday afternoon said so. The attention the New York Knicks will
pay him tonight surely says so.
</P>
<P>
   Such notoriety is a far cry from where Jackson has been much of
his career _ one that's taken him to eight NBA teams in four years
_ and a long and accomplished career in the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   So to be in media demand and the subject of a team's defensive
game plan is a mark of Jackson's perseverance as much the five
three-pointers he made in the San Antonio Spurs' 89-77 NBA Finals
victory in Game 1 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a matter of believing in yourself,'' said Jackson, a
former Georgetown star. ``I've been through a lot. I've gotten cut
a lot. But in this business you have to understand that's a part of
it. I didn't complain. I just made sure that when my time came that
I was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   It'll be interesting to see how ready Jackson is tonight, for
the Knicks are hellbent on not letting him get 10 open three-point
shots as he did Wednesday. With Tim Duncan and David Robinson
commanding so much attention in the low post, the Knicks must
double team the Twin Towers _ just not with the man who's guarding
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised he shot the ball so well,'' said Latrell
Sprewell, who left Jackson open as he attempted to double-team
either of the big men. ``He was huge for them. We have to change
some things. If Jaren gets it going again, you won't see me coming
off him at all.''
</P>
<P>
   All the dreams Jackson had about a solid NBA career finally
materialized this season. He was signed as a free agent ``to be a
defensive guy on two guards,'' coach Gregg Popovich said. ``But we
got him in here and saw how he shot the ball and said, 'Let's go
for it.' And he's loved the role as that guy taking the open
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is a beloved member of the Spurs for more than what he's
done in the their remarkable post-season run. (Jackson was huge
against the Lakers and Portland, too.) Through getting cut by seven
NBA teams, Jackson found a determination that he carries on the
court each time out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect him a great deal,'' Popovich said. ``I'm thrilled
for him. When something like this finally happens for a guy who
took the long road, who worked hard and never quit, never stopped
trying, you have to feel good about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he feels good about what he's accomplished, but
he's not satisfied. ``I always believed it would happen for me,''
he said. ``I've been cut a lot, played in the CBA and won two
championships, won a championship in the WBL. And I appreciate
those experiences. It's all helped me. But if I've learned one
thing it's to not get relaxed. There's still more work to do, so
I'm not celebrating. Not yet.''

OCEAN SPRAY CEO TO STEP DOWN AFTER ONLY THREE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid a cranberry glut that is hurting the entire industry, Ocean
Spray Cranberries Inc. said Thursday chief executive Thomas E.
Bullock, 53, will step down next year after only three years at the
top job. Bullock is the third Ocean Spray executive to announce his
departure this year.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ocean Spray, Bullock, an 18-year company veteran,
presented a ``major transition plan'' to the Lakeville, Mass.
cooperative's board of directors that will have him assist in the
search for his successor before leaving sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the challenges I've faced _ and one my successor will
face _ is continuing to create value for our grower-owners, who are
suffering from lower-than-expected returns due to crop surpluses
and low prices,'' Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge Bullock couldn't meet, outsiders said, was to
transform Ocean Spray from a one-time monopoly into a company that
could nimbly defend its turf from new rivals.
</P>
<P>
   As Bullock prepares to leave, he said Ocean Spray is ``a very
strong brand.'' Over the last 18 years, revenues have risen from
$300 million to $1.48 billion. As top achievements, he cited
increased efforts to launch new products and efficiency measures
that could save the company up to $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray claims its trouble is caused by several years of
bumper crops and surpluses that have hurt the entire industry.
Since 1997, Ocean Spray has eliminated about 500 jobs, or about 20
percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders offered some different views.
</P>
<P>
   For much of its recent history, Ocean Spray was a veritable
monopoly. In the mid-1990s, however, Ocean Spray's dominance was
challenged by new competitors, and, some say, it didn't know how to
react.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a monopoly for many years,'' said John Decas, head
of rival Decas Cranberry Products Inc. of Wareham, Mass. ``Now it's
a competitive environment, and it's not an environment they're
comfortable in.''
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1930, Ocean Spray is a cooperative of cranberry and
citrus growers. One of its goals is to shield its members from the
price fluctuations that affect many agricultural commodities by
offering its growers a set price for their fruit.
</P>
<P>
   In recent times, that system has worked well, but with the
industry enduring what Bullock described as the worst cranberry
surplus in 25 years, the cooperative is under strain.
</P>
<P>
   As the surplus grew and Ocean Spray engaged in price wars with
rivals, some Ocean Spray growers began to feel short-changed by the
prices they were paid for their berries.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray members are required to buy stock in the privately
held cooperative, which they redeem when they retire or leave.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Ocean Spray has cashed out the stock of departing
growers in annual installments, but this year, citing tough times,
Ocean Spray suspended those payments. Many growers rely on those
payments for retirement, and some felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray is ``like an unfaithful spouse,'' said Paul Rinta, a
third-generation cranberry grower from Wareham. ``They promise you
the world, and then they don't come home at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bullock's departure, Rinta said, ``He should have
left Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bullock of the growers, ``They're upset, and I understand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of his tenure, Bullock was a big part of Ocean Spray's
marketing efforts to convince US consumers that cranberries were a
lot more than a Thanksgiving side dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crave the wave'' ad campaigns and studies that showed
cranberry juice could help curb bladder infections helped Ocean
Spray rapidly grow its sales.
</P>
<P>
   But Ocean Spray's success may have encouraged rivals. In the
mid-1990s, Northland Cranberries Inc. of Wisconsin, the first
publicly traded cranberry company, began marketing a premium line
of 100 percent cranberry juice.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ocean Spray uses fructose corn sweetners, its beverages
are technically ``juice drinks,'' not juices.
</P>
<P>
   If Northland aimed at the top of the market, other rivals
squeezed Ocean Spray from the bottom. They bought berries from
independent growers, often at higher prices. These berries were
used to make private-label juice drinks that big supermarket chains
sell at lower prices than Ocean Spray beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray did not mount ``a rational response'' to those new
challenges, said George S. Dahlman, a US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
analyst who follows Northland. ``They didn't know how to deal with
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray initiated ``price wars of various sorts'' that wound
up hurting Ocean Spray more than Northland, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In taking on Northland, Ocean Spray launched its own 100 percent
juice line called Wellfleet Farms.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Ocean Spray said it would ``relaunch'' the line under a
new name. A separate beverage line fortified with vitamins and
calcium is also being readied for market.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray faces other difficulties. It had contracted with
PepsiCo Inc. to distribute its single-serve beverages to
convenience stores. But last year Pepsi announced plans to buy
Tropicana, an Ocean Spray rival. Ocean Spray is now suing Pepsi _
and looking for a new distributor.
</P>
<P>
   For its last fiscal year, which ended Aug. 31, Ocean Spray said
revenues rose 3 percent. Proceeds, the word it uses for profits,
were $280 million, up from $273 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cranberries are estimated to be a $200 million industry in
Massachusetts; only Wisconsin harvests more berries.

Operating under names like Check Into Cash, Check 'n Go and Fast

 &HT;    Atlanta Olympic officials aim to restrict records access
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After initially pledging full cooperation, Atlanta
Olympic officials now want to restrict federal investigators from
photocopying certain documents among eight boxes of papers they
want to keep out of the public's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing Olympic officials have refused to give U.S.
House Commerce Committee investigators unrestricted access to the
documents, which they consider private and sensitive. The lawyers
contend the records do not relate directly to information sought by
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   However, the congressional investigators think the disputed
records are pertinent and want permission to photocopy anything
they deem necessary.
</P>
<P>
   After first refusing to allow the investigators to copy anything
from the restricted boxes, Olympic officials then asked them to
flag specific sensitive documents they want to copy. Each requested
document then would be considered individually.
</P>
<P>
   But that process was unacceptable to the congressional
investigators, who insist on unfettered access. The papers at issue
were purged from the bid files that Olympic officials say they
eventually will open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the documents which we have said many times pertain
to the established rights to privacy of the Olympic volunteers and
donors, and we continue to believe that these documents legally
have a right to remain private,'' said Lee Echols, spokesman for
the Georgia Amateur Athletics Federation. The GAAF is the group
that successfully bid for the '96 Olympic Games and claims
ownership of the documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not withholding these documents from the committee's
investigators,'' he said, ``but we've been discussing the merits of
what to copy from these documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, any documents in the possession of Congress
eventually could be made available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional committee, which is investigating whether
Atlanta Olympic officials violated federal fraud and bribery laws,
could subpoena the records if Olympic officials decline to turn the
records over.

MAYANS DEVELOPED RUBBER, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody thought that the process for making rubber was
invented in Europe in the mid-19th century. But everybody was
wrong. In fact, they were off by about 3,500 years, according to a
new report from MIT archeologists.
</P>
<P>
   When Spanish explorers first encountered Mayan cities in Central
America in the 1500s, one of the most astonishing sights they found
was a complicated, highly ritualized ball game played on
stone-rimmed courts as long as a football field, which sometimes
ended with human sacrifices (nobody is quite sure whether it was
the winners or the losers). What amazed the invaders most was the
large bouncy ball used in the game.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the only kind of balls the Europeans knew how to
make were made of leather and stuffed with feathers, and they
didn't bounce much. The sight of the huge, bouncing rubber balls
the Mayans used _ some were a foot in diameter, made of solid
rubber, and weighed more than 15 pounds _ intrigued them. They
brought a few samples, and even a whole team for a demonstration
game, back to Spain to present to King Carlos V.
</P>
<P>
   But centuries passed before the secret of how to make rubber was
re-invented. And somehow, even though the Mayan ball games have
been well known to archeologists, nobody had thought to investigate
just what the balls were made of.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until three years ago, when MIT freshman Michael
Terkanian of Brockton, Mass. heard a description of the ancient
games in an introductory archeology course taught by Dorothy
Hosler. He raised his hand to ask how the balls were made, and
Hosler _ a specialist in Mesoamerican archeology _ was stumped. She
suggested he investigate the question as a research project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thought about it,'' Hosler explained in an interview.
``It was just one of those obvious questions that nobody asked.''
</P>
<P>
   So it turned out that nobody knew the answer, and that was the
beginning of a research project that continued for the last three
years and culminated in the publication in the journal Science of a
description of the discovery of the ancient rubber-making method.
The paper was co-authored by Hosler, MIT materials scientist Sandra
Burkett, and Terkanian, who is now a junior _ a highly unusual
achievement for an undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   After three trips to Mayan archeological sites in Mexico,
Terkanian and Hosler found that Mayans in the region still know how
to produce rubber in the ancient way. The key discovery was a
precise mixture of two different plant substances.
</P>
<P>
   The main ingredient of rubber is latex, derived from the rubber
tree by making diagonal slashes in the bark and collecting the
sticky sap. But this material, by itself, is virtually useless. It
is too sticky to handle, and when it dries it becomes brittle
instead of rubbery.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Goodyear is credited with inventing the process to
transform latex into a usable rubber by a heat and sulfur process
in the late 19th century. A similar process had been patented in
England in 1843. But it turns out these latter-day rubber barons
were just reinventing the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Mayan process was adding juice from a morning
glory vine, which also grows in the region. After the mixture is
stirred vigorously for 15 minutes, it reaches a consistency that
can be easily handled and shaped, and which dries to a bouncy,
durable rubber. The vine, the archeologists found, contains sulfur
compounds, and the process only works in hot weather, so the
process is closely analogous to modern rubbermaking.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of this process made it possible to make the
bouncy balls, which in turn led to the elaborate ball games that
were so central to Mayan society, which thrived from at least 2000
BC until the Spanish conquest.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no record of exactly how the game was played,
illustrations on Mayan pottery, the ballfields themselves, and
reports by explorers provide clues. In one version, a smaller ball
was hit with a stick. In another, it had to be thrown through an
overhead hoop.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the Mayans made other things out of rubber as well,
and many of these artifacts, including hollow human figures and
wide rubber bands for attaching stone ax blades to shafts, have
recently been recovered from swampy sites where oxygen-free
conditions preserved the rubber.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the ancient rubber-processing method is the
latest achievement for MIT's unique Center for Materials Research
in Archeology and Ethnology, the only such department in the world,
which focuses on how ancient peoples processed the materials that
were crucial to their civilizations.

 &HT;    Clicking for cleavage the latest in bra technology
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Va-va-va click! For women who think the Miracle Bra
isn't miraculous enough, the Wonderbra not wonderful enough,
there's a new way to boost the bustline.
</P>
<P>
   The Click Miracle Bra, new from Victoria's Secret, lets you snap
your way to cleavage that would look right at home in a Mark Eden
ad. Or at least that's the theory.
</P>
<P>
   Want big? Click to tighten the front fastener. Eye-popping?
Click twice. Spilling out of the dress? Make it a threefer.
</P>
<P>
   The bra, introduced a month ago, is the top-selling item in
Victoria Secret's catalog. In stores, it's selling about the same
as other bras, says Monica Mitro, vice president for public
relations for the lingerie company.
</P>
<P>
   It's selling despite the fact that, at $42, the Click Miracle is
the most expensive bra the chain stocks. So far, Victoria's Secret
is the only U.S. outlet for this latest weapon in the
cleavage-enhancement arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' said 18-year-old Amanda Calvert of Duluth (Ga.), who
was browsing through the Perimeter Mall store this week. She said
the Click Miracle was a cool idea, but reconsidered after learning
the price. ``Depends on how much cleavage you get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Underwires and removable pads push breasts
inward and upward. The click mechanism, front and center in the
bra, pulls the cups even closer together. You can click on purpose
or, if you're hugging your arms together, blossom unintentionally
but not inaudibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to be aware when you're wearing it of those
drastic arm movements,'' says Mitro, who road-tested the bra along
with other Victoria's Secret employees. ``Around the office you
could hear the little clicks going.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvert, already a Wonderbra wearer, decided to give the latest
technology a try. Her mother, Mary, 44, watched in the dressing
room. When mom suggested she tighten the bra again _ after she'd
already clicked the maximum three times _ Calvert hung it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me some cleavage,'' she said, ``but not enough.''

 &HT;    Pregnancy complications high amoung black women
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Black women are almost four times more likely than white women
to die from complications of pregnancy, one of the sharpest racial
disparities in public health, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-year study shows black women were more likely to die than
white women in every state in which death-certificate data could be
collected and compared, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   In 26 states including Georgia, the risk black women would die
while producing a living child ranged from twice that of whites for
young women to six times the risk run by whites for women older
than 40.
</P>
<P>
   No single cause could be pinpointed, said Dr. Lynne Wilcox, the
study's author, but key factors may include black women's more
limited access to health care and greater vulnerability to some
health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really struck us is how much we don't know,'' said
Wilcox, who is director of the division of reproductive health at
the CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health
Promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity between death rates persisted even when women of
different races were in the same social class, had similar access
to prenatal care or were diagnosed with the same conditions such as
diabetes or high blood pressure, Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1987 to 1996, reports indicate 3,086 women in the United
States died of pregnancy complications, the CDC said. But the true
number might be as much as three times higher, the agency
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   The gap in Georgia mirrors the national problem. ``Access to
care is something we are still struggling with in Georgia, as well
as appropriateness of care, managing high-risk conditions,'' said
Rosalyn Bacon, the state's director of family health.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 69.6 percent of black pregnant women in Georgia see a
physician regularly from the first trimester to delivery, she said.
In contrast, 83.1 percent of white pregnant women visit a doctor
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC research signals how deep health differences remain
between the races, said Dr. Stephen Thomas, director of the
Institute for Minority Health Research at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these gaps persist at the same time that we are
increasing the amount that medicine can do, we should be
concerned,'' he said.

<P>
   Inspired by the launch of the Soviet Union's Sputnik, Hickam and
some of his friends taught themselves how to build rockets. Defying
his father, who wanted him to become a mining engineer, Hickam went
on to win a top prize in the National Science Fair in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Hickam described his Frank Capra-esque triumph in his
best-selling 1998 memoir ``Rocket Boys,'' which was renamed and
filmed as ``October Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the ex-NASA engineer's second career has taken off like,
well, a rocket. His first novel, ``Back to the Moon'' (Delacorte,
$23.95), has just been published, and Hickam is well into another
memoir, ``Last Christmas in Coalwood,'' about his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to write the novel because the memoir required me to
dig deep in my soul and get all my emotions,'' says Hickam, 56, who
lives in Huntsville, Ala. ``With this novel, I could have the
characters do anything I wanted them to. I've been working in the
space business for 30 years, and it was a great thing to take the
space shuttle and send it anywhere I wanted to without the
bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, engineer Jack Medaris and two employees skyjack
the space shuttle to the moon to retrieve an isotope called
Helium-3, which would provide a powerful new source of energy.
Nothing goes according to plan, however, and Jack ends up with an
unexpected passenger: a beautiful, troublesome biologist and author
named Penny High Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the book so I could create two interesting characters,
Jack and Penny, going to a very exotic location. And what could be
more exotic than the moon?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Hickam says, the government isn't interested in
the moon anymore. He contends that rocket fuel systems are
hopelessly outdated and the International Space Station is nothing
more than an expensive public works project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to look at new propulsion systems based on fission or
fusion, new ways of getting out into space. These new experimental
engines can really scat with huge cargoes, zip to the moon in
hours, jump out to Mars in days. We need somebody like a John F.
Kennedy to enunciate a new purpose that is greater than ourselves.
It would be so helpful to children. They need something to aspire
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickam will sign his book at 7 p.m. Friday at Chapter 11 at
Peachtree Battle Shopping Center, 2345-A Peachtree Road N.E.,
404-237-7199.

   PORTRAIT OF A MARRIAGE: When Vicki and Dennis Covington decided
to write a book together, the idea was to describe their
humanitarian project of drilling water wells in the undeveloped
areas of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Then the unexpected happened: The Birmingham literary couple
discovered that each was involved in an adulterous relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That caused us a crisis, not only personally, but
professionally,'' says Dennis, author of ``Salvation on Sand
Mountain,'' a nonfiction account of his encounter with religious
snake handlers. ``Should we tell the truth in the book? We decided,
as writers, that was our job.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Cleaving: The Story of a Marriage'' (North Point
Press, $22), a brutally honest account _ of alcoholism, drug use
and affairs _ that has created a firestorm of controversy in their
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the idea of writing about your marriage is a frightening
possibility,'' says Dennis, 50. ``It's much more difficult than
picking up rattlesnakes. It was an ordeal. In Vicki's case, I think
it was the best writing she's done.''
</P>
<P>
   But the writing wasn't easy. Vicki, 46, the author of critically
acclaimed novels ``Night Ride Home'' and ``The Last Hotel for
Women,'' lost both parents and suffered a heart attack during the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The most painful part for both authors was explaining everything
to their daughters, Ashley, 14, and Laura, 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very supportive, as were most of our friends and
other writers,'' Dennis says. Pat Conroy, who thinly disguised his
own family woes in his fiction, called them regularly to tell them
what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Conroy's warning, the Covingtons were unprepared for the
controversy that erupted when the book was published. Some friends
shunned them, and the Southside Baptist Church in Birmingham asked
them to resign their positions as deacons and Sunday school
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither regrets writing the book, and they have been encouraged
by the receptions they've received on their national book tour.
``We've had big crowds,'' Vicki says. ``People want to talk about
marriage and why it does or doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   And why are they still married after all their problems?
</P>
<P>
   Says Vicki: ``Because we love each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Covingtons will sign their book at 7:30 tonight at Borders
Books &AMP; Music in Buckhead, 3637 Peachtree Road N.E., 404-237-
</P>
<P>
   0707 .

 &HT;    `Hannibal' author maintains his silence
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tracking down Thomas Harris is almost as difficult as catching
up with the elusive Hannibal Lecter. The 58-year-old author refuses
to do interviews. When he has talked to the press, it's been only
to explain why he doesn't want to talk about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think really everything that I know is in my books,'' Harris
told a reporter in Waco, Texas, 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most friends from his college and newspaper years have lost
touch with him. The few who keep up social contact with him at his
homes in Miami and Sag Harbor, N.Y., portray the divorced author as
a soft-spoken Southern gentleman who lives with his longtime
girlfriend, Pace Barnes; loves to travel; and savors gourmet food
and fine wines. Sort of like Hannibal Lecter, up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism background
</P>
<P>
   Before he became the best-selling author of ``Red Dragon'' and
``The Silence of the Lambs,'' Harris spent a bookish childhood in
Rich, Miss., reading works by Ernest Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe
while his mother taught high school biology and his father farmed.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Baylor University with a degree in
English, Harris worked as a reporter for the Waco News-Tribune and
later joined The Associated Press in New York, where he teamed up
with two co-workers, Sam Maull and Dick Riley, to write the
thriller ``Black Sunday'' in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1991 interview, Maull recalled Harris as a man who had
``tremendous insights into human nature. He was a real stickler for
detail. He's never appeared to be someone who has hidden demons who
could go off at any time. What you're reading is imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harris was fascinated with serial killers from early on,
says Charlie Reynolds, a journalism professor at Tarleton State
University in Stephenville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He clipped everything he could find on them,'' says Reynolds,
63, who taught Harris at Baylor and worked with him at the Waco
Herald-Tribune in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good writer even then. He was a lot of fun when you
got to know him. He rode to work on a motorcycle and he enjoyed
having drinks after work and socializing. Mostly he sat and
listened to what everybody else said. He told me one time that he
wanted to make a million dollars and go off and not have to talk to
anybody. I guess he's accomplished that.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously. With 1.2 million copies of ``Hannibal'' in print and
a $9 million movie deal with Dino de Laurentiis, Harris can be as
silent as a lamb for as long as he likes.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    For Ry Cooder, Cuban music is strummable magic
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guitarist Ry Cooder, whose musical obsessions have taken him
deep into such varied traditions as Hawaiian slack-key guitar,
Tex-Mex balladry and American country blues, has been involved in
an ongoing Cuban adventure since the 1996 sessions that initiated
the ``Buena Vista Social Club'' project.
</P>
<P>
   That this huge phenomenon in world music _ the revival of Cuba's
pre-revolutionary son form as a Grammy-winning mainstream American
success story _ happened at all is a fluke that Cooder likens to an
``X-Files'' episode. When a Havana summit meeting among Cooder, a
group of African musicians and various Cuban performers fell
through (the Africans, he explains, ``were diverted''), producers
had to find additional local musicians to salvage the project. A
studio was waiting. The players were there. Magic happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you think it's the luck of the draw,'' says Cooder,
52. ``But in this case I have to say I see the hand of fate
writing, and that's all there is to it.''
</P>
<P>
   We quizzed Cooder, who continues to play and record with the
``Buena Vista'' musicians, about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So some of the musicians who appear in the movie were thought
to have been dead?
</P>
<P>
   A: They were not necessarily known to be alive. Compay Segundo
we knew was supposed to be around. He was a very famous guy because
of his age. Ruben Gonzalez on piano was on the list. First, people
say he's dead, we haven't seen him in 10 years. Then somebody said,
``He's not dead, he's just got arthritis and can't play.'' Well,
none of it was true, and yet another person we asked for had died
six months before. In the '90s, it doesn't take a genius to figure
this out: People are dropping like flies. If there's any of them
left at all, it's a miracle. It was a different story in the '70s.
In the '70s you could have seen anybody who was still around from
the tradition. Twenty-five-odd years later, it's getting harder to
do this kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the secret of the music's appeal?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's beautiful music. With the African rhythm structure, with
the colonial-era French and Spanish melodies over the top. It's a
very beautiful combination, very unique in the world. It's the
greatest geographic synthesis of cultural mix I've ever heard.
There's nothing to compare it to. This has been very well worked
out over 150 years. They've crafted this stuff. It starts with
poetry, and the poetry is terrific. Cubans are very poetical;
poetry is a big deal down there. The lyrics are, like, specific and
complicated and universal, but tiny, miniature screenplays.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens next?
</P>
<P>
   A: Time changes everything, and we see now that the acceleration
of history is so intense. Cuba's coming on, coming on with force.
You're going to see economic and political and social issues coming
up. This was a backwater. Cuba was really just a little spot. And
then, during the revolution, it was off-limits and nobody knew
anything about it. This is going to change overnight. It may mean
that they get thermometers in hospitals and medicine for sick
people and some food. The people won't change, but their
circumstances will change, and it's bound to be drastic.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KOKOMO, Ind. _ A year and a half ago Doris Rude, a taxi driver
who is partly disabled by a herniated disc, was living at the edge
of her income of $300 a week and had just $5 in the bank. Then she
received a $1,900 hospital bill. With poor credit and no money, she
turned in desperation to a new, fast-growing American institution:
The payday loan company.
</P>
<P>
   For a fee of $30, the company agreed to advance her a two-week
loan of $100 against her next paycheck. To obtain the loan, she
wrote the lender a check for $130 that the lender agreed to hold
until her next payday. With the $30 fee, the lender was charging
her an interest rate that consumer advocates say is 780 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks later, with no change in her living expenses, her
check was sure to bounce. So the lender let Ms. Rude renew the loan
for another two weeks, for another $30 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Soon she was bounding from one payday lender to another, six in
all, borrowing from the next to pay the accumulating fees of the
others.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rude had fallen into a trap that regulators worry is an
increasingly common one, not just for lower-paid workers like Ms.
Rude but for higher-salaried employees as well.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected product of the nation's most prosperous peacetime
decade in this century, payday lending companies are sprouting up
all over the country, having increased to nearly 8,000 today from
300 seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although plentiful in big cities like New York and Los Angeles,
they have become most visible in places like Kokomo, Springfield,
Ohio, Champaign-Urbana, Ill., and Cleveland, Tenn. Ten have opened
in Kokomo's malls and along seedier stretches of town.
</P>
<P>
   Bearing names like Check Into Cash, Check 'n Go and Fast Cash,
payday lenders grant loans to workers against their next paychecks.
In return, the companies charge a fee, typically $15 to $35. At
annual rates, the fees normally exceed 300 percent and 400 percent
and in some cases they reach four digits.
</P>
<P>
   The lending has spawned at least a dozen national chains. The
biggest, Ace Cash Express in Irving, Texas, has around 900 stores.
Its revenue last year _ what it collects in loan fees _ was $100
million, twice the level of 1996. Check Into Cash, in Cleveland,
Tenn., reported that its revenue had jumped to $21 million in the
first six months of 1998 from $10 million three years ago and $1
million five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the country, these companies escape the routine
scrutiny and regulation faced by banks, finance companies and pawn
shops. As of late last year, the Consumer Federation of America
reported that 19 states, including all of those in New England, as
well as Pennsylvania, Virginia and Texas, prohibited payday
lending, most by limiting annual, small-loan interest to less than
40 percent. But it said the 31 other states, including New York and
New Jersey, condoned it by law or by the absence of law.
</P>
<P>
   The lenders say they are providing a vital service. As
commercial banks have shunned the poorest borrowers, in part by
raising the minimum amounts they will lend, people who need small
sums to get over a hump, like paying for a medical prescription or
buying tires for a car, have been cast aside. These include people
who are unable to get credit cards or who have reached or exceeded
their cards' credit limits.
</P>
<P>
   But worker advocates consider the interest rates exorbitant. ``I
know of loan sharks in New York who wouldn't charge this kind of
interest,'' said Gary L. Calhoun, a lawyer here who provides legal
services for members of the United Automobile Workers.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Richard Bodiker, a Democrat whose bill this year to
regulate the lenders fell to intense industry lobbying, calls the
fees ``in excess of what usury laws consider loan-sharking.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Rochford, deputy counsel of the National Check Cashers
Association, an industry trade group, called such charges spurious.
``Loan-sharking involves coercive tactics to collect the debt,'' he
said. ``No major direct deposit provider has been convicted of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for their growth is people's comfort with debt. The
nation's savings rate, the percentage of people's disposable income
that is saved, dropped to 0.5 percent last year and to nothing at
all by earlier this year from 6 percent a decade ago. People are
spending more than ever and borrowing more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there's a pretty sizable group of folks whose credit
cards are maxed out,'' said Mark B. Tarpey, a supervisor in the
consumer finance division of the Indiana Department of Financial
Institutions. With payday lenders around, he said, ``they don't
have to tell the boss they need a cash advance. They don't have to
give up their TVs and furniture. They don't have to run a credit
check.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is a level of unemployment, at 4.2 percent, that
economists used to call unattainable. To succeed, payday lenders
need customers with bank accounts and regular checks, in particular
paychecks, and these days, just about every able-bodied adult
receives one.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under such conditions, said Rochford, the deputy counsel for the
check cashers association, payday lenders' revenues are poised to
grow to $1.44 billion this year from $810 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Payday lending, Rochford said, ``exists because there's a need
for it.'' A short-term deferred deposit loan, the industry's
preferred term, helps a worker through an emergency and is cheaper
than bouncing a check. Most banks do not make loans for less than
$1,000, he said, and pawning is embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers like a payday loan, Rochford said, because ``it is
private. It is quick. And they don't need a lot of documentation.''
The fees cover loans that turn sour and the cost of employees to
process loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kokomo, with a population of 45,000 some 50 miles north of
Indianapolis, may be a case in point. A throbbing, steel and
asphalt city of immense new Daimler-Chrysler and Delphi-Delco
automobile component factories, Kokomo is fertile terrain for
payday lending.
</P>
<P>
   Strapped by bad credit and unmanageable or unexpected expenses,
people here used to go to pawn shops for loans. But of three pawn
shops here two years ago, one has closed, and another, Bob's,
passed up renewing its license this month. Now people go to the
city's new payday lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, which has exceeded 20 percent in Kokomo in
recessions, was just 1.4 percent in March, according to the latest
survey by the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University.
About 20,000 people, roughly 40 percent of the area work force, are
employed by automotive companies. They earn $50,000 to $60,000 a
year and are the new lenders' biggest customers.
</P>
<P>
   The payday lenders here approve most loans within 10 minutes.
``No Credit Check, Instant Approval,'' Easy Money's flyer promises.
``The fastest way to payday,'' read the banners on the walls of
Check 'n Go.
</P>
<P>
   For this service, some states specify a maximum fee of $15 on a
one- or two-week loan of $100 or $200. In Indiana the limit is $33.
At $33, the annual rate on a two-week $100 loan is 858 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And as borrowers amass loans, taking new ones to pay the fees on
the others, the fastest way to payday becomes a fast way, too, to
garnished wages and bankruptcy.

 &HT;    A lost opportunity for emotional depth resonance
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Loss of Sexual Innocence'' loses its way all too often,
but it never completely loses its audience.
</P>
<P>
   Disconnected and dreamlike, this film from director Mike Figgis
(``Leaving Las Vegas'') is, by turns, maddeningly self-indulgent
and disturbingly primal. You may not like everything about it, but
you certainly won't forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its elliptical, episodic structure, this is one of
those movies where it really helps to know what's going on going
in. Essentially, it centers on Nic (Julian Sands), a British
filmmaker in Tunisia with a skeleton crew. During the shoot, which
takes him and his group to some very remote areas, he thinks back
on earlier incarnations of himself. As a wide-eyed 5-year-old in
Kenya who accidentally stumbles upon a moment of colonial-style
sexual fetishism. As a 12-year-old fat boy humiliated in gym class.
As a slim but still awkward 16-year-old whose hot-and-fumbled
necking session with his willing girlfriend is interrupted by her
dying father. Even as his adult self, attempting a sexual
connection with his sad-eyed wife.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, interspersed with these outtakes from Nic's life
is a parallel story in which a very black, very muscular Adam and a
very white, very anorexic Eve play out their Garden of Eden tragedy
on the grounds of a decaying estate. Before tasting forbidden
fruit, they watch each other urinate and try eating grass.
</P>
<P>
   It's not what you'd call profound.
</P>
<P>
   Give Figgis credit, however, for his ravishing images (courtesy
of Benoit Delhomme, who shot ``The Scent of Green Papaya'') and his
expressive outbursts of emotional power.
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned teen-lust situation is an almost universal
embarrassment _ a well-meaning parent who walks in at the wrong
time. That the parent is in pain and visibly unwell gives the
sequence an entirely unexpected twist. Likewise, a scene in which a
blind woman's guide dog attracts the sexual attention of some
strays starts out almost comically, then veers into something cruel
and terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Figgis is dealing with more than the loss of sexual innocence.
Rather, he's looking at the loss of innocence, period, which, in
his terms, usually means defilement and desecration.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, this is a movie of moments _ some transcendently
powerful, others taxingly silly (the Garden of Eden part too often
recalls ``The Blue Lagoon'' at its ripest). Figgis' ``Loss'' is no
loser, but it's no winner, either. It's too shapeless and
unfocused.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say that this audaciously personal film is aimed at
moviegoers prepared to fill in the blanks for the filmmaker. And
for the adventurous movie lover, that's not necessarily a bad
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Loss
</P>
<P>
   of Sexual
</P>
<P>
   Innocence''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julian Sands. Directed by Mike Figgis. Rated R for sex,
nudity, language and violence. At Lefont Plaza. 1 hour, 41 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Loses its way a lot, but manages to keep its power.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this IMAX film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy
</P>
<P>
   Who Shagged Me'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mike Myers
</P>
<P>
   and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's fave dentally impaired British superspy, Mike
Myers goes back to the '60s to save his mojo from Dr. Evil and a
giant slob in a kilt (Myers and Myers, respectively). Shaggy but
still shagadelic, this worthy sequel also stars Heather Graham as a
curvy CIA operative, Seth Green as Dr. Evil's brooding son Scott
and Jerry Springer (don't ask). (SM)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Besieged'' R (brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Thandie Newton
</P>
<P>
   and David Thewlis.
</P>
<P>
   An art movie for the MTV generation. Made for Italian TV, it's
about a reclusive Brit (David Thewlis) who lives in a huge villa in
Rome and his relationship with his housekeeper (Thandie Newton), a
proud African beauty who mops by day and studies pre-med by night.
Full of exquisite touches, but it can come off as overblown
emotional shorthand. (ERG)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 34 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Buena Vista Social Club'' G
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   by Wim Wenders.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not already a fan of the crossover hit record, ``Buena
Vista Social Club,'' you might feel lost during this documentary.
Shot low-key and almost defiantly shapeless by German auteur Wim
Wenders, the movie follows musician Ry Cooder and his son Joachim
back to Cuba, where he rediscovered the near-forgotten musical
artists of the pre-Castro era. The music saves the movie. (SM) 1
hour, 41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' R (profanity, sexuality and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   In this cruelly funny satire, high school teacher Matthew
Broderick schemes to thwart perky student Reese Witherspoon in her
bid for the student government presidency. The second feature from
``Citizen Ruth'' director Alexander Payne may sound like a bouncy
comedy. But it's really a
</P>
<P>
   bittersweet ode to the everyday lies people tell themselves to
justify their actions. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Endurance'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Haile Gebrselassie.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiar but engaging blend of travelogue, docudrama and
sports film. It's the tale of wind-swift runner Haile Gebrselassie,
who plays himself, and his journey from a life of poverty in
Ethiopia to gold medalist at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. (SM) 1
hour, 27 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrapment'' PG-13 (violence and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Connery
</P>
<P>
   and Catherine Zeta-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   A thriller with no thrills. A he/she sexual pas de deux with
little
</P>
<P>
   chemistry. Sean Connery plays Max, a dapper thief swiping
priceless works of art and computer chips. A shapely insurance
agent (Catherine Zeta-Jones) slinks into the picture and
``Entrapment'' becomes a cat-and-mouse game with lots of twists and
turns. Sadly, it's almost always a bore. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 50
minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Forces of Nature'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Ben Affleck.
</P>
<P>
   Opposites attract as strait-laced Ben Affleck heads to his
wedding and is tempted by free spirit Sandra Bullock. Like ``My
Best Friend's Wedding,'' it's a savvy blend of romantic-comedy
formula and wise '90s updates. (SM) At area discount theaters. 1
hour, 41 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' R (profanity, violence, rape,
</P>
<P>
   sadomasochism)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta,
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Stowe
</P>
<P>
   and James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   As a warrant officer investigating the mysterious slaying of a
female captain, John Travolta bolts on screen, barking his lines
and spitting his machismo all over the place. He's got to.
Somebody's got to turn this mess into a movie. Shot in Savannah and
disguised as an A-grade film, ``General's Daughter'' is a slick,
over-directed, over-written and ultimately underwhelming whodunit
B-grade thriller. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 55 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' R (profanity, adult sexual issues)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Silverstone
</P>
<P>
   and Brad Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   Needs to get over itself. This gay-themed film about two British
male teens and their coming-out conflicts might have been of some
interest 15 years ago. Now, it's so obvious that the only ones
who'll be interested are gay 15-year-olds. As is, ``Get Real''
bravely goes where too many films have gone before. (ERG) 1 hour,
48 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct'' R (intense violent behavior)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anthony Hopkins
</P>
<P>
   and Cuba Gooding Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Resist your instinct to see it. Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins
plays an anthropologist locked up in a psychiatric prison
surrounded by ``colorful'' inmates. It seems that, after living for
months with gorillas in the African wilds, he went berserk and
killed two natives. Why? It's up to a psychiatry student (Oscar
winner Cuba Gooding Jr.) to pick his mind. It's twaddle. (SM) 2
hours, 4 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Life'' R (language, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy
</P>
<P>
   and Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence bicker for more than 60 years
in this sometimes hilarious and racially poignant prison comedy.
How they landed in a Mississippi correctional facility with life
sentences isn't nearly as important as the knack these talented
performers have for taking turns at
</P>
<P>
   generating laughs out of a throwaway script. (Bob Longino). 1
hour, 49 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Strathairn
</P>
<P>
   and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.
</P>
<P>
   Independent filmmaker John Sayles is at his most
independent-minded in this intriguing and inherently honorable
movie whose parts don't add up to a satisfying whole. It's as if he
set out to make one film _ a tender, middle-aged romance told
against the backdrop of encroaching tourism in Alaska _ and then
got interested in something totally different: an unsettling
metaphysical survival tale. (ERG) 2 hours, 6 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Loss
</P>
<P>
   of Sexual Innocence'' R (violence, profanity, sex and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julian Sands.
</P>
<P>
   Loses its way all too often, but never loses its audience.
Disconnected and dreamlike, Mike Figgis' film is as self-indulgent
as it is disturbingly primal. A British filmmaker (Julian Sands) in
Tunisia reflects on various former selves _ a little boy in Kenya;
a fat boy in gym class; a lust-filled teen. Meanwhile, a very black
Adam and a very white Eve act out their Garden-of-Eden tragedy on a
decaying estate. (ERG) 1 hour, 41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Love Letter'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kate Capshaw,
</P>
<P>
   Tom Everett Scott
</P>
<P>
   and Tom Selleck.
</P>
<P>
   Not lovable, but generally likable. An anonymous love letter
circulates among the residents of a small New England town setting
off rendezvous, revelations and romantic misunderstandings. The
film has two problems: It flirts with a serious case of the cutes
and Kate Capshaw, sexually appealing and adorably flustered, never
quite takes over her own star vehicle. Still, it has enough charm
to keep you interested. (ERG) 1 hour, 29 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' R (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves,
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Fishburne
</P>
<P>
   and Carrie-Anne Moss.
</P>
<P>
   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
an adventure
</P>
<P>
   starring Keanu Reeves that should please comic book fanatics and
mainstream moviegoers. Balancing intelligence with stunning special
effects and action, it's a movie that earns its explosions, high
kicks and cascades of spent
</P>
<P>
   bullets. (SM) 2 hours, 15 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' PG-13 (pervasive adventure violence
</P>
<P>
   and partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser
</P>
<P>
   and Rachel Weisz.
</P>
<P>
   Mummy, make it stop! Please! Just because a movie has desert
scenery, a hunky action hero (Brendan Fraser), hissable bad guys
and supernatural hoodoo doesn't make it an Indiana Jones flick.
You'll miss Steven Spielberg's masterful touch watching ``The
Mummy,'' a petrified mixture of retro adventure, clumsy slapstick
and minimal chills. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 2 hours, 4 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Never Been Kissed'' PG-13 (profanity, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   sexual references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore
</P>
<P>
   and David Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore is Josie Geller, a newspaper copy editor in her
mid-20s and former high school dweeb (``Josie Grossie,'' they
called her) who goes back to teenville as an undercover reporter,
promptly relives high school hell and pretty much bumbles her way
to popularity. Everything about her career is implausible. The
movie's jokes are lame, its situations loopy. But Barrymore does
make a go of it. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 47 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant
</P>
<P>
   and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Boy gets movie star, boy loses movie star, etc. Hugh Grant plays
a decent London bookseller and Julia Roberts a version of herself
(worldwide movie star) in this romantic comedy. The latest from the
writer of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' is old-fashioned hokum,
short on surprise but very long on charm. (SM) 2 hours, 4 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' PG (profanity, sensuality, alcohol use,
</P>
<P>
   some thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal,
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cooper and Laura Dern.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teenager Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickam's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick. (SM) 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I
</P>
<P>
   _ The Phantom Menace'' PG (sci-fi action/violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   Is George Lucas' new movie visually amazing? Yes. Exciting?
Sometimes. Emotionally involving? Almost never. As a technological
Mount Everest (and the Mount McKinley of marketing), ``Menace'' is
a
</P>
<P>
   remarkable achievement. Too bad writer-director Lucas left out
the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the original movies. He also left out
memorable characters. He left out the fun. (SM) 2 hours, 11
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated film with voices
</P>
<P>
   by Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver,
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Close and Nigel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's animated ``Tarzan'' really swings. This long-haired
dude confidently surfs through Africa's immense rain forest. He
glides barefoot on never-ending, moss-covered tree limbs like the
coolest Rollerblader you've ever seen. His feet never fail him. His
movie doesn't either. Both a little scary and a lot funny, kids
will no doubt lap this movie up. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 28 minutes.
B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joan Plowright,
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Smith and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Known in 1930s Florence as ``the scorpioni,'' thanks to their
collective sting, a band of British and American expatriate women
become surrogate mothers of a young boy named Luca. Based on his
autobiography, director Franco Zeffirelli's film is an uneven but
enjoyable tale of a boy growing up in Black Shirt Italy, entrusted
to a handful of Auntie Mames. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thirteenth Floor'' R (profanity, sex and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Craig Bierko,
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Mol
</P>
<P>
   and Armin Mueller-Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   A ``what is reality?'' sci-fi thriller that doesn't measure up
to earlier and better films such as ``The Matrix'' and ``Dark
City.'' It's about a modern-day computer whiz team that creates,
then walks around in, a digitized version of 1937 Los Angeles.
Murder, intrigue and too much flat acting follow. Your ultimate
warning: The movie's from some of the creative team that earlier
flubbed ``Godzilla.'' (Bob Longino) 2 hours. C
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)
40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Trippin''' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Deon Richmond
</P>
<P>
   and Donald Adeosun Faison.
</P>
<P>
   It keeps trippin' up on its own mixed message. Deon Richmond
plays Greg, a high school senior whose plans for college keep
getting waylaid by his fantasies of living the phat life,
surrounded by gorgeous women whose sole goal in life is to show him
their breasts. The movie has flashes of charm and heart, but
they're undermined by the filmmakers' pandering to the basic
instincts of its target teen audience. (SM) 1 hour, 32 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice Upon
</P>
<P>
   a Yesterday'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Douglas Henshall
</P>
<P>
   and Lena Headey.
</P>
<P>
   This romantic fantasy starts out with flat-footed awkwardness
but gradually grows deeper, nimbler. Its ideas about love and
destiny gleam with promise, even if the movie never quite finds the
structure to show them off properly. It's a near miss. (SM) 1 hour,
35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``William Shakespeare's
</P>
<P>
   A Midsummer
</P>
<P>
   Night's Dream'' PG-13 (sensuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, magic doesn't happen. A sexy cast, a classic play,
the
</P>
<P>
   sensuous Tuscany countryside. How could ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream'' misfire? Blame it on director Michael Hoffman, whose
</P>
<P>
   picturesque but pedestrian approach dims the sparkle of William
Shakespeare's script. (SM) 1 hour, 55 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Winslow Boy'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nigel Hawthorne
</P>
<P>
   and Jeremy Northam.
</P>
<P>
   David Mamet proves an unexpectedly good match for Terence
Rattigan's 1946 play loosely based on a true story of an Edwardian
patriarch's risky and costly fight to clear his 13-year-old son's
name when the boy is expelled from a prestigious school for
stealing pocket change. Mamet brings care, thoughtfulness and even
a theatrical spark to the material. Nigel Hawthorne and Jeremy
Northam lead an excellent cast. (ERG) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves''
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Jill Vejnoska) 41 minutes. B-

 KOKOMO: and bankruptcy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Jo King, 41, earns almost $60,000 a year as an assemby
line worker at the Daimler-Chrysler transmission plant. But she has
no savings, in part because she is paying creditors $113 a week to
work her way out of a bankruptcy that followed a serious automobile
accident that left her husband partly disabled and both with high
medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   Then early last year, Ms. King and her husband and their boys,
18 and 11, had to move, incurring $1,500 in unexpected expenses.
``I've got kids to feed,'' she said. ``I had to go do something.''
With her credit in ruins, she could not go to a bank for a loan, so
she went to payday lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did several payday loans all at once,'' Ms. King said.
``They make you feel real at ease about it.'' She started paying
off the loans bit by bit but became saddled with $200 in fees alone
every two weeks and could not keep up.
</P>
<P>
   So one lender tried to redeem her last $330 check covering a
loan of $300 and a fee of $30. She did not have money in the bank
to cover the check. The bank and the lender then charged her $80 in
fees for a bad check.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the lender sued, and Ms. King lost. The court awarded the
lender triple damages _ $990, or three times the amount of the
check, plus $150 in lawyer fees and $60 for court costs. With the
$80 for bouncing the check, Ms. King owes $1,280 on her original
loan of $330.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Currently, about 100 payday lender suits against borrowers are
on file in the Howard County Superior Court, in Kokomo. Lenders
here also send out letters threatening their customers with
imprisonment for bouncing a loan check, although none is known to
have tested the state penal code provision that they invoke in
making the threat.
</P>
<P>
   David Hannum, coordinator of the Consumer Credit Counseling
Service, said borrowers keep paying the fees, digging themselves
deeper into debt, out of fear that lenders will otherwise try to
redeem their checks when they do not have money in the bank to
cover them, further tainting their credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The process becomes addictive. ``You go into one,'' Hannum said.
``Then you go to another to pay off the fees of the first. You end
up with a whole string of them.'' Friday paydays here have become
Friday payday loan days, with the multiple-loan borrowers rushing
from one loan shop to another, renewing loans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To tap into this market, Carol Brenner, 36, opened Quick Cash
here in September. She now has 350 clients, most of whom return
every week or two to have their loans renewed or to pay them off
but then take another a few days later. She charges less than most
lenders: $20 for a two-week, $100 loan, for an annual percentage
rate of 521 percent, and $30 for $200, or 391 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some lenders, Ms. Brenner lets her clients pay off
portions of their loans as they extend them and in that way work
them down. And to avert trips to small claims court, she says she
will not lend to people who already have more than two loans from
other payday lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders say comparing payday lenders' fees with annual
interest rates is unfair because most loans are promptly paid off,
within a month.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest borrowers, many lenders say, are not Kokomo's
low-wage service workers, but auto industry employees who earn more
than $20 an hour. ``Most of my customers are from Chrysler and
Delco,'' said Marc Sutherland, manager of the Kokomo office of
Nationwide Budget Finance, which opened in April. ``People get
stung,'' he said. ``They can't manage money.''
</P>
<P>
   Shari Harris, 39, who earns around $25,000 a year as an
information security analyst, was managing money well enough until
the father of her two children, ages 10 and 4, stopped paying
$1,200 a month in child support.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then,'' she said, ``I learned about the payday loan
places.'' She qualified immediately for a two-week, $150 loan at
Check Into Cash, handing them a check for $183 to include the $33
fee. ``I started maneuvering my way around until I was with seven
of them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In six months, she still owed the $1,900 and was paying fees at
a rate of $6,006 a year. ``That's the sickness of it,'' Ms. Harris
said. ``I was in the hole worse than when I started. I had to
figure a way to get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   So she asked her employer to stop paying her wages into the
checking account, emptying it, and to put them into a savings
account on which she had not drawn any payday loan checks. She
stopped paying the biweekly fees to extend the loans, so the
lenders tried to redeem her checks. ``I let 'em all bounce,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She took a second job, working in a department store, and turned
to the Consumer Credit Counseling Service, which worked out a plan
under which she is paying $440 a month to work down the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Ann Fox, director of consumer protection at the Consumer
Federation of America and a prominent critic of payday lending,
said, ``There's nothing wrong with small loans at reasonable
interest rates, reasonable terms and reasonable collection
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these practices are designed to keep you in perpetual
debt.''

 &HT;    Hollywood and Vine Tarzan for the 90s
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Disney's animated ``Tarzan'' really swings. This long-haired
dude confidently surfs through Africa's immense rain forest. He
glides barefoot on never-ending, moss-covered tree limbs like the
coolest Rollerblader you've ever seen. His feet never fail him.
</P>
<P>
   His movie doesn't, either. It's both a little scary and a lot
funny, and kids will no doubt lap it up.
</P>
<P>
   To date there have been at least 47 film versions of Edgar Rice
Burroughs' story of the formidable Tarzan, orphaned in Africa,
raised by simians, discovered and loved by Jane and, ultimately,
destined to become king of the beasts. Johnny Weissmuller is
unquestionably the alpha ape-man. Let's not even talk about such
omegas as Mike Henry in the 1960s or last year's Casper Van Dien.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon ``Tarzan'' can't match Weissmuller's shrill yell _
and, smartly, hardly even tries. But it does take the jungle-book
guy into new territory, raising the bar on animated visuals with
groundbreaking background drawings that appear to be 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the ballroom dance sequence in ``Beauty and the
Beast''? It was about 30 seconds of computerized three-dimensional
juice, making the scene a memorable eye-popper. ``Tarzan'' improves
on the technique and exploits it for its full 88 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This jungle realistically sways, the ocean waves visually roar
and Tarzan's long, reckless but sure-footed treks through the trees
are as arresting to the eyes as just about anything in the latest
``Star Wars.'' Plus, Disney has a leg up on George Lucas:
``Tarzan'' is full of talented voices, with an often-enough moving
and humane story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   The voice of Rosie O'Donnell is a kick as Tarzan's androgynous
young ape pal, Terk. Wayne Knight is sweetly silly voicing the
movie's orange elephant sidekick, Tantor. Glenn Close propels Kala,
the ape who adopts the baby Tarzan, into a female as loving as
Dumbo's ma. Lance Henriksen's growly voice is perfectly menacing
for the charging, ape-clan patriarch Kerchak.
</P>
<P>
   Voicing the lead roles, Minnie Driver's wide-eyed Jane and Tony
Goldwyn's knuckle-walking ape-man infuse the movie with just enough
sexual chemistry to make ``Tarzan'' an honest love story.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad most of those characters aren't drawn with the same
gusto as the background. And Phil Collins' schmoozy pop soundtrack
is one of those noisy nuisances that does nothing but sell well.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe ``Tarzan'' isn't the well-rounded stuff that made
``Beauty and the Beast'' the only animated film ever nominated for
a best-picture Oscar, and it probably won't impress you as much as
``The Lion King,'' ``The Little Mermaid'' or even ``The Jungle
Book.''
</P>
<P>
   But it does have plenty of the right other stuff. It depicts
violence and death in a manner respectful of young eyes. It knows
how to really make an audience laugh _ and illustrates it with one,
brief, beautiful, in-your-face homage to ``Beauty and the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' is a fun time at the movies: a Disney-patented,
G-rated frolic. And we sure need it. Too often it's an R-rated
jungle out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Animated film with voices by Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn
Close, Rosie O'Donnell, Lance Henriksen and Nigel Hawthorne. Rated
G. At metro theaters. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ape-man cometh, for a fast and fun joy ride.

 &HT;    A tale of two boys and their PC toys
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Noah Wyle stars as the freewheeling Steve Jobs and Anthony
Michael Hall as the geekily focused Bill Gates in the made-for-TNT
movie, ``Pirates of Silicon Valley,'' airing Sunday night at 8. The
actors talked a bit with staff writer Drew Jubera about their roles
in the movie, which dramatizes the race between Apple Computer and
Microsoft for computer age dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ANTHONY MICHAEL HALL
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at the Flying Biscuit in Candler Park wearing Alain
Mikli designer glasses that seemed to say, very deliberately, so
they would not be misunderstood: ``I've changed. I'm not the
teenage nerd you remember me as. I've moved on. I suggest you do
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Michael Hall _ former nerd-playing Brat Pack star of
such '80s teen signposts as ``Sixteen Candles'' and ``The Breakfast
Club'' _ went from geek poster boy to a year on ``Saturday Night
Live'' to drinking a quart of vodka a day to dropping off the
public radar. Hall, 31, clearly sees his role as Bill Gates in
Sunday's ``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' on TNT as a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why Gates?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was an opportunity to change my life. I was asked to
prepare four scenes and I really wanted to impress the will to win,
that desire. I didn't just do a reading and leave; I wasn't just
performing for suits. This time I really wanted to deliver. It made
me reinvest in my own craft. I felt like I was the richest actor in
the world the day I got the job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How'd you prepare?
</P>
<P>
   A: I transferred all the documentary interviews on Gates to
audiocassette and walked around listening to them on my Walkman. I
walked around the set with it on.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sounds kinda . . . nerdy.
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to be convincing as (Gates) _ make people forget
they were watching this kid from the '80s. I understand the
correlation people make to the nerd thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The nerd thing. You're a star at 15, then you basically
disappear . . .
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a lot harder to get work than people think. I'm humble
about the process _ only I know how many meetings I've been to.
I've been in 29 movies and I've probably taken 2,000 meetings. The
challenge is to survive all the pitfalls and cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Pitfalls and cliches?
</P>
<P>
   A: Death and addiction. I was able to view it firsthand. It took
a long time to see it all. I took that time in my 20s. Where in the
past I took this for granted, now I have more respect.
</P>
<P>
   NOAH WYLE
</P>
<P>
   Taking an off-season break from his role as Dr. John Carter on
NBC's ``ER,'' Noah Wyle talked recently about transforming himself
into Apple Computer co-founder Steve Jobs for Sunday's ``Pirates of
Silicon Valley'' on TNT.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why play Jobs?
</P>
<P>
   A: They sent me the script and enclosed a documentary that was
on PBS, ``Triumph of the Nerds,'' a history of the PC industry. It
was cued to Jobs' '94 introduction at an Apple (stockholders
convention). So I popped it in the VCR, and there was something
unbelievably charismatic about him. He was complicated,
interesting, contradictory, and I thought, ``If I don't play him
I'll kick myself for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're a dead ringer for him. It's kinda weird.
</P>
<P>
   A: In the last scene, when I'm wearing a sweater vest and his
round glasses, there's a photo from that time from the exact same
Boston convention, and when I put the two next to each other, I
giggled. I looked at myself and said, ``That's him.'' Pretty damned
scary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How'd you approach playing the guy?
</P>
<P>
   A: I made sure I never hit the same note twice with him, to
belay a constant sense of evolution. Every time he's speaking, he's
only saying about a tenth of what he's thinking. I attacked Jobs
more from the standpoint of a Shakespearean hero: He should
succeed, but because of innate traits, he can't possibly succeed.
If he'd died when (Apple) fired him, that would hold true. But the
fact that he was successful with Pixar (the computer animation
company) and came back to Apple, it contradicts that philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you talk to him, or to people who know him?
</P>
<P>
   A: I spoke to people associated with him. The way they described
him was, ``Consummate salesman, horrible boss.'' He's an incredible
motivator, visionary _ part carnival huckster, part Zen monk. I
doubt I even scratched the surface on him, but I got an indication
of how deep the well was.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Zen monk?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was a wonderful quote I read about his approach to Zen.
In monasteries, there was one monk called the Zen Crazy, who had
license to walk about and be belligerent and not bathe. He could
not be more un-Zen. He was there to keep all the other monks on
their toes, to galvanize their faith by constantly challenging
them. And there was Jobs, skulking the halls, surprising people at
their desks, challenging their work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How's he different from Gates?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both are master chess players. I call Gates ruthless, but to
a very fixed and defined point. Whatever his definition of success
is, he's unwavering in his approach. Jobs is more inconsistent,
more a dreamer, prone to flights of fancy. He takes three wrong
steps to come around to the right path. He's not as good a chess
player (as Gates).

 &HT;    Collins revs up `Tarzan' soundtrack
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any time Walt Disney Pictures pokes its paintbrushes into the
jungle, whether it's 1967's ``The Jungle Book'' or 1994's ``The
Lion King,'' it comes up with a hit. So when the animation giant
tapped Phil Collins to produce five new songs for ``Tarzan,'' it
was a tall order _ this also is the first Disney animated film to
predominantly feature a single vocalist throughout, and the former
Genesis singer and drummer does not disappoint. Whether it's the
driving rhythm of the film's majestic opening number, ``Two
Worlds,'' or the radio-ready ballad ``You'll Be in My Heart,''
Collins' music cuts an impressive swath through the animated
underbrush.Only the foot-tapping ``Son of Man'' contains more than
a faint whiff of Collins' pop successes, and composer Mark Mancina,
who scored the action flicks ``Twister'' and ``Speed,'' expertly
mixes African rhythms and instrumentation to create a lush
soundscape for the most dramatic sequences.

 &HT;    Talking with Travolta
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  A few things about John Travolta
</P>
<P>
   (``The General's Daughter''):
</P>
<P>
   He's a movie star. During a recent visit to Atlanta, a
photographer is required to show him Polaroid proofs before he'll
agree to let her snap a roll of portrait shots. The lighting has to
be just so. And the makeup woman in the corner is there not just
for touch-ups, but to point out if his tie has slipped, exposing
the buttons of his charcoal-gray shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta knows the power of image, whether it's the white
leisure suit that drove him into disco fame in ``Saturday Night
Fever'' or the greasy hit-man hair of Vincent Vega, the ``Pulp
Fiction'' role that microwaved his Hollywood career after 10 tepid
years. He takes possession of an Atlanta hotel conference room with
the shambling grace of a royal bear, a bear dressed very well and
beautifully groomed. And when he speaks, it's in a low, soft rumble
that makes you lean in a little.
</P>
<P>
   Some other things: He's 45, a Scientologist, married to actress
Kelly Preston (their son, Jett, is 7), and he's a pilot who loves
to fly.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On the two months he spent in sweltering Savannah last summer,
shooting ``Daughter'':
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked it, actually. I didn't mind the weather. I lived in
Florida for six years, so the weather was not a big deal. There was
a cigar club that I went to, and a couple of restaurants that were
quite nice. I stayed in this lovely house, so mostly I stayed home
after work, went to the movies a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  As an actor who's emptied his share of machine guns
(``Face/Off''), what about the post-Columbine High School debate
about Hollywood violence?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we underestimate the correlation to those incidents
and street drugs or prescription drugs. You know, I grew up in the
'60s, and when things happened like Manson and all that, they were
on LSD, it altered their state of mind. These days it's just a
little more disguised, you know. So I think that's not looked at
perhaps enough. There have been violent movies around for 100
years, since movies started. And it's all your state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``One kid could be subjected to a Playboy and be fine. Another,
it might send him on a roll of pornography. Another child may be
able to watch a violent movie, but another one may come home
wanting to break up the house. That's personal judgment there. It's
always (caused by) a bunch of things, and I think it's wrong to try
to blame one area. There's always this heated rush to find some one
`why,' when it may be a mix of things.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Biggest indulgence:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm famous for food being an indulgence. I think I'm
famous for aviation, flying, travel. It's extroverting for me. It
makes me feel focused.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Biggest fear:
</P>
<P>
   ``Heartbreak with people. I get disappointed easily. It's never
too much about my family; it's mostly been with friends and working
situations. It is my nature to want an ascent in life. I want to go
up. I'm a romantic, what can I tell you? I want things to be ideal,
I want the joys and pleasures in life to be what I know they can
be. But to expect that from other people, it's a little
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two things I was thinking about today. One was the
song from `Cabaret' ... `The sun will rise and the moon will set,
sooner or later you'll settle for what you get.' But I've never
settled, really. Even though I've been hurt or heartbroken, I've
never accepted the idea of settling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there's a line that once in a while creeps in: `Most men
lead lives of quiet desperation.' I refuse it. I just don't agree
with it. I don't want to agree with it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  His next project:
</P>
<P>
   ``Battlefield Earth,'' based on a novel by Scientology founder
L. Ron Hubbard, which starts filming in Montreal next month. ``I
play a 9-foot alien. Man is an endangered species, and these aliens
have taken over the Earth. Man is just hunted for sport and for
slavery. They think of them as rats, basically. I play this wicked,
evil guy that is very full of himself and very arrogant and thinks
of himself as some sort of royalty. It's hilarious. It's the
cruelest humor I've ever seen. It's so cruel it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't feel bad _ Travolta hasn't nailed down his New Year's
Eve plans, either:
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbra Streisand asked me to sing with her on New Year's (in
her Las Vegas concert). I was very honored, the Chosen One, kind
of. But I don't know. I have to see if I want to really live that
pressure for six months. And also, do I want to be doing that for
the millennium? Do you make a little bit of history with the diva
of the century, or do you have your own view of what should happen
on that night?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had planned to fly around the world and try to catch as many
time zones as I could. Kind of a James Bond-y New Year's. Then when
I found out that my favorite airplane, the 707, was gonna be in
inspection in December of '99, I wasn't as interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Travolta video must-sees
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Carrie'' (1976; Rated R). Playing one of telekinetic teen
Sissy Spacek's tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Saturday Night Fever'' (1977; Rated R). Strutting down the
street toward his first Oscar nomination and into pop-culture
history.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Grease'' (1978; Rated PG). Doing the hand-jive with Olivia
Newton-John.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Blow Out'' (1981; Rated R). Uncovering a murder in Brian De
Palma's paranoid thriller.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994; Rated R). Dancing with Uma Thurman,
killing people and landing another Oscar nod.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Get Shorty'' (1995; Rated R). Making a smooth transition
from hoodlum to Hollywood producer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Face/Off'' (1997; Rated R). Changing faces, and
personalities, with Nicolas Cage.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Travolta video must-
</P>
<P>
   avoids: Anything made between 1981 and 1994. Oh, and also 1978's
``Moment by Moment'' (Rated R).

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LE BOURGET, France _ Displayed proudly above the reception desk
of the Ilyushin Aviation Complex office at the Paris Air Show here
is a newly minted air-worthiness certificate from the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration. On June 2, the big, four-engine Russian
Ilyushin IL-96T parked nearby became the first wide-body jet, other
than ones made by Airbus Industrie and Boeing Co., to meet FAA
safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   While Airbus and Boeing have the certification process for new
models down to a science, often breezing through it in a year or
less, Ilyushin struggled for five years to get approval. And even
though it now has the coveted certificate, making it easier for
leasing companies and banks to finance sales of the IL-96T, the
success of the huge cargo plane, or of a sister passenger plane
that is in the works, is by no means assured.
</P>
<P>
   Ilyushin _ founded in 1933 by Sergei Vladimirovich Ilyushin, who
won the Order of Lenin three times for designing some of the Soviet
Union's most famous military and civilian airplanes _ has built
only one IL-96T so far. The company, which was partially privatized
in 1994, has orders for 19 more from Aeroflot International
Airlines. But it cannot even deliver the first one because an
agreement for loans from the Export-Import Bank in Washington to
pay for the airplanes has lapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ilyushin team, in the best Russian tradition, knows how
to live with adversity. ``We have overcome so much,'' said Vladimir
Belyakov, the company's deputy marketing director, ticking off the
collapse of the Soviet Union, the introduction of a market-based
economy that eliminated decades of fat government subsidies, and
last summer's financial debacle. ``And we continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The IL-96T was the inspiration of American industrialist Armand
Hammer, who in 1989 suggested combining the best of the Soviet and
U.S. aerospace industries. Hammer convinced wealthy friends,
including publishing magnate Robert Maxwell and real-estate mogul
Paul Reichmann, to invest in the project.
</P>
<P>
   But after Hammer and Maxwell died and Reichmann's Olympia &AMP; York
went bankrupt, the deal fell apart. Belyakov said Ilyushin
executives now joked that they should have taken $1 billion from
Reichmann. ``What difference would it have made if he were $11 or
$12 billion in debt?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of building a Russian-U.S. airplane survived.
Eventually Pratt &AMP; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, agreed
to supply the engines, while Rockwell-Collins, a unit of Rockwell
International, furnished the cockpit instruments and controls.
Other American suppliers also signed on. The result was the IL-96T.
</P>
<P>
   It was _ and is _ a bet on the future of the aviation market in
Russia, a country that spans 10 time zones and and desperately
needs more airplanes. Arthur Kelly, the Rockwell-Collins executive
who oversaw the company's role in the project, was a believer,
making his final presentation to Rockwell-Collins' board of
directors in the early 1990s, dressed in the uniform of a Russian
air force colonel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur was passionate about getting Rockwell Collins into
international markets,'' said Karen Tripp, the company's chief
spokesperson. ``He would do things like that.'' Kelly, who died of
cancer in 1996, got the board's approval. So far, Rockwell-Collins
has invested $50 million in the airplane and Pratt &AMP; Whitney $80
million. Belyakov estimated that Ilyushin has spent $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Ilyushin joined the young Soviet military as an aircraft
mechanic in 1919 and began building gliders as a student at
Russia's air force academy in the 1920s. During World War II, he
developed the IL-2 attack airplane to support infantry.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its history, Ilyushin was simply a design center,
creating airplanes that were built by factories around the Soviet
Union as ordered by the central authorities. The system may not
have been efficient but it was certainly productive: More than
36,000 of the single-engine prop attack planes were built, making
it a mainstay of the war and the most widely produced model in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, the Ilyushin Design Bureau, as it was then
called, continued to create bombers and fighters but also branched
into civil aviation. Hundreds of Ilyushin airplanes were produced
each year and ``sold'' to Soviet allies in the East Bloc and
elsewhere _ the allies had little choice but to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 ended the cozy
relations between the state and the aircraft industry. Government
orders dried up. Designers like Ilyushin and the factories that
produced its planes were told to make it on their own. While some
airplanes, like the mighty Antonov, the world's largest cargo
airplane, have found niche markets, most Russian airplane makers
have fallen on hard times. The Antonov, for example, moved
Rockefeller Center's 73-foot Norway spruce Christmas tree to New
York from Cleveland last year. And, because it was being leased, it
did not need FAA certification.

EVIDENCE OF KOSOVO ATROCITIES MOUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN AND MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ NATO troops ``by the hour'' are uncovering
evidence of savage, wartime atrocities _ mass murder, rapes, and
torture _ carried out against ethnic Albanian civilians by Serb
soldiers and police in Kosovo, British officials said Thursday.
They estimated more than 10,000 Kosovars were killed in at least
100 separate massacres.
</P>
<P>
   As ethnic Albanian refugees who left Kosovo in the Europe's
largest human displacment since World War II stream back to their
towns, their worst nightmares are coming true. Roads on Kosovo's
southern and western tier reek of death and destruction. In the
once-bustling city of Pec, nearly every house and store has been
burned or bombed out. Family members are missing, and NATO say they
have identified or have heard of 90 mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   In one gruesome scene in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, British
soldiers discovered what officials called a ``torture chamber''
inside a five-story police headquarters. They found knives, rubber
and wooden batons, baseball bats inscribed with Serb slogans, a
wooden crate of brass knuckles, ``savage'' pornography, and drugs
used presumably to sedate victims, said Geoffrey Hoon, Minister of
the British Foreign office. A stack of condoms was also found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still hard to credit that our fellow human beings could
be guilty of machine-gunning children, systematic rape of young
women and girls, digging mass graves, and burning bodies to try and
conceal the evidence of murder,'' Hoon said in London. ``But this
has happened in Kosovo, fresh evidence is being found all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the police headquarters, Hoon said, the British troops
followed a trail of charred paper to an incinerator where Serb
authorities appeared to have burned evidence of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, President Clinton said he was ``moved'' to see
soldiers finding hard evidence of long-suspected atrocities, and he
said that along with resettling Kosovar refugees, the highest
priority for NATO should be documenting the war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to focus on our obligations _ fundamental humanitarian
obligations to get the Kosovars home and to continue to uncover
whatever evidence of war crimes there is in Kosovo,'' Clinton said
during a news conference with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of atrocities and confirmation of deaths by
returning refugees is likely to put pressure on the NATO allies to
seize Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who has been indicted
by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. But Clinton
said peacekeepers will take a ``wait and see'' approach toward
Milosevic's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   A team of forensic investigators from the UN court will arrive
in Kosovo Friday to begin documenting the alleged war crimes. They
will concentrate on mapping and photographing suspected sites and
try to substantiate reports of rape, murder, and torture by Serb
forces, said Jim Landane, a spokesman for the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another drama was unfolding as fearful Serb
civilians, carrying their belongings in packed cars and tractors,
formed a column that stretched for miles and moved slowly north
from the southeastern region of Urosevac in Kosovo toward the
Serbian border. The UN World Food Program reported that 50,000
Serbs have left since last week's peace agreement that sent NATO
troops into Kosovo and required all Serb military and police forces
to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's ruling Socialist Party appealed Serbs to stay in
Kosovo, to ``secure the survival of Serbia in this territory.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO officials said allied peacekeeping troops, now
numbering 15,000 are making headway into Kosovo and patrolling
parts of the province. But it will be at least a month before the
full force of 50,000 is in place, spokesman Jamie Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   US and Russian officials meeting in Helsinki failed Thursday to
agree to a plan for integrating Russian troops into the NATO-led
force, but Defense Secretary William Cohen said progress had been
made, and the talks would resume Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The pullout of Serb military units from Kosovo is on schedule
and should be completed Sunday, NATO officials said. Of the 41,000
Serb forces in Kosovo, 26,000 already have withdrawn, along with at
least half of their tanks, artillery pieces, and armored personnel
carriers. The demilitarization of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
is not going as smoothly yet, the officials acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, two KLA rebels were brought into Pec with gunshot
wounds, presumably the victims of Serb snipers. Italy's ANSA news
agency reported violent clashes between Serb paramilitary groups
and KLA fighters in Klina, near Pec, where Italian peacekeeping
forces are headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   In Pec, Italian troops watched passively from tanks as KLA
soldiers checked cars. Under a midday rainshower, young rebel
guards confiscated two hand grenades from a Serbian driving a
silver Mercedes _ one from the pocket of his pants and the other
from under a box of cookies in the front seat.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Kosovo is open and under control by peacekeeping forces
_ with the visible assistance of the KLA _ the effort to account
for the missing has begun in earnest. Terrible reports are coming
from Kosovars who stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
   The road into Pec is clogged with dead horses and farm animals.
It smells of rotting carcasses and recently burned buildings. The
few locals left say the Serb paramilitary set fires as late as
Thursday, when they made their final pullout.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of Pec, where is now nearly a ghost town,
appears to have been organized and calculated. Even the small
kiosks on the street were subject to the selection process:
Albanian newsstands are shells of blackened metal, while the Serb
kiosks were left untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Houses spray-painted with the word ``Serbia'' _ meaning they
were owned by Serbs who may also have fled _ were intact. Next
door, the homes of their Albanian neighbors were demolished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I survived. I was hiding all the time,
running from house to house,'' said Ram Belagu, 24, the only member
of his family to remain in Pec. ``They burned even today,'' Belagu
said. ``They (peacekeepers) didn't do anything. They thought the
paramilitary were gone. I guess they were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   During his nearly three months in hiding, Belagu said, he once
went for four days without a meal, eating grass to stay alive.
Ashamed, Belagu said he had to take food from burned and looted
houses of his neighbors to have something to eat. ``You can't
imagine what it was like,'' the gaunt Belagu said.
</P>
<P>
   In Djakovica, residents speak of a mass grave holding as many as
150 bodies, near a lake in town. The area is off-limits because of
the danger of landmines, so no one has ventured near the site. The
fate of some 1,200 men rounded up by the Serbs is still unknown;
the most hopeful theory is that they were taken to a prison in
upper Serbia.

 LE BOURGET: FAA certification.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Liberated East European countries dumped their Russian planes,
opting for more modern and cost-efficient Airbus and Boeing jets.
Even Aeroflot decided to buy Boeing 737s and leases Airbus A310s
and two wide-body Boeing 777s.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow-based Ilyushin teamed up with its factories in Voronezh
and Tashkent to form a joint-stock company. (The Tashkent deal was
delayed because the governments of Russia and Uzbekistan first had
to work out a two-way agreement.) In addition to the new IL-96,
Ilyushin now makes the IL-114, a regional two-engine prop, the
four-engine IL-76 cargo jet, and the IL-103, a small, single-engine
private plane that in December was actually the first Russian
airplane to receive FAA certification.
</P>
<P>
   So far, business has not been good. A decade ago, 60 IL-76s were
made each year; last year just 15 were produced. And while China
bought three wide-body IL-86 passenger jets and one IL-76 freighter
three years ago, most of the new Ilyushins now coming off the
assembly line are flown by Russian airlines that lack the money to
pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Belyakov estimated that around 1,500 Ilyushins, ranging from the
four-engine prop IL-18s of the 1950s to the wide-body 350-passenger
IL-86s of the 1970s, remain in service in Russia and places like
China, Cuba, India and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The new, Westernized version of the IL-96 is based on the
all-Russian IL-96-300, which went into service in 1993. It is
currently flown only by Russian airlines and serves as the official
plane of President Boris Yeltsin. The IL-96M, which is the
soon-to-be-introduced passenger version of the new airplane, can
carry up to 436 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the IL-96T, which is the cargo version and the
first of the planes to come off the assembly line, can carry as
much as 92 tons more than 7,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it smaller than the biggest Boeing 747 freighter,
which can carry up to 140 tons. But Genrikh Novozhilov, Ilyushin's
chief airplane designer since 1970, said the IL-96T's 16-foot-wide
and 9-1/2-foot-high side cargo door, which is bigger than any
competitor's, gave it a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   And at an asking price of $75 million, the plane is less than
half the list price of a new 747, even though it has the latest
high-tech American cockpit instruments and fuel-efficient American
engines. Thus, its backers claim, the IL-96T could find a ready
market, even a huge one, from cash-strapped customers that need
cheap hauling capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a bad airplane,'' said Edwin Laird, the publisher of
Cargo Facts, a monthly magazine that focuses on freight airplanes,
as he watched the IL-96T lumber along the runway into take-off
position for its demonstration flight here. But that is a just a
small part of the equation, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines are not worried about the engines or the
avionics, which are all made in America,'' he said. ``They are
worried about everything else. What do you do if it breaks down? Do
you go out in the back yard and make a part?'' He said he doubted
there would be much of a market for the plane outside Russia until
it had proven itself.
</P>
<P>
   Belyakov said Ilyushin was prepared to offer airlines a global
support network with the help of Pratt &AMP; Whitney and others. The
real problem, he said, is that Ilyushin lacks the money to help
customers finance the purchase of its planes.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA certification will help with that. Uncertified planes
like the IL-96-300 are allowed to fly back and forth between the
United States and Russia but it is very difficult to sell airplanes
in third countries without a stamp of approval from U.S. or
European safety authorities. Few banks and other financial
institutions will lend money to finance the sale of an uncertified
airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Belyakov said that Ilyushin was now looking for alternative ways
to finance the Aeroflot sale to make up for the $1 billion
Export-Import Bank loan, which was to pay for 85 percent of the
Western content of the first 20 airplanes. Ilyushin's plan is to
deliver the planes to the Russian airline as soon as it can so it
can show the world how well the IL-96 can perform in commercial
service. But Ilyushin executives were busy entertaining prospective
customers at the air show here and were said to have some interest
from airlines in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of opportunity for it in the CIS,'' said Louis
Chenevert, the president of Pratt &AMP; Whitney, referring to the
Commonwealth of Independent States, the loose confederation
comprised of most of the former Soviet republics. ``But as the
airplane builds credibility for itself, it will gain customers all
over the world. The airplane will do well over the next couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Airbus and Boeing should lose any sleep. Together, they
will deliver more than 900 new airplanes this year, while Ilyushin
will be lucky to deliver one of its IL-96s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA certification will ease access to international
capital for us and for our customers,'' Belyakov said. ``We are
rising to the same level of competitiveness with the Western-made
aircraft.''

GORE CLAIMS PARTIAL CREDIT FOR BOOMING U.S. ECONOMY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Standing at a historic building on Wall Street, Vice
President Al Gore claimed partial credit Thursday for the nation's
economic boom _ and encountered some of the trip wires of New York
politics.
</P>
<P>
   On tour to announce his candidacy for president, Gore spoke at a
campaign rally from the steps of Federal Hall in the heart of
Manhattan's financial district, where gains in the stock market
have transformed the economy. He declared that the nation is
enjoying its strongest economy ever ``under the policies President
Clinton and I have proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the nation's prosperity was seeded by the
policies of GOP presidents Reagan and Bush. But Gore said it was
not until seven years ago, when the Democrats took over the White
House, that the nation started achieving unprecedented job growth
and the erasure of the federal government's budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remember what it was like seven years ago. And I never ever
want to go back,'' Gore said in a refrain he has developed for his
presidential campaign. It refers not only to Republican economic
policies in general, but to the administration of George Bush,
father of the front-runner for the 2000 presidential nomination,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing the symbols for Gore's message, one supporter at the
rally held a sign saying ``Keep the Bull Market, Vote Gore.'' A
group of children held Gore campaign signs while wearing caps
embossed with the words ``Lehman Brothers,'' an investment banking
firm.
</P>
<P>
   But economic prosperity aside, Gore is fighting for political
attention in New York with another Clinton Democrat, first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton. She is raising money for a possible run for
a U.S. Senate seat from New York, and her potential match-up
against Republican New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has sometimes
made the budding presidential race a mere sideshow for Democrats
here.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about the first lady's possible candidacy, Gore
told reporters on the flight to New York, ``I've already addressed
that issue; I'm all for it.'' He said her campaign would generate
enthusiasm among Democratic voters in New York and across the
country, benefiting the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally, Gore's speech was interrupted by the shouts and
whistle-blowing of six protestors claiming that he has protected
U.S. drug manufacturers by opposing production of cheaper, generic
AIDS drug in Africa. Small groups pushing the same issue disrupted
Gore's speeches earlier Thursday in New Hampshire and Wednesday in
Carthage, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   This time, mindful that Manhattan's Federal Hall was where the
Constitutional Congress met and George Washington took the oath of
office as president, Gore shouted back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our First Amendment was born right here on this spot. We honor
it,'' he said. ``Let's give a hand to those who are exercising
their First Amendment rights . . . make it louder! Let's hear it
for the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of a few thousand, which had treated Gore's speech
with more quiet curiosity than cheers, complied by drowning out the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   New York is where Gore's first campaign for president, in 1988,
ran out of gas. Then a U.S. senator from Tennessee, he withdrew
from the Democratic presidential contest after a weak third-place
showing in the New York primary, his campaign $1.6 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   This time his party primary foe has a New York connection and is
from New Jersey, just across the Hudson River: former U.S. Sen.
Bill Bradley, who was a star for the New York Knicks basketball
team.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Manchester, N.H., Gore proposed business tax cuts,
new trade policies and government-funded training for the expansion
of the Internet and high technology.
</P>
<P>
   It was a two-pronged campaign statement: New Hampshire is
recovering from economic problems thanks to the growth of computer
industry jobs and is also the site of the first presidential
primary next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are my proposals to spur innovation for the 21st
century,'' Gore said, in character as a technology and science buff
who promotes those subjects well beyond their usual limit in
campaign politics.
</P>
<P>
   But also to keep part of the focus on his formal announcement as
a presidential candidate, made Wednesday, Gore talked to the
audience at a forum at Hesser College about his theme of family
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask for your help to strengthen family life in America,'' he
said. ``And I make you this pledge: if you entrust me with the
presidency, I will marshal its authority, its resources and its
moral leadership to fight for America's families.''
</P>
<P>
   Moral leadership is one of President Clinton's biggest
weaknesses in the eyes of most voters, and Gore has set out as a
candidate to distance himself from Clinton on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Four AIDS protestors came within a few feet of the vice
president at the forum as they shouted jeers. Law enforcement
officers escorted them from the college.
</P>
<P>
   The African ``crisis of AIDS'' was ignored too long, Gore said,
but now the United States is leading the way in providing
assistance to fight the disease.

`AN IDEAL HUSBAND': WILDE AS SENSITIVE GUY, SO WISE AND
INSIGHTFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Political blackmail, insider trading, incriminating documents,
sex as a bargaining tool, potential trial by tabloid and
sanctimonious public oratory masking frantic behind-the-scenes
wheeling and dealing. In some ways, the world of Oscar Wilde's 1895
play ``An Ideal Husband'' seems awfully familiar.
</P>
<P>
   As Oliver Parker's likable, handsome but diluted film adaptation
of Wilde's melodramatic comedy enfolds you in a dream world of
grand Belgravia houses swarming with Victorian London's beautiful
people, madly flirting and exchanging bons mots, it's easy to sink
into a ``Masterpiece Theater'' fantasy of traveling back to a more
civilized time and place. Life at the top has rarely looked or
sounded more fabulously elegant.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' begins with a grand, formal reception at
which the dashing Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam) is accosted
by Mrs. Cheveley (Julianne Moore), a beautiful expatriate
adventurer who has traveled all the way from her home in Vienna to
make him an offer he can't refuse. If Robert will reverse his
position in Parliament and support a risky, highly questionable
Argentine canal project in which she has invested all her money,
she will return an incriminating letter he wrote 18 years ago. If
he doesn't, she warns coyly, she will take the letter to the
newspapers and ruin his career.
</P>
<P>
   The letter reveals that Robert once provided an Austrian baron
and close friend of Mrs. Cheveley's with secret information from
the British Foreign Office regarding shares in the Suez Canal. The
baron subsequently gave a percentage of the fortune he reaped from
this privileged information to Robert. The money became the
foundation of Robert's own fortune and brilliant career in
government.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is not only Robert's political career but also his
ecstatically happy marriage to his beautiful and moralistic wife,
Gertrude (Cate Blanchett), who worships him as a paragon of virtue.
If Gertrude were to discover that he was less than perfect, he
confides to his best friend, Lord Arthur Goring (Rupert Everett),
she would be devastated and their marriage destroyed. Arthur, a
cynical, indolent playboy (and Wilde surrogate) who was once
romantically involved with Mrs. Cheveley, advises Robert to confess
everything to his wife and seek her forgiveness and support. But
Robert, fearing Gertrude's inflexibility, balks.
</P>
<P>
   This elaborate setup is much richer than its neatly contrived
resolution, which involves people listening behind doors and a
high-stakes wager between Arthur and Mrs. Cheveley that shifts the
emphasis of the story away from politics toward romance. Also
hanging around waiting for Arthur to notice her is Robert's plucky
sister, Mabel (Minnie Driver, in a terribly underwritten role).
</P>
<P>
   In the end, greed turns out to be no match against charm. The
repository of that charm is Arthur, the ultimate catch, who is
presented as the late-Victorian equivalent of Warren Beatty or John
F. Kennedy Jr. in their bachelor days. Far from being a silly, idle
twit, Arthur reveals previously undisclosed reserves of wisdom,
insight and moral consistency. The dandy who jokes that ``to love
oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance'' also turns out to
have been waiting all along for Miss Right. He is the only major
character to emerge untainted by hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   In adapting the play, Parker has streamlined and rewritten
Wilde's dialogue, keeping some (but not all) of Wilde's biting
epigrams and scraping off a lot (perhaps too much) of the Victorian
crust. As the movie zips along (especially in its second half), the
drama begins to thin as the all's-well-that-ends-well mechanics go
into motion. The movie's final scenes seem rushed, hollow and
stagy, the passionate kisses unearned.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's Arthur is the subtlest and deepest performance in an
ensemble that meshes fairly well while never quite finding the
seamless groove of a first-rate stage production. Instead of
adopting a conventional Wildean posture and tossing off epigrams
like a self-satisfied fop ostentatiously strewing flowers from his
buttonholes, Everett's Arthur is a sullen, secretive gentleman
rebel concealing his sensitivity beneath a facade of blase
rakishness. Because the clever words leak out of him instead of
being launched like missiles, what he says is all the more truthful
and personal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blanchett's Gertrude strikes a winning balance between
prudery and warmth with her performance of a hopelessly dated
Victorian stereotype, revealing still another side of the actress'
chameleon skills. Northam's Robert is every inch the dashing
Victorian hero, perfect but for one crucial blemish. Ms. Moore's
slightly too sweet Mrs. Cheveley and Ms. Driver's mugging,
eye-rolling Mabel just miss hitting the right sour and comic notes.
</P>
<P>
   If ``An Ideal Husband'' transports us back to a world that seems
more refined than ours, it also flatters us, as Wilde flattered the
play's fin de siecle audience, by arriving at a
plain-as-the-nose-on-your-face piece of wisdom that after all the
preceding badinage may seem more profound than it really is.
Hollywood couldn't come up with a tidier feel-good ending _ one
that gets everybody off the hook _ than ``An Ideal Husband's''
concluding moral: Nobody's perfect.

THE POPE'S LAST DAY IN POLAND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KRAKOW, Poland _ Bidding farewell to Poland, Pope John Paul II
made a stop Thursday at his and his country's most venerated
shrine, the Black Madonna of Czestochowa, a medieval icon of the
Virgin Mary that for Poles also carries vast patriotic
significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got used to coming here and bringing our personal and
family matters, as well as the vital issues of the nation,'' the
pope said after praying at the shrine, in a monastery on a hill in
central Poland. He asked the Madonna, who Poles believe have
protected their country throughout every threat, from 13th-century
Tatars to the Nazis and then the Communists, to see Poland safely
into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, 79, who fell ill for a day on his eighth and longest
visit to Poland, made a more personal stop before returning to
Rome, praying at the grave of his parents at Rakowice cemetery near
here. He also celebrated a Mass and kissed the relics of St.
Stanislaw, an 11th-century bishop and martyr, at the Cathedral on
Wawel Hill, where almost every Polish hero, king and martyr is
buried.
</P>
<P>
   Huge, ecstatic crowds have greeted him at every stop, recreating
some of the euphoria that his presence sparked in trips when Poland
was still under Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Every stop _ from his arrival at Gdansk, where 20 years ago he
helped set off the Solidarity movement that toppled Communism, to
his nostalgic visit on Wednesday to his hometown, Wadowice _ has
resonated with the extraordinary twin fates of Poland and his
pontificate over the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But John Paul has used this voyage to extend his countrymen's
memories, linking the recent past with the last 1,000 years of
Polish history. In his vision, Poland's history and survival are
inseparably entwined with its Christian faith, and he wants a new
generation of Poles to keep that legacy paramount as they grapple
with the secular temptations of their new democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding farewell at the airport, he said, ``During this
pilgrimage, on the eve of the Great Jubilee of the year 2,000, it
has been granted to us to return to the places, events and people
who bear eloquent witness to the fact that during the thousand
tears of the church's life in our homeland, the mystery of the
Incarnation of the Son of God and his redeeming work has penetrated
deeply into its history.''
</P>
<P>
   His message has been solemn, but the pope, despite a fever that
forced him to cancel appearances on Tuesday, has seemed happy and
lighthearted, joking with crowds. Thursday, at a surprise stop in
Gliwice, a town in the industrial region of Silesia, to make up for
canceling his scheduled appearance on Tuesday, he hinted that this
was not a valedictory tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until next time,'' he told several hundred thousand people
cheering him on. ``Thank God for your holy patience with the pope _
one can see that a Silesian is patient and sturdy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself wouldn't put up with such a pope,'' he said. ``When
the pope is supposed to come, he doesn't, and when he is not
supposed to come, he arrives.'' The crowd chanted a Polish
expression of forgiveness that translates, ``No harm done.'' The
pope replied, ``I go to Rome with a peaceful conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   As he grows older and frailer, the pope's memories of his youth
seem to grow stronger. In Wadowice, he remembered street names,
bakeries, school plays and old friends in a cheerful stream of
consciousness that delighted the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   World War II and the suffering of Poles under Nazi occupation
have also been a theme of the Pope's trip. Before the war, Wadowice
was 20 percent Jewish, and unlike many Polish communities then, it
had little overt anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   As he commemorated Polish suffering during the war, he has also
sought to remind Poles also of the fate of the Jews during the
Holocaust. But his efforts at reconciliation have repeatedly been
interrupted by vivid reminders that the wounds of World War II are
still fresh in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   In Warsaw, the grand rabbi of Poland breached protocol in a
reception line to implore the pope to instruct his church to remove
the last remaining cross at Auschwitz. That issue has divided
Catholics and Jews in Poland since the cross was placed outside the
camp walls in 1989.

ILO ADOPTS TREAT AIMED AT ABOLISHING WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Germany, The Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Denmark
and France)   By ELIZABETH OLSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The International Labor Organization Thursday adopted a
treaty meant to abolish the worst forms of child labor, one that
includes a contested provision allowing people under 18 to serve in
the military. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pact hopes to end the exploitation of millions of children,
who are involved in pornography, prostitution, slavery, hazardous
work and forced recruitment as child soldiers. Drawing attention to
the treaty, President Clinton addressed the delegates, the first
American president to do so. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adopted unanimously by delegates from the 174 country members of
the ILO, the convention aims to protect those under 18 but does not
provide an across-the-board ban on child labor. The treaty's text
does not prohibit people under 18 from voluntarily enlisting in the
military, an omission which non-governmental groups and some
governments believe weakens the document. A compromise was adopted
after insistence by the United States that there be no bar to such
military service. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A number of countries, including the United States, Britain,
Germany and the Netherlands, recruit 17-year-olds into their
armies. The United States, among others, requires parental consent.
U.S. officials estimated that the American military services have
fewer than 10,000 enlistees per year under 18. Of these, fewer than
100 are involved in combat units, and those are in the Balkan
region, officials said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The compromise treaty language now bars ``forced or compulsory
recruitment of children for use in armed conflict.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trade unions, along with a diverse group of countries, including
Canada, Norway, Denmark and France, had urged tougher provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it's not appropriate for people under age 18 to be
involved in the military,'' said Tim Noonan, of the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions, which supported a blanket
prohibition on child labor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defending the administration's position, the American Labor
Secretary, Alexis Herman, said, ``We wanted to make sure the
emphasis was on forced, compulsory child labor.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Martin McPherson, of Amnesty International, disagreed. ``In
the end, it makes no difference whether the person has gone
voluntarily or compulsorily,'' he said. ``Military service is
hazardous - regardless.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Noonan said trade unions wanted a flat ban, the
compromise was agreed to because ``our primary concern was children
in Uganda and Sudan _ the 10- and 12 year-olds with guns.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, who declined to be named, said many countries
allow 17-year-olds to serve voluntarily. ``Our concern is about the
use of the younger ones being abducted and coerced by
paramilitaries and militias,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty says there are an estimated 300,000 such child soldiers
worldwide. They are among the estimated 250 million children under
age 14 who, according to ILO statistics, work in developing
countries, mainly in Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   An ILO treaty adopted in 1973 that set a minimum age for child
labor, has been ratified by 74 countries. The United States is not
among them, although Clinton promised he would quickly send the
treaty to the Senate. &QL;

 &HT;    Atlanta Olympic officials aim to restrict records access
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After initially pledging full cooperation, Atlanta
Olympic officials now want to restrict federal investigators from
photocopying certain documents among eight boxes of papers they
want to keep out of the public's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing Olympic officials have refused to give U.S.
House Commerce Committee investigators unrestricted access to the
documents, which they consider private and sensitive. The lawyers
contend the records do not relate directly to information sought by
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   However, the congressional investigators think the disputed
records are pertinent and want permission to photocopy anything
they deem necessary.
</P>
<P>
   After first refusing to allow the investigators to copy anything
from the restricted boxes, Olympic officials then asked them to
flag specific sensitive documents they want to copy. Each requested
document then would be considered individually.
</P>
<P>
   But that process was unacceptable to the congressional
investigators, who insist on unfettered access. The papers at issue
were purged from the bid files that Olympic officials say they
eventually will open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the documents which we have said many times pertain
to the established rights to privacy of the Olympic volunteers and
donors, and we continue to believe that these documents legally
have a right to remain private,'' said Lee Echols, spokesman for
the Georgia Amateur Athletics Federation. The GAAF is the group
that successfully bid for the '96 Olympic Games and claims
ownership of the documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not withholding these documents from the committee's
investigators,'' he said, ``but we've been discussing the merits of
what to copy from these documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, any documents in the possession of Congress
eventually could be made available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional committee, which is investigating whether
Atlanta Olympic officials violated federal fraud and bribery laws,
could subpoena the records if Olympic officials decline to turn the
records over.

 &HT;    Canadian killer is executed in Texas
 &HT;    By Jerry Graham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE _ Joseph Stanley Faulder's 24-year battle for his
life ended Thursday in the Texas death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   He was pronounced dead at 6:18 p.m. after being convicted of
capital murder in the July 9, 1975, slaying of Inez Phillips, 75,
of Gladewater.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Phillips was killed during a robbery in her home. She was
impaled with a butcher knife, which was plunged into her chest and
exited from her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 24-year fight is over. And it is about time,'' Gregg County
District Attorney Bill Jennings said upon learning of Faulder's
death. ``It is hard to believe that it is over Faulder, 61, was
arrested two years after the murder, and his attorneys successfully
postponed his execution nine times. Thursday was his 10th and last
execution date.
</P>
<P>
   His execution came just three weeks shy of the 24th anniversary
of Mrs. Phillips' death.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Sandra Babcock of Minneapolis, during the past two
weeks, filed a flurry of motions, petitions, writs and lawsuits.
One was pending before the U.S. Supreme Court as late as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She succeeded in halting his execution with 30 minutes to spare
last Dec. 10, when the Supreme Court granted a stay of execution,
which it vacated a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   But Babcock's efforts were to no avail Thursday, and Faulder
died with a fatal injection of poison into his veins in Texas'
death chamber at the Walls Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice Institutional Division in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder was the 178th person to die since Texas resumed
executions in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He was the 14th executed this year. Eleven others have execution
dates set, and 462 are on death row, according to prison
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed on the Texas death row 8,221 days (22.52 years),
second only to Robert Excel White, who was executed March 30 after
8,977 days (24 years, six months) on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Mrs. Phillips were dismayed and disgusted that
Faulder had evaded the executioner nine times. The 10th execution
date affected Faulder, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why don't you guys just go ahead and kill me or cut me free,''
prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said Faulder told him two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As he was being ready for the trip into the death chamber
Thursday, Faulder told prison officials, ''I'm at peace with my
maker. I'm ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulder was born in Canada, and his case attracted massive media
attention in his native land, which abolished the death penalty in
1976. He became the first Canadian since 1952 to be executed in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues Babcock raised in her numerous writs was the
failure of local officers to notify the Canadian consulate that he
had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The Vienna Convention on Consular Affairs, a treaty signed by
the United States, requires local officials to notify a foreign
country's consular office anytime a person from the foreign country
is arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Local officers said they were unaware of the treaty, and did not
know Faulder was a Canadian citizen because he had a Texas drivers
license at the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans brushed the
complaint aside. In a written opinion, the court said if the consul
had been notified, the consul could have done nothing more than was
done by Faulder's court-appointed attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in effect endorsed that decision when it
refused to hear an appeal on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asked Gov. George W.
Bush to grant clemency because of concerns over the consular
matter. Bush declined Thursday to grant a reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock also contended that Faulder suffered head injuries which
changed his personality when he fell out of a moving car at age 3.
She argued the jury should have been told about the injury, but
appellate courts declined to grant a new trial on those grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Babcock filed suit contending Faulder should be
granted clemency because officials had subjected him to
psychological torture by scheduling his execution 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   The courts discarded that theory with the observation that so
many execution dates were set because he had successfully obtained
stays so that the courts could consider other legal issues he had
raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not forget that the Phillips family has figuratively
been to death row on those nine previous occasions as well. Last
December, when justice and the jury's verdict were only a half hour
away, a last-minute stay snatched justice from their grasp one more
time,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often after the verdict is read and the jury spoken, we
forget the survivors. We must not forget that this has been a
24-year ordeal for the Phillips family as well,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until Faulder was declared dead was justice finally
rendered for Faulder, Inez Phillips, her family and the citizens of
the state of Texas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings noted that Faulder was tried before two different
juries and the 24 collective jurors ``thought that Joseph Stanley
Faulder was guilty and the crime so heinous that nothing less than
a death sentence was warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings expressed thanks to all the officials and officers who
helped push the case through to the end and to ``the Phillips
family who patiently endured 24-years of a judicial process
designed to protect the rights of an accused murderer.''

COMMENTARY: BARAK IN A HARD PLACE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ If you want to understand why Israel's Ehud
Barak has had such a hard time forming a new government after
winning a landslide victory last month, you can reduce it to one
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Israel's new Knesset, its parliament, was sworn in. At
the start of the ceremony all members were asked to stand and sing
``Hatikva,'' the Israeli national anthem. Nearly 30 of the 120
members of the Knesset weren't singing. These were the non-Zionist
members, ranging from Israeli Arabs to ultra-Orthodox Jews, who
share an ambivalence toward the secular Israeli state.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to form a government from such pieces _ one that can
simultaneously implement Barak's domestic agenda and the peace
process _ is turning out to be Barak's Rubik's Cube. Every time he
thinks he's got all the squares right, one pops up that doesn't
fit.
</P>
<P>
   To have a majority to pursue the peace process, Barak wants the
ultra-Orthodox Sephardi party, Shas, which has 17 seats and is now
the third-largest party, in his Cabinet. Shas cares about its
schools and social service networks and would go along with any
peace deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But if Barak brings in Shas he will probably lose Meretz and
Shinui, ultra-secular, pork-eating parties that won record votes by
vowing to strip Shas of government aid and to force Shas boys to
serve in the army. And Barak needs Meretz and Shinui to implement
his domestic agenda _ creating a bill of rights and shifting
spending from the ultra-Orthodox to secular schools and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, who Barak chooses to include in his government
should indicate which priority he will focus on first: the peace
process or domestic reform. It appears he is going to opt to bring
in Shas and focus first on the peace process, because as complex as
that is, domestic reform is even harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess right now is that Barak is going to go for the easy
stuff _ dealing with Hafez al-Assad,'' quipped Haaretz diplomatic
correspondent David Makovsky.
</P>
<P>
   That's not surprising. After all, what the Israeli election
revealed was that there is now a widening consensus in Israel on
how to live apart from the Arabs _ there is going to be a
demilitarized Palestinian state _ but there is still no Israeli
consensus on how to live together with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what is on the minds of most Israelis today is the size
of their children's school classes, not the size of Israeli
sovereignty in the West Bank. What's on their minds is the divide
between the secular Jews of South Jerusalem and the ultra-Orthodox
Jews of North Jerusalem, not the divide between the Arabs of East
Jerusalem and the Jews of West Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   As such, even if he wants to start with the peace process, it is
only a matter of time before Barak will be conducting two
mega-negotiations at once _ one between Arabs and Jews over what
size Israel, and the other between Jews and Jews over what kind of
Israel _ in particular, what will be the relationship between the
secular, liberal majority and the fundamentalist, traditional
minorities and underclasses led by Shas.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs Shas to give him cover for a deal with the Arabs and
to be his main partner for a deal among the Jews. Forget about the
Likud. It's dying as a significant party. Shas is now the real
alternative to the secular, free-market, liberal, democratic vision
represented by Labor, Meretz and Shinui.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Barak years could be very interesting. Both the
hibernating peace process, which will assert itself, and the
domestic agenda, which Israelis are clamoring to have addressed,
have ripened to the point where incrementalism or delay are no
longer possible.
</P>
<P>
   The next stage of peace talks will involve giving up land and
settlements. The next stage of domestic reform will be about
whether or not the state is going to continue subsidizing the
ultra-Orthodox, absenting them from army service and letting them
snub the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Barak may not be able to close the gaps on these issues, but
unlike his predecessor, he is going to make an honest effort, with
a real strategy. We are now going to find out exactly what is and
is not possible.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the Barak years will either mark the birth of the
Second Israeli Republic, when a new set of basic rules for
Arab-Israeli and Israeli-Israeli relations began to be forged, or
they will be the years when both Arab-Israeli and Israeli-Israeli
relations exploded at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Caution: Big Decisions Ahead.

 &HT;    European governments keep partial ban on Coke products
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. can resume selling some of its drinks in
Belgium, but not its key brands of Coke, Sprite and Fanta.
</P>
<P>
   The government is keeping a partial ban in place because it is
still not satisfied with the Atlanta-based company's explanation of
what caused illnesses in more than 100 consumers of its soft
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the basis of the elements presented by Coca-Cola ... it is
not possible at this stage to explain in a pacifying and
satisfactory way the outbreak of these symptoms of illness,'' the
Belgian Health Ministry said Thursday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola said the contamination arose from two separate causes:
defective carbon dioxide injected into drinks at a plant in
Antwerp, Belgium, and an offensive odor on the outside bottom of
cans produced at a plant in Dunkirk, France. The company said the
odor originated from a fungicide sprayed on wooden pallets carrying
cans that were sent to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials in both Belgium and France appear to be
focusing on whether the fungicide alone could have been responsible
for the illnesses linked to the Dunkirk cans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to meeting with the (Belgian) ministry on
Friday so that we can present further evidence that we hope will
convince the minister to allow us to resume distribution of our
entire product line,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Robert Baskin.
</P>
<P>
   The French government said Thursday it has commissioned tests to
see if something besides the fungicide may have contributed to the
sicknesses. Coca-Cola also has conducted tests.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin said the company was pleased that it can return many of
its products to the shelves in Belgium, but disappointed that the
government has not allowed a full return of its brands.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's developments mean the company remains embroiled in a
public relations nightmare that is spreading in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland on Thursday joined several other European nations
that have either removed the company's products from their shelves
or restricted shipments from the bottling plants involved in the
illnesses. Those nations include Luxembourg, France, Spain, Germany
and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern because this thing has dragged out,'' said
Manny Goldman, a global beverage analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``Coke
has never had to go through something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the company's biggest recall in its 113 years of
operation. But most industry analysts believe the world's largest
beverage company will be able to restore public confidence and its
image over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be clear. Coke has a marketing machine, and once they
push the button they'll have the full array of brands back in the
distribution network,'' said Scott Wilkins, a beverage analyst for
Deutsche Bank. ``The ability to regain confidence with the consumer
is easier when there's not been a severe illness.''

   Belgium's health minister said Thursday that there was no

reported cases of hemolysis, a condition that destroys red blood
cells. Most of the ill in Belgium were students suffering from
nausea, vomiting or stomach aches.

Belgium with a doctor's certificate showing the illness was caused
by drinking one of the company's products.

definitive proof that Coca-Cola drinks caused sickness among 80
people who live near the Dunkirk plant.

$64.56 1/4.

 &HT;    European governments keep partial ban on Coke products
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. can resume selling some of its drinks in
Belgium, but not its key brands of Coke, Sprite and Fanta.
</P>
<P>
   The government is keeping a partial ban in place because it is
still not satisfied with the Atlanta-based company's explanation of
what caused illnesses in more than 100 consumers of its soft
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the basis of the elements presented by Coca-Cola ... it is
not possible at this stage to explain in a pacifying and
satisfactory way the outbreak of these symptoms of illness,'' the
Belgian Health Ministry said Thursday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola said the contamination arose from two separate causes:
defective carbon dioxide injected into drinks at a plant in
Antwerp, Belgium, and an offensive odor on the outside bottom of
cans produced at a plant in Dunkirk, France. The company said the
odor originated from a fungicide sprayed on wooden pallets carrying
cans that were sent to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials in both Belgium and France appear to be
focusing on whether the fungicide alone could have been responsible
for the illnesses linked to the Dunkirk cans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to meeting with the (Belgian) ministry on
Friday so that we can present further evidence that we hope will
convince the minister to allow us to resume distribution of our
entire product line,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Robert Baskin.
</P>
<P>
   The French government said Thursday it has commissioned tests to
see if something besides the fungicide may have contributed to the
sicknesses. Coca-Cola also has conducted tests.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin said the company was pleased that it can return many of
its products to the shelves in Belgium, but disappointed that the
government has not allowed a full return of its brands.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's developments mean the company remains embroiled in a
public relations nightmare that is spreading in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland on Thursday joined several other European nations
that have either removed the company's products from their shelves
or restricted shipments from the bottling plants involved in the
illnesses. Those nations include Luxembourg, France, Spain, Germany
and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern because this thing has dragged out,'' said
Manny Goldman, a global beverage analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``Coke
has never had to go through something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the company's biggest recall in its 113 years of
operation. But most industry analysts believe the world's largest
beverage company will be able to restore public confidence and its
image over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be clear. Coke has a marketing machine, and once they
push the button they'll have the full array of brands back in the
distribution network,'' said Scott Wilkins, a beverage analyst for
Deutsche Bank. ``The ability to regain confidence with the consumer
is easier when there's not been a severe illness.''

WORLD CUP? SOUNDS LIKE A KICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: What could possibly be more boring than
watching soccer on TV?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Watching women's soccer on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, smart guy. But not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd argue that it's a much more fun sport to watch than men's
soccer,'' said Geoff Mason, the executive producer for ABC and
ESPN's total coverage of the FIFA Women's World Cup that begins
Saturday with the U.S.-Denmark match at noon on Channel 7.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's not going too far out on a limb to say just about
(begin ital)anything(end ital) would be more enjoyable than
watching a ball poked around on a large grass field and, if by
accident, finding its way into the oversized net for a goal.
</P>
<P>
   But women's kickball, especially at this level, will be a
different TV drama altogether. Different, as in better.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Mason points out the women players talk much more on
the field to each other. Could it be true _ women express
themselves more verbally than men?
</P>
<P>
   To prove it, ABC and ESPN's coverage will turn up the volume on
the sounds of the game, said Mason, best known for his years behind
making ABC's ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is an easy sport to televise and a difficult sport to
televise well,'' said Mason. ``Soccer purists would have us do it
with just one camera _ and there's validity to that. But it's not
as simple for us to bring the viewer into the event with just that.
So what our focus will be is on audio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone once said that a camera lets you see it, but a
microphone lets you feel it. We'll give it a dimension that's more
real.''
</P>
<P>
   After NBC ignored U.S. women's soccer in the '96 Olympics, ABC
and ESPN will do the opposite here.
</P>
<P>
   During a time on a sports calendar when the NBA Finals, Stanley
Cup Finals, U.S. Open golf tournament and Wimbledon elbow for
attention, the Women's World Cup telecast will make viewers care
about this group of athletes who aren't playing for the money, but
for the love of the sport. Much like viewers saw with the women's
gold-medal winning softball team in the '96 Olympics and hockey
team in the '98 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   And much unlike the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll have to work hard to sell this sport and
the U.S. team,'' Mason said. ``All we really have to do is capture
what they're doing. Just look at the faces and you'll feel their
excitement, charisma and passion. And a winning U.S. team doesn't
need any hype at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting home: Los Angeles-based ESPN reporter Shelley Smith has
a much more personal perspective to add to the upcoming ``Outside
the Lines'' installment entitled ``High School Athletes: Do Jocks
Rule The School?'' that'll debut Monday at 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   With the friction between athletes and non-athletes reportedly
having played a role in the April 20 shooting tragedy at Columbine
High in Littleton, Colo., Smith, who was born and raised in Denver,
has watched her father, a principal at another high school in the
same Jefferson County district, struggle with this issue for years.
Smith also has a 13-year-old daughter who starts junior high next
year and is involved in soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Littleton and then at Conyers, Ga., has
scared the hell out of me because it shows how little we really
know about what's going on in our kids' schools,'' said Smith, who
passed this year on covering her favorite sport, the NBA playoffs,
so she could work on this story and companion piece for ESPN's
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The half-hour show wants to avoid trivializing the Columbine
incident yet use it as a hook for a story that's always been
present in high schools but in the last two months has taken on a
greater focus.
</P>
<P>
   It's an issue that isn't bigger or smaller in any particular
region of the country, Smith found out. Her interview trail took
her locally to Loyola High in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``One student (at Loyola) was a musician who said he and his
friends have been constantly teased by football players and it's
been painful for him,'' said Smith, who also admitted many students
did not want to go on the record on the show for fear of
retaliation against them and their families.
</P>
<P>
   How the media has contributed to this _ the ESPN's and Fox
Sports Nets of the cable world that have boosted the coverage of
high school athletics _ isn't covered much in the special, producer
George Lazarus admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound like the company line, but I'm not sure ESPN
necessarily makes sports more important,'' Lazarus said.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Smith: ``Sure, it's a factor, but it's not the most
compelling reason. We tried to find how the feelings are
transferred and what allows them to feel they can pick on other
kids, what gives them that entitlement.''
</P>
<P>
   A Chilton Poll that ESPN conducted with high schoolers for the
show revealed 72 percent felt there was at least some tension
between athletes and non-athletes in their schools, 78 percent feel
athletes are given preferential treatment by teachers or school
administrators and 60 percent believe athletes feel superior to
non-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   There's also this chilling quote in the special from Lisa Kaune,
a student from Bernardsville, N.J.: ``When I first heard about the
Columbine thing, I kind of thought it was really bad, you know,
because people died. But then I thought it's a victory for the kids
who are different. It's a horrible thing to happen, but in a way,
good came out of it 'cause it kind of scared the rest of the kids
who had to back down, and maybe cause kids in our school to think
that we're going to do something like that.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   _Now that we've got him back _ and only on Pac-10 games _ ABC's
Keith Jackson might !ital!never leave. Whoa... you know the rest.
Said the 71-year-old Jackson: ``In this town, you've got in a sense
two old-timers who are glorious to listen to. (Vin) Scully, he'll
go on forever. And you've got Chick (Hearn) sitting over there _
you might have to shoot him. I don't begin to think I'm in their
class, but I'd like to be. You know, the main problem with being a
legend _ it also means you're not far from being an ancestor. You
have to shake the day and squeeze all you can get out of it.'' &QL; 
_Ah, remember the times when the Lakers played in June? They do
again in an ESPN Classic NBA Finals 15-game marathon that runs from
9 a.m. Saturday through 2:30 p.m. Sunday. It starts with the '70
Lakers-Knicks Game 7 (Saturday, 9 to 11:30 a.m., with Jerry West
vs. Phil Jackson as players) and includes early-Sunday-morning
views of these three in a row: '84 Lakers-Celtics Game 4 (4 a.m.);
'85 Lakers-Celtics Game 4 (6:30 a.m.) and '87 Lakers-Celtics Game 4
(8:30 a.m.). It ends with two of the early Jackson masterpieces
with the '92 Chicago-Portland Game 6 (10:30 a.m.) and the '93
Chicago-Phoenix Game 6 (12:30 p.m.). &QL; 
_A recent issue of Entertainment Weekly cleared up the question:
Who does the hilariously cliche call of the podrace in ``Phanton
Menace''? It's comedian Greg Proops, often seen on ABC's ``Whose
Line Is It Anyway?'' Proops tells EW that he based the voice on Ron
Fairly, the Seattle Mariners' play-by-play man. ``He tends to get
things wrong a lot,'' said Proops of Fairly. ``I took his voice
because I always thought he was hilarious.'' Hasn't Proops heard
Rick Monday?
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   _The excuse NBC has used for not scheduling any of the NBA
Finals games this year on a weekend. By starting with Game 1
Wednesday and putting Game 2 Friday (and avoiding ``Must See
Thursday'' rerun lineup), Game 3 of the Spurs-Knicks from New York
is bumped to Monday. That gives the players more time to rest, NBC
spokesman Ed Markey told Bloomberg News. But when has NBC or the
NBA been concerned about the players' rest time, especially after
cramming in a 50-games-in-80 days regular season? Conveniently,
this arrangement allows NBC to avoid crashing head to head with
CBS' highly rated Sunday night lineup of ``60 Minutes'' and
``Touched by an Angel'' in the East, although the network brass
won't admit it. An NBA Final that started Tuesday-Thursday in San
Antonio and went to Sunday-Tuesday-Thursday in New York and finish
(yeah, right) with Saturday-Sunday back in San Antonio would have
been the norm. Just ask Lakers fans who remember their team having
to endure such a schedule in the past. The reason there was no NBA
game last Sunday _ which could have been Game 1 of the NBA Finals,
even though the Eastern Conference finals ended Friday _ was the
East didn't go a full seven. &QL; 
_NBC's Ahmad Rashad made the prediction Monday on the ``Tonight
Show'' with Jay Leno that the winner of the NBA Finals will be
``either San Antonio or the Knicks.'' &QL; 
_The all-too-overused phrase: ``ESPN's (fill in the beat reporter)
has confirmed that....'' Too many times lately, all that means is
they have access to newspapers and wire services that have already
reported it, and they've just doublechecked it. ESPN has been
disguising this to viewers as breaking news. It just ain't so.
Breaking news is more like what Fox Sports News has done with the
hiring of Phil Jackson and the restructured contract of Shaquille
O'Neal in the past week.

DIVIDED HIGH COURT RULES AGAINST NASA IN UNION REPRESENTATION CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled Thursday that
employees of NASA, and other federal departments, are entitled to
union representation when being questioned by their agency's
inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's 5-4 decision marked a defeat for the space
agency, which had argued that federal law provides for union
participation only when employees are grilled by an agency
``representative.'' A presidentially appointed inspector general,
by contrast, does not represent an agency but rather serves as an
independent ombudsman within a department, trying to uncover
negligence and corruption inside, NASA said.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices rejected the agency's argument, ruling that
inspectors general, though independent, are essentially agents of
the departments to which they are assigned and on whose behalf they
conduct investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had no comment
on the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The case the justices decided arose in 1993 when NASA's Office
of Inspector General sought to question an employee at the agency's
George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. The
employee, identified only as ``P'' in court papers, was suspected
of sending messages in which he threatened to assault co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   A representative from the employee's union, American Federation
of Government Employees, was present when one of the investigators
questioned the worker. But the investigator told the union official
that he could only witness the interrogation and could be called as
a government witness should criminal charges be filed.
</P>
<P>
   The union then filed a grievance with the Federal Labor
Relations Authority, alleging that the inspector general had
violated U.S. law governing labor-management relations by
restricting the union's ability to represent the employee. NASA
countered that the inspector general, because he does not represent
the agency, need not comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   But the FLRA ruled for the union and ordered the space agency
and its inspector general to let union representatives actively
defend employees being interrogated. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta upheld the authority's order, ruling that
inspectors general are representatives of the agencies to which
they are assigned.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department then appealed to the Supreme Court on
NASA's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing with the 11th Circuit's decision, the high court said
inspectors general and their staff are ``unquestionably
representatives'' of the agencies at which they are investigating
potential missteps. For example, an inspector general can sound
much like an agency supervisor in warning an employee that he or
she could be fired for refusing to answer questions, Justice John
Paul Stevens wrote in the court's majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Stevens' opinion in NASA vs. FLRA were Justices Anthony
M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   But dissenting Justice Clarence Thomas assailed the court for
failing to give enough deference to the inspectors general's
statutory responsibility to be independent overseers of federal
agencies. Unlike agency representatives, the inspectors have
unbridled authority to ignore the wishes of department heads in
conducting investigations, Thomas wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Thomas' dissent were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist,
Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.

JONES FIGHTING THROUGH PAIN OF BREAKING UP OLD COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Painful as it may be, go back to Jan. 2, to the
moments just after the favored Cowboys dropped a 20-7 decision to
the Arizona Cardinals in a wild-card playoff game that symbolized
the ailments of an old team.
</P>
<P>
   In the losing locker room, a somber Troy Aikman wrapped up the
sentiments of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``there is a tendency to look at some of
the guys that have been here through the better years and think
that this is the same Cowboys team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not,'' he added, ``the same team.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose translation: Some of us can't do it like we used to.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has been faced with this reality since
the club won its last Super Bowl, after the 1995 season. The hard
part is dealing with it. Once Jones comes to terms with the reality
that some of his superstars aren't as effective as they once were,
he must deal accordingly. The consequences for the ``has-been''
superstar often mean a pay cut, a benching or release from the
team.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes particularly tough if that player has long been an
integral part of the organization's success. But that's Jones' job,
to bypass loyalty issues and separate what was from what is, to, he
said, ``separate what happened in 1992 to what's happening now.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past two off-seasons, Jones has had to make some
pretty tough decisions regarding the ``ugly side of the game.'' To
Jones, not re-signing popular locker-room leaders such as Bill
Bates, Tony Tolbert and Nate Newton must have felt like abandoning
his own sons. Playing financial hardball with Michael Irvin and
Daryl Johnston must feel like denying those sons the use of the
family car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with the professional relationships I have,''
Jones said yesterday as the club wrapped up the final session of a
three-day minicamp. ``Sometimes, when you've got to address
productivity, and what's best to win the games, then it doesn't
feel good, and it can cause you to get a knot in your stomach. Yet
I can reconcile with that. And really, most of the time, in the
case of players or coaches, they know where I'm coming from. They
might not like it. But we all know it has nothing to do with the
past. We're talking about the future here. And you have to be
realistic about that.''
</P>
<P>
   In deciding when to sever relationships with brand-name players
who have, in some cases, been with the Cowboys as long as 10 years,
Jones is lucky that Chan Gailey is his coach. When Gailey was hired
in 1998, the loyalty issue went on the back burner. From afar,
Gailey knew about the past achievements of the Cowboys. Yet the
Troy Aikmans, the Emmitt Smiths, the Michael Irvins, the Deion
Sanderses and the Darren Woodsons had to prove themselves all over
again.
</P>
<P>
   Some did. Some didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotion is a factor, but it doesn't override business,''
Gailey said. ``That's true whether you are talking about IBM,
Burlington Northern or whomever. Business takes precedent over the
loyalty factor, right, wrong, good or bad. That's just the way it
is. You've got to weigh the good and the bad about anyone and make
a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The way it has been is that with all of the big-name stars sent
packing the past few years, the Cowboys could add to their Ring of
Honor. Tolbert, Bates, Newton, the late Mark Tuinei, Jay Novacek
and Charles Haley were household names who became a part of the
housecleaning.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, isn't the first time a great Cowboys dynasty
has been faced with big decisions about aging stars. The Tom
Landry-Tex Schramm-Gil Brandt regime probably didn't part fast
enough with their established veterans and compounded the problem
by not bringing in enough talented players who could keep the club
from bottoming out in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones' Cowboys are to avoid the same mistake, the club owner
must continue to aggressively and, more important, accurately
evaluate the talents of the players who have three Super Bowl
rings.
</P>
<P>
   You can argue with some of the moves Jones has made regarding
his old pros. But at least he is trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, over my life, I'd like to think I've made realistic
decisions by saying that maybe a guy is not the player he was in
1990, and that we can take our resources and get better,'' Jones
said, never once mentioning a specific player. ``Look, we're not
robots. We're human beings. You are going to have feelings for the
people you work with. But we all know the reason we are here. The
only reason we get an opportunity to have anybody interested in
what we are doing is to win the football game. Ultimately, you have
to make decisions to win the football game as best as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if, as Jones is finding out, the decisions are about people
you call friends.

<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Phil Mickelson has a spot atop the leader
board at the U.S. Open ... and a private plane waiting to whisk him
away at a moment's notice, in case something more important
develops.
</P>
<P>
   For Mickelson, that would be a call from his wife, Amy, alerting
him that she has gone into labor with the couple's first child.
Such a call, when placed to the beeper of caddie Jim McKay with the
proper secret code, would trigger an immediate withdrawal by a
player who shot himself into contention yesterday at Pinehurst
Resort and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a U.S. Open every year. Your first child is only born
once,'' Mickelson said. ``I want to be there. That's the most
important thing, as far as my family is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, in Mickelson's estimation, than the 67 he fired
in the opening round to take a share of the lead with three other
golfers. More important, he insists, than trying to protect a
five-stroke lead during Sunday's final round _ scheduled,
appropriately enough, on Father's Day _ if the beeper goes off and
Mickelson must choose between wrapping up his first major
championship or welcoming Amanda Mickelson into the world.
</P>
<P>
   Prenatal tests have determined the unborn child is a girl, and
the couple wasted no time in selecting a name. A test on Tuesday at
an obstetrician's office in Phoenix also indicated that Amy is
unlikely to be born before the June 30 due date, which convinced
the father-to-be to keep his tee time at the Open.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing only one practice round at Pinehurst, Mickelson
put together a five-birdie, two-bogey effort that included a
chip-in for birdie at No. 5 and a 30-foot birdie putt at No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Mickelson said playing with the knowledge he could
leave at any moment relaxes him on the course because it provides
``something to take my mind off a major championship.'' A 13-event
winner on the PGA Tour, Mickelson also has adopted more of a
go-for-broke mentality this week than at any of his 27 previous
majors, none of which he has won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to attack and see if I can win. Otherwise, it's not
worth my time. I'd rather be home with my wife,'' said Mickelson,
29.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Mickelson _ a licensed pilot _ has a private
plane and a co-pilot waiting at the Pinehurst airport. By his
calculations, he could make it from Pinehurst No. 2 to the hospital
in Phoenix where Amy will deliver in 5 hours, 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If McKay receives a beeper message with the secret code,
Mickelson said he will confirm with a call to Amy's cellular phone.
After that, Mickelson said, he's grabbing the first golf cart
headed to the parking lot, regardless of his position on the leader
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care more for my wife and daughter than I ever would about
the game of golf,'' Mickelson said. ``When I was 19 or 20, I would
have had a hard time envisioning that. But in the cycle of life,
things change. If that beeper goes off, I'm out of here.''

CHURCH LEADERS URGE SERBS TO STOP FLIGHT FROM KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ At the Gracanica monastery, the holiest
site in eastern Kosovo, leaders of the Serbian Orthodox Church and
a NATO general joined Thursday night to implore some 2,000 anxious
Serbs to remain in Kosovo rather than follow the thousands who have
fled in long convoys behind withdrawing Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Pavle, Serbian Orthodoxy's highest-ranking cleric,
urged Serbs not to sacrifice the efforts of their forebears to keep
Kosovo Serbian under the Ottoman occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Artemije of Rasca and Prizren called on them to trust
in the peacekeeping forces, known as KFOR, to be patient and to
remain at home for a few days, saying: ``So my message is that our
national interest is to stay in our homes and in our churches and
in our towns and in our Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining them, with a priest translating from the balcony, was a
British major general, John Drewienkiewicz, who said: ``KFOR is
here for all the communities of Kosovo, and that means every one of
you. You live here, and you belong here.'' He promised that an
agreement being worked out ``would lead to the demilitarization of
the so-called KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Drewienkiewicz was chief of operations of the Kosovo
Verification Mission, run by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As Yugoslav forces completed their withdrawal from the south of
Kosovo, the NATO-led peacekeeping forces have been slow to move
into the west of the province, near the Albanian border, creating a
vacuum of authority that has led Serbian civilians to flee, fearing
revenge from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Artemije himself fled the city on Wednesday, despite the
presence of German troops, NATO and U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting here Thursday with the bishop and the patriarch,
the foreign military and political leaders promised all possible
efforts to show their evenhandedness and to convince the minority
Serbs that they will be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Michael Jackson, the commander of KFOR, and Sergio Vieira
de Mello, the special representative of the U.N. secretary general,
apparently failed to convince Bishop Artemije to return immediately
to Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   But he promised Thursday that he would return when security
improves. He was sharply critical of NATO, nonetheless, for
allowing attacks on Serbs fleeing from Prizren, saying: ``Armed
members of the KLA in uniform in the center of the town disarmed
Serbs, kidnapped them and mistreated them,'' and he said that a
priest was arrested by the KLA ``and we don't know where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Vieira de Mello also appeared on Kosovo state
television with local leaders to reassure the Serbs and answer
questions from viewers.
</P>
<P>
   They have met with Albanian political leaders of all stripes,
including Jakup Krasniqi, the political spokesman for the KLA,
urging patience, calm and reconciliation, even as the military is
working out an understanding with the insurgents on how they will
be demilitarized.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Vieira de Mello, who is in charge of
the civilian life of Kosovo, said that the future of the KLA is
political, not military.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no point engaging in this whole operation unless the
ultimate objective is to transform Kosovo into a model of
multiparty democracy that settles arguments without guns,'' he
said. ``So the KLA will become a political force with whatever name
it chooses, while its fighters will presumably demobilize.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the insurgents would form the backbone of a new police
force, Vieira de Mello said that there would be an international
police force set up with some 3,000 foreigners, who would recruit
and train a multiethnic police force. That force would, at least
initially, put Serbian police in Serbian areas and Albanian and
other Muslim minorities as police in their own areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those fighters who wish to apply for the new Kosovo police
force we will set up and train will be welcome to apply,'' he said
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Part of Vieira de Mello's problems are bureaucratic and
institutional. The United Nations is still trying to decide what
``interim civil authority'' means in the Security Council
resolution that governs the Kosovo settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a state within a state, giving Vieira de Mello and his
permanent successor full executive and administrative power here,
like a czar? Or is it a weaker idea, with effective power to be
shared with Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and its designated local leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The presumption here is that the United Nations will opt for a
stronger authority to keep order while a local census, elections
and institutions can be built over time to give Kosovo real
self-government and autonomy within Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For now, Vieira de Mello says he is operating with a skeleton
staff of 20 policy professionals and 10 support people, including
security, all of whom were seconded from other agencies. But now
that the United Nations, only on Monday, advanced its Kosovo
mission some $200 million, he is able to start hiring.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees has only
another 20 people to start, and various charities, like the World
Food Program and Doctors of the World, are beginning to work here
in earnest. They delivered emergency food supplies Thursday
morning, for example, to blasted Albanian villages like Stimlje and
Petrovo, where the Mother Theresa Society, the local Albanian
charity, will distribute aid to the needy, including refugees
returning home from the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is now a heavier KFOR presence along that road, which has
been the scene of heavy KLA sniping and where German and British
journalists have been wounded over the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   Fehmi Baftiu, the head of the Mother Theresa chapter in Stimlje,
said the Albanians appreciated all aid, but needed more substantial
supplies of flour, cooking oil, sugar, beans, macaroni, blankets
and even spoons and forks. ``Our reserves are spent and we could do
no planting at all,'' he said. ``We don't have milk. The Serbs even
stole our cattle and our corn.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in a medical clinic that was looted by Serbian forces,
who took all the medicines, beds and diagnostic equipment,
including an EKG machine. About 60 percent of the town of 13,000
people was burned the first night of the NATO bombing, March 24,
Baftiu said. ``That night they started to burn and shoot, whether
people were in their houses or not.'' The rampage lasted five days,
leaving Stimlje a ruin and its population mostly dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with Kosovo's reconstruction, which will be the bulk of
the world's commitment here, U.N. agencies will handle the issue of
aid; the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will
probably handle democracy training and institution-building; the
European Union will handle and pay for reconstruction of homes,
roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations will be in charge, Vieira de Mello
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The trickiest issue, he said, is how to handle civil
administration. For example, who pays the civil servants here,
Belgrade or the United Nations? What happens to local taxes? Who
collects the garbage or runs the water system? Will the Yugoslav
dinar remain the local currency, or will the informal currency
here, the German mark, become the formal one? Does Belgrade
continue to get the profits from electricity supply and from state
industries like vineyards and coal mining?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of Vieira de Mello's earliest tasks will be to appoint five
district commissioners and 29 municipal administrators to help him
run Kosovo. Each municipality will have a U.N. police commissioner
to set up the initial police force of 3,000 foreigners to take over
local policing from KFOR troops.
</P>
<P>
   The municipal administrators will appoint civil-liaison
officers, who will themselves set up local advisory councils, to
deal with residents, local leaders and civic needs and services.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is lots of work to do, more than in Bosnia or
Cambodia,'' Vieira de Mello said.
</P>
<P>
   The uncovering of the horrors of the Serbian battle against the
Albanian population here continued, with reporters finding more
gravesites even as the first forensic team from the U.N.'s
International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia prepared to come
to Kosovo on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In towns like Poklek, Bruznik, Berisht and Vlastica, journalists
were shown or told of a series of killings of Albanians by the
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Lt. Col. Robin Clifford Thursday urged
journalists not to use ``emotive words like mass graves'' before
any proper forensic investigation. ``There are fresh burial
sites,'' he said. ``But remember there was a war here. It's up to
the tribunal to investigate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said that 26,000 of Yugoslavia's 40,000 troops and police had
withdrawn from Kosovo on schedule. All Serb forces must be gone by
Sunday night, while several hundred will return to guard border
posts and holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   British troops also brought journalists on a guided tour of an
interrogation center at police headquarters here. The cellar
contained knives, batons, batteries, baseball bats, brass knuckles,
a box of condoms and a sword. After the display, they cordoned the
building off for tribunal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials said it was odd that the police would have
cleared the building of every file and lightbulb but left a
so-called ``torture chamber'' to be discovered, complete with even
a chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   But KFOR's biggest victory Thursday was finally restoring the
water supply to Pristina after three hot summer days. Serbian
workers at four pumping stations fled after failing to get the
protection they sought from KFOR, and some of them disabled the
stations.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of changing times, the first two KLA soldiers
showed up at the Grand Hotel, where the Serbian army and police
often ate and worked. They were not authentic Kosovo Albanians,
however, but an English mercenary and an American Albanian who came
to offer themselves for interviews.

COMMENTARY: JHTWAITING FOR THE NOOSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This column has three motivations. One is to try to help save
the lives of at least 13 Iranian Jews who will be hanged unless the
Western governments, people and press pay attention. So far, there
has been painfully little from any of the three.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The second is to allow Iranians who elected their current
president, Mohammad Khatami, in the hope he would bring them
political freedom to decide whether he has the power or passion to
achieve it. Does he represent a historic change, or a candy coating
on the still-reigning dictatorship of ayatollahs?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Third: to help America decide whether to continue heaping the
treasure of political support and respect on Khatami while he keeps
promising freedom, or hold off until he diminishes the domestic
tyrannies of the ayatollahs, and their critical support for
terrorism abroad.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 13 are accused of espionage for ``the Zionist regime,''
which requires no translation, and for the ``world arrogance'' _
Ayatollah-speak for the United States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both target countries have denied and protested the espionage
charges, which have not been specified. In Iran the legal process
for capital crimes is usually simplicity itself: accusation, closed
hearing, noose. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All that has become known in the weeks since their arrest are
their names, that most of them came from the towns of Shiraz and
Isfahan, that they were teachers, rabbis or small merchants or
practiced another trade not known for espionage expertise _ kosher
slaughtering.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Israel, the White House and Madeleine Albright protested for the
sake of the lives of the 13 _ and others whose number and names
have not yet been released. Both countries also have the motivation
of national security _ the increased terrorism against them likely
to follow the spy charges.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also protesting were American Jewish organizations, some members
of Congress and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a good man to have on your
side when hostages are taken. Jackson took the valid opportunity to
remind Americans that while they spent billions in Kosovo, in
Africa refugees were going without food, attention and, often,
enough water.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, don't blame yourself if you were not fully informed of the
Iranian scare campaign about Jewish spies. Unless you spotted a few
paragraphs here or there, or read the English-language weekly
Forward, indispensable to Jews and non-Jews interested in matters
affecting Jews, you might not have known a thing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time was, as late as 1996, when the U.S. forthrightly said Iran
was the ``most active'' state sponsor of terrorism, because of the
money and airlifts of weapons Iran delivered to Hezbollah and other
terrorist organizations operating against Israel and America.
</P>
<P>
   Then Washington began putting its hopes in Khatami and paying
before delivery. So in its new report on terrorism the State
Department drops the number-one award to Iran and simply lists Iran
among other terrorist nations. The political gift to Iran was the
implication that under Khatami's presidency Iran is giving less
support to terrorism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately somebody must have forgotten what George J. Tenet,
head of the CIA, had to say earlier this year. ``We have yet to see
any significant reduction in Iran's support of terrorism,'' is what
he had to say.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet also said that Russia continued to assist the Iranian
missile effort, from training to testing _ and components. He said
that ``no doubt'' Russia was helping Iran's ability to make better
missiles and of longer range, a particular U.S.-Israeli worry. I
guess Russia won't work up a sweat helping the 13 and those to
come. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for Khatami, he visited Syria recently, where he met with
Palestinian radical leaders opposed to the Mideast peace process.
He told them the future was with them and ``everyone else who
rejects hegemony'' _ meaning world-arrogant America. Thank you,
Khatami. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About the arrested Iranian Jews, he said all religions and
minorities had freedom in Iran, a lie contradicted by the official
U.S. human rights report.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Khatami also said he was responsible for every Iranian of every
religion. That will be remembered from now on by the men in the
death cells, and, it is to be hoped, by the governments and people
of the U.S. and its allies, with mouth and heart.

   MERDARE, Yugoslavia _ A jumbled line of tractors, horse carts
and broken down tanks stretched for nearly six miles from Kosovo
into an adjoining part of Serbia on Thursday, bringing thousands
more displaced Serbs and a potentially troublesome burden for the
Belgrade government.
</P>
<P>
   All along the roads of southern Serbia, Kosovo Serbs have
arrived with household possessions piled on the roofs of their
cars, trundling slowly up the highway to Belgrade. Many have pulled
over to the shoulder to camp among the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents watched them pass, remembering previous tides of
Serbian refugees from other wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not happy about anything to do with this war,'' said
one resident of the town of Krusevac, who gave her name only as
Sanje and said she herself was a refugee from Bosnia. ``And now we
are seeing a lot of buses and cars of refugees. We feel nothing
good at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade government has played down the exodus of Serbs from
Kosovo on state television and has not offered any estimate of the
numbers of people fleeing. The Yugoslav Red Cross has counted some
40,000. NATO puts the number at 80,000 over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the actual number, they come in addition to about
70,000 other Serbs who fled Kosovo over the last two months of NATO
bombing. Where these people will live and work, whether they will
return to Kosovo, and how they will be fed and cared for are the
latest ripples of the Kosovo problem to confront Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's beleaguered government.
</P>
<P>
   When asked, many of the refugees say they have little doubt who
they blame for the debacle in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all Milosevic's fault,'' said Zlate Djordjevic, a lawyer.
``He gave everything to the Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Serbian refugees appear more resigned than angry, and
do not look likely to march on Belgrade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday, many huddled under plastic sheeting as a great thunder
storm broke overhead, drowning out their words. Asked where they
would go, most answered: ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have no relatives to stay with are being directed to
collective centers in schools and public buildings. They are
joining tens of thousands of Serbian refugees from wars in Croatia
and Bosnia over the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Those previous waves Serbian refugees have ended up nearly
forgotten, living in depressed conditions throughout Serbia,
surviving on meager food handouts but mostly left to fend for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these new arrivals will be turning to the government for
food and shelter. Asked how they will survive, one said: ``We'll go
to the refugee center and register. We are not refugees, because we
are in our own country, but we'll be living on humanitarian aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The road just north of the border with Kosovo at Merdare was
blocked solid with new arrivals Thursday. Soldiers mingled with
peasant farmers, white collar workers from the cities and dozens of
Gypsy families.
</P>
<P>
   One young reservist named Slavise was still in his uniform but
accompanying his old mother out of Kosovo, where her family has
lived for centuries. He said he did not know where they would go,
but he said he knew he would not be going back.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Serbs and Albanians could live together after what had
happened over the last two months in Kosovo, he answered no.
</P>
<P>
   A group of other men gathered around him said they were fleeing
the Kosovo Liberation Army, but not their Albanian neighbors, and
said they would stay in Kosovo only if NATO could guarantee their
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not afraid of ordinary Albanians,'' said Djordjevic,
the lawyer. ``I will return in a few weeks I hope when it is more
secure.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, when pressed, said they thought they would never be
able to return. And asked if Albanians would nurture hatred for the
Serbs after what had happened in the last two months, the men stood
in glum silence.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Serbs offered various wild conspiracy theories about
what has gone wrong in Kosovo, but nearly all those leaving agree
on one thing _ that for whatever reason, the policies of recent
years have proved disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Most still blame the KLA and Albanian extremists who want
independence from Serbia. But they equally blame the leadership in
Belgrade for not crushing the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Many at first try to deny that ``ethnic cleansing'' or any
organized killing of Albanian civilians occurred in Kosovo, but
when confronted with strong evidence even they admit that things
happened.
</P>
<P>
   A few not only admit that atrocities occurred, but agree that
such violence has forever made it impossible for Serbs to live in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have lived with our Albanian neighbors, but not with
the guerrillas,'' said Slobodan Filipovic, a storekeeper from
Prizren. ``I left my apartment keys with our Albanian neighbors.
They were crying. They wanted us to stay. They wanted to protect us
but they couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking dazed and weary, he sat at the wheel of a tiny Fiat car,
piled high with bedding and luggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not like it that the Albanians had to go, but they were
asking for independence for Kosovo and we were defending the
state,'' said his wife, Jovanka, a retired factory worker. But
asked if it was the violent campaign against the Albanians that had
precipitated their own exodus, she replied: ``Yes,'' nodding her
head firmly. ``Yes, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all this nationalism that was the cause of it all,''
she said.

`THE DAY OF THE BEAST': A SPANISH PRIEST SEEKS THE INFANT
ANTICHRIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)

<P>
   If Quentin Tarantino had gotten his directorial hands on
``Rosemary's Baby'' or ``The Exorcist,'' the results might very
well have resembled ``The Day of the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Part black comedy, part lurid cartoon, part paranoid theological
melodrama with a heavy-metal undercurrent, this subtitled Spanish
film has won half a dozen Goyas, the Spanish equivalents of Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, for best director, honored Alex de la Iglesia, who
collaborated with Jorge Guerricaechavarria in writing this
hyperthyroid tale of a scholarly priest, Father Angel (Alex
Angula), whose studies of the Apocrypha have convinced him that the
Antichrist is to be born in Madrid before dawn on Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, ``The Day of the Beast'' is comic in a casually
brutal visual way, performed as if it matters, and never allows its
swift pace to flag; at its least admirable, it loses its early
comic touch and seems to revel in bloody violence that is all too
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   With only hours to spare, in a city where babies have been
disappearing, graves have been desecrated and roving bands have
been beating and burning the homeless, the priest sets out to make
contact with Satan, mortifying his flesh and selling his soul to
try to find and kill the infant Antichrist and save humanity before
the Devil can appear and establish his dominion.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, the priest, played by Angula with a beguiling
mixture of wide-eyed innocence and relentless determination,
enlists the hulking, shaggy, body-pierced, tattooed Jose Maria
(Santiago Segura), the owner of a heavy-metal record shop, and,
after some painful persuasion, Professor Cavan (Armando de Razza),
a Mephistophelean-looking author and the host of ``The Dark Zone,''
a popular television program devoted to the occult.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, in the boarding house owned by Jose Maria's
shotgun-packing, cleaver-whacking mama, Rosario (Terele Pavez), the
priest encounters her country-girl servant, Mina (Nathalie Sesena)
and Rosario's frontally nude, mute father. And the plot calls upon
the clergyman to draw blood from the virginal Mina, do in Rosario
and suffer various beatings, a shotgun wound that shreds his ear
and the music of a band called Satannica in a seething hellish
dance club.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to overlook the capture of Susana (Maria Grazia
Cucinotta), Cavan's voluptuous girlfriend; the beating and binding
of Cavan, and a hair-raising escape along the side of a skyscraper
from an early encounter with the Beast.
</P>
<P>
   Some of de la Iglesia's characters rebound like cartoon
creatures from the mayhem visited on them; others remain very dead
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   As theological adventures go, the over-the-top ``Day of the
Beast'' adds up to a mixed blessing. &QL;

CONFIDENCE IN FED SPARKS GAIN IN DOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices moved higher Thursday as investors and
traders grew increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve will
decide the economy needs little more than a tap on the brakes to
keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the market opened, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman,
told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that ``modest
pre-emptive actions can obviate the need of more drastic actions at
a later date.'' The stock and bond markets, regarding this as an
unusually clear signal of a likely one-time rate increase on June
30, promptly rallied and continued to rise for most of the session.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, in a stepped-down version of Wednesday's pattern,
the Nasdaq composite index was up 26.32 points, or 1.05 percent, to
2,544.15, and the Dow Jones industrial average was up 56.68 points,
or 0.5 percent, to 10,841.63. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
rose 9.49 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,339.90.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds did even better, soaring by amounts that cut yields by an
average of about one-eighth of a percentage point, one of the best
performances of the year. The yield of the benchmark 30-year bond,
which was at 6.16 percent last Friday, retreated below 6 percent
and finished at 5.96 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a calm that the Fed is aware of what's going on and
doesn't see a runaway inflation,'' said John R. Peluso, head of
listed equity trading at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the government's surprisingly benign inflation
report on Wednesday, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief strategist at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. maintained her bullish stance despite
contending that the S&AMP;P 500 is now ``modestly'' overvalued by about
5 percent. Earlier in the year, when rates were lower, Ms. Cohen
found stocks undervalued by about that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ugly inflation news associated with higher oil prices
seems to have ended,'' she said in an advisory, adding that
second-quarter profits are shaping up well and the markets should
be able to ``easily tolerate'' it if the Fed raises the overnight
interest rate a notch, a move already anticipated by the futures
market.
</P>
<P>
   She referred to such a move as a ``flu shot,'' not unlike
Greenspan's ``pre-emptive'' strike.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy J. Morris, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust,
agreed that corporate earnings, which will begin to pour in for the
second quarter next month, are likely to support further
stock-market gains.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that operating earnings of S&AMP;P 500 companies will
climb by more than 10 percent for the year, well ahead of the 6
percent to 8 percent gain he projected at the end of March and the
3 percent to 5 percent gain when 1999 began.
</P>
<P>
   Such improvement, he suggested, helps explain the stock market's
relatively mild setback in the face of the recent sharp rise in
interest rates. With Thursday's gain, the Dow stands just 2.4
percent below its May 13 record close and is up 18.1 percent for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks turned in another strong performance Thursday,
joined by drugs and many high-technology issues. Paper and airline
shares slumped. Microsoft had the biggest positive effect on the
S&AMP;P 500. The software giant gained 1 7/8, to 82 7/8, followed by
General Electric, up 1 5/8, to 108 7/16, and America Online, up 4
3/16, to 110 11/16. Intel, down 1 11/16, to 58, and Wal-Mart, down
three-quarters, to 43 5/8, were the biggest drags.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Dow components, 18 issues advanced while 12 declined.
Alcoa was the biggest gainer, rising 2 7/16, to 67 3/8, a new
52-week high. Another cyclical issue, however, International Paper,
was one of the Dow's biggest losers, falling 2 3/16, to 53 5/16,
more than six points off its high reached two months ago. Boeing,
which announced a $1.4 billion order for 25 planes, gained
seven-eights, to 43 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Prices could prove unusually volatile Friday, traders cautioned,
because it is a so-called triple-witching session, when stock
options, index options and index futures contracts all expire.

HOUSE BACKS 10 COMMANDMENTS IN SCHOOLS, THEN TURNS AGAIN TO GUN
CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted Thursday to allow the Ten
Commandments to be posted in schools, and then turned to a tense
debate over the most significant gun control legislation to come
before it in in five years.
</P>
<P>
   With both parties searching for an answer to school violence,
gun regulation came center-stage after two long days of sometimes
impassioned clashes over God, values, the entertainment industry
and the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In a significant victory for social conservatives, the House
voted 248-180 to include in the crime bill an amendment sponsored
by Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., giving states the right to allow
the display of the Ten Commandments in public places, including
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, the House turned to a separate bill on gun
control, which is the preferred political ground of the Democrats.
A dozen separate gun amendments were under consideration, running a
gamut from a measure requiring child safety devices to be sold with
handguns to a proposal to repeal the District of Columbia's ban on
the possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant showdown was over rival measures of varying
strictness to regulate sales of weapons at gun shows, at which
collectors and hobbyists selling firearms are not currently
required to conduct the kinds of background checks on buyers that
licensed dealers are.
</P>
<P>
   In a fierce lobbying blitz, President Clinton arose at 5 a.m. in
Paris to telephone four wavering Democrats: Gary Conduit and Mike
Thompson of California, Marion Berry of Arkansas and Ron Kind of
Wisconsin to urge them to vote for a gun show amendment sponsored
by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was shot to death
by a gunman on the Long Island Railroad in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy for the United States to be the only advanced
country in the world that doesn't take comprehensive, sensible,
thorough steps to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals,''
Clinton told reporters in Paris. ``It's just _ it doesn't make any
sense.'' To hammer home the point, the White House sent Attorney
General Janet Reno to the Capitol late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority
whip of Texas, shored up support among conservatives for a weaker
version sponsored by another Democrat, Rep. John Dingell of
Michigan, who is a former member of the NRA board.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell _ whose victory would be a blow to the president and the
Democratic congressional leadership _ insisted that he was going to
win. He said that Clinton would not make headway with conservative
Democrats because ``he cost us control of the House and a lot of
people remember that.'' The Republicans won the majority in 1994,
months after Congress enacted a ban on assault weapons avidly
sought by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the NRA has largely held sway on Capitol Hill. But
after the shocking school shooting in Littleton, Colo., the Senate
last month _ with Vice President Gore casting the tie-breaking vote
_ approved a proposal that would compel all vendors at gun shows,
licensed or unlicensed, to run such checks. Law enforcement
officials are given three business days to complete the checks.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell's version on gun shows is much less stringent. It
narrowly defines what constitutes a gun show, and only 24 hours
would be allotted for background checks. Mrs. McCarthy's version
largely mirrors the Senate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the procedures for the debate, Dingell's measure was to be
considered first, and both sides considered it the most likely to
pass. But even a majority vote does not guarantee its survival. If
Mrs. McCarthy's amendment also wins a majority vote, it trumps the
Dingell proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, Reps. McCarthy, Nita M. Lowey of New
York and Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut made last-ditch phone calls to
undecided colleagues from Mrs. McCarthy's office. And Mrs. McCarthy
and Ms. Lowey even agonized over the order of the speech-making to
come on the floor, as if that might decide the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats expected about 45 of their members from the South and
West to vote with Dingell. Gun control advocates thought they had
30 Republicans firmly on their side. That left the outcome of the
vote in the hands of about two dozen wavering lawmakers, most of
them Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of this debate have become so convoluted that no
matter which gun show measure prevails, final passage of a gun
control bill remains in doubt. No one could predict whether
conservatives _ even those who join Dingell to water down gun shows
language _ will vote for the legislation if any other gun
restrictions also prevail. Liberals, on the other hand, are likely
to bolt if Mrs. McCarthy's proposal fails.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The two parties were already preparing to blame each other if an
odd coalition of conservatives and liberals caused the legislation
to collapse. ``If Republicans cynically vote for Dingell and
against the bill then their strategy is no gun safety,'' charged
Rep. Stenny Hoyer, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said of the final bill, ``the less gun control, the more
apt it is to pass.'' And Dingell refused to say whether he would
vote for the final measure if his amendment prevailed, but other
gun control provisions like a child safety device or a raise in the
minimum age for all handgun purchases from 18 to 21 also were
approved.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday and early Thursday the House approved a variety
of measures signaling support, sometimes symbolic and sometimes
more concrete, for public expressions of religion. The debate over
the Ten Commandments was the most spirited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that simply posting the Ten Commandments will not
instantly change the moral character of our nation,'' Aderholt, the
measure's sponsor, said just before midnight Wednesday. ``However,
it is an important step to promote morality and an end of children
killing children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., displayed the copy of the Ten Commandments
he hangs in his office. He repeatedly mentioned God and argued that
display of the commandments did not _ as his critics charged _
violate the Constitutional guarantee of separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in these Ten Commandments that reaches out
and grabs somebody and forces them to abide by any particular
religious belief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of Congress disagreed. ``This amendment seeks to
elevate one particular religion over all others,'' said Rep. Robert
Scott, D-Va. ``This singling out of one religion is contrary to the
American ideal of religious tolerance and is blatantly
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York City also raised constitutional
questions. ``Whose Ten Commandments?'' he asked. ``Which version?
The Catholic version? The Protestant version? Or the Jewish
version?''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in 1980 declared unconstitutional a Kentucky
law requiring that a copy of the Ten Commandments be posted in
every public school classroom. The court held that the law violated
the constitutional separation of church and state, serving neither
a ``secular legislative purpose'' nor an educational function.
</P>
<P>
   In other votes touching on religion, the House overwhelmingly
approved measures allowing the use of religious language in
memorials on school grounds and allowing religious organization to
compete for government social service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   A day after rejecting an effort to impose a prison term on those
selling violent entertainment to teenagers, lawmakers also debated
and approved several measures that served primarily to make
Congress' displeasure with the entertainment industry known. One of
these proposals directed the surgeon general to prepare a report on
the effects of interactive video games on youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   The House also overwhelming approved a non-binding resolution by
Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., calling the entertainment industry
irresponsible in its marketing to youth and urging it to curtail
``portrays of pointless acts of brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can there be any doubt at all that the entertainment industry
has contributed to the culture of violence that has manifested
itself in Colorado, in Georgia, in Jonesboro, Arkansas?'' asked
Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich., listing sites of recent school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   California Democrats complained that the resolution was too
broad. ``Don't condem a whole industry,'' said Rep. Howard Berman
of California, protesting ``blanket guilt by association.'' Rep.
Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., shot back sarcastically, ``I suppose the
Democrats would never condemn an entire industry'' _ an implied
reference to Democratic attacks on tobacco and gun manufacturers.

 &HT;    Posting Ten Commandments in schools OK, House says
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. House of Representatives approved
legislation Thursday to give states the authority to post the Ten
Commandments in government buildings, including schools.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, attached to a massive juvenile crime bill, was
applauded by religious conservatives. But legal analysts said it
would do little to change prohibitions the courts have adopted
barring certain religious symbols on public property.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was a personal victory for its sponsor, Alabama
Republican Rep. Robert Aderholt. In 1995, Etowah County Circuit
Judge Roy Moore refused an order to remove a redwood tablet of the
Ten Commandments from his courtroom wall in Aderholt's district.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Fob James threatened to call out the National Guard if
anyone tried to remove the display from behind the judge's bench,
igniting a showdown that drew national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud to see that people are waking up to the real
problem in our society, and that's the loss of morality,'' Moore
said Thursday after the House vote.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has campaigned with Aderholt and makes speeches nearly
every week about the Ten Commandments display.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Schroeder, a legislative analyst with the American Civil
Liberties Union in Washington, said the language of Aderholt's
amendment was similar to a ``sense of the Congress'' resolution: It
carries no penalties and has ``no legal teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The case law on the issue won't change, Schroeder said, and
governments and school districts that post the Ten Commandments
will be subject to the same court challenges as in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote came on the second day of a fractious debate over
teens and violence, sparked by recent school shootings in Colorado
and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Aderholt conceded his Ten Commandments provision would not
``change the moral character of our nation overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However, it is one step that states can take to promote
morality and work toward an end of children killing children,'' the
congressman said. ``The states we represent deserve the opportunity
to decide for themselves whether they want to display the Ten
Commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 248 to 180 in favor of Aderholt's amendment to a
$1.5 billion juvenile crime bill. Democrats John Lewis and Cynthia
McKinney were the only Georgia lawmakers to vote against the
proposal, which attracted 45 Democratic votes and 203 Republican
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who voted against the measure said it was
unconstitutional. In 1980 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a
Kentucky law that required the posting of the Ten Commandments in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This singling out of one particular religion is contrary to
the American ideal of religious tolerance and is blatantly
unconstitutional,'' said Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.).
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) noted the Ten Commandments has
numerous translations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose Ten Commandments?'' Nadler asked. ``The Catholic
version? The Protestant version. ... Are our public buildings to be
Catholic because the local Catholic majority votes that the
Catholic version ... should be in the public buildings?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), who recently suggested the shootings at
Heritage High would not have happened if the Ten Commandments had
been on display at the Rockdale County school, spoke in favor of
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some on the other side of the aisle keep saying that
Republicans are working on behalf of the NRA,'' said Barr, a
National Rifle Association board member. ``Their irrational
argument against something as simple and nonsectarian as displaying
the Ten Commandments proves that many in the Democrat party are
paid for by the trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County, the heart of Barr's 7th District, spent $100,000 in
an unsuccessful bid to keep the Ten Commandments on a courtroom
wall four years ago. Fred Bentley Jr., the county attorney who
litigated the matter, said the House vote ``opens up the door for
the county to revisit its position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Principally, what this recognizes is that the people of the
United States are demanding safe communities and a return to
morality and just good, old-fashioned, safe, earlier times,''
Bentley said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Lumpkin County's sole commissioner, Charlie Ridley,
gave in to the ACLU and other groups who opposed a Ten Commandments
display in the North Georgia county courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's congressional action is ``something that should have
happened a long time ago,'' Ridley said. ``I only hope the
president and both sides move ahead. I think it's something that
needs to be in the schools and it's something that needs to be
displayed in public buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Gerry Davis, pastor of the Dahlonega United Methodist
Church, said the Ten Commandments display at the Lumpkin County
courthouse fractured the local religioius community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to use law as a means to get people to follow
God,'' Davis said. ``There is the doctrine of free will churches
embrace. God does not force us to love him, to follow him, to
believe in him. So why should I as an American citizen ask
legislatures to adopt laws that basically try to force people to
believe in God?

ALIEN SMUGGLERS USING NEW TRICKS IN EFFORTS TO EVADE BORDER
PATROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Agent Griselda Vidrio had just wandered
into the U.S. Border Patrol's processing center after several hours
patroling the weed-girded Rio Grande when she caught sight of the
young Honduran couple and the seven-month-old baby in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is with a baby, you see one and you go up to
them,'' Ms. Vidrio, a border agent, said. ``The baby looked at me
and smiled and something struck me. I knew that baby. I had held it
in my arms. I thought, no, this baby has already been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vidrio's memory flash on March 31 led to uncovering a
smuggling network that, U.S. officials said, had been doing
something they had suspected was occurring with increasing
frequency along the border _ the use of infants and young children,
perhaps kidnapped, perhaps rented from impoverished parents, as
living props to bamboozle border agents.
</P>
<P>
   The baby ruse is just the latest wrinkle in the game of
cat-and-mouse between border agents and illegal-alien smugglers, a
game that has only intensified following recent federal crackdowns
and dramatic rises in the number of agents along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers, it seems, have discovered an inadvertent loophole on
the U.S. border. If illegal aliens are taken in custody and claim
to be a family, especially with babies or young children, they are
simply cut loose and asked to report for a later court date, as
there are no facilities for housing families on the border and
agents say they do not want to split up families.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of letting families go began several years ago, but
has become more frequent since thousands of Central Americans have
tried to get into the United States in in the wake of Hurricane
Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that most of them don't show up for their court
date, but we do it for humanitarian reasons, because we don't have
the facilities and it's better than breaking up the family,
especially one that's already suffered something like Hurricane
Mitch,'' said Fernando Quiroja, who initially spearheaded the baby
investigation in Brownsville until it was transferred to the
federal antismuggling unit in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   This latest, particularly ugly wrinkle in the struggle between
smugglers and border agents picked up steam after a recent U.S.
crackdown along the border that has seen agents grow in number in
some stations by threefold. In Brownsville, the 18-month-old
Operation Rio Grande has increased the size of the locally based
force to more than 350. When Quiroja first joined the Brownsville
station a dozen years ago, there were fewer than 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Border Patrol is without doubt a more formidable presence
around here,'' said Ivan Welker, Brownsville's assistant city
manager. ``Back before Operation Rio Grande, down at the municipal
golf course near the border, golfers would routinely see groups of
people who had crossed the river coming out of the trees and
trotting across the golf course. You'd always be seeing groups of
people downtown who looked like maybe they didn't belong in
downtown Brownsville. Now, you don't see that. You don't see that
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Already last summer, when South Texas and much of the nation was
caught in a vicious drought and heat wave, border agents received
gruesome evidence of the desperate lengths smugglers were forced to
go in the form of the corpses of dozens of aliens who had been led
across the border in increasingly remote areas and died from heat
and lack of water.
</P>
<P>
   In Brownsville, aliens arrested in the last year have reported
that the price of being brought across the border had risen from an
average of $300 to $500 a few years ago to an average of $1,400 to
$1,800 today. And that is for Mexican nationals coming across.
Those traveling from farther away, like Hurricane Mitch victims,
must often pay much more.
</P>
<P>
   Border agents found themselves investigating g more cases
involving the use of unexpected and expensive modes of
transportation, including planes chartered out of Brownsville's
airport. A new route sprang up to bring illegal aliens up the Gulf
coast from Mexico using a network of boats and ferries that
connected northern Mexico with Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   All along the border, from El Paso to the Rio Grande's mouth
near Brownsville, border agents have seen smugglers make increasing
use of the 18-wheel semis that are moving back and forth across the
border by the thousands since passage of the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't search every semi,'' Quiroja said. ``You'd back up
the whole border, and they know that. So they corrupt a few,
individual truck drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent, very typical case, a truck was found with 101
illegal aliens hidden in its trailer. ``In cases like that, a
driver might make $100 to $500 a head,'' Quiroja said. ``Do the
math. That's $10,000 to $50,000, a lot of money. And the smugglers
are probably keeping $1,000 a head.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vidrio said she became convinced there was something fishy
about the mud-streaked infant when she spotted a turquoise and
red-bead bracelet on its right wrist, triggering the recent memory
of another Honduran illegal alien, a man claiming he had been left
alone with this very same infant when his wife was killed during
Hurricane Mitch. She peppered the young couple with questions. In
short order, the scheme unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The woman admitted, border officials said, that she had given
$1,000 to a smuggler in Matamoros, Mexico, just across from
Brownsville. The man had paid $1,050. They were both Honduran, but
had not known one another before they met at the smuggler's safe
house that day. They were given the baby, which they had never seen
before, and told to swim across the Rio Grande just upstream from
Brownsville and immediately give themselves up to border agents.
When being processed, they were to tell officials that they were a
family. Once given their court date and released, they were to
travel by bus to Houston and call the smuggler's accomplice from
the bus station.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was federal agents who called the number from the
Houston bus station. They arrested two men who arrived in response
to the call, both of whom were identified by the illegal aliens,
now material witnesses in the federal probe, as among the smugglers
they had seen in Matamoros. The investigation led to a Houston
apartment where another woman was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the couple who are the apparent real parents of
the infant walked into a Houston police station to report their
child kidnapped. They were taken into custody, and federal
officials suspect that they had actually rented the baby several
times to the smugglers, probably for as little as a few hundred
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury has been hearing the case in Houston and
was expected to hand down indictments, perhaps including the
infant's mother, as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials say they have uncovered at least three
instances in which this particular infant was used by smugglers,
but suspect it had been used even more often _ just as they suspect
that the same ruse, involving other children, is being used with
increasing frequency up and down the border, partly in response to
the federal crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vidrio said she was particularly incensed by the callous way
the baby was treated. In none of the three known cases, did the
phony parents carry extra diapers or a change of clothes for the
infant, or more than one bottle of infant formula. And they just
hopped into the Rio Grande and swam across the river with the baby.
``You can imagine what that baby must have gone through,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is apparently worth it to the smugglers who must find new
ways to circumvent the federal crackdown along the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of when you build a better mousetrap, the mice
have to get smarter,'' Quiroja said.

GREENSPAN INDICATES HE IS LEANING TOWARD MODEST INTEREST RATE
RISE 
</HEADLINE>

(DW) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave
the clearest indication yet Thursday that the central bank will
raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a congressional committee, Greenspan acknowledged
that inflation is currently negligible, as shown by the report on
Wednesday that the Consumer Price Index did not rise at all last
month.
</P>
<P>
   But to applause from many economists _ and in the face of
skepticism from politicians of both parties who have grown
increasingly convinced of the economy's ability to expand at a
robust pace without much risk of accelerating prices _ he laid out
a case for why the Federal Reserve sometimes needed to act well
before inflation takes root.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding more like the Greenspan of old, a hard-line advocate of
price stability, than his more recent incarnation as apostle of a
new, technology-driven economy, the fed chairman said that growth
was on an ``unsustainable trend,'' and warned somewhat ominously
that the excesses of human nature have brought all expansions to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said that continued strong growth _ fueled in part by
booms in the stock market and in housing prices _ could soon lead
to a shortage of workers, a condition that has historically set off
a spiral of rising wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan did not flatly say he would call for a rate increase
when the Federal Reserve meets to set policy on June 29 and 30.
Instead, he coupled his warning about the brewing inflationary
pressures with a call for the central bank to act sooner rather
than later when it spots strains that could derail the economy
further down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we can be pre-emptive we should be, because modest
pre-emptive actions can obviate the need of more drastic actions at
a later date that could destabilize the economy,'' Greenspan told
the Joint Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts connected the dots and concluded that Greenspan was all
but guaranteeing a quarter-point increase in rates at the end of
the month. That would bring the benchmark federal funds target rate
to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan gave little guidance, though, about whether the
central bank would tighten policy further later in the year.
Economists said that he wanted to keep his options open while he
waits to see whether growth slows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to put some measure of financial restraint in place
to moderate demand early enough to head off a significant
problem,'' said Robert V. DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith
Barney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's testimony appeared to bring to an end speculation
that the Federal Reserve had adopted a ``Bunker Hill'' strategy of
waiting to fire until inflation was staring it in the face,
DiClemente said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has been a proponent of the view that huge investments
in computers and telecommunications are revolutionizing American
business and making it much more productive. But Thursday he seemed
to be signaling that his faith in new technology should not be
confused with his willingness to take early and perhaps unpopular
action to squelch the fed's old nemesis, inflation.
</P>
<P>
   He even provided a simple bit of arithmetic to back up his case
for an early tightening. The economy, he said, has grown 4 percent
a year for the last three years. Of that, improvements in
productivity, or output for each hour worked, account for 2
percentage points. Another percentage point represents the growth
in the working-age population.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining percentage point, he said, was accounted for by
dipping ever deeper into the pool of available workers, a trend
that could not be sustained much longer given the low unemployment
rate, which is now 4.2 percent. The smaller the pool of available
workers, the greater the pressure on wages, and ultimately prices.
</P>
<P>
   With growth remaining strong and the global financial crisis
having receded, the Federal Reserve signaled last month that it
might soon begin reversing the three rate cuts _ each a
quarter-point _ it made last fall. Since the May meeting of the
Fed's policy making Federal Open Market Committee _ when members
adopted and announced a formal bias toward a tighter monetary
policy _ Fed officials have gradually prepared investors for the
likelihood of a rate increase this month. Thus, Greenspan's
statements did not shock anyone on Wall Street.

 WASHINGTON: on Wall Street.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently interpreting Greenspan to be suggesting that one rate
hike might be enough, the bond market rallied, sending the yield on
the 30-year Treasury bond back below 6 percent. Stocks rose
modestly, with the Dow Jones industrial average finishing 56.68
points higher, at 10,841.63.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to the need to soothe Wall Street, where higher
interest rates tend to be bad news over the long run for both
stocks and bonds, Greenspan reassured investors that the Fed's goal
was not to end the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betting against markets is usually precarious at best,''
Greenspan said, adding that monetary policy should focus on price
stability for goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   The Depression in the United States and the problems of recent
years in Japan were not caused by the bursting of asset bubbles,
Greenspan said, but by bad economic policy in the years following
the market crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should volatile asset prices cause problems, policy is
probably best positioned to address the consequences when the
economy is working from a base of stable product prices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has won widespread acclaim for his management of
monetary policy for the last 12 years. But his broad hints Thursday
about his intention to raise rates drew quick responses from
politicians of both parties, who questioned the justification for
tightening policy in the absence of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's argument in favor of an early tightening drew
skepticism and in one case pointed criticism from Democrats who
heard him testify before the Joint Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maurice Hinchey, D-N.Y., said that raising rates now would
send a signal that the Fed's policy is to put an end to strong
growth just as all working Americans are benefiting from plentiful
jobs and higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that's not what you want to do,'' Hinchey told
Greenspan, who tried in vain to cut him off. ``But that will be the
effect if you give in to this notion that interest rates need to be
raised now.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who is running for the Republican presidential
nomination, also warned Greenspan against raising rates now. In a
statement issued in Iowa, where farmers have been hard hit by
falling prices for agricultural products, he said that the real
threat was deflation, not inflation, and suggested that Greenspan
could become a political issue if he enacted a series of rate
increases as the presidential campaign proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat of resurgent inflation exists only in the fevered
minds of the Federal Reserve and the Clinton-Gore Treasury
Department,'' Forbes said. ``Jacking up interest rates now would be
a pre-emptive strike against American prosperity, not against
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan defended the need to attack inflation before it became
a problem. The combination of strong growth and low unemployment,
he said, had not yet put the expansion at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``But should labor markets continue to tighten, significant
increases in wages, in excess of productivity growth, will
inevitably emerge, absent the unlikely repeal of the law of supply
and demand,'' Greenspan said. ``Because monetary policy operates
with a significant lag, we have to make judgments, not only about
the current degree of balance in the economy, but about how the
economy is likely to fare a year or more in the future under the
current policy stance.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN ANTONIO _ It was a scene filled with more than just a touch of
irony as Phil Jackson's face dominated TV screens from coast to
coast in the moments before the Spurs and Knicks played Game 1 of
the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Dr. Jerry Buss of the Lakers had just spent $30
million to hire a coach for NBC's team, and the peacock network
wouldn't miss an opportunity to strut that fact proudly, already
beating the drum for next season's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still the matter of the championship match of the
season at hand to play, and one can't help but notice the team _
San Antonio _ that took one step closer to winning it all is being
directed by a man who is the anti-Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Popovich probably couldn't spell Zen if you spotted him
the ``Z'' and the ``e,'' and he wouldn't know Confucius from Conway
Twitty.
</P>
<P>
   While so much of Wednesday was filled with the news that the
erstwhile coach of the former Chicago dynasty was coming down from
the mount with stone tablets that would show Shaq and Kobe the way
to the promised land, it became almost an afterthought that the
Spurs won again, an NBA-record-tying 11th straight playoff victory.
</P>
<P>
   If Popovich had as much ego as Jackson had lint in the
professorial beard he recently shaved off, he would have stepped up
to the podium Thursday and pointed out he got David Robinson to
place his focus elsewhere, thereby allowing Tim Duncan to shine. He
might have said it was his idea to re-sign the itinerant Jaren
Jackson and to reacquire Sean Elliott in a trade. He could have
pointed out he discovered Malik Rose and brought in Mario Elie and
Steve Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when Popovich was asked how he has changed as a coach
since giving himself the position in December 1996, he half-smiled,
half-snorted into the microphone: ``I read a book and got smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson doesn't have to read books when there are divine
thoughts constantly entering his mind. He has the way, the plan,
the path to hoop enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, of course, is the perfect setting for this, a place
of myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's needed is, obviously, experience in a system
I have,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   You'll note he didn't mention ``his'' offensive system is one
taught to the Bulls by assistant coach Tex Winter.
</P>
<P>
   One might also note Jackson somehow has managed to portray
himself as Leonard Bernstein, the maestro leading the orchestra,
while a certain Michael Jordan might as well have been sitting in
the last row playing the tuba.
</P>
<P>
   To see the reaction of a giddy Los Angeles, part of his contract
must also call for Jackson to end smog and traffic, along with
winning the next few NBA titles.
</P>
<P>
   While a gruff, no-nonsense, uncharismatic man like Popovich has
the Spurs playing unselfishly and ferociously and harmoniously with
few visible signs of weakness, Jackson, the Zen phony, has LA
believing this team that was swept by San Antonio will turn it
around because he'll drop a few pithy sayings in the Lakers' midst
and maybe turn the locker room into an American Indian sweat lodge,
where Shaq and Kobe can mend their differences by puffing on a
peace pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Popovich's is not an entertaining style of management, but it
works because his players know he doesn't care about getting the
credit. Jackson's style is all entertainment, and it worked because
he had Jordan to do all of the heavy lifting. He has cultivated
greatness by association and turned it into a $6 million-a-year
gig.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson wanted to show us he is truly a Zen master, he would
have taken a job with the Clippers or Nets. If he wanted to show us
he has the secret to turning an uphill battle into success, he
would have stuck with his buddy Bill Bradley's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was a decent coach who befriended Jordan, won his
loyalty and then hitched a ride on M.J.'s talent to become a
new-age philosopher and hoop guru. Popovich doesn't care if
Robinson likes him after turning over the main offensive focus to
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches have long been a part of the show, and the slick ones
have turned showmanship into a marketable commodity. Popovich can't
recite those lines from the script. But by not even trying, he does
not sell himself out.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the Lakers be in a year or two if Shaq and Kobe never
discover Jordan's unteachable, uncoachable, unstoppable will to
win? Will the Zen master at least teach them to be at peace with
early-round playoff losses?
</P>
<P>
   And Popovich? He'll act then the way he acts now, gruffly,
uncomplicated, as himself.

<P>
   HOLMDEL, N.J. _ Forget dental benefits and stock options. When
Al Galdi was searching for a perk to inspire employee loyalty, he
wanted something a bit more, well, dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Galdi, chief executive of Arcnet, which designs and
builds wireless communications systems, handed keys to 28 new BMWs
to company workers ranging from administrative assistants to
architects. Under a new company policy, every employee on the job
at least a year gets a leased BMW, plus fully paid insurance.
Turnover has been such that of 57 workers, only half qualified. But
the other half can taste it.
</P>
<P>
   This dramatic gesture, which some might call extravagant in the
extreme, was anything but that to Galdi, who told of constantly
losing trained people to rivals. Weighing the cost of recruiting,
retraining and lost business, he estimated that the $15
million-a-year, privately held company had been spending nearly $1
million a year just to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran the numbers and this made sense because it gave us
something that made us stand out from the crowd,'' he said. ``It is
going to be better than a raise, because every time they turn that
ignition key, they will think of me and the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The new perk turned what was by most measures a happy shop into
an ecstatic one, said Lauren Catalano, an administrative assistant
for the last 19 months. She was standing next to her silver BMW,
lined up with the other new cars in the company parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The bestowing of keys took on a carnival atmosphere, with Galdi,
36, as the chief barker. Family members sat in balloon-festooned
bleachers, hot dogs were cooked under a tent and employees drove
their BMWs around the parking lot in a horn-honking caravan.
</P>
<P>
   While unusual, Galdi's gesture is not singular. At least two
other small companies, Revenue Systems Inc. of Alpharetta, Ga., and
Net2000 Communications of McLean, Va., have provided a range of
workers with a luxury BMW. And according to Michael Carter, vice
president of Hay Group, a human resources consulting firm, it fits
in with employers' need for dramatic moves to counter the triple
woes of a tight, competitive job market in highly technical fields;
decreased loyalty, and lingering cynicism in the wake of the
mega-layoffs of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a super-flashy, extreme version of a far less dramatic
trend among employers who are trying to do different and unusual
things to distinguish themselves,'' said Carter, whose firm surveys
trends in benefits packages.
</P>
<P>
   More common, less costly moves, Carter said, included signing
bonuses, ``work-life benefits'' like telecommuting, flexible hours,
job-sharing arrangements and ``convenience benefits'' like
on-premises dry cleaning pickup. But none, he said, can dazzle like
a free BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Dazzling was precisely what Galdi had in mind when he
appropriated the idea from Revenue Systems. Bill Glover, that
company's chief executive, said he too was drowning in headhunter
and retraining costs when he hit on the idea of providing each
employee with a choice of the 3 series BMW or the Z3 Roadster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all the benefits that you could expect, from full
medical and dental to 401(k), but we still didn't have the
visibility we wanted to attract the kind of people we needed,''
said Glover, whose 70-person company provides software for
government revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
   Galdi echoed those sentiments Thursday as he told employees he
wanted to give them the ``ultimate benefit.'' And in an interview
he acknowledged that the publicity was likely to expose his firm to
a host of potential employees who are not among that ``homogenized
group of currently unemployed'' job seekers but ``the stable,
longtime employed'' with other firms.
</P>
<P>
   The lease on each $31,000 car runs about $7,000 a year, while
insurance is about $2,000. (And employees must pay tax on this
added income.) The total cost of the first batch, Galdi said, is
about $270,000 a year. This compared ``very favorably,'' he said,
with the roughly $900,000 he had spent on recruitment and training
over the last, turnover-filled 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   George Slocum, a 51-year-old purchase order coordinator who came
to the company three years ago after being ``downsized'' by a large
heating oil distributor, said that before the BMW offer he might
have entertained other job offers, but not now. He has sold his
Mercury Grand Marquis, happily settled into his forest green BMW
with the tan interior, and plans to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   A new employee, Barton Stabler, 41, who came on as
communications and marketing director about a week ago, also plans
on staying the ``11 months, 27 days, three hours'' he says it will
take to get his car. The car offer was not his reason for applying
to the company, he said, but he conceded that it had a lot to do
with his decision to take the job after being self-employed for 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Catalano said she felt like one of those running, screaming,
jumping winners on ``The Price Is Right.'' Perhaps the only
downside, she said, came after her photo appeared with an article
about the plan in the local paper. After she went into a local BMW
dealer to order her car, several men she did not know started
persistently calling her at the office asking her out on dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe they wanted me for my car,'' she said with mock
horror.

TIME RUNNING OUT TO CONTROL INFECTIOUS DISEASES, WHO SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A window of opportunity to control infectious diseases may be
closing, the World Health Organization warned Thursday, due to
growing antibiotic resistance, emerging new diseases, and a global
explosion in urban populations and travel.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the means are at hand to curb infections, which
now kill 1,500 children and adults every hour, often at a cost of
less than 35 cents per person in the most heavily affected
countries. But those opportunities may soon slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The progress that the world can make today against infectious
diseases may not be possible a decade from now,'' the WHO declared
in a report that the agency's director, Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland,
said is intended as ``a wake-up to the world's governments,
decision-makers, and the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, a private group called the Global
Health Council released a survey showing that most Americans are
worried about global infectious diseases, ranking the problem
higher than environmental concerns and regional wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to understand that the best way to fight disease
is at its source in Third World countries,'' said Nils Daulaire,
president of the Vermont-based Global Health Council.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-page WHO report said smallpox, the only infectious
disease to have been eradicated, offers a striking example of how
timing can make all the difference between success and failure.

<P>
   If smallpox had not been defeated in 1977, the variola virus
which causes it _ the deadliest microbe in human history _ could
still be causing a million deaths a year and costing billions of
dollars in health care, WHO analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because AIDS emerged as an important disease just after
smallpox was eliminated. Since the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) impairs its victims' immune systems, the live-virus smallpox
vaccine would have been fatal to many HIV-infected individuals,
blocking mass-vaccination campaigns and preserving a reservoir of
smallpox infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a few years delay and global eradication of smallpox may
have become impossible without discovery of a new vaccine,'' the
WHO said.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO warned that ``medicines are losing their
effectiveness,'' leaving more people defenseless against diseases
that were on their way to being controlled. For instance, 45
percent of malaria cases in Thailand are resistant to the two
front-line drugs used to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, 60 percent of staph infections are resistant to
multiple antibiotics, while in the United States, 60 percent of
hospital infections are caused by resistant microbes and 14,000
hospital patients die every year from resistant infections.
</P>
<P>
   The Global Health Council survey found that four out of five
Americans are worried about mounting drug resistance, and most know
that antibiotic overuse is a major cause.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO also warns that ``new'' diseases are gaining strength,
such as hepatitis C virus (first identified in 1989, now thought to
infect 170 million people), Legionnaire's disease and ebola virus
(identified in 1976), Hanta virus in the US Southwest (1993), and a
new variant of Creutzfeld-Jacob, the infectious protein that causes
``mad cow'' disease (1996).
</P>
<P>
   All is not gloom and doom in the WHO report, however. The agency
notes that polio, leprosy, neonatal tetanus and Guinea worm disease
have nearly been eliminated. It also recounts many recent success
stories in controlling epidemics in the poorest countries, at a
cost of 27 cents to $10 per capita.

 &HT;    Bradley, Dole canvass California
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The campaign travels of Vice President Al Gore and
Texas Gov. George W. Bush this week have forced the other
candidates for president to struggle even harder for attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat and Republican who run second in most polls are
spending the week trying to improve their standing in California,
the richest prize in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is on a nine-day tour of the
state, a distinctly un-modern political swing in an era when
candidates try to cover the state with television. Conventional
wisdom is that one-on-one politicking works better in Iowa and New
Hampshire, where voters have come to expect candidate coffees and
farm visits.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley trails Gore by 30 points in California, a new Los
Angeles Times poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Former cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole spent three days
traveling from San Diego to San Francisco in search of money for
her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And in San Jose, she once again dismissed the notion that she is
really running for the second spot behind the heavily favored Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in it to win,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   New New York tune?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary vs. Rick just doesn't sing, but it may have to do.
</P>
<P>
   The media's dream match of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
against New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the U.S. Senate may not
come to pass if Rep. Rick Lazio (R-N.Y.) has his way.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio says he most likely will announce his candidacy this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   But what chance would a little-known Long Islander have against
the mayor of New York?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Long Island is the GOP base in New York. For
another, upstate New York voters may not be in love with Democrats,
but they surely do not like the New York City or its mayor. Lastly,
Lazio probably would have the support of New York's Republican
governor, George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani backed Pataki's Democratic opponent, then-Gov. Mario
Cuomo, in 1994. The governor has not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Gore watch
</P>
<P>
   Republicans (again) jumped on Gore this week when he (again)
uttered a public statement that was somewhat at odds with the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans to talk to the nation's mayors Monday, Gore said
18-to-20-year-olds can walk into gun shows, pawnshops and gun
stores and purchase handguns. In fact, federal law already makes
that illegal in pawnshops and gun stores.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's office put out a correction the same day. Gore favors
extending the ban to gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia PACS
</P>
<P>
   The Common Sense Leadership Fund, the Good Government for
America political action committee and the House Majority Fund have
one thing in common, apart from their unobjectionable names. Their
members include Georgians in Congress who use these PACs to enhance
their influence among colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Rep. Saxby Chambliss has The Common Sense fund and
Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell controls the Good Government PAC.
Democratic Rep. John Lewis, the chief deputy whip for the minority
party in the House, maintains the hopefully named House Majority
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss and Lewis each gave $34,000 from their PACs to
candidates for Congress in last year's election. Coverdell
dispensed $29,000.
</P>
<P>
   The standard for such contributions is Republican Rep. Tom DeLay
of Texas, whose leadership PAC gave so prodigiously to Republican
candidates in 1994 that he won the gratitude and votes of his
colleagues for House Majority Whip when the Republicans took
control of Congress in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The PACs have one other function. They often serve as legal
vehicles to accept campaign contributions in excess of what
individuals or other PACs can give the candidates. Chambliss's PAC,
for example, received $5,000 contributions from at least five
people who also gave the maximum $1,000 per election to Chambliss's
campaign account.

NEW CORP. AGREES TO BUY TWO PUBLISHERS FROM HEARST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   BY DOREEN CARVAJAL and GERALDINE FABRIKANT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intensifying the consolidation of the nation's top book
publishers, News Corp. announced a deal Thursday to expand
HarperCollins with the purchase of the Hearst Corp.'s Avon Books
and William Morrow &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition, estimated at less than $180 million,
HarperCollins will remain the nation's second-ranking trade
publisher of popular titles, but will expand its share of the $8
billion consumer book market to more than 10 percent. Together,
Avon and Morrow are ranked eighth among trade publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The new combination will increase the popular commercial
presence of HarperCollins, which publishes writers like Barbara
Kingsolver and John Gray, and extend its reach into the mass market
through Avon Books, the second oldest paperback publisher in the
United States. The potential union also will deepen its children's
offerings through Morrow, which was founded in 1926, and publishes
best-selling children's authors like Beverly Cleary.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of HarperCollins, which is second in size to
Bertelsmann's Random House, comes in a market for popular books
that has been roiled by consolidation within the ranks of the top
10 trade publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   With this deal, few publishing giants remain that are ripe for
future sales, but consolidation is quickening in other categories
of publishing and reaching the second tier of mid-level companies
that have remained independent thus far. The interest comes not
just from publishers. Distributors are buying small presses, for
instance. Even the nation's largest bookstore chain, Barnes &AMP;
Noble, has become one of the leading suitors for Friedman/Fairfax
Publishers, a New York company specializing in nonfiction and
illustrated gardening and home decorating books, according to a
person with knowledge of the negotiations. A Barnes &AMP; Noble
spokesman, Mary Ellen Keating, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the educational and professional publisher John Wiley
&AMP; Sons announced that it had closed its $82 million acquisition of
the San Francisco publisher Jossey-Bass, a deal that followed its
$58 million purchase of a list of 60 college titles from Pearson
PLC _ which sold the titles and Jossey-Bass as part of its purchase
and break-up of a large part of Simon &AMP; Schuster last year.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, News Corp. considered selling HarperCollins,
but having kept it, it is now trying to expand, a move that spreads
the heavy costs of operating over a broader base. HarperCollins,
which got $200 million of its total $737 million in sales last year
from Britain, also is said to be involved in discussions to
increase its clout abroad through a possible merger of its foreign
operations in Britain with Penguin/Putnam, which is owned by
Pearson, or W.H. Smith, Britain's largest book retailer which
bought a large stake in the British publisher Hodder Headline.
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins' announcement of its planned purchase drew mixed
reviews, but it appeared that the expansion was not big enough to
prompt any organized effort to challenge it for anti-competitive
reasons and executives expect the deal to be completed within about
30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Authors Guild, which took its challenge of
Bertelsmann's purchase of Random House last year and its union with
Bantam Doubleday Dell to federal regulators, said it probably would
not follow the same strategy in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Letty Cottin Pogrebin, the president of the organization, said
that HarperCollins was not expanding enough to satisfy requirements
for a federal review for antitrust violations. She noted, however,
that she remained wary about the union of more imprints under
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. because of a 1998 incident in which
HarperCollins dropped the publication of a book by Chris Patten,
the last British governor of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Murdoch blamed the cancellation on publishing
executives who ``screwed it up'' although the decision was widely
attributed to Murdoch's desire to avoid antagonizing the leaders of
China, where he has large media investments.
</P>
<P>
   At HarperCollins, the company's chief executive, Jane Friedman,
said that the planned purchase of Avon and Morrow was News Corp.'s
``stamp of approval'' of the effort to turn around HarperCollins.
HarperCollins struggled through a bleak period in 1997 when it
canceled about 100 book contracts and took a $270 million charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled, I'm thankful and this says that we are here to
stay,'' Ms. Friedman said. ``And to be here, to stay in this
competitive environment one has to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that it was too early to answer whether any of
HarperCollins' imprints will be merged with the publishing units of
Morrow and Avon, which between them have 22 imprints and publish
1,000 books annually. Both Morrow and HarperCollins, for example,
each have six children's book imprints.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of the union, Ms. Friedman said, is that ``you've got
a bigger market share and you've got economies of scale, which of
course we all are looking for.'' She added, ``We are obviously
going to be looking at some consolidation, but nothing to speculate
on at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   William M. Wright, the chief executive of the Hearst Book Group,
which is the unit that will preside over Avon and William Morrow,
will remain a Hearst employee, but will participate in the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about potential job reductions, Ms. Friedman said she
could not comment because she first needs to ``get to know
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But some literary agents remained concerned about the potential
consolidation. On the one hand, the company's expansion could
increase advances for established commercial writers because
HarperCollins will have more resources to compete for authors in
high demand within the industry, said Robert Gottlieb, a literary
agent and executive vice president of the William Morris Agency.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he said: ``It makes my job much more
difficult. There are fewer places now to grow new writers. Whenever
these companies make new acquisitions, the first thing they say is
that it's going to be business as usual. But the reality is that
they try to create a greater level of production and greater
margins, by cutting down on their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind all this activity is the reality that most publishing
companies have single-digit profit margins, hovering around eight
percent while educational publishers are more profitable with
margins of 17 to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, trade publishers are sold for lower multiples than
other types of publishers, usually for one to 1.2 times sales
revenues. News Corp. is buying Morrow and Avon for less than $180
million _ a price that is not a premium one because the companies'
sales revenues last year totaled about that amount. The price is
also less than the $220 million that they were asking for six years
ago when MCA's Putnam Berkeley Group considered buying the
companies then.
</P>
<P>
   By merging, a buyer gets saving on warehousing, distributing,
order processing and marketing, all of which can be spread across a
broader number of books.
</P>
<P>
   Using that logic, some analysts believe that Time Warner, which
owns Warner Books and Little Brown &AMP; Co., might be interested in
acquiring Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   However, a person close to Time Warner said that the company had
no intention of expanding its publishing business dramatically.

CLINTONS' MENU TAKES MIDDLE ROAD AT DINNER IN PARIS WITH CHIRACS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ President Clinton asked for a slice of life, and if it
included a slice of lamb, well, all the better.
</P>
<P>
   In arranging the president's only night out in Paris on his
weeklong European trip, U.S. officials told their French
counterparts the president wasn't interested in a three-star
gourmet experience. Something more typical, ``s'il vous plait.''
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were whisked
away Wednesday night in their bulletproof car (``l'immense
limousine,'' noted Agence France-Presse) to the unassuming Chez
l'Ami Louis. It's in the middle-class third ``arrondissement,'' one
of the 20 numbered zones of the French capital _ each with a
certain character and cachet, or lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   On the doorstep of the plain 70-year-old establishment on the
Rue du Vertbois waited the first couple's dining companions,
President Jacques Chirac and his wife, Bernadette.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac kissed Ms. Clinton. Clinton shook Ms. Chirac's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant owner Louis Gadby was ready with hearty fare from the
southwest of France.
</P>
<P>
   For starters there was air-cured ham and that terror of
cardiologists, ``foie gras,'' or perhaps buttery snails (``escargot
Bourgogne''). Then again, what about some rich preserved duck
(``confit d'canard'') or fancy frog (``grenouilles a la
provenale'')?
</P>
<P>
   Then on to the main course. Gadby recommended roasted young lamb
(``agneau de lait roti'') with potatoes (``pommes bearnaise'').
There was also beef or mutton, quail or a bit of roasted pigeon or
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Elysee Palace, the French White House, Clinton
chose the ham-``foie gras'' combo and the lamb. The wine was a 1990
St. Julien. Dessert was described as ``red fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the menu that amused French political wags. Even
though Chirac was once mayor of Paris, they offered wagers on the
last time the French president had dined in ``the third.'' It's an
area known for, well, not much. Street after street is lined with
aging apartment buildings of the solid bourgeois sort, with offices
and stores here and there.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-class choice of neighborhood prompted a touch of
sneering Thursday from morning radio commentators who found it a
little too calculatedly egalitarian.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac must have tucked in pretty good, because the button on
his dark blue suit looked a touch tight Thursday as he appeared
with Clinton before reporters on the exquisitely manicured lawn of
the Elysee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very pleasant dinner,'' Chirac said. ``I can't say
that we worked a great deal ... to tell you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a wonderful dinner,'' Clinton said. ``We had a terrific
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons drove to the restaurant from the residence of the
U.S. ambassador on the ever-smart Rue du Faubourg Saint Honore (in
the second ``arrondissement,'' a mixed district that includes some
of Paris' most stylishly elegant and grittiest neighborhoods).
</P>
<P>
   As the motorcade formed, there was an impromptu moment that
White House planners try desperately to avoid. Across the street,
in a large French window, appeared a well-fed matron, decked out in
skirt, earrings and white brassiere.
</P>
<P>
   A true Parisian, she nonchalantly removed curlers from her hair
and stepped out onto her balcony and into the warm late spring
evening _ grabbing a silk blouse and clutching it to her front only
when photographers waiting for Clinton started snapping her
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Her unabashed husband soon appeared beside her, taking off his
pants, which left him in briefs, shirt and tie.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was not about to say whether Clinton had seen
the little exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Food was still on the American president's mind Thursday when he
took a break from official meetings and did a bit of sightseeing _
an homage to his first trip to Paris 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among his stops was a shop selling the top-rated Berthillon ice
cream. A shop assistant tried to press the prune flavor on Clinton
but had no luck. Two scoops of strawberry was the presidential
decree. Clinton was ready to pay with some francs, but the clerk
sniffily refused, insisting it was gratis.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service agents tried to keep control over a crush of
people, many of them fellow American tourists intent on getting a
look at the president. One reporter heard an agent push people out
of the way with the warning, ``I'm armed.''
</P>
<P>
   That did not intimidate a slim woman in a one-shouldered black
dress who demanded, and got, a Continental kiss on each cheek from
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a beautiful man,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A more robust matron in orange begged for a hug.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton complied, she squealed: ``Now I can die happy.''

CHINA CALLS U.S. EXPLANATION FOR EMBASSY BOMBING `UNCONVINCING' 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ One day after Under Secretary of State Thomas
Pickering presented Chinese officials with a detailed explanation
of how NATO warplanes could have accidentally bombed the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade last month, the Chinese government rejected it
Thursday as ``unconvincing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering spent hours on Wednesday briefing Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan and other officials about the conclusions of an
investigation into the bombing, which killed three Chinese and set
off angry anti-American protests here.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the report's findings were featured on state-run
television and carried by the official New China News Agency _
along with a detailed Chinese government analysis concluding that
the American explanations were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This irrelevant explanation only shows that the United States
lacks any sincerity,'' said People's Daily, the Communist Party
newspaper, in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's rejection of the American version of events marked
another setback for Chinese-American relations, which were at a low
point at the time of the bombing, but recently had seemed to be
mending somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an opportunity here to move forward on WTO and other
big issues, but instead something in the Chinese foreign
policy-making process made them want to rachet this up again,''
said David Zweig, a China expert at the Hong Kong University of
Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But some Chinese were more optimistic, seeing the exchanges on
this issue as a first step in a healing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Chinese perspective the explanation is not
convincing,'' said Jia Qingguo, a professor of international
politics at Beijing University. ``But I think China wants further
clarification so it can get over its doubts, so that it can move on
in the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Chinese have been convinced from the start that the United
States intentionally bombed the embassy, though few can say why the
United States would want to do that. Many believe it was intended
to test China's resolve or to punish China for its vocal opposition
to the NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has promised to provide a fuller
briefing to Congress and news organizations when Pickering returns
to Washington next week, James Foley, the deputy State Department
spokesman, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you've seen Chinese spokesmen on television this
morning indicating that they were not fully satisfied with the
report.'' Foley said. ``I would like to point out, though, that
from our perspective, we believe that the information Ambassador
Pickering provided is sufficient to demonstrate that the bombing
was a terrible mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official, who spoke only on condition that he
not be identified, suggested that the hostile Chinese response to
the explanation may be partly for internal consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Although American officials refused to discuss the contents of
Pickering's presentation, Chinese news outlets gave detailed
reports Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The New China News Agency said that Pickering told the Chinese
that the intended target was the Yugoslav Federal Directorate for
Supply and Procurement, but that these errors resulted in striking
the embassy instead:
</P>
<P>
   _ American intelligence used three maps, two produced in
Yugoslavia and one by a U.S. government agency in 1997, none of
which specifically identified the directorate or the correct
location of the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   _ An American intelligence officer _ ``in breach of operational
rules'' _ preliminarily located the target by extrapolating from
``the pattern and numbering system'' of parallel streets. He
mistakenly picked out the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Military and targeting databases had not been updated and
contained an old address for the Chinese Embassy, so the error was
not detected.
</P>
<P>
   _ Targeting reviews also failed to pick up the mistake, and the
air crew, flying high and at night, could not see identifying
markers.

<P>
   SEOUL _ A US Navy warship sailed into South Korean waters
Thursday to help restore calm, two days after a brief but deadly
gunbattle between North and South Korean vessels.
</P>
<P>
   But the shootout that sank a North Korean warship, killing an
estimated 30 sailors aboard, has left analysts here wondering why
North Korea would provoke the worst naval clash between the divided
neighbors since the Korean War _ less than a week before
long-awaited talks between the enemy nations.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings planned for Monday in Beijing will be the first
direct government contact between the two Koreas in 14 months, and
the gunbattle is sure to sour the negotiating climate.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul says the clash began when Northern vessels crossed into
Southern waters and fired, capping a nine-day standoff between
warships protecting crab-fishing vessels on either side.
</P>
<P>
   The incident comes while the Communist North and capitalist
South _ separated by the world's most militarized border _ have
been hard at work developing business contacts and opening limited
tourism to the hermetically sealed North.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say North Korea's unpredictable and contradictory
behavior is part of a two-pronged strategy. It is improving social
and economic relations with Seoul to extract desperately needed aid
_ while at the same time flexing military muscle to pressure
Washington into signing a final peace treaty to end the Korean War
and decrease its huge military presence in the South.
</P>
<P>
   An armistice halted the 1950-53 conflict, which claimed 50,000
American lives.
</P>
<P>
   The North's Jekyll-and-Hyde strategy may seem bizarre to
outsiders. But Pyongyang's isolated, Stalinist leadership regards
South Korea as a puppet state controlled by Washington and has long
wanted to negotiate directly with the United States for the
withdrawal of 37,000 American troops deployed in the South, as well
as for the lifting of US economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether South Korea's president, Kim Dae
Jung, who has pursued a controversial engagement policy toward the
North since early last year, can continue to indulge the North's
mercurial behavior without suffering political backlash from
domestic hawks. Similarly, the United States, which has pursued a
limited engagement strategy and recently sent US presidential envoy
William J. Perry to talk with North Korean leaders, could
eventually lose patience with the hot-and-cold response.
</P>
<P>
   Perry is expected to propose to Congress and the White House
that the US lift economic sanctions in exchange for promises by
Pyongyang to freeze nuclear weapons development and halt missile
testing and proliferation. The CIA says North Korea is the world's
largest exporter of ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``For North Korea, being very aggressive to South Korea on one
hand and being positive to the US on the other is a traditional
negotiating strategy _ it's a two-track policy'' to drive a wedge
in the close alliance between Seoul and Washington, said Park
Young-Ho, a senior fellow at the Korea Institute for National
Unification, a government think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Sparking a sea battle before scheduled talks next week is also
likely an attempt by Pyongyang to shift the agreed-upon agenda from
food aid and cross-border family reunification to security issues,
and to try to frighten Washington with the supposed military
prowess of the North, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Seoul seems eager to play down the incident. This week,
cruise ships filled with Southern tourists sailed to the North as
scheduled, Seoul delivered shipments of donated fertilizer as
promised, and a business trip to Pyongyang by Samsung officials
went ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to our intelligence sources,'' a South Korean
official said, ``North Korea is not preparing for war...They may be
provoking us in order to get more (concessions) in Beijing. We want
peace, so if they provoke, they think the South will give more.
They often do this before conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Japanese media quoted US military sources saying that
North Korea began in April conducting propulsion tests on a
long-range missile that could reach Alaska. The sources said the
missile launch pad has been enlarged and fuel transported to
storehouses, but that a launch did not appear imminent. The South
Korean defense ministry could not confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, analysts here say, the cat and mouse strategy shows
Pyongyang's underlying weakness and desperation. North Korea's
economy has shrunk every year since the collapse of the Soviet
Union, its onetime benefactor, and aid workers estimate 2 million
people have died from starvation brought on by drought and state
farm mismanagement in the last four years. That leaves the North
with few options but to negotiate in exchange for aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to maintain social cohesion, North Korea needs a
common enemy and a certain tension,'' said Koh Il-Dong, a North
Korea expert at the Korea Development Institute. ``Every time they
need to make a deal, they pull out a new card to exploit to get
more concessions.''

FIDELITY UPS SIZE OF BOND OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Institutional investors jumped Thursday at a rare
chance to own a piece of the action at Fidelity Investments,
prompting the mutual fund behemoth to increase its landmark bond
offering to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity told investors not to start thinking about owning
Fidelity stock one day. The nation's largest fund firm, privately
owned and closely held, said it had no intention of becoming a
publicly traded company, with shares listed on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, in an unusual move to tap markets for cash, boosted
its $750 million corporate bond offering by one third to meet a
crush of demand from New York investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   The debt offering, the largest in the Boston firm's 53-year
history, gave investors not just the highest rated bonds of any
asset management company, but also securities in one of the money
world's most profitable businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fidelity name was extremely well received by the
marketplace,'' said Bill White, head of US syndication at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, the investment bank that led the offering.
</P>
<P>
   While Fidelity said it would use proceeds from the borrowing for
internal purposes, the uncommon cash-raising venture spurred
speculation that the firm might be testing the waters for a stock
offering. Because it is privately owned, with 49 percent of its
shares in the hands of the Johnson family of Boston, whose
billionaire patriarch, Edward C. ``Ned'' Johnson III, runs the
firm, Fidelity is not required under law to reveal much about its
inner workings.
</P>
<P>
   But in line with securities industry disclosure rules, the bond
offering document provided a treasure trove of financial details.
The confidential memorandum, a copy of which was obtained Thursday
by the Globe, confirmed reports that show Fidelity doing a booming
business amid a record bull market. The document's profit, cash
flow, and other information fueled industry talk that Fidelity
wanted to see how investors would assess the company's financial
details as a warm-up to drafting the tell-all documents required
for issuing stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be seeing how Wall Street's going to react, and this
is a way to get some information out into the public,'' said
Nikolas Lanyi, editor of the independent Fidelity Insight
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbish, said Fidelity spokesman Thomas Eidson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you categorically that we have no interest in going
public,'' Eidson said. ``We're going to use the money from the
offering for general corporate purposes.'' The Johnson family has
said it has no intention of selling the firm, which industry
observers speculate could fetch at least $24 billion and possibly
more than $35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On other fronts, Fidelity's bond document provided a rare
glimpse into one of the investment world's most powerful yet
inscrutable companies.
</P>
<P>
   One section stated that Fidelity reduced its charitable giving
last quarter while increasing compensation and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Another part suggested Fidelity thought that cheap on-line
trading _ a goal for many traditional money management firms these
days _ might not produce happy results. ``Although Fidelity has
experienced a significant increase in on-line trading since it
reduced its commissions,'' the document said, ``the long-term
effect on net commission revenues has not yet been determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, which manages $805 billion in assets, sells mutual
funds to individual and institutional investors and operates an
on-line brokerage. As Fidelity customers migrated to fast and
inexpensive on-line trading services, offered by Fidelity and
others, commissions per trade had suffered and revenue from
brokerage commissions had declined, the document said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fidelity _ whose skipper, Johnson, is a technology addict
_ would probably use some of the proceeds from Thursday's bond
offering to help beef up the firm's technology, including at the
on-line brokerage, Lanyi said. Fidelity spends $500 million a year
on technology projects. The document said the firm expected to
invest in property and equipment, make strategic investments in new
technologies and products, and seek ``attractive opportunities''
for its venture capital unit property.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's bond offering injected new life into a corporate bond
market that has been jittery about possible interest rate hikes.
Fidelity sold $750 million in 30-year notes at 7.57 percent and
$250 million in 20-year notes at 7.49 percent, all in a private
placement to four investment banks and Fidelity's capital markets
division, White said.

 &HT;    `Owning up' can cut the damage
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite vigorous efforts to cooperate with health
officials and analyze the production problems that have bedeviled
its soft drinks in Europe, Coca-Cola Co. has so far failed to calm
health fears that sprang up a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the hours fly by, the precious Coca-Cola brand is threatened,
with one country and then another registering levels of concern
about the beverages.
</P>
<P>
   The alarms at Coke's Atlanta headquarters were first set off
last week when schoolchildren became ill in Belgium after consuming
bottled Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola officials have been working with health agencies and
others in Europe to try to isolate the problems of contamination
that have produced illness and fears from Belgium to France,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bill Casey, president of Coca-Cola Europe, and Randy
Donaldson, vice president for global communications, flew to Europe
to take personal charge of developments and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   A team of technical specialists from the United States and
Europe have been working with European bottlers to address
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman M. Douglas Ivester issued his first public statement on
the crisis Wednesday, apologizing to European customers for the
problems and pledging that the company ``is taking all necessary
steps to ensure that all our products meet the highest quality
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   While Belgium announced Thursday it was allowing Coca-Cola to
resume the sale of some products, sale of the signature soft drinks
was still suspended _ all pending some clear and satisfying
explanation of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Experts praised the early action by Coke to take the complaint
seriously and remove products. In doing so, said the London Times
newspaper, the company may have sidestepped the worse mistakes of
Perrier, the mineral water company that stalled and dragged its
feet in 1990 when its products were found to be contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Coke is undoubtedly terrified that things might spiral
out of control, it has acted coolly and slickly in seeking to
contain damage,'' said the London newspaper. ``Branding experts say
it has done all the right things, owning up to the problem and
taking prompt action,'' the paper continued, echoing the views of
many American analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the public concerns do not subside.
</P>
<P>
   There are some views that probably should have spoken sooner,
perhaps even gone to Europe himself as a symbolic show of personal
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Holmes, editor and publisher of Reputation Management
Magazine, which studies and reports on corporate image problems,
said, ``In an age of global media, when any threat _ whether true
or unfounded _ is aimed at your brand's reputation, you must react
immediately from the highest levels within the organization, no
matter where in the world the threat is being launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Coke's case, waiting several days to issue a response (from
Ivester) from corporate headquarters in the United States raised
serious questions about the company's sensitivity to customer
safety concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   From all appearances, of course, internally at Coca-Cola there
has been deep concern, though a kind of domino effect among the
European nations has escalated the scope of the public fears.
</P>
<P>
   Though Coca-Cola has been busy and not indulging in denial, as
time drags along without turning the corner and without a clear
bill of health, there could be an erosion of consumer confidence
among jittery Europeans not unlike the Perrier problem of nine
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Perrier danced and dodged before finally pulling the products
from shelves. But in the bargain, the company lost substantial
market share, which it has not fully regained to this day, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Perrier, of course, was paraded as a health product before being
brought low by its problems.
</P>
<P>
   Coke, quite differently, is a chemical product, marketed
unabashedly as a fun drink. The product has lagged in sales in
recent months, held down mostly by economic problems in Asia,
Russia and Latin America, and shares in the company have been
lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a lot less fun than usual lately in Atlanta, and
there clearly is an urgent need for some breakthrough in confidence
in Europe for the Coke products.

HOUSE BACKS 10 COMMANDMENTS IN SCHOOLS, THEN TURNS AGAIN TO GUN
CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(EDS: Subs 2nd graph to update with vote on juvenile crime bill) (rm) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted Thursday to allow the Ten
Commandments to be posted in schools, and then turned to a tense
debate over the most significant gun control legislation to come
before it in in five years.
</P>
<P>
   With both parties searching for an answer to school violence,
gun regulation came center-stage after two long days of sometimes
impassioned clashes over God, values, the entertainment industry
and the Constitution. That debate culminated Thursday night in
287-139 vote to pass a wide-ranging bill that would provide $1.5
billion for fighting juvenile crime and enact tough new mandatory
sentences for young people in gun crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In a significant victory for social conservatives, the House
voted 248-180 to include in the crime bill an amendment sponsored
by Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., giving states the right to allow
the display of the Ten Commandments in public places, including
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, the House turned to a separate bill on gun
control, which is the preferred political ground of the Democrats.
A dozen separate gun amendments were under consideration, running a
gamut from a measure requiring child safety devices to be sold with
handguns to a proposal to repeal the District of Columbia's ban on
the possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant showdown was over rival measures of varying
strictness to regulate sales of weapons at gun shows, at which
collectors and hobbyists selling firearms are not currently
required to conduct the kinds of background checks on buyers that
licensed dealers are.
</P>
<P>
   In a fierce lobbying blitz, President Clinton arose at 5 a.m. in
Paris to telephone four wavering Democrats: Gary Conduit and Mike
Thompson of California, Marion Berry of Arkansas and Ron Kind of
Wisconsin to urge them to vote for a gun show amendment sponsored
by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was shot to death
by a gunman on the Long Island Railroad in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy for the United States to be the only advanced
country in the world that doesn't take comprehensive, sensible,
thorough steps to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals,''
Clinton told reporters in Paris. ``It's just _ it doesn't make any
sense.'' To hammer home the point, the White House sent Attorney
General Janet Reno to the Capitol late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority
whip of Texas, shored up support among conservatives for a weaker
version sponsored by another Democrat, Rep. John Dingell of
Michigan, who is a former member of the NRA board.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell _ whose victory would be a blow to the president and the
Democratic congressional leadership _ insisted that he was going to
win. He said that Clinton would not make headway with conservative
Democrats because ``he cost us control of the House and a lot of
people remember that.'' The Republicans won the majority in 1994,
months after Congress enacted a ban on assault weapons avidly
sought by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the NRA has largely held sway on Capitol Hill. But
after the shocking school shooting in Littleton, Colo., the Senate
last month _ with Vice President Gore casting the tie-breaking vote
_ approved a proposal that would compel all vendors at gun shows,
licensed or unlicensed, to run such checks. Law enforcement
officials are given three business days to complete the checks.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell's version on gun shows is much less stringent. It
narrowly defines what constitutes a gun show, and only 24 hours
would be allotted for background checks. Mrs. McCarthy's version
largely mirrors the Senate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the procedures for the debate, Dingell's measure was to be
considered first, and both sides considered it the most likely to
pass. But even a majority vote does not guarantee its survival. If
Mrs. McCarthy's amendment also wins a majority vote, it trumps the
Dingell proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, Reps. McCarthy, Nita M. Lowey of New
York and Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut made last-ditch phone calls to
undecided colleagues from Mrs. McCarthy's office. And Mrs. McCarthy
and Ms. Lowey even agonized over the order of the speech-making to
come on the floor, as if that might decide the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats expected about 45 of their members from the South and
West to vote with Dingell. Gun control advocates thought they had
30 Republicans firmly on their side. That left the outcome of the
vote in the hands of about two dozen wavering lawmakers, most of
them Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of this debate have become so convoluted that no
matter which gun show measure prevails, final passage of a gun
control bill remains in doubt. No one could predict whether
conservatives _ even those who join Dingell to water down gun shows
language _ will vote for the legislation if any other gun
restrictions also prevail. Liberals, on the other hand, are likely
to bolt if Mrs. McCarthy's proposal fails.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The two parties were already preparing to blame each other if an
odd coalition of conservatives and liberals caused the legislation
to collapse. ``If Republicans cynically vote for Dingell and
against the bill then their strategy is no gun safety,'' charged
Rep. Stenny Hoyer, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said of the final bill, ``the less gun control, the more
apt it is to pass.'' And Dingell refused to say whether he would
vote for the final measure if his amendment prevailed, but other
gun control provisions like a child safety device or a raise in the
minimum age for all handgun purchases from 18 to 21 also were
approved.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday and early Thursday the House approved a variety
of measures signaling support, sometimes symbolic and sometimes
more concrete, for public expressions of religion. The debate over
the Ten Commandments was the most spirited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that simply posting the Ten Commandments will not
instantly change the moral character of our nation,'' Aderholt, the
measure's sponsor, said just before midnight Wednesday. ``However,
it is an important step to promote morality and an end of children
killing children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., displayed the copy of the Ten Commandments
he hangs in his office. He repeatedly mentioned God and argued that
display of the commandments did not _ as his critics charged _
violate the Constitutional guarantee of separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in these Ten Commandments that reaches out
and grabs somebody and forces them to abide by any particular
religious belief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of Congress disagreed. ``This amendment seeks to
elevate one particular religion over all others,'' said Rep. Robert
Scott, D-Va. ``This singling out of one religion is contrary to the
American ideal of religious tolerance and is blatantly
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York City also raised constitutional
questions. ``Whose Ten Commandments?'' he asked. ``Which version?
The Catholic version? The Protestant version? Or the Jewish
version?''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in 1980 declared unconstitutional a Kentucky
law requiring that a copy of the Ten Commandments be posted in
every public school classroom. The court held that the law violated
the constitutional separation of church and state, serving neither
a ``secular legislative purpose'' nor an educational function.
</P>
<P>
   In other votes touching on religion, the House overwhelmingly
approved measures allowing the use of religious language in
memorials on school grounds and allowing religious organization to
compete for government social service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   A day after rejecting an effort to impose a prison term on those
selling violent entertainment to teenagers, lawmakers also debated
and approved several measures that served primarily to make
Congress' displeasure with the entertainment industry known. One of
these proposals directed the surgeon general to prepare a report on
the effects of interactive video games on youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   The House also overwhelming approved a non-binding resolution by
Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., calling the entertainment industry
irresponsible in its marketing to youth and urging it to curtail
``portrays of pointless acts of brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can there be any doubt at all that the entertainment industry
has contributed to the culture of violence that has manifested
itself in Colorado, in Georgia, in Jonesboro, Arkansas?'' asked
Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich., listing sites of recent school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   California Democrats complained that the resolution was too
broad. ``Don't condem a whole industry,'' said Rep. Howard Berman
of California, protesting ``blanket guilt by association.'' Rep.
Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., shot back sarcastically, ``I suppose the
Democrats would never condemn an entire industry'' _ an implied
reference to Democratic attacks on tobacco and gun manufacturers.

CLINTON SEES NO QUICK RESULTS FROM MILOSEVIC INDICTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ Still trying to sort out the untidy aftermath
of the Kosovo war, President Clinton suggested Thursday that the
indictment of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by the war
crimes tribunal would serve to isolate Serbia on the international
stage but would not immediately affect Milosevic's personal
position in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   As forensic experts prepared to enter Kosovo to examine mass
grave sites that could yield evidence for the war crimes tribunal
in the Hague, Clinton urged patience on what the ultimate outcome
of Milosevic's indictment would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that the NATO allies can invade Belgrade to
try to deliver the indictment,'' Clinton said at a news conference
with President Jacques Chirac of France.
</P>
<P>
   ``That does not mean that this is not an important thing, or
that there won't someday be a trial.'' Sometimes, he added, ``these
things take a good while to bear fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Clinton held talks with Chirac and French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin on the future of Kosovo and the Balkans. He
strolled in the Tuileries gardens, spent half an hour shopping on
Rue St.-Louis en l'Ile, and then flew to Cologne, Germany, where he
will attend a three-day meeting of the seven leading industrial
countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton is scheduled to meet with President Boris
Yeltsin of Russia. At the top of that agenda will be the Russian
military role in Kosovo, which administration officials said they
hoped would be settled by then at talks between U.S. and Russian
military officials in Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
   How to deal with the reconstruction of the Balkan region but at
the same time not reward Milosevic has become one of the trickier
problems that the allied leaders are beginning to confront. Both
Chirac and Clinton said Thursday that they favored relief aid to
Serbia, on the grounds that Serbian people suffered during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac expressed the justification for the ban on economic
assistance to Serbia most strongly: ``There can be no economic
development aid to a regime which is not democratic and whose
present leader, furthermore, has been indicted with crimes against
humanity by the international war crimes court.''
</P>
<P>
   How long Milosevic will retain his grip on power and how
vulnerable he is now that his troops are withdrawing from Kosovo
are being assessed by Balkan specialists in the Clinton
administration as well as in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The question of his survival in power is important because
economic experts assert that to try and revive southeastern Europe
without including Serbia is a tough proposition. ``It is difficult
to conceive of the reconstruction of the Balkans without the
participation of Serbia, because the land routes go through
Serbia,'' said Vladimir Gligorov, an economist at the Institute for
Comparative Economics in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   For countries like Bulgaria and Macedonia to regain their trade,
for instance, bridges through Serbia would have to be repaired,
economic experts said. Bulgaria announced Thursday that it had
lifted its ban on the export of oil to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   So far, officials said they believed that Milosevic would strive
to consolidate his power in the police force, his traditional
source of strength. It was too early to assess how the Yugoslav
army, now retreating from Kosovo, would react to Milosevic's
decision to order their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short run, they said, Milosevic would probably
prevail. He has already sent signals that he will organize
parliamentary elections before the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   By calling quick elections, Milosevic is apparently planning to
take advantage of the disarray among the democratic opposition
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic will also try to create an atmosphere of normalcy by
lifting the state of war that he imposed at the start of the air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The call this week by the leaders of the Serbian Orthodox Church
for Milosevic's resignation was important symbolically and
represented a dramatic shift in the church's attitude, officials
said. But its practical effect on Milosevic in the short term is
hard to predict in a country where the political opposition is
barely visible and the church is not the powerful popular force
that it is in some other countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer run, Western diplomats said their hopes for
unseating Milosevic depend on some influential sector of Yugoslav
society's becoming disenchanted enough to put political pressure on
a leader who has proved impervious to opposition in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's closest cronies, Western diplomats said, may find it
increasingly difficult to maintain their wealth.
</P>
<P>
   It was some of those businessmen, particularly those close to
Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic, who appear to have had
considerable influence in persuading Milosevic to agree to the
peace settlement, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   These cronies are not going to be much better off now, diplomats
said. About 300 Serbian officials and businessmen, all of them
close associates of Milosevic, are not able to get visas to
European Union countries. The ban on visas for these people was put
in place last year as part of a series of sanctions intended to
punish the Milosevic government because of its repression in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This travel ban, which European diplomats said would be
maintained, will circumscribe the ability of those businessmen to
hold on to their wealth. During the NATO air strikes, several of
them were refused entry into Hungary, even though Hungary is not
yet a member of the European Union, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic pressure will increase, and these people could
turn against him,'' a European Union diplomat said.

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the height of the Mexican peso crisis in
1995, Lawrence Summers was the favorite target of the Senate
Finance Committee. He was viewed as the scheming architect of an
end-run around Congress that resulted in the $12 billion Mexican
bailout. Some Republicans called for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, virtually all the members of the same committee
said they expected Summers, the Harvard economist whom President
Clinton nominated last month to succeed Robert Rubin, to easily win
approval as the 71st treasury secretary of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But first they wanted him to suffer a little.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-hour confirmation hearing, Summers twice apologized
for saying over lunch with a small group of reporters in 1997 that
Republicans wanted to cut estate taxes because of ``selfishness.''
(``What I said there was wrong,'' Summers said. ``It is always
wrong to impugn motives in these kinds of policy debates.'')
</P>
<P>
   He sparred at length with an angry Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.,
about the administration's plans for financing Social Security.
Pressed on the question of whether the administration would raise
payroll taxes, he would say only that Clinton would not raise
``payroll tax rates,'' leaving open the possibility that the
administration could find other ways to raise revenue, including
increasing the ceiling on incomes that are subject to the tax.
Currently, it applies to the first $72,000 in income.
</P>
<P>
   And then Summers and Kerrey entered a lengthy debate on the
question of how the government would pay to convert into cash
Treasury bonds that Clinton proposes to place in the Social
Security trust fund so that it does not run out of money. Summers
ducked and dodged a bit until Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D--N.Y., the ranking Democrat on the committee, exclaimed: ``Larry,
it's taxes!''
</P>
<P>
   Summers later acknowledged that the general revenue pool of the
government would have to be tapped to liquidate the bonds, leading
Kerrey to conclude that the president's solution to saving Social
Security was no solution at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the president's answer to the problem,'' Kerrey said.
``Take the current problem that we have of using more individual
and corporate income taxes to pay Social Security beneficiaries and
consider it to be a virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would see it differently,'' said Summers, clearly trying to
obey the unwritten mandate that nominees should never engage in
lengthy arguments with senators voting on their confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   For all the heat of the exchanges, there was never any real
question that Summers is likely to be confirmed. The last real
obstacle was surmounted on Wednesday, when the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, announced that he had negotiated a deal that
would lift a freeze on all Senate confirmations. The freeze had
been declared, under the rules of senatorial privilege, by Sen.
James Inhofe, R-Okla. Inhofe said he was outraged that Clinton had
issued a recess appointment for James Hormel as ambassador to
Luxembourg. Hormel is a gay businessman, and the appointment was
made when the Senate was out of session to avoid opposition to his
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Summers had clearly trained for Thursday's hearing, suppressing
his occasional tendency to respond to questions with a quick and
sometimes cutting quip, and an attitude that demonstrated he knew
far more about a subject than the questioner. It was this approach
that contributed to his troubles in 1995. Nonetheless, on Thursday
one of the senators who was most vocal in opposing the Mexican
bailout, Frank Murkowski, D-Alaska, conceded that he had been
wrong. ``I think it is fair to say that you and Secretary Rubin
proved that you were on a correct path,'' Murkowski said, an
acknowledgment that Mexico both recovered and repaid its loans from
the United States.

 &HT;    Airlines take reform pledge
 &HT;    By Shannon Shelton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Waiting out delay at Hartsfield International Airport
is a routine part of life for Clyde Fones of Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Fones, who often flies Delta Air Lines for business trips, was
sitting Thursday afternoon at a Delta gate again, hoping his latest
stay wouldn't strand him too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the third time in two weeks I've been delayed,'' he
said after arriving from Hartford, Conn. ``I was supposed to leave
at 3:40, but I'm going to be delayed at least until 4:10.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to reduce the frequency of such complaints, the U.S.
airline industry Thursday unveiled voluntary reforms designed to
provide more consumer protections for air passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The measures, which include promises of low fare quotes and
increased liability for lost baggage, are expected to halt
congressional moves for a passenger ``bill of rights.'' Air
Transport Association President Carol Hallett said the picture of
uncaring airlines was not accurate, but ``we all need and want to
do a better job'' and ``when Congress gets our attention, that's
when we really do react.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta, the focus of Fones' agitation, had no objections to the
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta wholeheartedly supports this plan,'' spokeswoman Kay
Horner said Thursday. ``It's good for consumers and airlines. It
addresses the concerns of passengers and enables airlines to
compete in a healthy, competitive environment.'' Orlando,
Fla.-based AirTran said it would lay out its guidelines after
further review of the plan. ``Once we do that, we are going to work
on a plan of our own passenger bill of rights,'' spokeswoman Shelia
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Smith, a Roseland, N.J., resident, also waiting at
Hartsfield for a delayed Continental Airlines flight to Newark, was
skeptical about the vows of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea, but I don't think the airlines will
follow it,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to take such steps came after much-publicized incidents
during a storm last winter when passengers flying Northwest
Airlines were forced to sit seven or more hours on runways in
Detroit without food and other services.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers like Fones think reforms can't arrive too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're footing the bill for the airlines and taking it in the
neck,'' Fones said
</P>
<P>
   VOLUNTARY REFORMS
</P>
<P>
   _ Quote the lowest available fare for each flight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Notify customers at the airport and on board the aircraft with
the ``best available'' information on delays, cancellations and
flight re-routings. In addition, each carrier would have to
establish a set policy for passengers stranded overnight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give consumers a 24-hour window after reserving a ticket to
decide whether to make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   _ Support a Department of Transportation proposal to increase
the current liability limit of $1,250 per bag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide prompt refunds, accommodate disabled passengers and
meet customer needs during long on-aircraft delays.

DALY CHALLENGES FOR EARLY LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ They used to point out that nothing could be
finer than to be in Carolina, but after four days of rainy and
overcast conditions that threatened to put a damper on the 99th US
Open at the No. 2 course at Pinehurst, the sun broke through
briefly Thursday, and there was an interesting leaderboard after
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   After John Daly put aside memories of the six putts he took on
the 18th green in the first round of the Memorial, which prompted
his withdrawal, he threatened to take the lead. Then he hit a tee
shot so far left on 18 that it nearly ended up in Southern Pines or
Aberdeen. He did manage to gouge out a bogey 5, and only trails by
one stroke entering the second round.
</P>
<P>
   When Rocco Mediate suffered a double bogey on 18, when he had
the opportunity to take the lead, and the round was history, there
was a four-way tie at the top. Phil Mickelson, an expectant father
who will leave if wife Amy goes into labor with their first child,
heads the group at 3-under 67. He's joined there by David Duval,
who burned his right hand in a kitchen mishap, Billy Mayfair, and
Paul Goydos.
</P>
<P>
   The five lodged at 69 were Daly, Tiger Woods, who birded the
final two holes, last year's runner-up, Payne Stewart, David
Berganio of the Nike Tour, and Kaname Yokoo of Japan, who has
participated in 10 events on the Japanese Tour, six on the PGA
Tour, and is playing in his first US Open.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, 28, who has knocked on the door at the major
championships but has yet to win one, said his wife is due June 30.
Should his caddie's beeper go off, Mickelson will head home _ even
if he's in the lead. ``That's something I don't want to miss,'' he
said. ``The US Open takes place every year. If she punches in the
code, I'm getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   The round over the course designed by Donald Ross and modified
for the first US Open by Rees Jones included five birdies and
bogeys on the sixth and seventh. The birdies came on the second
(7-iron, 18 feet), fourth (pitching wedge, 8 feet), a chip-in on
the fifth (from 25 feet), the 13th (8-iron, 30 feet), and 14th
(9-iron, 8 feet), and he had to make a putt from 12 feet on the
18th to cling to the lead. This is a course he enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really excited heading in,'' Mickelson said. ``I'm
really excited about the setup of the golf course. I think it's the
best test of golf that I've ever played in a major championship. It
tests every area of your game. It tests every shot. Past Opens have
not really tested you off the tee as well with the driver. Every
player has an opportunity to hit any club he wants to off the tee,
and this year there's a lot of emphasis placed on the short game.
It's an integral part of this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who has won four times this year and is still ranked No.
1 on the world list, is in the same situation as Mickelson. He
hasn't won a major. He had three birdies in his bogey-free round.
He birdied the second (7-iron, 8 feet), the par-3 15th (5-iron, 2
feet), and par-3 17th (7-iron, 10 feet), and saved three pars. ``I
wasn't able to practice,'' he said, ``but at the same time there's
times when that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   The course everybody expected to be hard and fast after a dry
stretch has been softened by the rains. ``It makes the greens a lot
more receptive,'' said Duval. ``We're in a position where we're
having to hit anywhere from two to three clubs more into the
greens. I think it's going to get more difficult as the week
progresses. I was pretty pleased with all of my game today. I'd be
content to do it three more days.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair, who won twice last year in a comeback and beat Woods in
a playoff at Los Angeles, birdied the ninth (6-iron, 20 feet) and
10th (4-iron, 20 feet) to get to 3 under and then finished with
eight consecutive pars. ``It was raining pretty hard when we teed
off,'' he said. ``The golf course is actually the most susceptible
of birdies we'll see all week because of the wetness. I went out
today and did exactly what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Goydos has won just once, in 1996 at Bay Hill and actually
worked as a school teacher in Long Beach, Calif., where he won the
Long Beach Open in 1990. He saved pars on five holes to put him
into the thick of the hunt. ``I'm a firm believer that if you're
playing well, every course kind of sets up for you,'' said Goydos.
``If you're playing bad, none of them do.'' For the four tied for
the lead, nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina.

COMPAQ COMPUTER PREDICTS $237 MILLION SHORTFALL IN 2ND QUARTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first comment on its business prospects since dismissing
its chief executive, Eckhard Pfeiffer, two months ago, the Compaq
Computer Corp. said Thursday that it would lose as much as 15 cents
a share, or $237 million, in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin M. Rosen, the company's longtime chairman and acting
chief executive, also announced a sweeping reorganization meant to
save $2 billion a year. Last year, total expenses were $34 billion.
The company will lay off thousands of employees and take a charge
to earnings in the third quarter to cover the costs of the
restructuring, but it would not quantify either the layoffs or the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has been losing both money and market share in the face
of Dell Computer's more efficient and flexible method of selling
directly to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, which now gets 85 percent of its sales from local
dealers, wants to increase its direct sales to consumers to 25
percent of total sales by the end of this year. The company is
building 17 call centers to take orders over the telephone, and is
upgrading its Internet site to give customers more options in how
they buy computers directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce is starting to drive the computer business,''
Michael D. Capellas, the company's acting chief operating officer,
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Compaq was pinning much of its hopes for growth in
the future on developing small, specialized computers that
consumers would use mainly to surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company attributed its continued earnings problems to
bloated costs, competitive pricing for personal computers and slow
sales growth. It said it no longer faced losses from write-downs of
bloated inventory, a problem that had tripped the company up
several times over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen declined to predict how long the lean times would last.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major structural change for Compaq,'' he said. ``We
want to restore our historical profitability and growth, but we are
not prepared to make forecasts about when.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised the reorganization and cost-cutting moves but
said they would do little to address the company's long-term
problems, including the complexity of its acquisitions of the
Digital Equipment Corp. and Tandem Computers, both of which make
powerful computers for large companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq still has lots of problems at the high end, although
not everything is hunky dory in PC land either,'' said Steven
Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   In published forecasts, analysts had estimated that Compaq would
earn 20 cents a share in the second quarter, or $317 million,
according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors appeared to take the news in stride, perhaps
because Compaq's stock had taken such a beating in recent months.
The company's shares closed up 25 cents Thursday, at $22.50,
substantially off the 52-week high of $51.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be a miracle if they made money this
quarter,'' said Andrew J. Neff, an analyst with Bear Sterns. ``But
the issue is not what they are going to earn next quarter but
whether they can turn the company around.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq announced a streamlined organization structure, based on
three global product groups, that will handle product development,
sales and marketing. In the past, these functions were split among
a much more complex organization, which had some divisions focused
on products, others on geographic areas and yet others on
functional areas like marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each group will be focused on a single market, have clear
accountability and understanding of who its competition is,''
Capellas said.
</P>
<P>
   The company will merge its high-end computer division and its
division that provides services like custom programming and
installation help into a single enterprise solutions and services
group, headed by Enrico Pesatori. An expanded personal computer
division will continue to be run by Mike Winkler. The consumer
products group, the most successful part of the company now, will
continue to be run by Michael J. Larson.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pfeiffer was dismissed, seven of 15 top executives have
left.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most important management change was not announced
Thursday. Rosen said the search for a new chief executive ``is well
along'' but he declined to say when the appointment would be
announced.

 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1994, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., faced the
toughest vote in his long congressional career: whether to ban
assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A proud board member of the National Rifle Association at the
time, Dingell hated the measure. But President Clinton was urging
him to support it and his party leaders were demanding loyalty. So
Dingell, an avid hunter who adorns his Capitol Hill office with the
stuffed heads of wild boar and other game he has bagged, quit the
NRA board and voted yes, infuriating friends and even one of his
sons. He has regretted it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Months after the assault weapons ban passed, the Republicans
swept into control of Congress, stripping Dingell of his powerful
position as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. He was
convinced that a major factor was his party's fervent support for
tough gun control.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Dingell has championed a measure that has
angered gun-control advocates, confounded his party leaders, given
heart to conservative Democrats squeamish about gun restrictions,
and won support from Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip and
a fierce opponent of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell's amendment, which the House was scheduled to debate
Thursday night, is a weaker alternative to a bill supported by the
House Democratic leadership that requires criminal background
checks of gun buyers at gun shows. Dingell's amendment, which has
been endorsed by the NRA, would require the checks in 24 hours, as
opposed to three days in the Democrats' bill, or let the sale
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   To the many advocates of gun control in his party, Dingell's
bill undercut the Democrats' efforts to portray Republicans as
unreasonable opponents of reasonable gun restrictions, trapped in
the pocket of the NRA. Moreover, Dingell's amendment may have
demonstrated that the Democrats are far from united on gun control,
and that the issue may not be as potent in the 2000 elections as
many Democrats had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``His bill hurts our message,'' said Rep. Louise Slaughter, a
Democrat from Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But in Dingell's mind, he has been acting like a loyal Democrat,
trying to save his party from itself, and from a replay of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows if Democrats don't do the right thing, they are not
going to retake the House in 2000,'' said his wife, Deborah,
president of General Motors Foundation, whose advocacy of gun
control puts her in conflict with her husband's views. ``He
absolutely believes he is helping the party.''
</P>
<P>
   A barrel-chested, gruff-voiced 72-year-old whose 44 years in the
House makes him its longest-serving member, Dingell scoffs at the
suggestion that he has hurt his party, saying he has simply given
voice to the desires of his blue-collar district, which runs from
Dearborn south along Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people love the out of doors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility that some felons might be more
easily able to buy guns at gun shows under his bill, Dingell leaned
his 6-foot frame into a questioner and wrapped his mittlike hands
around his shoulder. ``When do you think you will get a perfect
world?'' he asked with a wry smile. ``I'm just trying here to get a
better bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats assert that Dingell used the possibility of a
Democratic victory in 2000 to cajole his party mates to vote for
his bill. If the Democrats retake the House, Dingell would regain
his chairmanship of the powerful Commerce Committee, which controls
legislation on a wide range of matters, from telecommunications to
energy to defense contracting. As chairman in the 1980s, Dingell
was widely known as a procedural genius, a zealous investigator of
government waste, and a bit of a bully.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very powerful man,'' said Rep. Carolyn McCarthy,
D-N.Y., who is author of the other Democratic gun show bill. ``A
lot of things go through his committee. And he might be chairman
again.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Dingell replied, his voice dripping with innocence,
``Why should anyone be afraid of me?''
</P>
<P>
   Dingell, a former county prosecutor, was first elected to
Congress in 1955 to replace his father, who had held the seat for
23 years. He describes himself as an ``old-fashioned, New Deal
Democrat,'' but his record has been hard to categorize.
</P>
<P>
   With Ford Motor Co. in his district, he has frequently fought
environmentalists over air pollution regulations. But he was also a
major proponent of the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act.
While he has battled his party on gun control, he has carried its
banner on health care reform, currently pushing bills intended to
protect managed care consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And while he likes hunting, fishing and other traditionally
masculine sports, he is also an avid fan of the ballet and opera,
who raised his four children after divorcing his first wife.
</P>
<P>
   As an NRA board member in the 1970s, Dingell helped create the
rifle association's Institute for Legislative Affairs, which has
evolved into one of the most powerful lobbying and political action
committees in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He is also famous for calling Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms agents ``a jackbooted group of fascists'' in a 1981 NRA
promotional film. He says he has no regrets about coining the
phrase, saying, ``If it's true, what is wrong with it?''
</P>
<P>
   Dingell says he is planning on running for re-election next
year. And he says he fully expects his party to retake the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be working for it,'' he said.

ARREST OF 13 IRANIAN JEWS AS SPIES DIVIDES FACTIONS IN TEHERAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ The arrest of 13 Iranian Jews on charges of
spying for the United States and Israel has emerged as a new focal
point in the struggle between moderates and conservatives in
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said by telephone from the Iranian capital Thursday
that they suspected that the case was being used to try to block
better relations between Iran and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian Jews, who are from the southern cities of Shiraz and
Isfahan, may be executed if convicted, Iranian officials say, but
the leader of Iran's Jews is demanding that they receive a fair
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Manouchehr Elias, the leader of Iran's 27,000-member Jewish
community, has said that the suspects should be punished if guilty,
but that ``if the opposite is true, they should be released
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no indication as to how the suspects have
responded to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi, the head of Iran's judicial system,
struck a hard line in a prayer sermon last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish spies for Israel will be tried for treason
according to Islamic law and they may be sentenced to death _ not
once but several times,'' Yazdi said. A crowd of thousands shouted
for ``the traitors'' to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has denounced the arrests as ``unacceptable''
and has called for the immediate release of the suspects, who were
arrested in February and March and who include rabbis, religious
teachers and community activists.
</P>
<P>
   But Jomhuri Islami, a newspaper opposed to President Mohammad
Khatami, a relative moderate, has served notice that conservatives
intend to draw a hard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington's support of the spies shows that the United States
is still the enemy of the Iranian people, and this should be a
lesson for all those in Iran who support a normalization of
relations with the United States,'' the newspaper said in a recent
editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, who has been trying to improve Iran's relations with
the West, has not commented publicly about the arrests, which took
place in March but were not disclosed by Iranian officials until
this month. But he has not tried hard to disguise a sense of
exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are using almost any method to ruin the plans of
the government,'' Khatami said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election two years ago, Khatami has been battling
constantly with the conservatives who still hold the main levers of
power. He has seen allies jailed, supportive newspapers shuttered
and top aides impeached, but the popular appeal behind his victory
seems only to have increased, as was evident in the triumph that
his supporters scored in municipal elections this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the conservatives, the dominant political force in Iran
since the 1979 revolution, have not backed away. Their harsh
reaction to criticism over the arrest of the Jews suggests a belief
that they see the issue as a way to reinforce popular suspicions
over links to the West.
</P>
<P>
   That hard line has been reinforced by Iran's mission to the
United Nations, which said in a statement last week that those
arrested had come from a ``Zionist'' spy network in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has condemned the arrests in harsh terms, and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson has said he has been in touch with the Iranian
authorities in the hope of visiting Tehran, apparently in the hope
of brokering a prisoner release.
</P>
<P>
   Israel maintained warm relations with Iran before the 1979
Islamic revolution.

SPORTS COLUMN: ROBINSON AND SPURS ARE ON TOP OF WORLD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Imagine what it's like to be 7 feet 1 inch and
looking down on the world from the highest of professional and
personal posts. What a perspective to have gained on basketball,
and life.
</P>
<P>
   What a blessing for a religious man to have reached the point of
contentment, of being exactly where he wishes to be. David Robinson
is in the city he considers home, in a position where he can help
those less fortunate, and at the high post in the San Antonio
Spurs' offense, from where he can take his man off the dribble and
hit the jumper and assist his teammates cutting to the rim. From
where he can see the big picture and appreciate the brilliance of
another young man who has relieved him of a role that was cutting
him down and wearing him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's talent is a little more obvious than mine,'' said
Robinson, a judicious man in a fortuitous place.
</P>
<P>
   In his 10th year as a pro basketball player, during the first
post-Michael Jordan season, Robinson has had the best view in
America, watching Tim Duncan suddenly become the most dominant
player in the game, claiming the very space in the lane that
Robinson once owned. Watching Duncan's eye-opening variety of
low-post moves and knowing only a fool could have resisted the ride
that has brought him to within three victories of his primary
vocational dream. Watching, yet understanding that he has become
more of a teammate, no less a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, you think you can get it all done by yourself, but
then you realize you can't,'' Robinson said Thursday after the
Spurs prepared for Game 2 of the NBA finals, for an ornery albeit
battered bunch of Knicks who are trailing in this season's playoffs
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   From the high post in Game 1 Wednesday night, Robinson generated
seven assists - four more than any Knick. He could clearly see how
all the disappointments of his early pro years and all the back
pain of the more recent ones could soon culminate in the first
championship for team and town. Robinson high. Duncan low. This is
the blueprint, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, there is so much basketball left to be played,'' Robinson
said, cheerfully rejecting the notion of the Spurs in control, as
if it were a Charlie Ward layup, floating like a beach ball toward
the rim.
</P>
<P>
   This was just another prime vantage point, part of that
expansive view from the high post. Don't count out the Knicks, and
while we're at it, stop making too much of his so-called sacrifices
to accommodate the new kid on the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how you look at it,'' Robinson said, ``you have to
use Tim's abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Parish stepped outside years ago in Boston to accommodate
Kevin McHale. Ralph Sampson realized he was better suited to facing
the basket the minute Hakeem Olajuwon touched down in Houston.
Robinson knows he was never the classic post-up player. The story
here is less about setting examples for the more selfishly inclined
and more about not kicking a gift horse in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   So many of these opportunities are serendipity, a chain of
events no one foresees. When Robinson missed most of the season two
years ago with an ailing back and a broken foot, his career seemed
on the way down and the Spurs on their way out. Even as the finals
go on, there are reports of the team's ownership in talks with
officials from Baltimore and Anaheim, Calif., about relocating from
a small television market and an unfashionable dome built by a
previous owner for a football team the city never got.
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association could do worse than to
financially assist in the building of a new arena, following the
National Football League's lead in the New England case. It would
be a shame for pro basketball to lose this charming and boisterous
outpost, rich in history and fan support. It would be a blow to
Robinson, who set up shop in south Texas with the idea of leaving
more than statistical records behind.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Valerie, started the David Robinson Foundation
seven years ago, administering to a variety of programs benefiting
students, babies, the homeless and the hungry. Two years ago, the
Robinsons gave $5 million to the expansion of a local cultural
center. He has always maintained that he never wanted to play for
another team, in another town.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do well, they're going to find a way to keep us here,''
he said. ``I can't see us playing anyplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   From the high post, three victories from the title, Robinson's
eyes are fixed on the prize. &QL;

PERSERVERENCE PAYS FOR JOHN DALY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ He was in the woods. But that's the story of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   He could have played it safe, but that's not the story of his
life. So John Daly did what he always does. He gripped, he ripped,
he took on trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And somehow, someway, he perservered. He shot 2-under 68
Thursday in the first round of the US Open at Pinehurst No. 2. How,
he was asked, was that possible? Hadn't he just fallen to the
depths of despair once again, a six-putt debacle from 8 feet at the
Memorial? How had he come back this time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to it, I guess,'' said Daly. ``It's been
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't talking about the drive at No. 4 that went left into
the woods, or the drive on No. 10 that sprayed right into the
woods. He wasn't even talking about the drive at 18 that was
shanked right, hit a tree, and ended up a mere 80-90 yards from the
tee, in the woods, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Those are merely bad golf shots and aren't even on the radar
screen when it comes to what Daly has to deal with. He is a
recovering alcoholic. That was Thursday's battle. It will be
today's battle. Tomorrow's battle, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I'm playing good, it's hard ... the cravings are
there. You can't imagine what I'm going through when I'm playing
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The play of late has been worse than bad. He scored a 10 on that
18th hole at Memorial, shot 82, and withdrew from a tournament for
the third time this year. He has also missed five cuts. Playing in
his eighth straight tournament, there was no reason to expect
anything from Daly.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew. I'm about as much in shock as everybody else is
right now. I didn't have any confidence or any expectations coming
in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, it was suggested to Daly, he feels confident on this
course, having finished third here in the Tour Championship in
1991. Not possible, he said. ``I think I played so drunk here in
'91 I don't even remember the holes. I honestly don't. They told me
I finished 1-under.''
</P>
<P>
   So honest, so sadly honest, Daly conceded, but it is such a huge
part of his life, which has been an open book ever since that
magical weekend in 1991 when he burst upon the scene at the PGA
Championship. He ate Crooked Stick and washed it down with booze.
Then he quit drinking, won the British Open in 1995, and started
drinking again. It got so bad he wanted to kill himself during a
hotel rampage at The Players Championship in 1997, a scene so ugly
that those who know the details don't like to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Daly couldn't play in the '97 Masters, then had to withdraw from
the US Open at Congressional, battling shakes that were
uncontrollable. Tiger Woods or no Tiger Woods, he remained No. 1
with galleries, though at times they could only look on helplessly.
Like the time the shakes came again, and Daly began to cry,
consoled by Corey Pavin.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the roars started early as Daly opened birdie-birdie.
Then he nearly drove the 335-yard par 4 third and went to 3-under.
When he registered his fourth straight one-putt, this to save a par
5 at the fourth, his name was atop the leaderboard and he had it
going. Right? Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in total shock,'' said Daly. ``It was weird. I just kept
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 610-yard 10th hole, moments after a triple-breaking
birdie putt at the ninth, Daly flew his drive into the woods. He
was on hard sand, 269 yards from the pin and the gallery moved
slightly, assuming a pitch-out was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Move back further, they were told. Back more. Back even more.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the third request that they realized that the man in
the woods was John Daly and John Daly meets trouble head on. He was
going for the green, some 269 yards in the distance. ``Cut a 3-wood
out of there,'' he said. But he didn't quite catch it flush, so it
only reached the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The crowd loved it. And though he kept looking
straight ahead, through a pair of sunglasses with orange lenses
(``I was in so many bunkers at Augusta, my eyes were squinting so
bad''), and puffing on a cigarette, Daly heard the support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the greatest feeling in the world. Fans have stuck
with me through think and thin, and it was so nice to give them a
good round today. I haven't figured out why they do it, but I sure
love it and I love them for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he finished with a bogey to fall out of a share of the
lead, Daly had put up the round of the day. So how to celebrate?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go eat about six cheeseburgers at McDonald's,
probably have a bag of Oreos and a big thing of milk, then watch
Sports Center and hopefully see myself on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   He will like what he sees.

NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA WATCH EACH OTHER IN YELLOW SEA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Ships from North and South Korea circled
cautiously Thursday in the Yellow Sea, where the two sides recently
skirmished, but American ships were streaming toward the area in a
display of force.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean government officials seem to be playing down the
effects of the gun battle, in which they sank a North Korean
torpedo boat and killed a number of North Koreans on board. At
least 20 North Koreans may have died in the firefight, which took
place early Tuesday morning after the two sides had been taunting
each other for days in disputed waters in the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now, it seems as though it has subsided,'' said Kim
Hyon-du, a spokesman for the South Korean Ministry of Unification.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, North Korea suspended visits by South Koreans to
Pyongyang, endangering two-way talks that are scheduled for Monday
in Beijing. They would be the first official negotiations in 14
months, and South Korea is worried now that North Korea may not
show up.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions are still running high. When asked at a news conference
Thursday whether the firefight threatened the talks, Brig. Gen. Cha
Young-koo, a spokesman for South Korea's defense ministry, said:
``Even husbands and wives get closer after they fight.'' Cha was
fired later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not put any of its troops in the region on
alert. But it is moving military ships and aircraft in a show of
force. The Aegis-class cruiser Vincennes was headed this way
Thursday, and the guided-missile destroyer Mobile Bay was moving
toward the region as well.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was also sending out four Navy reconnaissance
aircraft, the EA-6 electronic warfare aircraft, from Whidbey Island
in Washington, and those aircraft will go to Japan, American
military officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two nuclear-powered submarines, the Kamehameha and the Buffalo,
were also at a Korean naval base for training as part of a routine
port call, according to reports by the Associated Press, the Korean
state-owned Yonhap News Agency and the Korea Broadcasting System.
American and South Korean officials did not deny the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Yonhap also reported that nuclear submarines often come to South
Korea for training and that these two would also be leaving soon.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not had an aircraft carrier in the region
since the Kitty Hawk was sent to the Persian Gulf. But it has had
18 F-15 aircraft here for a month, as well as AC-130 gunships for
two months. Moreover, the nuclear aircraft carrier Constellation is
expected to head to the region from San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation between the North and the South began 10 days
ago, when North Korean naval vessels escorted fishing boats south
of the ``northern limit line,'' the customary line of demarcation
separating the seas of the two Koreas. The North does not recognize
the line, and has often sent ships south of it, but they normally
retreat when ordered back by South Korean patrol boats.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the North Korean vessels refused to back off,
and on Friday, South Korean vessels began to ram the North Korean
boats.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the standoff exploded in gunfire. South Korean
patrol boats sank a North Korean torpedo ship and damaged at least
five other North Korean vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Two South Korean patrol boats were damaged and seven South
Korean sailors were slightly wounded. South Korea has put its
entire armed forces on a combat level of alert, which is a state of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials will not officially comment on the
suspension of visits to Pyongyang. But such restrictions are not
likely to have a large effect on travel to the North, for only a
handful of South Koreans typically travel to Pyongyang. Other areas
do not seem to be affected by the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the firefight took place, there were 1,970 South
Koreans in the North, and most of them were in the tourist area of
Mount Kumgang.

 &HT;    Anderson: `I don't want to be traded _ I'm a Falcon'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few days ago, Falcons running back Jamal Anderson
decided he would skip the start of the team's attendance-optional
passing camp. Anderson's agent, Jim Sims, said the All-Pro back was
staying home in Salt Lake City ``unless we have some sort of show
of good faith'' from the team on contract extension talks. Sims
even said he might ask the Falcons to trade Anderson. Anderson, 26,
planned to keep quiet, but he places a premium on the way he is
perceived in public. So he called AJC writer Matt Winkeljohn.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: So, what's going on with the contract situation?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: I'm not holding out of anything. This passing camp is
not a mandatory thing. I've always missed days. (Quarterback) Chris
(Chandler) won't be there every day. One thing I'm not is selfish.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Your agent said you need a ``show of good faith'' in order
to show up. Considering the Falcons started these talks in November
and there is an offer on the table for a five-year contract worth
about $26 million, what's that mean? That money is enough to be
considered one of the five highest-paid backs.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: I'm just trying to get market value. There's a lot we
need to establish. Am I top five? Top three? You also have to take
into account how important a team considers a running back to its
scheme. There are reports I've turned down $5.2 million per year.
That's hogwash. I haven't turned down anything. ... We could just
as easily say the Falcons have turned down some of our
(counterproposals). These are negotiations; this is how
negotiations go. The big sticking point is the signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: The Falcons likely are offering a bonus of around $6
million. Your agent said the recent signing bonus of $8.84 million
given by the Saints to No. 5 draft choice Ricky Williams is a
starting point. True?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: I've given (five) years of service to the Falcons, and
all the bonus I've ever gotten is the $23,000 when I signed (as a
seventh-rounder in 1994). We did not create the market. I would be
ruining the market if I came in lower than (Williams). No matter
what we project (for him), he hasn't carried the ball yet. And
Edgerrin James (the No. 4 pick of the Colts) is going to get $9
million. Really, the signing bonuses the top rookies have
perpetuated (create) a bigger need for veteran signing bonuses to
increase.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Williams got the big money up front but has very low
salaries and needs to reach lofty incentives to earn sizable
salaries. If the Falcons were willing to increase the signing bonus
substantially, would you consider more of a play-for-pay contract?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: The numbers would have to be tremendous up front. I'm
not stupid. Let's be real. I play running back. How long can I
play?
</P>
<P>
   AJC: What about your image, considering all this is happening
while you are still under contract?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: I have never said a word. If I was selfish, last year
I would have gone, `OK, guys, (to) hell with the NFC championship;
the Falcons need to re-sign me.' Check around the nation, and I
don't have a bad relationship with any writers except one. This is
like two guys who do the exact same job for IBM and Microsoft. Say
they're just as good as each other, but the guy at IBM is making
$30,000 a year and the guy at Microsoft is making $75,000. The guy
at IBM, wouldn't he try and go get more money?
</P>
<P>
   AJC: But what good is it to have your agent talking about lack
of good faith and pushing for a trade?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: I don't want to be traded. I'm a Falcon. That's just
part of all this. You know how this goes; it's like a game. My
agent is inflaming things. He's doing a good job, but I think for
myself.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Is your absence doing any good?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: I don't think this helps or hurts (negotiations). I
know the system like the back of my hand. I haven't ruled out
coming. This just happens to be where my mind is at right now.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Will you come to the mandatory portion of passing camp,
July 7-9? And what about training camp July 29?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: I don't know what I'll do when it's mandatory. Every
day, I'm in a different mood. I know I miss my teammates. I talk to
(center Robbie) Tobeck, (defensive tackle) Travis (Hall) almost
every day. I've talked to (linebacker Keith) Brooking, (defensive
end) Chuck (Smith), (defensive tackle Ben) Huff, (offensive tackle)
Bob (Whitfield).
</P>
<P>
   AJC: What about coach Dan Reeves? He tried to call you earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: I haven't hooked up with Dan. I saw his funny comments
about my Web site and e-mail. Maybe I'll send him an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Do you trust in Dan?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: This is not that serious; I want everybody to see
that. I live here ... and people think I'm absolutely in love with
Salt Lake City. That's just not true. I love Atlanta, but I've
never felt stability there. And my (18-month-old) daughter is here.
In '95, I had to sign the minimum tender the Falcons offered, and
then in October of '96 they signed me to an extension that
increased my salary but had no bonus. ...In '97, going into the
last game (at Arizona), Dan said he was going to try to get (rookie
running back) Byron (Hanspard) more into the rotation to see if he
could carry the load. What's that say to me? It says I'm
expendable. That was a rocky year. I began to prepare myself for (a
possible departure). Dan and I went back and forth about carries,
rotation and so forth. If I sign a contract extension now, it will
be the first time I really felt like I was on solid ground. Then,
I'll move (to Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   AJC: So, you're on shaky ground with Reeves? You ran for 152
yards that day against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: Yeah, I was killing the Cardinals in the first
quarter, and to Dan's credit, he kept giving me the ball, and I was
able to get 1,000 yards for the season. I love playing for Dan. He
played the game and coaches it the way it's supposed to be played.
I've got jerseys from some of the guys, and a picture of Dan I'm
going to put on my wall, a Falcons Hall of Fame. I've got no
problem at all with Dan.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: So why aren't you working out in Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson: The thing is, this is going to happen. This is just
the way these things go. Tomorrow, I'll wake up with a smile on my
face. It'll get done. I'm a Falcon, and I want to stay a Falcon.

SOUTH AFRICAN NAMES CABINET: FAMILIAR FACES IN NEW POSTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ South Africa's new pesident, Thabo
Mbeki, Thursday named Jacob Zuma his deputy. The announcement ended
speculation that Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the fiery leader of the Zulu
Inkatha Freedom Party, would get the post in a move intended to
strengthen peace between him and the African National Congress.
Buthelezi remains the home affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
   Zuma, the deputy leader of the African National Congress and a
close ally of Mbeki, is considered to have been a key player in
making inroads into the Zulu party's traditional base of support
base.
</P>
<P>
   In naming his Cabinet, Mbeki kept key economic ministers in
place, including Trevor Manuel as finance minister and Alex Erwin
as trade and industry minister, decisions that were widely
applauded by the business community.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his Cabinet members served in President Nelson Mandela's
Cabinet, although many will have new posts. Mbeki said he was ``not
visualizing any major changes in policy.'' He also noted that the
number of women had doubled, to eight, out of 29 posts.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole Mbeki's choices were applauded for rewarding
competence and maintaining stability. ``The positive thing here is
the continuity,'' said Sean Jacobs, a political analyst with the
Institute for Democracy in South Africa. ``And he did get rid of a
lot of dead wood.''
</P>
<P>
   A new post, special minister in the president's office, went to
Essop Pahad, a friend from Mbeki's days as a student exile in
England.
</P>
<P>
   Pahad's appointment was in line with Mbeki's desire to
strengthen the presidency. In the last few weeks, he has announced
that he would absorb the deputy president's staff into his own
office and assume the power to appoint the top administrators in
the ministries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Mandela was obliged to cobble together a multi-party
government. But Mbeki, with a firm majority, can do as he chooses.
Nevertheless, he has kept three Inkatha members in his government:
Buthelezi and two deputy ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki at least twice brushed off questions about whether he had
offered the deputy's job to Buthelezi. Buthelezi told the South
African Press Association Thursday that he had never wanted the
job, but earlier this week he said he had rejected an offer.
</P>
<P>
   One big surprise was the switch of assignment for Dr. Nkosazana
Zuma, who is to become minister of foreign affairs. Dr. Zuma, who
is divorced from Zuma, is considered one of Mbeki's favorites
though she has been a controversial health minister, taking on the
tobacco and pharmaceutical industries and angering AIDS activists
by refusing to finance the drug AZT for pregnant mothers infected
with the virus that causes the disease.

   VERMITCA, Kosovo _ Aid workers put up two big signs with red
skulls at the border here Thursday, and they are thinking about
showing a videotape of a cow exploding in a mine field. But
nothing, it seems, can dam the flow of Kosovo refugees: Ignoring
all dangers, more than 13,000 refugees on Thursday squeezed through
the crowded crossing point here on the way, finally, home.
</P>
<P>
   In just three days, 46,000 refugees have left Albania, to go to
their burned-out villages, where there is little food and a real
danger from mines, booby traps and unexploded bombs. That is a 10th
of the 450,000 Kosovo refugees in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed definitely caught us all by surprise,'' said Rupert
Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``By jumping the gun they are making it more
difficult for themselves, more difficult for the people inside
Kosovo and, worst of all, putting themselves at great risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, you can understand why they are doing it,''
Colville added.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest example of the risks, an Albanian boy died on
Wednesday after plugging in a booby-trapped videotape player he
stole from a Serbian family that fled, NATO officials in Prizren
said Thursday. The machine was rigged with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   But the pull toward home is strong _ so strong, in fact, that no
one in the Maharremi family seemed at all nervous being driven back
over the border Thursday by Liridon, their 12-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I die, at least I will die there!'' barked Liridon from
behind the steering wheel, which reached the height of his
determined eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   The number of refugees crossing Thursday was lower than on
Wednesday, when 18,000 refugees went back to Kosovo, Colville said.
The number would have been higher, except that military officials
effectively closed the border around 6 p.m. to let traffic flow
into Albania from Kosovo. Starting Friday, the way into Kosovo will
be open from the early morning to the evening; at night, the road
will be open to traffic into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two days, the number of returning refugees has
created huge traffic jams on the road from here to the city of
Prizren, 15 miles away; one bottleneck at the town of Zhur is
caused by an enormous crater from a NATO bomb, maybe 15 feet deep,
that narrows the road.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic is also worsened by the number of Kosovo men who
left Albania over the last few days and are now returning to pick
up their families after looking over their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the house and it's all burned out,'' Rrustem Kicaj, a
50-year-old farmer from Grejkovce, said as he rode back into Kosovo
with his family. ``But I found my cows. I want to guard my house
and take care of the cows.''
</P>
<P>
   Colville said aid officials are trying whatever they can to
persuade refugees not to go home until NATO and other groups can
make Kosovo minimally habitable. A television crew filmed a cow as
it stepped on a land mine, and Colville said his agency is
considering showing the footage to refugees in the camps to deter
them from leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from explosives, some officials are also worried about the
amount of food inside Kosovo. In Prizren, where nearly all the
refugees flow through on their way north, basic food supplies
disappear from shelves and shops by afternoon. Thursday morning,
Kosovars who had never left lined up downtown for food being
distributed by relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some food but we don't have any way to buy it,'' said
Nakie Morina, 28, who waited in line for an hour and a half for
food for her and her two children. But the food ran out before she
reached the front of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Di Lellio, a spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program,
said the flow of food into Kosovo has been slow, in part because of
the traffic out of Albania. But she said the agency is still
getting 7,000 loaves of bread into Kosovo every day, along with
canned meat and fish, wheat flour and rice.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, the program is handing out huge rations
to refugees leaving Albania, including 110 pounds of wheat flour,
which she said will effectively bring large amounts of food into
Kosovo along with the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such an enormous influx of food,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But many refugees interviewed said they had not seen the relief
food and were traveling with very little. Rrustem, for example,
said he only had two loaves of bread for seven members of his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Hysen Sertoli, a 52-year-old construction worker, said he would
go to Kosovo ``with food or without food, no matter what happens.''
Traveling on a tractor with a sign praising NATO wedged between two
mattresses, he said he had been living in an apartment building in
Kukes, Albania, with 1,200 other refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Kosovars left,'' he said. ``So I left.''

   LOME, Togo _ Meet the aging fighter from the bush in his
five-star hotel suite, the sitting room table covered with
proposals to end the endless war and spare his life.
</P>
<P>
   At work and at play, here in l'Hotel 2 Fevrier, was this
near-mythical warrior from the thick bush of Sierra Leone, Foday
Sankoh, who had so seldom ventured out of his jungle stronghold
that his very existence was once in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, 63, the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, was
inclined to be satisfied: a peace agreement for his country was at
hand, a pardon for himself.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was the delicate matter of atrocities. After
describing themselves for years as freedom fighters, the rebels in
his organization had committed some of Africa's worst atrocities in
the last two years, hacking off the hands, arms or legs of
countless ordinary Sierra Leoneans in a highly effective campaign
of terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not denying that,'' Sankoh said of the atrocities, ``but
not on such a scale.'' Given the crushing evidence against his
organization, his words should not be surprising. But it was the
first time that the subject of amputations and mutilations was not
met by flat denials by Sankoh or his commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the survivor, Sankoh _ who has been imprisoned by Sierra
Leone's government and its allies since 1997 _ seemed at times to
distance himself from his group's actions in the last two years,
even as he insisted that he was its only leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with them,'' he said, ``they don't use to commit
such atrocities. Even I am not saying they are not committing
atrocities, but why should the RUF commit such atrocities by
amputating people, the people we've come to free? We are freedom
fighters, and the people are feeding us. Their children are
fighting this war.''
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's representatives and officials of the government have
been meeting for the last few weeks in this quiet seaside capital
to try to end a fierce eight-year-old civil war that has left
Sierra Leone a country in name alone.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have gone slowly but well, people involved in the
negotiations say. Both sides are now down to discussing the rebels'
role in a transitional government and the future role of a
Nigerian-led peacekeeping force known as Ecomog.
</P>
<P>
   But reducing the chance of an enduring peace are two unresolved
points: the legacy of the atrocities committed by the Revolutionary
United Front and Sankoh's role in a transitional government. The
negotiators have chosen in many ways not to tackle these issues,
one government representative said, ``because we want to have
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having two evils,'' the representative said of the
choices between pursuing the war or negotiating with Sankoh. ``We
can only choose the lesser one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh does not see it that way. Once a corporal in Sierra
Leone's army, as well as a commercial photographer, with a primary
school education, he believes he has been fighting to free Sierra
Leoneans since he took up arms in 1991. With vague talk of wanting
to destroy the ``rotten system'' that had left most people in his
diamond-rich country poor, Sankoh waged a war from the jungle and
preached agrarian values.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the bush there, we started our ideology, grass-roots
development,'' Sankoh said. ``We worked very hard. I tilled the
soil. I had my farm, my swamp, my poultry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That motivated me, and poverty, and corruption, tribalism,
nepotism, etc., etc., and the vices of capitalism,'' he added,
reducing his voice to a whisper and crunching his nose. ``The vices
of injustice, what you call injustice, you know, all these things.
So that is why I took up arms.''
</P>
<P>
   After five years of fighting, Sankoh signed a peace treaty in
1996 with the newly elected president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. But the
agreement began unraveling after Sankoh was arrested in Nigeria in
1997 on charges of trafficking arms, allegations that he denied.
Eventually, soldiers backed by Sankoh's rebels toppled Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of atrocities began emerging in 1998 after the Ecomog
forces restored Kabbah to power in March. Throughout the country,
civilians with chopped off arms and legs said Sankoh's rebels had
mutilated them, instead of simply killing them, so that they would
serve as living symbols of terror.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign worked, as the rebels recruited more and more young
men and boys to join their movement, often by forcing them to
commit atrocities and drugging them, survivors and international
aid organizations said.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-year civil war _ whose number of deaths, estimated at
14,000, is low in comparison with other wars in this decade _
marked a new, brutish turn in warfare on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   After Sankoh was convicted of treason last October and sentenced
to death, the rebels stepped up their attacks and mounted an
assault in December on the capital, Freetown. The rebels nearly
seized Freetown in January, and in their retreat, they killed and
maimed thousands. At the time, despite survivors' own accounts that
the rebels had mutilated them, Sankoh's group denied all
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting continued until last month when a cease-fire for
the current talks went into effect. Since then, Sankoh has been the
star guest in this city, a smallish, soft-spoken man with a graying
beard, sighted frequently in his hotel on the 36th-floor
restaurant, where the other night he shared a booth with his
secretary, Josephine, touching her head with his and holding her
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were in Europe, Foday Sankoh would have been tried a
long time ago as a war criminal,'' the government negotiator said,
not with anger but with a resignation that made him slump,
burnt-out cigarette between his fingers, on the edge of his hotel
bed at 9 a.m. ``But it's Africa; it's a small country. That is
basically what it is.''

   ATLANTA _ Once a team makes it to the Super Bowl, as the Falcons
did last season, times get tougher for the team's bookkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Teams win big because players have big years, and then the
players ask for big compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams, Arizona and Baltimore, have more money under the
2000 salary cap than the Falcons' $23 million, but Atlanta general
manager Harold Richardson isn't dancing about those numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen projected starters have contracts that expire this
season, including 10 unrestricted free agents _ center Robbie
Tobeck, guard Gene Williams, receiver Terance Mathis, running back
Jamal Anderson, fullback Bob Christian, linebacker Jessie Tuggle,
defensive ends Chuck Smith and Lester Archambeau, defensive tackle
Shane Dronett and safety Eugene Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, I'd like to keep all of them, and is it possible?
Yes,'' said Richardson, who began managing salary caps when he was
administrative assistant to Broncos coach Wade Phillips in 1993.
``But herein lies the rub: All 10 of them aren't going to get what
they consider the giant contract. ...We can't pay them all the
market value.'' The Falcons have about $1.5 million under this
year's cap, enough to sign their rookies and have about $400,000
left. But it won't be enough to consider extending most of the
potential unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions are Tuggle, who will count more against the cap
than any of the Falcons at $3.85 million; Anderson, who is second
at $3.6 million; and perhaps Smith, at $2.8 million. Their numbers
are high enough that new contracts would drop their charges against
this year's cap.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is trying to get Anderson's contract extended, which
would create more than $1 million in additional cap room. That
could create room to maneuver with some of the lower-paid
unrestricted free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Despite complaints from players that the Falcons have been slow
to begin contract talks, Richardson vows to get busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never finished a season with that many (potential free
agents),'' he said, ``and I don't anticipate finishing this season
with that many.

 &HT;    New York's Sprewell plans to stay on attack
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ He played 46 minutes, took 24 shots, and yet the
Knicks' Latrell Sprewell did not get to the foul line once in Game
1 of the NBA Finals. That must change in tonight's Game 2 at the
Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was attacking, but their big guys made a difference,''
Sprewell said. ``You know their big guys are there. Their presence
definitely effected some shots. But that's not going to stop me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel I'm going to get to the basket. It's important to
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in Wednesday's game, whenever Sprewell got past the initial
defender, he was cut off by Tim Duncan or David Robinson before he
could elevate toward the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to keep attacking,'' Sprewell said. ``When
they block my shot, it just motivates me more to go back in there.
'You got me this time, but I'm coming back to get you.' But I've
got to go more aggressively. I think I need to go for the dunk at
times instead of layups. Take it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sprewell denied statements attributed to him in
``Sports Illustrated'' that he would not play for coach Jeff Van
Gundy next year and that he wanted to play in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say it,'' Sprewell said. ``And at this point in time,
it's all about winning a championship. My future is here. Anything
that could happen in the summer is so far from where my mind is.
I'm totally focused on the Knicks. I'm happy with the Knicks. I
want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston calling
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino took the Boston Celtics coaching job two years ago
because he believed the Celtics would get the first pick in the NBA
lottery and, therefore, the rights to Duncan. But San Antonio ended
up winning the pick and Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not stop Pitino from seeking the top choice via
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five minutes after the lottery,'' San Antonio coach and
general manager Gregg Popovich said, ``Rick Pitino called. He said,
'What to you want (for the No. 1 pick)? Whatever it is, you've got
it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, 'I can't imagine doing anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Duncan's a Spur and widely considered the best player in
the NBA. The Celtics? They were in the lottery again this year.
Game 2 blues
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have tied an NBA record with 11 consecutive playoff
wins. But Game 2s have not been the best for San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' only postseason loss this season came against
Minnesota in Game 2 of the first round. And in Game 2 of each of
the next two rounds, the Spurs needed key baskets, by Duncan
against the Lakers and a Sean Elliott last-second 3-pointer against
Portland, to pull out victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we have problems with Game 2,'' Popovich
said. ``Maybe because there's so much emphasis put on Game 1 that
there's a letdown. But the only way to guard against it is to be
aware of it. We have to come out strong, like our backs are against
the wall.

AIR WARS WON'T ALL BE RISK-FREE, U.S. GENERAL SAYS

 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The American general who ran the NATO air war over
Kosovo warned Thursday that it would be a mistake to think that
just because the allies lost no lives in this one that future wars
fought from the air would be risk-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid some people will draw lessons from this conflict,
and the shorter conflict in Bosnia in 1994 and 1995, and conclude
that you can conduct an air war without losses,'' Lt. Gen. Michael
C. Short said in a telephone interview from the allied air
operations center in Vicenza, Italy, where he ran the 78-day
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little stomach for young infantrymen and other
soldiers coming home in body bags, and it's very difficult to fight
any sort of ground conflict without having casualties,'' Short
said. ``There are some people who will continue to believe that
airstrikes are surgical, that casualties do not occur, and that you
can bring down an enemy without inflicting civilian casualties or
suffering losses yourself. We all know that not to be correct, but
some people will draw the wrong lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``I believe air power established itself in this
campaign,'' the general said on his last day in the operations
center before returning to peacetime duty as commander of the U.S.
16th Air Force in Aviano and of Allied Air Forces, Southern Europe,
in Naples.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought Milosevic to the bargaining table,'' he said,
crediting sustained air attacks with getting President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia to withdraw 40,000 police, military and
paramilitary forces from Kosovo and let 50,000 NATO peacekeepers go
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO got every one of the terms it had stipulated in
Rambouillet and beyond Rambouillet,'' he said, referring to the
peace agreement negotiated in France that Milosevic had refused to
sign before the bombing began last March, ``and I credit this as a
victory for air power.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, he said, had suffered estimated damage of $40
billion from the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   American warplanes flew 60 percent of the 35,000 allied
missions, he said, and probably a higher percentage of the 10,000
bombing runs, because the United States had most of the planes and
most of the alliance's precision targeting equipment, using
satellite data to hit targets even in bad weather or at night.
</P>
<P>
   But superior American numbers also meant that when bombs went
off target and caused civilian casualties, they were bombs dropped
from American planes. ``It's pure percentage,'' he said. ``It was
just the odds. I'd like to give you a more scientific explanation,
but I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can ever ensure that you will never make a
mistake, as long as there are human beings in the loop,'' he
observed, citing the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by
an American B-2 stealth bomber on May 7. That resulted from an
intelligence error that misidentified the embassy site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to assure you that it never turns out that
something like that will happen again, but I can't,'' Short said.
All he could do, he said, was to promise that intelligence experts,
pilots and military commanders would do the best they could to
avoid making such mistakes in a future conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times in May, Short had hinted
at disagreement with the relative restraint of the first few days
of the bombing, when the main targets were Yugoslav anti-aircraft
defense systems and military targets, none of them initially close
to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had airmen been in charge, it would have been done
differently, but that's water under the bridge,'' he said Thursday.
``I felt that on the first night, the power should have gone off,
and major bridges around Belgrade should have gone into the Danube,
and the water should be cut off so that the next morning the
leading citizens of Belgrade would have got up and asked, `Why are
we doing this?' and asked Milosevic the same question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise in the campaign, he said, was the relative
ineffectiveness of the Serbian anti-aircraft missile defense
system, which had been reputed to be one of the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serb air defenses chose to survive, as opposed to fight,''
he said. ``They lost close to 700 surface-to-air missiles of
various types, but I venture to say that not more than a handful of
those were guided. That was reflective of their determination to
survive _ they didn't turn on the radar.''
</P>
<P>
   To guide SA-3 or SA-6 missiles to hit allied planes, the general
said, Serbian anti-aircraft crews would have had to keep guidance
radars turned on for a certain time, but the longer they did, the
easier it would have been for allied missiles to track the radar
signals and destroy the missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our analysis was that there weren't many Serb defenders
willing to die for Slobodan Milosevic,'' he said. ``My guess is
that they had talked to the Iraqis, and knew how effective we had
been against these systems during the Gulf War. We had air
superiority wherever we wanted, and whenever we wanted it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that would be the case in the next war, wherever that
is, is another question. ``Any would-be adversaries will certainly
analyze this campaign to see if we have weaknesses that they can
exploit,'' he concluded. ``I come out of this pretty pleased with
the way air power performed, both U.S. and NATO.''

   MERDARE, Yugoslavia _ A jumbled line of tractors, horse carts
and broken down tanks stretched for nearly six miles from Kosovo
into an adjoining part of Serbia on Thursday, bringing thousands
more displaced Serbs and a potentially troublesome burden for the
Belgrade government.
</P>
<P>
   All along the roads of southern Serbia, Kosovo Serbs have
arrived with household possessions piled on the roofs of their
cars, trundling slowly up the highway to Belgrade. Many have pulled
over to the shoulder to camp among the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents watched them pass, remembering previous tides of
Serbian refugees from other wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not happy about anything to do with this war,'' said
one resident of the town of Krusevac, who gave her name only as
Sanje and said she herself was a refugee from Bosnia. ``And now we
are seeing a lot of buses and cars of refugees. We feel nothing
good at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade government has played down the exodus of Serbs from
Kosovo on state television and has not offered any estimate of the
numbers of people fleeing. The Yugoslav Red Cross has counted some
40,000. NATO puts the number at 80,000 over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the actual number, they come in addition to about
70,000 other Serbs who fled Kosovo over the last two months of NATO
bombing. Where these people will live and work, whether they will
return to Kosovo, and how they will be fed and cared for are the
latest ripples of the Kosovo problem to confront Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's beleaguered government.
</P>
<P>
   When asked, many of the refugees say they have little doubt who
they blame for the debacle in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all Milosevic's fault,'' said Zlate Djordjevic, a lawyer.
``He gave everything to the Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Serbian refugees appear more resigned than angry, and
do not look likely to march on Belgrade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday, many huddled under plastic sheeting as a great thunder
storm broke overhead, drowning out their words. Asked where they
would go, most answered: ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have no relatives to stay with are being directed to
collective centers in schools and public buildings. They are
joining tens of thousands of Serbian refugees from wars in Croatia
and Bosnia over the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Those previous waves Serbian refugees have ended up nearly
forgotten, living in depressed conditions throughout Serbia,
surviving on meager food handouts but mostly left to fend for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these new arrivals will be turning to the government for
food and shelter. Asked how they will survive, one said: ``We'll go
to the refugee center and register. We are not refugees, because we
are in our own country, but we'll be living on humanitarian aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The road just north of the border with Kosovo at Merdare was
blocked solid with new arrivals Thursday. Soldiers mingled with
peasant farmers, white collar workers from the cities and dozens of
Gypsy families.
</P>
<P>
   One young reservist named Slavise was still in his uniform but
accompanying his old mother out of Kosovo, where her family has
lived for centuries. He said he did not know where they would go,
but he said he knew he would not be going back.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Serbs and Albanians could live together after what had
happened over the last two months in Kosovo, he answered no.
</P>
<P>
   A group of other men gathered around him said they were fleeing
the Kosovo Liberation Army, but not their Albanian neighbors, and
said they would stay in Kosovo only if NATO could guarantee their
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not afraid of ordinary Albanians,'' said Djordjevic,
the lawyer. ``I will return in a few weeks I hope when it is more
secure.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, when pressed, said they thought they would never be
able to return. And asked if Albanians would nurture hatred for the
Serbs after what had happened in the last two months, the men stood
in glum silence.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Serbs offered various wild conspiracy theories about
what has gone wrong in Kosovo, but nearly all those leaving agree
on one thing _ that for whatever reason, the policies of recent
years have proved disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Most still blame the KLA and Albanian extremists who want
independence from Serbia. But they equally blame the leadership in
Belgrade for not crushing the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Many at first try to deny that ``ethnic cleansing'' or any
organized killing of Albanian civilians occurred in Kosovo, but
when confronted with strong evidence even they admit that things
happened.
</P>
<P>
   A few not only admit that atrocities occurred, but agree that
such violence has forever made it impossible for Serbs to live in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have lived with our Albanian neighbors, but not with
the guerrillas,'' said Slobodan Filipovic, a storekeeper from
Prizren. ``I left my apartment keys with our Albanian neighbors.
They were crying. They wanted us to stay. They wanted to protect us
but they couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking dazed and weary, he sat at the wheel of a tiny Fiat car,
piled high with bedding and luggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not like it that the Albanians had to go, but they were
asking for independence for Kosovo and we were defending the
state,'' said his wife, Jovanka, a retired factory worker. But
asked if it was the violent campaign against the Albanians that had
precipitated their own exodus, she replied: ``Yes,'' nodding her
head firmly. ``Yes, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all this nationalism that was the cause of it all,''
she said.

AS STOCK FALLS, SINGAPORE BANK DISAPPOINTS IRISH INVESTOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Japan, The Netherlands)   By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ A major banking deal that at first looked like a
clear-cut victory in Singapore's effort to become a financial
center of Southeast Asia is now getting mixed reviews among
investors and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks ago, Allied Irish Banks PLC said it would buy
roughly 25 percent of Singapore's smallest bank, Keppel Tatlee Bank
Ltd., paying about $1.5 billion (Singapore) _ currently $880
million (United States) _ over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks announced the deal after Singapore's government
opened its financial industry to more foreign investment as part of
broader changes intended to make the banking industry more
transparent and competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In return for capital and expertise from Allied Irish, Ireland's
largest banking group, Keppel Tatlee stands to give its new partner
a base from which to exploit resurgent Asian financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But shares in Keppel Tatlee have fallen 7 percent since the
announcement, and the rating agency Standard &AMP; Poor's says it is
considering downgrading Allied Irish's credit to reflect its
expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest example of a push by Western banks to buy
a share of the market in Asia in anticipation of a new financial
landscape that many expect will come with recovery. Under these
assumptions, retail banking would take on greater importance than
corporate banking.
</P>
<P>
   American and European banks are seeking out cheap takeover
targets in the region, and Allied Irish was only one of several
European banks in recent weeks to bet on an Asian recovery.
Standard Chartered PLC of Britain has agreed to take control of a
bank in Thailand and another in Indonesia. ABN Amro of the
Netherlands has taken a majority stake in another Thai bank.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the Irish investment probably does not presage a
wholesale invasion of Singapore by foreign bankers. Instead, it is
likely to hasten a government-sanctioned consolidation among four
remaining local rivals as they steel themselves for more foreign
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger banks will have to re-examine their strategy and
ask themselves, `Can I compete with this smaller competitor with
deeper pockets?''' said Terry Chan, director of Standard &AMP; Poor's
office here.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Irish said when it announced the deal that it had opted
for a partner in Singapore rather than a bank elsewhere in the
region because of Singapore's relatively strong economy and
regulatory standards. ``If you want to get involved in the whole
region, you need to have a really solid base,'' Michael Buckley,
managing director of AIB Capital Markets, told reporters earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Singapore officials have been saying since the
Asian financial crisis began in 1997. Not only has Singapore been
spared much of the region's tumult but officials have also been at
pains to remind investors and traders that unlike some neighbors,
Singapore is freeing up its markets on its own initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, the authorities here began preparing for an
overhaul of what was a fairly protected and sleepy financial
system. Their aim is to make Singapore a financial center along the
lines of New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong. But that means
throwing the city open to foreign banks, with their more advanced
technology and bewildering blend of financial services.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare, Singapore's Monetary Authority is shaking up
insurers, mutual funds and securities markets. The government is
making banks disclose bad loans to shareholders for the first time.
The end to limits on foreign ownership has forced Singapore banks
to dismantle a class of shares for foreign investors that because
of their relative scarcity had typically traded at a premium to
local shares. Banks are now offering to swap every foreign share
for a slightly higher amount of common stock.
</P>
<P>
   More big news appears likely: Hinting at a tougher future, the
Monetary Authority's chairman, who is also a Deputy Prime Minister
and the son of Singapore's founding prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew,
has maintained that Singapore is only big enough for two local
banks.
</P>
<P>
   That the government-controlled Keppel Tatlee was the first to
experiment with foreign shareholdings came as only a mild surprise;
the bank's stock had sharply risen in the days leading up to the
Allied Irish announcement in expectation that it was a takeover
target. The bank was the product of a 1988 merger between the
Keppel Bank Ltd. and the Tat Lee Bank Ltd. It began discussions
with potential foreigner investors late last year and said it had
chosen Allied Irish because senior managers got along well.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, analysts say the specifics of the deal disappointed
investors. Allied Irish will buy just $350 million (Singapore) _ or
$205 million _ worth of Keppel Tatlee bonds paying 1 percent
annually. Attached to the bonds are warrants that can be used any
time in the next three years to buy 350 million Keppel Tatlee
shares for roughly $1.5 billion (Singapore).
</P>
<P>
   A higher price would presumably have made investors happier,
given that the new shares will dilute the value of existing stock.
There is also concern that warrants leave Allied Irish the option
of walking away, should the relationship sour, and beyond that,
there is talk of potential clashes between the managers of Allied
Irish and Keppel Tatlee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cultural change and I don't think the banks have a
willingness to experiment,'' said John Doyle, an analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Asian nations' recovery is far from assured,
and the financial crisis has not left Keppel Tatlee and its
Singapore peers unscathed. Almost a quarter of the $30.3 billion
(Singapore) worth of outstanding loans by banks here to Southeast
Asian borrowers as of March was classified as nonperforming.
</P>
<P>
   Keppel Tatlee says it has its nonperforming loans under control,
having set aside more than enough to cover the $704 million
(Singapore) in bad debt it still has in Southeast Asia. Some
analysts say that the drop in the bank's stock price is temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Some local brokers said they like the new combination. Keppel
Tatlee ``looks a lot better with AIB as a partner than without,''
said David Lum, director of banking and strategy at
Prudential-Bache Securities Asia Pacific.

   BERNARDS TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ The provocative skinsuit Brandi
Chastain displayed in a recent sportsgear magazine photo spread has
confirmed David Letterman's long-held belief that the U.S. women's
soccer team is ``Babe City.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the gap-toothed talk-show host invited Chastain onto his
show Wednesday, the starting left defender, with one of the lower
profiles on the team, wasn't sure how to gauge the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if `special' was the word, because it was like
being in an accident,'' Chastain said. ``I saw it coming but I
couldn't stop it, and I wasn't ready for it until it was over. I
was kind of shaking when I got off the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   While that might sound like a Jerry Springer moment, Chastain
also was charmed. ``It was exciting,'' she said. ``He was really
very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain, 30, has been with the U.S. team since 1988, but hasn't
generated the attention of some of her teammates. She appeared in
the magazine with fellow Nike endorsers Gabrielle Reece and Michael
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to be in the kind of a magazine where I was
going to be exposing myself,'' she said. ``But I did tell my
parents maybe it wasn't such a good idea to show it to Grandma and
Grandpa.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost a sellout
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday morning, only 1,200 tickets remained for the
opening doubleheader at Giants Stadium, the U.S.-Denmark match at 3
p.m. and Brazil-Mexico at 5:30.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 76,516 tickets sold are in American hands, giving
the U.S. team an overwhelming home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   For the World Cup, more than 465,000 tickets have been sold, an
average of 27,000 for each of the 17 doubleheaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have as many spectators in our country for what we
will see here,'' Denmark coach Jorgen Hvidemose said, referring to
the crowd his team have to contend with on Saturday. ``They don't
all have to come to one game, do they?''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's twinbill in San Jose _ co-favorite China
against Sweden and Japan facing Canada _ has sold between 18,000 to
20,000, with Spartan Stadium holding 26,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican team a 'curiosity'
</P>
<P>
   His team might be one of the biggest longshots in the World Cup,
but Mexico coach Leo Cuellar thinks his first-time qualifiers have
scaled a notable obstacle in a country where soccer is considered a
male pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are something of a curiosity,'' Cuellar said. He and nearly
half his roster live in the United States, primarily Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican soccer federation formed a women's team only last
year, and Cuellar quickly infused it with U.S.-based talent.
Captain Laurie Hill was a star at UC-Santa Barbara, and forward
Monica Gerardo is Notre Dame's all-time scoring leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico is the weakling in a tough Group B field that
includes Germany, Italy and Brazil, their opponent Saturday.

EISNER REACHES OUT TO RALLY RANK AND FILE
</HEADLINE>

BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Buck up, Mouseketeers.
</P>
<P>
   That was the essence of an uncommon, corporatewide e-mail sent
out Thursday to employees of The Walt Disney Co. by Chairman
Michael Eisner, the Los Angeles Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, saying he was taking on the role of company cheerleader,
said he sent out the message partly to counteract the
higher-than-normal amount of negative publicity that the
entertainment giant has received recently. He told employees they
should focus on the positive and stressed strong prospects for
``Tarzan,'' the studio's 37th animated movie, which opens
nationwide today.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, who has headed Disney since 1984, also indicated he
would now regularly send e-mail messages to employees across the
company. Officials at Burbank-based Disney refused to comment on
the e-mail or release a copy of Eisner's letter, but portions of
the note was read to the Daily News by several Disney employees who
requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Good news has been rare at Disney recently. Earlier this month,
Eisner imposed a corporatewide hiring freeze and tightened the use
of temporary workers. He ordered a cost-savings review in late
April after Disney reported a 30percent drop in quarterly profits.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, meanwhile, has been harping on Eisner over the
performance of Disney shares, which are down 29percent from their
all-time high of $42.375 set in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is one of 30 companies that comprise the Dow Jones
industrial average, the nation's most heavily watched stock market
index.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Eisner is under growing pressure to boost Disney's
stock price due to strong performances by rival entertainment
conglomerates and other blue chip companies. His sterling
reputation _ which was built on the impressive run-up of Disney
shares in the middle of the decade _ has been hurt by the stock's
slide.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he was the nation's top-paid corporate executive, as
he cashed more than $500million in options. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

 &HT;    U.S. team's self-effacing Hamm magnet for spotlight
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERNARDS TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Ask Mia Hamm about soccer, her friends
on the U.S. national team and the Women's World Cup, and you'll
discover a straightforward young woman who says all the right
things and presents herself in stark contrast to the crude profile
of the American sports superstar these days.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her about herself, and the phenomenon that has sprung up
around her as the glamour girl for her sport, and her face quickly
flushes red with embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to outgoing personalities, Hamm can't hold a
candle to some of the others around her. For an outpouring of
gutty, inspiring resilience, there's 33-year-old veteran Michelle
Akers. Midfielder Julie Foudy, the glib, merry prankster, has
yukked it up with comedy talk show hosts Conan O'Brien and Craig
Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   And for sheer outrageous behavior, try topping goalkeeper Briana
Scurry, who lost a bet at the 1996 Olympics and dashed naked down a
street in Athens in the middle of the night after the Americans won
the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a soccer player, and I really don't do much else,'' Hamm
said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the three years since the U.S. women electrified a packed
Sanford Stadium, Hamm's impact has moved far beyond the field,
where she recently established an international record with 109
goals and counting. The 27-year-old forward has become a largely
media-driven icon for a sport that was virtually unknown to the
American sports public.
</P>
<P>
   Considered the most marketable female athlete in the country, as
determined by a sports marketing survey last year, Hamm accepts her
role for the sake of promoting women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it comes to certain aspects of her game, Hamm is
uncomfortable talking about herself, particularly when she went
through an eight-game goalless streak that finally ended in a 7-0
rout of Japan last month in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's 87 assists are an American record, and she's just as
adept at lofting a delicate cross for a teammate in scoring
position as she is putting on the finishing touches herself. After
the U.S. lost to China in April, she expressed displeasure with her
defensive effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very passionate player,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said
earlier this week. ``You see her true personality come out on the
soccer field.''
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the burden
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. prepares for its World Cup opener Saturday against
Denmark, newspaper and magazine articles have recounted at length
Hamm's legendary yearning for privacy. On Thursday morning at the
team's training ground, she spent half an hour patiently answering
questions she has heard dozens of times before. When they veer
toward the internal, she backpedals, especially when queried about
why she rose so quickly to sports celebrity status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Hamm said, her voice trailing off, searching
for a more communal reply. ``People have rallied around this team.
There's something great here. So many young girls play soccer, and
it's great that they can grow up and want to be like Julie Foudy or
Michelle Akers or Kristine Lilly. We didn't have that, and I think
it's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the Olympics, it was Hamm that caught Madison Avenue's
eye. People magazine dubbed her one of its ``50 Most Beautiful
People.'' That spawned a host of product endorsements, most notably
Nike, which has used her girl-next-door image to soften some of its
own hard edges and go after legions of teen-age girls who shriek
her name after catching a glimpse of her firsthand. Hamm, like her
teammates, earns a living primarily from endorsements and pulls
down somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million annually, far and
away tops among female athletes in team sports.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Nike unveiled a new building on its Beaverton,
Ore., campus bearing Hamm's name _ and larger than the one
constructed in honor of Michael Jordan. Naturally, she shuddered at
the attention. ``It was never a goal to have a building named after
me,'' Hamm said, sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   More than just one player
</P>
<P>
   Hamm, the daughter of an Air Force colonel and the wife of a
U.S. Marine Corps pilot currently on duty in Asia, volunteers
little about her life away from soccer. She has a 12-handicap in
golf and established a foundation in memory of her adopted brother
Garrett, who died of a blood disease in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was Garrett Hamm who introduced his younger sister to soccer,
and, as the family moved around, it became her most abiding
constant, even though she played other sports.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent series of Gatorade commercials she challenges Jordan
to one-on-one duels in such sports as fencing, running, and karate.
In the last sequence, Hamm gets the last laugh, throwing Jordan
over her shoulder and onto the mat flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they even bring up the glamor,'' Hamm said.
``And that's what I like about them.''
</P>
<P>
   She also revels in her teammates getting on camera. When
defender Brandi Chastain returned to the team hotel Wednesday after
appearing on David Letterman's show, Hamm was ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said to me, `You were just awesome,' `` Chastain said.
``It's good for Mia to sit back and enjoy what we've been enjoying
all these years, which is seeing our sport promoted in a positive
way.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the lens gazing away from her, if only for a moment.
The World Cup will unfold over the next month, and Hamm hopes the
spotlight on women's soccer will be much bigger than the one that
has been enveloping her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tournament is a success on its own because there are so
many great personalities on these teams, so many great players,''
Hamm said. ``It wouldn't have gotten as big as it has because of
just one player.

RACIAL DIVIDE FOUND IN MATERNAL MORTALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass., Neb., Wash.)  (mk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Though the nation's infant mortality rate has
steadily declined over the last decade, the percentage of women who
die in childbirth has remained essentially unchanged, and black
women are four times as likely to die as whites, according to a
government study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dying while giving birth is still rare in this country. For
every 100,000 women who have babies, the study found, 7.7 die, a
figure that translates into the death of one mother for every
12,987 giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   But the research, the first to analyze maternal mortality by
state, uncovered huge disparities between black and white women,
and among the states themselves. And experts say the differences
cannot be explained solely by socioeconomics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found is that the best rates for black women were
still higher or in about the same range as the worst rates for
white women,'' said Dr. Lynne Wilcox, director of the division of
reproductive health at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, which conducted the research. ``There are
ongoing, long-term disparities that have not been looked at
carefully here.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the states, New York had the highest death rate for black
pregnant women. In New York, the study found, 28.7 black women die
for every 100,000 who give birth, the equivalent of one death for
every 3,484 births. That puts New York well above the national
average of 19.6 deaths per 100,000 black pregnant women; the
maternal death rate among white women in New York, 7.6 per 100,000,
was also higher than the national average for white pregnant women,
5.3 deaths per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the state with the lowest rates for both black
and white women, the rate was 8.7 per 100,000 for black women and
2.7 per 100,000 for whites. Because the numbers for other racial
groups were too small to be reliable, the researchers did not
include them.
</P>
<P>
   To conduct the study, the centers' epidemiologists examined
birth and death certificates between 1987 and 1996. Any woman who
died in pregnancy or within 42 days after giving birth, from any
cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy, was considered a
maternal death.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the centers identified 3,086 pregnant women who died
in the study period. But Wilcox said that figure was almost
certainly an underestimate; smaller, more detailed studies have
found that the maternal mortality rate is 1.3 to three times higher
than is reported on death certificates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the national rate of 7.7 deaths per 100,000 women
giving birth is more than twice the goal set by the federal
government for the year 2000, under its Healthy People 2000
initiative. Only Massachusetts, Nebraska and Washington have
managed to meet the Healthy People 2000 goal of 3.3 deaths per
100,000, and only for white women.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists do not fully understand the reasons for the
disparities between blacks and whites, and the study did not
provide an explanation. But experts offer a variety of possible
explanations: Black women are less likely to have good prenatal
care than whites; they are more prone to high blood pressure, a
leading cause of death in pregnancy, and they are in poorer health
in general.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, these experts say, there may be other reasons
that are being overlooked. Even well-educated and well-off black
women appear to be at greater risk than whites. And little research
is focused on preventing deaths among black pregnant women, in
large part because most people think dying in childbirth is no
longer an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``As safe motherhood has become an international issue, people
say it is not a problem here in the developed countries,'' said
Andrea Camp, a senior fellow at the Institute for Civil Society, a
nonprofit foundation in Boston. ``What this report shows is, it is
a problem in America in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that states no longer examine every
single death of a pregnant woman. Dr. Jeffrey King, who is leading
an examination of maternal mortality for the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, called on states to establish
maternal mortality review boards that would examine the reasons for
each death. Currently, only 25 states conduct such reviews.
</P>
<P>
   There are three leading causes of death in pregnancy:
preeclampsia, or high blood pressure induced by pregnancy;
hemorrhage, including bleeding associated with ectopic pregnancy,
and embolism, a clot in the bloodstream. The study found that black
women have a higher risk than whites of dying from each.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the technologies available in the United States,
we have not reached an irreducible number of maternal deaths,''
King said. ``This is a public health issue that requires action.''

SIEMENS AND FUJITSU TO JOIN EUROPEAN COMPUTER UNITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Hoping to close the gap with bigger
American computer rivals, Siemens of Germany and Fujitsu of Japan
said Thursday they that would combine their European computer
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The new entity, with total annual revenue of more than $6
billion, would rank as the world's fifth-largest computer maker
after Compaq, Dell Computer, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Fujitsu and Siemens said they hoped to cut expenses, mainly by
obtaining more bargaining power with suppliers and by spreading
research and development costs over a broader base. The deal also
gives Fujitsu access to a better distribution network in Europe,
which it has long needed.
</P>
<P>
   For Siemens, of Munich, the move represents the latest step in a
corporate overhaul aimed at streamlining the company. Siemens is
currently spinning off its semiconductor business, with annual
revenue around $3.5 billion, through a public stock offering early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   It is also pushing deeper into the Internet business, having
recently reached agreements to acquire three young American
software companies.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens appears to be contributing far more to the deal than
Fujitsu. Its computer division has about $4.2 billion in annual
sales and 8,000 employees, while Fujitsu Computers Europe has sales
of $2.1 billion and 1,600 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies glossed over the apparent imbalance, suggesting
that Fujitsu had contributed more valuable assets and has a
stronger focus on information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of Siemens, had originally hoped
to sell Siemens' personal computer business to Acer of Taiwan. But
that deal fell through last year, when the Asian financial crisis
forced Acer to back out.
</P>
<P>
   The new deal could help Siemens achieve enough volume to keep up
with bruising price competition. Siemens, though the biggest
personal computer manufacturer in Germany, produced only 1.5
million units last year. The combined entity plans to produce more
than four million.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens and Fujitsu also sell a fairly broad range of other
equipment, from computer networks and servers to big mainframe
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has generated meaningful profit from computers, said
Frank Alexander Rothauge, head of the technology group at
Oppenheimer &AMP; Co. here.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the merger should strengthen their ability to
make money even as computer prices come down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantages are mainly on the cost side,'' Rothauge said.
``The challenge is really to make use of the scale in order to
actually reduce costs of purchasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts had speculated that Siemens might simply sell its
entire computer business, and there were some signs that investors
were disappointed that such a divestiture had not taken place.
Siemens shares, after surging to a record high of 73.30 euros in
midday trading here, settled back to close at 71.45 euros, up 1.59
percent. Reaction was far more positive for Fujitsu shares, which
rose 110 yen, or 5 percent, in Tokyo to a record 2,290 yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an exit strategy for Siemens _ it is quite the
opposite,'' von Pierer said.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies predicted that the new venture would increase
annual sales to about $8 billion in the year 2000.

 &HT;    Georgia Tech teammates have rough 1st-round start
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ So much for Kooch-mania.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Matt Kuchar's second U.S. Open isn't the smile festival
it became a year ago at the Olympic Club. The 20-year-old former
U.S. Amateur champion from Georgia Tech started Thursday's first
round with a double-bogey 6, found himself 5-over par after five
holes and was fortunate to eventually finish at 6-over 76.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of Tech's collegiate season, teammate Bryce Molder found
himself in a better position at Pinehurst No. 2. Playing in his
first pro event, Molder, 20, who made the field from the East Lake
qualifier, followed his front-nine 40 with a 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still around where I can make the cut,'' said Kuchar, of
Lake Mary, Fla., who tied for 14th at last year's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't shoot myself out of it,'' said Molder, of Conway,
Ark., who spent most of the college season as the nation's
top-ranked men's player, ``and I did the first nine holes. But I
played really great the last six or seven holes.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``quitting on a 6-iron'' from 182 yards at the 485-yard
eighth hole and eventually making double-bogey on a missed 4-foot
putt, Molder regrouped with birdies at 14 and 15, on approaches of
6 and 9 feet, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Molder said he did not experience the nervousness he
anticipated, aided by the presence of teammate/roommate Wes Latimer
of Woodstock on his bag. Both players beat Kuchar by five shots at
the recent NCAA Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably played as many rounds with Wes as anyone the
last two years,'' Molder said.
</P>
<P>
   Molder said he isn't paying Latimer, who volunteered his
services, ``but I got his hotel and most of his dinners.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else playing No. 2 Thursday in soft,
scoring-friendly conditions, Kuchar realized an opportunity
squandered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever a day to take advantage of the course, this
was it,'' Kuchar said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Tech players fared better Thursday, with David Duval
sharing the lead at 3-under 67 and Duluth's Stewart Cink in decent
position with a 72. The normally straight-driving Cink hit only six
of 14 fairways.
</P>
<P>
   ``My driver was really off,'' he said. ``I hit the fairway with
all the clubs other than my driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus out of focus
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus' chances to make the cut at age 59 basically ended
with the rains came Wednesday. On a soft, longer Pinehurst No. 2,
Nicklaus, still regaining his strength after January hip
replacement surgery, was outmatched and shot a 78. ``Guys are
hitting 8- and 9-irons and I'm hitting 2 and 3 irons,'' Nicklaus
said. ``I guess I'm getting some of my own medicine. I had it the
other way for years.'' Teeing off at 7:20 a.m. on an overcast day,
Nicklaus ``couldn't see at all'' and typically has a problem with
low light. ``My caddie read my putts on the first three greens,''
he said.
</P>
<P>

   Colin Montgomerie was justifiably irked when after birdieing the
last two holes for 72 and showing up in the interview area, he was
asked, ``What did you shoot?'' (Most reporters consider it
insulting to the player not to have that information in their
possession). ``Is that the first question? What did I shoot? That's
the best one yet.'' Later, he said, ``Could you believe that? What
if I'd shot 80?'' ... On the rainy morning weather, Monty said,
``In fact, the weather's better in Scotland, and warmer.'' ...
Tiger Woods has had better driving days. He missed one fairway on
the front nine with a 4-iron. ... Jose Maria Olazabal's wayward
driver reappeared, accounting for nine missed fairways in a 75. ``I
hit the ball all over the place,'' said the Masters champ, ``and
there's no way you can score like that.'' ... Mark O'Meara's caddie

TEXAS EXECUTES CANADIAN DESPITE INTERNATIONAL PLEAS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Canadian man who survived nine dates with death in
22 years on death row in Texas was executed Thursday despite
international pleas to halt the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Joseph Stanley Faulder, 61, who was sentenced to death
for the 1975 murder of a wealthy elderly woman, was the first
Canadian to be executed in the United States since 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials, as well as human rights groups and
international legal authorities, had sought to halt the execution
for several reasons, among them that Faulder was never notified of
his right to contact the Canadian Consulate.
</P>
<P>
   In a final appeal, which was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court
about 75 minutes before the execution, Faulder's lawyer, Sandra
Babcock, turned to a 200-year-old law, the Alien Tort Claims Act,
that allows foreign citizens to sue the United States for
violations of international law. Ms. Babcock argued that Texas
violated the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations' guarantee
that citizens arrested abroad be allowed to seek assistance from
their consulates.
</P>
<P>
   She also argued that the 22 years Faulder spent on death row
were excessive and that his nine prior execution dates resulted in
cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was rejected without comment, clearing the way for
Faulder's death by injection shortly after 6 p.m. His execution was
the 14th this year in Texas and the 178th since the death penalty
was reinstated in the state in December 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the international legal aspects of the case, a
spokeswoman for Gov. George W. Bush said that was a matter for the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the diplomatic nature of the issue, particularly
since Bush is a presidential candidate, the spokeswoman said,
``Canada is a friend and neighbor of the United States and we hope
Canadians understand that Governor Bush has taken an oath to uphold
the laws of Texas, including the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Parole and Pardons voted 18-0 on Wednesday to deny
Faulder's request for reprieve or commutation of sentence. Bush
cannot grant a reprieve without the support of the board, though he
could grant a one-time 30-day delay.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General John Cornyn of Texas defended the execution,
noting that ``10 different courts and more than 38 judges have
reviewed a total of 17 appeals, each time rejecting his appeal and
affirming the capital murder conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulder was arrested in Colorado in 1977 nearly two years after
the stabbing death of Inez Phillips in a July 1975 robbery of her
home in Gladewater, Texas. Ms. Phillips was also severely beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The issues regarding Faulder's citizenship did not come to light
until 1991, when Ms. Babcock began representing him and contacted
the Canadian Consulate in Dallas, which had no record of Faulder.
She has argued that the consulate's involvement in the case could
have bolstered his defense.
</P>
<P>
   The case also focused attention on questionable practices of the
Texas Board of Parole and Pardons. In an appeal that the U.S.
Supreme Court denied on Wednesday, Ms. Babcock argued that the
clemency process in Texas failed to meet minimum standards of
fairness.

CHOOSING 2006 OLYMPIC SITE A SOMBER EVENT AFTER REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No champagne and caviar this time. No calfskin luggage, no
Waterford keepsakes, no five-figure ``humanitarian aid'' offers
from jostling bid cities. And no more balloting that resembles the
1924 Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   When the International Olympic Committee convenes in Seoul
Friday to choose the site of the 2006 Winter Games from among six
European candidates, it will do so without the lavish lobbying that
the Lords of the Rings have come to regret -- and with only two
options to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the handout scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's
2002 bid, with its expulsions, resignations and worldwide calls for
reform, the IOC banned its members from visiting candidate cities
and stopped cities from giving them anything more than trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any kind of gifts, any kind of bribes,'' Marco San
Pietro, international relations director for the Turin bid
committee, said by phone Thursday from Seoul. ``Everything is
forbidden. You can't even give a pen.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time in its history, the IOC is allowing
outsiders to help choose a host city. A special 15-member
``selection college,'' including three athletes and two
representatives from the winter sports federations and national
Olympic committees, will narrow the field from the six bidders
(Sion, Switzerland; Turin; Helsinki; Klagenfurt, Austria; Zakopane,
Poland and Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia) to two finalists. Then, shortly
after midnight in the United States, the full IOC will choose the
victor.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new system, which the IOC says is experimental, is
designed to limit the suspicious horse-trading between bidders and
members that marked previous elections, it has undeniable flaws. It
gives a distinct advantage to Sion, which hosted dozens of IOC
members when it was bidding for the 2002 Games. And it forces
voters to rely for information on hour-long presentations, a report
from the IOC's site evaluation commission and on piles of brochures
and CD-ROMs (``virtual visits'') from cities they've never seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you fall in love with a lady without seeing her, just by
reading a book about her?'' complained Vitaly Smirnov, an IOC
member from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The travel ban fell hardest on Klagenfurt, which is offering a
unique ``bid without borders'' that includes nearby venues in Italy
and Slovenia. ``Some IOC members think we have very long
distances,'' says bid leader Michael Ausserwinkler. ``It would have
been fantastic to show them that a citizen of Klagenfurt leaves his
job at 5 o'clock and at 6 he is eating dinner in Slovenia.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Sion is the clear favorite, observers have been
whispering about a possible anti-Swiss backlash directed at Marc
Hodler, the IOC member from Switzerland who fueled the scandal in
December by claiming that at least a quarter of his colleagues had
been taking payoffs from bid cities for years.
</P>
<P>
   But the most obvious backlash is being directed at the
Americans, whom some members accuse of creating the worst scandal
in IOC history by seducing them with cash and gifts then demanding
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem inherent to corruption was born from people of
Salt Lake City,'' said IOC member Mario Vasquez Rana of Mexico.
``I'm sorry to say this is something that comes from that wonderful
country, the United States of America.''

   BC-POPE-NYT (moved on Wednesday, June 16)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Wednesday, June
16, about Pope John Paul II's recollections of Jewish friends in
his hometown, Wadowice, Poland, and their suffering in World War II
misstated the name of a boyhood friend in some copies. He was Jerzy
Kluger, not Jurek Kruger.

   BC-BUSH-CONN-NYT (moved on Tuesday, June 15)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Tuesday, June 15,
about Gov. George W. Bush's Presidential campaign referred
imprecisely to a response by Elizabeth Dole to his comments about
who should be appointed to judgeships. After Mr. Bush said that
opposition to abortion would not be a litmus test for judicial
nominees if he became President, a spokesman for Mrs. Dole said her
appointees would have to share her ``general philosophy.'' The
spokesman explained that although Mrs. Dole opposed abortion except
in cases of incest, rape or danger to the pregnant woman's life,
the candidate had not specifically cited abortion as an issue on
which she and an appointee would have to agree.
</P>
<P>
   The article also referred incorrectly to Mrs. Dole's attitude
toward Mr. Bush's stance. Her spokesman said Mrs. Dole did not
criticize Mr. Bush's position, but agreed with it.

HELMS PRODS HOLBROOKE AND RECEIVES A CONCESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse
Helms said Thursday that he believed that Richard Holbrooke,
President Clinton's nominee as chief diplomat to the United
Nations, had ``violated the law several times.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long-awaited showdown on Capitol Hill between the
conservative senator and the longtime diplomat, Holbrooke tried to
satisfy Helms by quickly apologizing to the Senate and
acknowledging that his carelessness had led to ``misconceptions''
about his ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials suggested that Holbrooke's contrition
might have rescued his nomination. Other senators on the panel,
Democrats and Republicans alike, expressed support for Holbrooke on
Thursday as his confirmation hearings began.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination, announced a year ago, has been stalled by
allegations that Holbrooke skirted federal ethics laws in his
revolving-door career between the State Department and Wall Street.
Just as things appeared to be looking up for him, another senator
announced that he would temporarily block any vote on the
nomination on the Senate floor as a result of a controversy
involving the suspension of a State Department employee at the U.S.
mission to the United Nations, Linda Shenwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not against Mr. Holbrooke,'' said the lawmaker, Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who is seeking Ms. Shenwick's
reinstatement. ``This is a message to the State Department. Linda
Shenwick is a patriotic public servant trying to do her job and
exposing a lot of things that are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms, R-N.C., who is the Senate's most outspoken critic of the
United Nations, has left unclear what he would ultimately do with
Holbrooke's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The senator had left open the possibility that he would kill the
nomination through procedural tactics even though Holbrooke appears
to enjoy widespread _ except for Helms _ possibly unanimous support
on the Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials said Thursday that Holbrooke's
willingness to concede that he should have been ``much more
sensitive'' to appearances of conflict of interest might have
satisfied Helms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the law and I was careful to follow it,'' Holbrooke
said. ``But I should have been more sensitive, much more sensitive,
to the appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With regret,'' he added, ``I must say that carelessness on
occasion on my part contributed to these misconceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke also committed himself to making the streamlining of
the United Nations, the senator's longstanding goal, ``my highest
sustained priority.'' Holbrooke described himself as ``a hard-line
hawk on the issue of bureaucratic bloat, whether it's in Washington
or New York.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his remarks after Helms had opened the hearing with a
lengthy attack on what he described as Holbrooke's failure to
adhere to ethics laws that bar former officials from trying to
profit off their government work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time and again, the evidence shows Mr. Holbrooke either chose
not to seek ethics advice or to ignore it when it was given,'' the
senator said, facing Holbrooke across the witness table. ``I agree
that you have served with distinction, and certainly with
sincerity. But I also believe that it's apparent that you have
violated the law several times.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his nomination was announced last June, Holbrooke
became the subject of an ethics investigation by the Justice
Department and the State Department inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry, prompted by an anonymous letter, ended in February,
when Holbrooke agreed to pay $5,000 to settle civil charges that he
had violated a law that bars former government officials from
lobbying their former colleagues for a year, a so-called
cooling-off period.
</P>
<P>
   After Holbrooke's remarks, Helms said, ``I believe we're getting
somewhere.'' ``The most important thing that the nominee has said
this morning is, in effect, that he has made some mistakes and
regrets that,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley's threat to hold up the nomination was a surprise to
the State Department, which had no comment on the move. In the
past, the department has described Ms. Shenwick, the employee at
the U.N. mission, as insubordinate, and she has been told that she
is being suspended from her duties as of Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Victoria Toensing, said Ms. Shenwick had exposed
waste and fraud at the United Nations and in the mission. ``They're
getting rid of a whistle-blower,'' she said.

NEGOTIATIONS ON THE ROLE OF RUSSIA INTENSIFY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ With the key issue of the distribution of
Russian forces in Kosovo still unsettled, American and Russian
negotiators returned to the table on Thursday night, with orders to
work through the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian defense minister, Igor D. Sergeyev, and the foreign
minister, Igor S. Ivanov, told their American counterparts early
Thursday evening that they would return to Moscow for consultations
on Thursday night. But they were persuaded instead to press ahead
with work on a complex agreement defining Russia's role in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sees the outcome as a test of its standing as an
independent albeit weakened player on the world stage. For NATO,
Russia's integration into the security force is a test of its
ability to manage a tenuous peace in a province wracked by violence
and hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are under pressure to resolve the issue before this
weekend's summit meeting in Cologne, Germany, which will be
attended by leaders of the seven major industrial nations and by
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they decided to stay is encouraging,'' said the
Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, speaking to reporters outside
the Presidential Palace, where the two delegations have been
holding talks for two days.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Yeltsin said he had instructed Sergeyev to stick to a
demand for a Russian sector in Kosovo, where allied forces have
been steadily increasing their presence as Serbian troops pull out.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials, negotiating on behalf of NATO, have
rejected a separate Russian sector, fearing a de facto partition of
Kosovo. In their latest proposal, the Americans reportedly offered
an alternative that would distribute Russian troops in sectors
already controlled by the United States, France, Germany, Italy and
Britain. The number of Russian troops has not yet been decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been putting forward different ideas, all designed to
meet our `red lines,''' said James Rubin, the spokesman for
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who arrived here on
Thursday. Those red lines, he said, include a unified command
structure, with Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain, the commander
of the allied troops, holding ``ultimate authority.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian news reports, one compromise may involve
having a senior Russian officer serve in the force's top command.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Thursday evening, Ivanov said Russia was
not looking for special treatment but for parity with the other
members of the force, which was approved by the U.N. Security
Council earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a rope-pulling competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia caught the allies off guard last week with a sudden
deployment of 200 troops at the airport outside Pristina, the
capital of Kosovo. The Russians had been ordered from Bosnia, where
they are serving with the peacekeeping force there, by the Russian
General Staff. According to Russian news reports, Yeltsin approved
the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president made it perfectly clear that Russia
favors equality and equal participation in the peacekeeping
operations,'' Ivanov said. ``The only conditions we have are the
same conditions as the other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said the negotiations had already produced an
``understanding'' on two key issues: a unified command structure
and the distribution of functions at the Pristina airport.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would publicly outline the interim agreements. But
a Clinton administration official described the tentative agreement
on a unified command structure as ``very analogous'' to the
arrangement in Bosnia, where 1,300 Russian troops serve in a sector
that is under American command.
</P>
<P>
   But, the official cautioned, everything will depend on the
contents of the final agreement. ``There is a command on top, and
command on the technical level,'' he said. ``Until you work out the
geography of deployment, you haven't worked out anything on the
technical level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These talks are military, not political,'' he added. ``Until
you get all of it done, you have no agreement. That's why half a
loaf is no loaf.''

   Russia: IMF Measure Rejected

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The lower house of Parliament rejected a proposed
gasoline tax, a linchpin of an economic reform package that the
International Monetary Fund has sought as a condition for resuming
loans to the near-bankrupt government. The 291-101 defeat raised
questions about whether any form of a gas tax could be passed this
year; however, IMF officials indicated this week that they might
approve new loans even if the bulk of the economic overhaul stalls

   LONDON _ The High Court ruled that 17 soldiers due to appear
before a judicial inquiry into the ``Bloody Sunday'' killings of 14
unarmed Catholic civil rights demonstrators in Londonderry in 1972
could remain publicly anonymous. The soldiers had protested a
decision ordering them to identify themselves, saying it might
expose them to retaliation. The inquiry is a review of a speedy and

paratroopers and faulted the protesters.

provided by the IRA, police have been digging in several areas, but

toll on Braves first basemen this series, resulting in injuries to
Randall Simon and Brian Hunter after sliding to score.
</P>
<P>
   The more serious injury is Hunter's sprained ankle, which got
caught on the plate as he slid home in the sixth inning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no top layer of dirt,'' Hunter said. ``It's like
cement with a plate in the middle of it.''
</P>
<P>
   X-rays taken Thursday on Hunter were negative, and he said he
might return in a couple days. Manager Bobby Cox isn't quite as
optimistic. ``I wanted to play him against (Arizona left-handers
Omar) Daal and (Randy) Johnson,'' Cox said. ``But I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the disabled list is a possibility unless Hunter heals
significantly in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter started Wednesday's game over Simon against the
right-handed Sean Bergman because Simon had a sore knee from his
slide home Tuesday when he scored on a Craig Biggio error. Simon
was back in the lineup Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   So long, `Eighth Wonder'
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a possible postseason trip here, Thursday
was the Braves' last game in the Astrodome, which opened in 1965 as
the ``Eighth Wonder of the World,'' the first domed stadium in
baseball. The artifical surface here is where the term
``Astroturf'' originated.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros will move into Enron Stadium, a new open-air facility
with a grass field and a retractable roof, in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as domes go, I've always enjoyed playing here,'' Cox
said. ``It really was a spectacle when it first opened, with the
scoreboard (fireworks) _ it was rocking and rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are 144-142 at the Astrodome, including 7-2 when the
Braves franchise was in Milwaukee and 38-16 since 1991. Two
pitchers who'll be sorry to see it go are Tom Glavine and Greg
Maddux. In 10 starts here since Sept. 1991, Glavine is 8-0 with a
1.35 ERA. In his career, Maddux is 9-3 in the Astrodome with a 1.85
ERA in 16 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Boone's progress
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone, who has seen his batting average dip from .288 to
.257 in June, ended an 0-for-20 streak with a double his first time
up Wednesday. It was one hit in five at-bats on the night but he
had another two hard hit balls caught in center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough stretch for me,'' Boone said. ``My swing got
a little long for some reason, but I don't feel that way now.''
</P>
<P>
   To help shorten his swing again, Boone said he approached every
pitch like it was coming with two strikes against him.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ozzie Guillen has started at shortstop for injured Walt
Weiss, his batting average has climbed from .152 to .210, helped by
his three hits Wednesday. ... Maddux's 2-for-3 night at the plate
Wednesday was his second multi-hit game of the year. He was 2-for-3
April 6 against the Phillies, including one of his two home runs
this season.

 &HT;    Stars' Hull returns to lineup, sees limited action
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Brett Hull, who presumably has a groin injury, returned
to the lineup for the Dallas Stars Thursday night, but skated only
on the team's fourth line with Benoit Hogue and Brian Skrudland.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said before the game that Hull ``is
not 100 percent but he's a heck of a lot better than he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said Hull, who missed Game 4, could not skate a full
shift because, ``It's an easy game when you're on the move all the
time. But the way these two teams play, the game is not played on
the move. There's a lot of stop and go.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Hitchcock clearly is getting all the questions about
his team's injuries, most of which have centered on Dallas's
refusal to publicly confirm that Mike Modano is playing with a
fractured hand.
</P>
<P>
   Following Thursday's skate-around, Hitchcock began to answer a
reporter's question with, ``You're assuming it's just a groin.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: ``Yeah, you're right. I shouldn't assume anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock: ``You're right. You just answered the question. You
shouldn't assume anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: ``Is there more than that?''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock: ``He might have a shoulder, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Postscript: Fox TV analyst John Davidson said Hull also was
wearing a knee brace. But we won't assume that.
</P>
<P>
   Sneak peak
</P>
<P>
   Dixon Ward has been one of Buffalo's best players in the
post-season (7 goals, five assists, plus-seven in 19 games). But
Ward came very close to being in Nashville this year, as one of the
players left unprotected during the expansion draft. The Predators
instead opted for defenseman Bob Boughner. Ward may be left
unprotected for the Thrashers June 25, but his age (30) and
contract status (one year remaining) could lead general manager Don
Waddell elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said of Ward: ``Obviously we thought
there would be a chance he would be taken (by Nashville). It's
going to happen again this year. Dixon has been a good player for
us and we're going to lose another good player. We didn't want to
lose Bob Boughner. He was kind of the heart and soul in the back
end for us. But obviously with young guys coming (up), you have got
to expose guys who you think in a year or two may not be here any
more, guys who are going to become unrestricted free agents,
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt players resented the expansion draft, Ruff
said, ``I think the players understand expansion means more jobs.
Although you're losing a teammate, players look at it that another
30 jobs have been created and two years from now another 60 jobs.
Instead of players playing four or five years, they'll probably
stretch it to eight or nine. In that sense players are happy about
expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   This was the 16th time in Stanley Cup Finals history the teams
were tied at 2-2. In the previous 15, the team that won Game 5 won
the series 12 times. The last time a team bucked the trend came in
1971, when Montreal lost the fifth game to Chicago but won the next
two. ... Buffalo's Dominik Hasek and Dallas's Ed Belfour are the
first two finals goalies in the expansion era (since 1967) to both
have sub 2.00-goals against averages through the entire playoffs.

   BEIJING _ The World Bank Thursday defended a proposed
antipoverty project in a remote northwestern region that has been
attacked by critics abroad as a threat to Tibetan culture, saying
that many objections reflected misinformation.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, for which the World Bank proposes lending China $40
million, resettling 58,000 people from an overcrowded, eroded area
in the northeastern corner of Qinghai Province to a sparsely
populated region in the province 300 miles west.
</P>
<P>
   Qinghai is geographically part of the Tibetan Plateau and was
historically settled by Tibetan and Mongolian people. But a
majority of its five million residents are ethnic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say by moving a mix of ethnic groups into the new zone,
the project will aid a Chinese policy of diluting Tibetan culture.
Forty percent of the proposed settlers would be ethnic Chinese,
along with Hui Muslims and others, including some ethnic Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   The critics also say the project, involving a small dam and
irrigation works, may threaten the environment. They add that two
nearby prison camps could be aided, in violation of World Bank
policy, and that the bank's assessment procedures have been
violated.
</P>
<P>
   But in a briefing Thursday afternoon, the bank's resident
director here, Yukon Huang, an American, said the project was a
sincere effort to aid some of China's most wretchedly poor. He said
that environmental concerns had been taken into account, that the
legal rights of minority groups would be protected and that any
effects on Tibetan culture would be negligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This involves moving people from an area of great ethnic
diversity into an area that has relatively few Tibetans,'' said
Huang, who just completed a six-day trip through the zone with
agricultural and social experts to ``double check'' the wisdom of
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The region around the proposed new irrigation area is mainly
populated by Mongolians. The immediate site is barren and used only
seasonally by 63 Mongolian herding families whose interests will be
protected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing the project has become a major cause of pro-Tibetan
groups in Europe and the United States. The critics have gained the
ear of Western politicians, and American officials have expressed
concern.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank board of governors is to consider the project on
Tuesday. China has called the criticism politically motivated, and
an American vote against the project would inflame the already
tense relations. The project needs a simple majority of votes on
the bank board, which is made up of major donors and smaller
countries formed into blocs, to proceed.

SPORTS COLUMN: BEWARE THE AILING DUVAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas)   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Keep your head down. Slow backswing. Follow
through. Those are three of golf's commandments for duffers who
want to do what the pros do, but David Duval has now created
another commandment: burn your right thumb and forefinger.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the world's No. 1-ranked golfer did a week ago
Thursday when he grabbed the handle of a teapot of boiling water on
the gas range in his new Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., home. He wasn't
sure how well he would be able to play in the 99th U.S. Open here
at Pinehurst No. 2, but after his three-under-par 67 in Thursday's
first round, look for duffers everywhere to hold a lighted match to
their right thumb and forefinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This must be the secret,'' all those duffers will be saying.
``Burn, baby, burn.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing too serious, mind you. Just enough to create small
blisters from second-degree burns. Don't forget to slice those
blisters open, as Duval did Monday. When all those duffers arrive
at their first tee this weekend, look for each one to have a strip
of white adhesive tape on both the right thumb and forefinger, as
Duval did throughout Thursday's round.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some tenderness in my forefinger,'' he acknowledged,
``but nothing bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing that kept Duval from justifying one of golf's oldest
warnings: beware the ailing golfer. Especially in the U.S. Open, a
tournament won every so often by ailing golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Venturi, wobbling with heat prostration, won in 1964 at
Congressional with a doctor watching his every step.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hogan, his legs weak and weary only 16 months after the
head-on collision with a bus on a Texas highway that nearly killed
him, won in 1950 at Merion in an 18-hole playoff with Lloyd Mangrum
and George Fazio.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Wood, wearing a corset to ease a back problem, won in 1941
at Colonial after opening with a double-bogey 7 on his first hole.
</P>
<P>
   Olin Dutra, ill with amoebic dysentery after two rounds when he
trailed by eight strokes, recovered to win in 1934 at Merion.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Guldahl, despite a two-stroke lead on the tee of what in
1937 was then a par-5 final hole at Oakland Hills, was suddenly so
nervous he turned to Harry Cooper and asked, ``What should I do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just don't drop dead,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Guldahl soon calmed down. When he got to the green, he combed
his hair before putting out from 15 feet for a par that won by two
strokes. But why had he combed his hair?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the photographers were going to take my picture,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Payne Stewart, who had to wear a neck brace for
six weeks earlier in the year because of a herniated disk in his
back, won in 1991 at Hazeltine in an 18-hole playoff with Scott
Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Now, not just another ailing golfer, but also the world's No. 1
ailing golfer, David Duval, threatens to win the Open after the
lowest of his 28 rounds dating to his Open debut as an amateur in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purely for ball-striking,'' he said, ``it's probably the best
Open round I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   With two late birdie-2's from 2 feet after a 5-iron on the
202-yard 15th hole and from 10 feet after a 7-iron on the 191-yard
17th hole, he did it like he does everything. Quietly,
unemotionally, steadily.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I try to play,'' he said with a slow smile. ``I
find it less stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   After his fingers were burned last Friday, he didn't hit balls
until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I packed, worked out, played with my cat, watched TV,'' he
said. ``That's what I did. Pretty boring, I guess, but I rather
enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until late 1997, Duval hadn't won a PGA Tour event. Now he has
won 11, but not a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that the anticipation for the first tour win was
greater than the anticipation for the first win in a major,'' he
said. ``I think when you go on tour you're not quite sure, although
I felt pretty confident about it. But as I've continued to excel
and win some tournaments, I think it's a matter of time now, so I'm
not very nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he nervous about grabbing the handle of a teapot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same old, same old,'' he said. ``Just not on gas stoves.''
</P>
<P>
   But that won't stop all those duffers from trying to burn their
fingers. Anything to help them shoot a 67 or even a 97.

VATICAN MAY NOTE JEWISH OWNER OF POPE'S CHILDHOOD HOME 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KRAKOW, Poland _ A long bypassed Jewish claim to ownership of
the childhood home of John Paul II in Wadowice, now a papal museum,
may be on the verge of official recognition after the pope
mentioned it on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Balamuth, the grandson of Yechiel Balamuth, the pope's
landlord when he was a youth who later died in a Nazi death camp,
complained that the surviving family members had been unsuccessful
in petitioning the Vatican, local church and government officials
for title to the house. They are also seeking a plaque to
commemorate the murders of the owners in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the Balamuths are Wadowiceans. We cordially remember
them,'' a town official, Stanislaw Kotarba, said when asked if a
plaque would be possible. ``Also the pope cherishes their memory.
So I can see no obstacles. There should be no fears about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The house, Kotarba said, ``belongs to Balamuth,'' adding, ``The
pope himself acknowledged it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican was more guarded Thursday, noting that a decision on
a plaque or returning the property was up to local officials.

ACCESSORIES FOR THE KENNEL TRADE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LESLEY HAZLETON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saab says its research has found that 60 percent of its American
customers are pet owners _ the highest percentage in the auto
industry. And when these Saab owners take to the road, they say
there is a good chance their Saint Bernard or Siamese will go along
for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   To make such trips safer, Saab has developed special gear, which
is available through dealers or its merchandise catalogue. The
equipment, which ranges from a $19.95 restraint that works with
existing three-point safety belts to a $49.95 leash that attaches
to Saab's cargo-track system, was developed with the Humane Society
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The society has tested, approved and licensed the equipment and
gets a 10 percent royalty on each item sold.
</P>
<P>
   Other items include a black aluminum compartment divider to
separate pets safely from cargo, a spill-proof food bowl, a
pet-travel guide and assorted packs and bags.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Janisse, a spokesman for Saab Cars USA, a unit of the
Swedish auto maker, said the gear was specifically designed for use
in Saab vehicles, though much of the equipment could be adapted for
other makes.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll Thrift, a vice president of the Humane Society of the
United States, said that while there were no data on pets injured
or killed in car accidents, dogs were particularly at risk when
improperly restrained in cars.
</P>
<P>
   He said Saab and the society were planning to expand their
efforts, especially in safety education. Expect to see the
society's pet first-aid book (issued with the American Red Cross)
added to the Saab pet-gear line, along with a pet first-aid kit.
</P>
<P>
   Thrift said the organization and the car maker were also looking
into new products, like car cages suitable for small dogs and cats.
</P>
<P>
   And Saab will get behind the society's Give Wildlife a Break
program, aimed at helping drivers avoid deer, raccoons, skunks and
other animals.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swedes make good cars. Quick. Name a Swedish automobile maker!
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you'd say Volvo, and that has a lot to do with its
distinctive image. Like them or hate them, most everybody knows
what Volvos look like, and that they have a reputation for
durability and safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the other Swedish car company is Saab. Quick! What image
comes to mind?
</P>
<P>
   You might know that Saab also makes sturdy, safe cars. But
chances are you'd be hard pressed to describe their different sort
of look. Not surprisingly, Volvo outsells Saab in the United States
by 3 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   If folks at Saab had their way, Americans would know Saabs are
reliable, spirited cars of good value. With handling that rivals
good German sedans, a fastidiousness about safety on a par with
Volvo and turbo-charged acceleration that quickens the pulse, Saabs
have a loyal _ but limited _ following.
</P>
<P>
   Since the introduction of its top-of-the-line 9-5 sedan last
year, Saab has tried to get the performance-safety-value message
across by offering stylish cars that stand out from the pack. The
goal is to give Saab an appealing identity, bolster sales and turn
a profit, something that Saab AB is about to accomplish for the
first time in years.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the company rolled out the 9-5 wagon, Saab's first
wagon in more than 20 years. And it has arrived just as the market
for sporty, midsize luxury wagons is blooming. Audi, BMW, Mercedes,
Volvo and now Saab have unveiled ``sport wagons'' aimed at buyers
who want a little more than a trunk but would rather walk than ride
in a four-wheel drive Exterminator, or whatever Detroit is calling
its latest brute ute.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-5 wagon is not just about room. While the cargo space
behind the back seats exceeds that of the BMW and Audi A6 wagons,
its turbo-charged four-cylinder engine, the base power plant, has
170 horsepower and 207 foot-pounds of torque, virtually tying the
get-up-and-go of the BMW and the Audi, and exceeding the standard
engine's in the basic Volvo V70 wagon.
</P>
<P>
   All those rivals have six-cylinder engines except Volvo, which
has five. (The Saab has an optional turbo-charged V6 that gets 200
horsepower.)
</P>
<P>
   The Saab has impressive takeoff _ maneuvering in city traffic,
accelerating onto highways and passing on country roads. Unlike
traditional turbos, there is almost no waiting from the moment you
hit the accelerator until the extra boost kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, with the standard 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine, the
maximum torque is achieved at a modest 1,800 revolutions a minute.
In other words, you can have exceptional pickup well within city
speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   When I first drove it, I did not determine if I was driving the
standard four or the optional six. After a trip into Manhattan, I
looked at the sticker hidden in the glove box and was stunned to
discover that I had been driving the smaller engine. Surely a
misprint, I thought. So I opened the hood, but there was no
mistake: only four cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   At high speeds, the Saab moved seamlessly in the twists and
turns of a country road, with almost no leaning. A firm suspension
produced neat cornering and impressive road feel. It was also
supple enough to absorb the bump and grind without jarring my back
and bones. Steering was precise and confident. Wind noise was low.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that kind of performance and handling cost dearly.
While Volvo wagons start at less than $30,000, the grander
performance machines _ BMW 528i, Audi A6 Avant _ begin at $37,000
to $41,000, and a Mercedes costs even more.
</P>
<P>
   Saab wanted to make a splash with a sticker that begins at
$32,500 with a turbo and a five-speed manual transmission. The car
I tested, which was nicely equipped with a power, glass sunroof,
in-dash CD player, leather seats and an automatic gearbox _ with
sport, winter and normal drive modes _ topped off at $35,895. Both
the front and rear seats were heated _ Swedes clearly know about
driving in winter _ and the two front seats were vented.
</P>
<P>
   Vented seats? Pay attention, this is big: Each front seat has
two fans beneath it that draw the warm air trapped between the seat
and your lower back through perforations in the leather. The
sensation was wonderfully cooling on a warm day's drive.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is also an exceptionally elegant cup holder that pops out
of the dash like a ballerina taking a bow.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere inside, Saab had good legroom and headroom. My
6-foot-5 friend could easily slide behind the wheel, which is not
always the case in cars with sunroofs. The interior also had two
trademark quirks.
</P>
<P>
   Saab made airplanes before it made cars, and its dashboards
resemble a pilot's cockpit with the instrument panel angled toward
the driver. The ignition switch, following Saab tradition, is on
the console that divides the two front seats, not on the steering
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   There are two air bags up front and two in the sides of the
front seats that are designed to cushion both the head and the
chest in side impacts. All five headrests adjust, and there are lap
and shoulder belts for every passenger. The headrests are designed
to sense a collision and automatically move forward to stabilize an
occupant's head to minimize whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   It is a very nice feature, but the headrests reduce rear
visibility. Better to borrow a page from Mercedes, which has a
button on the dash that can retract the rear headrests when they
are extended but not in use.
</P>
<P>
   The storage area in back includes a 12-volt power outlet for
tailgating. With the back seat up, the space easily accommodated my
golf bag and later a load of camping gear for two adults and three
boys. Saab offers retractable floor that extends about 18 inches
from the tailgate and allows you to load heavy, bulky items and
then roll them into the car, easing muscle strain.
</P>
<P>
   With the back seats folded down and the headrests cleverly
stowed, the hauling area exceeds 73 cubic feet, second only to the
Mercedes wagon. The tailgate is one piece, instead of the more
convenient two, but it was easy to close.
</P>
<P>
   Saab does not offer a four-wheel-drive version because its
Swedish bosses don't think Americans really need it. They're right,
of course, but Saab's American managers know that will hurt them.
Traction control, a sensible alternative that slows wheels that are
slipping and sends power to those that are gripping, is available
on Saab wagons with V6 engines. (On the camping trip, the 9-5 wagon
easily climbed the rutted, dirt road we crossed with front-wheel
drive.)
</P>
<P>
   Saab is also passing on another feature that could lift sales.
While the 9-5 wagon is engineered to accommodate a small third seat
in the rear, Saab decided against it because it believes that it is
not a safe seat for children. Right again. No wonder these guys
have always seemed a little different.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: A mainstream wagon from the folks outside the
mainstream.

LAST-MINUTE MANEUVERING BEFORE GUN-CONTROL DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Night was approaching and time was growing short to
change the hearts and minds of lawmakers as three Democrats
gathered for another of the week's relentless publicity offerings
on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   With reporters listening and a photographer snapping away, Reps.
Nita Lowey and Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Rosa DeLauro of
Connecticut began making phone calls to fellow members on Capitol
Hill, to persuade them to support the most stringent version of the
gun control proposals that finally loomed for floor debate Thursday
night _ very late Thursday night, beyond the waking attention of
most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, my friend, how are you?'' Ms. DeLauro cheerily began one
call across from Ms. Lowey, who apparently had already received a
rebuff from her target. ``No, that isn't good,'' she said somberly
into the phone.
</P>
<P>
   In making a show of their intramural lobbying, the three only
underlined the political ballet _ of building a defensible record
for the next elections _ that plays about the debate's essential
question of what to do about the national rampage of school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCarthy seemed to acknowledge the theatrical curtain that
is a ubiquitous part of Capitol politics when she looked down the
phone list and smiled mischievously at her colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Barr, anyone?'' she inquired, referring to the Georgia
lawmaker who is one of the Republicans' most scathing debaters and
dedicated supporters of the National Rifle Association. They spared
Barr and themselves a colloquy.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the debating chamber, Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., suddenly
interrupted his own words of praise for bipartisanship to dash onto
the House floor. He voted electronically in 10 seconds flat on one
of the 56 culture-debate amendments that made much of the day's
legislative business seem like a slow-motion indictment of virtual
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then up rises Dingell!'' exulted Foley, re-emerging to resume
a corridor interview and his point about the fortuitous beauty of
bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Foley was beaming at the electioneering inoculation of the gun
control debate that the Republican Party has found single-handedly
delivered by John Dingell, D-Mich., who is the respected dean of
the House. The thoroughly democratic Dingell, long an opponent of
gun control, proudly served as point man Thursday night for the
NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gephardt's got to be twisting over this,'' said Foley of the
House minority leader, Dick Gephardt. The leader has indeed had to
field endless questions about the comfort his friend and frequent
ally, Dingell, has delivered to the NRA by trying to weaken the
police checks on purchases at gun shows passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you've noticed, President Clinton has suddenly stopped
mentioning the NRA and Republicans in his criticism,'' added Foley,
judging that the Democrats have been confounded and deprived of the
slam-dunk score on gun control they were hoping to carry into the
national elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   For all the concern House members have been putting on the
record about gunfire mayhem among students, the subtext this week
of publicity offerings and corridor conversations alike has been
about the debate's crucial political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to Dingell, nobody can blame any Republican necessarily
for the failure of the gun bill,'' said Foley, grateful for
political complexity and cover even as he said he favored stronger
checks on purchases at gun shows than the Dingell proposal would
permit.
</P>
<P>
   Foley has been an active participant in the debate, scoring a
victory in the culture-war face-offs when he attacked as
unconstitutional the proposal of a Republican colleague, Henry Hyde
of Illinois, to censor entertainment violence for minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least the public will be able to say we're inching
forward,'' said Foley, accurately characterizing a debate that, for
all the storm and fury over the gun slaughter of innocents, has
been marked by low expectations among many lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels a little bit like a shell game,'' Rep. Thomas
Barrett, D-Wis., said of the melange of culture issues and gun
control options Republican leaders arranged like a political
smorgasbord. ``The amazing part for me is that we are not taking
dramatic measures here,'' added Barrett, who favored far tougher
gun controls in reaction to the school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop of limited expectations, debaters consumed
much of their time in exchanges of salvos on the relative efforts
of the gun and entertainment industries to entice the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're Gonna Die!'' blared one lurid looking advertisement for
a computer game displayed in the House. ``Why, you can download the
blood-splatter!'' complained an outraged Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., in
urging mandatory warnings about the harm these games might pose for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start 'Em Young!'' blared another advertisement, this from a
gun magazine depicting a boy fondly brandishing his first pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Families of summer tourists watched mutely from the galleries.
Fewer than a dozen lawmakers participated below in what amounted to
a time-killing passage through the day's cultural agenda to the
gun-control measures of the night.

FROM FLASH TO FOCUS FOR JACKSON
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The spotlights faded Thursday and the Lakers' newly
anointed savior retreated to the background, trading pomp and
circumstance for the nitty-gritty business of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The day after his glitzy introduction to Los Angeles, new coach
Phil Jackson spent four hours with Lakers brass, plotting the next
steps for a franchise in transition. But with Jackson due to return
to his Montana home today, the changes will have to wait a while.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson plans to return sometime next week and begin assembling
his coaching staff and planning for the June 30 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson met briefly with Lakers assistants Larry Drew and Bill
Bertka but has yet to speak with outgoing coach Kurt Rambis. All
three want to join his staff, but Jackson wants to speak with them
all at length before making any decisions. Former Jackson
assistants Tex Winter, Jim Cleamons, Jimmy Rodgers and Frank
Hamblen all remain in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   All indications are that Jackson will make his hires soon after
returning to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Jackson was introduced Thursday to other new
members of the Lakers family, the downtown Staples Center and the
new practice facility in El Segundo. He toured both construction
sites with executive vice president Jerry West and general manager
Mitch Kupchak.
</P>
<P>
   The trio also had lunch with owner Jerry Buss and spent time
watching the workouts of two pro prospects _ Quincy Lewis of
Minnesota and Stais Boseman, formerly of USC.
</P>
<P>
   Several personnel issues face the new coach and Lakers brass,
from shoring up the power forward position to tabbing a starting
point guard to settling the contract situations of Glen Rice and
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has an opt-out clause but has financial incentive to stay
and now has Jackson, a coach he's eager to play for. O'Neal has
four years and $81 million remaining on his contract but would only
be able to make a starting salary of $11 million with another team
under the NBA's new labor deal.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, O'Neal could choose to opt out and re-sign for up
to seven years with the Lakers. He would sacrifice a few million in
the first four years of the deal but would gain long-term security
_ up to $151 million over seven years, an average of $21.66 million
per year.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal has until June 25 to exercise his option, but the Lakers
feel he will stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is the place for him,'' Kupchak said. ``I think
he believes that. Subjectively speaking, I don't think he can
continue to run from team to team. Sooner or later, you've got to
plant a tent and say, `I'm going to be here with Phil for five
years, seven years, whatever.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have until July 1 to exercise a one-year, $7.1
million option on Rice, who prefers to become a free agent and
negotiate a new deal starting at the maximum of $14 million. He
might still be used in a sign-and-trade deal to obtain a point
guard or power forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Glen, there's really only one thing we can do,'' Kupchak
said. ``If we don't exercise the option, then we risk losing him
for nothing. I don't know why we'd do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under NBA rules, the Lakers can't discuss new contracts with
Rice or O'Neal or free agents Derek Fisher, J.R. Reid, Rick Fox and
Ruben Patterson until July 1. New deals cannot be announced or
signed until Aug. 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Gore returned to New York as an official candidate
for President Thursday, hoping to reverse the fortunes of his last
such outing, in 1988, when the state's primary drove him from the
race and frayed his relations with his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent that New York race in the shadow of Mayor Ed Koch,
his exuberant booster. The vice president's campaign hopes that if
he ends up this time in the shadow of Hillary Rodham Clinton and
her likely run for the Senate, it will work to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to the Republicans' beating up on her,'' Tony
Coelho, Gore's campaign manager, told reporters. ``I know she won't
be happy to hear me say that, but they will beat up on her so much
so that you're going to have a lot of women in New York and a lot
of women all over the country who are going to deeply resent what
they say and how they say it. And as a result of that, we are going
to benefit as a party, and Al and Tipper Gore will benefit because
of what the Republicans try to do to Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho said Mrs. Clinton ``can stand on her own and she can be
tough and she will be very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said, ``I encourage the Republicans to take her
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was not eager Thursday to discuss the assessment of some
political analysts that a candidacy by the first lady would compete
with the Gore campaign for cash in a state that customarily
bankrolls Democratic presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already addressed that issue,'' Gore told reporters on a
flight to New York from New Hampshire. Of Mrs. Clinton's candidacy,
he said, ``I'm all for it,'' and added, without elaborating, that
he thought it would help him because it would ``generate
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore appears better situated this time around than in 1988 to
capture New York's delegates to the Democratic nominating
convention next year. At two fund-raising events at the Pierre
Hotel Thursday night, Gore was expected to pull in $900,000 from
about 800 people.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1988, he demonstrated little appeal outside the South.
Then in a bruising New York primary, he alienated Jews and blacks
and ended up with 10 percent of the vote, losing to Gov. Michael
Dukakis, the eventual nominee, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's sole rival this time around for the Democratic nomination
is former Sen. Bill Bradley, who is from neighboring New Jersey
and, perhaps more important, was a star player for the champion New
York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Adler, a Democratic consultant, said that Gore had lined
up endorsements from most of the state's leading Democrats and
that, barring some unforeseen circumstance, he expected they would
activate their machines for Gore next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee Miringhoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public
Opinion, said his most recent poll, in March, showed that while
Gore was leading Bradley in New York by 47 percent to 30 percent,
he saw room for growth. ``I assume, given that Bradley is doing
better nationally than he was at that point, that New York is now
within striking distance for Bradley,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls from Quinnipiac College show that New York
voters view Gore and Bradley equally favorably _ 43 percent have a
favorable opinion of both. But where 24 percent view Gore
unfavorably, only 6 percent view Bradley unfavorably, although 40
percent say they do not know Bradley, while only 9 percent do not
know Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a state Bradley will focus on because it's a good state
for him, potentially,'' Miringhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it was unclear at this point what effect Mrs.
Clinton's likely entry into the Senate race would have on Gore but
that so far it had completely overshadowed the presidential race
among New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Gore is not punching through,'' Miringhoff said.
``The fact that these other questions are out there _ if Hillary is
running and can't campaign for him, it's sinking Gore's chances _
shows he's not holding down a lot of real estate. He's not defining
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore mentioned none of this Thursday as he held an outdoor rally
under gray skies on Wall Street, where hundreds of people jammed
into the intersection at Nassau Street in front of Federal Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeated the official campaign announcement he first gave
on Wednesday in Tennessee, highlighting his own moral authority,
his proposals to make preschool available to everyone and his
promise to help parents save for college tuition. He also claimed
Thursday, as he has for months, a special knowledge that would
enable him to continue the economic expansion of the last eight
years. ``I know what works,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was on Wall Street, he also gave a nod _ twice _ to the
role of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, the former co-chairman of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., in creating the economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, he promised to keep Internet commerce free
of international taxes. In just four years, more than $1.4 trillion
has been spent on goods through cyberspace. ``I want to keep the
Internet a duty-free, global free-trading zone,'' he said.

AIRLINES OFFER PASSENGERS SOME REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Ore.)  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's airlines on Thursday appeared to slow
the momentum for ``passengers' rights'' laws by announcing a
package of modest reforms, including offering customers who call
for tickets the lowest fare for which they are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement at a Capitol Hill news conference won praise
from the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee and the chairman
and ranking minority member of its aviation subcommittee, who had
been backing such laws. But other members of Congress called the
promises vague and said some areas were not addressed, including
notice of overbooking.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are promising that by later this year they will
notify passengers of delays, cancellations and diversions whenever
they can, ``make every reasonable effort'' to deliver lost bags
within 24 hours, and designate an executive to answer such
complaints within 60 days. They also said they would support an
increase in their liability for lost bags, from the $1,250 that has
been in force since 1984. They did not specify a figure, but
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said he wanted the figure
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard the bell ring, we have felt the whip,'' Gerald
Greenwald, chairman of the industry's trade association and the
chief executive of United Airlines, said in announcing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers said the announcement Thursday was at least a
partial cure. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is chairman of the
Commerce Committee and a co-author of one passenger rights bill,
congratulated Greenwald on ``some very significant steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines, including Continental and United, said they would
have to adjust certain practices, notably to conform with a promise
to hold reservations for 24 hours at no charge. But many airlines
said the new commitments were a confirmation of existing practices.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and others listed several issues that they said should
still be addressed, including telling passengers when flights were
overbooked.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's co-sponsor, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said airlines
should have to tell more about frequent flier programs. The
airlines promised to issue annual reports, but Wyden said that
among other steps, he wanted information on how many seats on each
flight were available for customers trying to spend frequent flier
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is a system for auditing the airlines' compliance.
Some lawmakers want regular reports from the government, but the
airlines are resisting.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Slater said, ``I'm glad to see that
under some pressure, and proposed legislation by the administration
and Congress, airlines have decided to put the passengers first.''
</P>
<P>
   At the American Society of Travel Agents, Paul Rudin, the senior
vice president, described the promises as ``a string of zzzz's.''
Referring to the promise to quote callers the lowest fare, he said,
``The top item is, `We're going to tell you the truth.'''
</P>
<P>
   David Messing, a spokesman for Continental, said, ``We see a lot
of the value coming from the standardization that this achieves
between airlines.'' Passengers will know what they can expect,
which is good for the industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At American Airlines, Chris Chiames, a spokesman, said the
airline was reviewing many aspects of its operation. In general, he
said, airline ticket agents are trained to listen to a customer and
respond to the questions asked. ``Unprompted, they might not say,
`If you can leave two hours later, I can get you a better fare,'''
Chiames said.
</P>
<P>
   Continental will have to change a practice to conform with a new
policy that will allow customers to hold a telephone reservation
without payment for 24 hours or cancel a ticket within that period
without penalty. The policy is meant to allow comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   On holding reservations, Messing said, ``We'll do that now, but
the fare isn't guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   The package includes only the most limited action on two issues
of great concern to business travelers: ``back to back'' ticketing
and ``hidden city'' ticketing. In the former, a traveler making a
quick round trip buys two round-trip tickets, each including a
Saturday night stay-over, to get the benefit of the discounts that
airlines offer for such trips. The traveler then throws away half
of each round-trip ticket and completes the journey for less cost
than buying one full-fare round trip. In the second practice,
travelers bound for a hub airport can sometimes fly there more
cheaply by buying a ticket that includes a stop there, and simply
walking off the airplane at what is supposed to be an intermediate
stop.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines retaliate by canceling the remaining reservations
of a passenger who skips some segments. Under the changes, the
industry will disclose its policies on back-to-back and hidden city
ticketing.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ Most every story told about New York Knicks forward
Latrell Sprewell has a familiar ring to it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter what he does, Sprewell always will be remembered for
throttling his coach. Sprewell's choking of Golden State coach P.J.
Carlesimo in late 1997 and subsequent 68-game suspension have been
well-documented, so it's understandable almost everyone associates
the fiery 6-5 Knick with that incident.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has followed Sprewell, 28, for years. His history
includes numerous confrontations with teammates, like when he went
after Jerome Kersey with a two-by-four when the two were teammates
with the Warriors in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   But with New York playing the San Antonio Spurs in Game 2 of the
NBA Finals tonight at the Alamodome, Sprewell hopes his play with
the Knicks has erased at least some of the negative perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that has,'' Sprewell said. ``I think that for some
people, this has changed (their perception). They probably heard a
bunch of stuff that wasn't true, and now that they've had an
opportunity to see myself and the team, and the way that I've
played, I think that's changed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some people are always going to say I'm a bad guy and
some people are going to always think that I'm a bad guy, but I
think that's just something I'm going to have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with the Knicks in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation for trouble surfaced again recently when Sports
Illustrated published an article that shot down the notion Sprewell
and Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy have settled their differences and
are getting along. The story reported Sprewell will demand a trade
next season should the Knicks keep Van Gundy as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said that,'' Sprewell said Thursday. ``Something like
that at this point I don't know what to say about it. I don't know
who put it out there. What can you say? Maybe my name sells papers
or Sports Illustrateds or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell did not dodge the questions, even though he easily
could have refused to answer anything unrelated to the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that with everything I've had to go through, dealing
with the media because of the suspension and everything, has kind
of prepared me for what I'm going through right now,'' Sprewell
said. ``Do I enjoy it? Well I'm getting better at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurs point guard Avery Johnson, who is friendly with Sprewell,
understands why Sprewell seems to always be answering such
questions. Johnson's introduction to Sprewell was less than
desirable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, my first impression of him was that in my first practice
he got in a fight with Byron Houston,'' Johnson said of Sprewell,
with whom he played with the Warriors in the 1992-93 season. ``I
had just signed that day, so I was like, `Man, what am I in for?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard some things about him, but going to that practice
and seeing those guys really get into it like they did, I said,
`Man .' But after things settled down, he and I really developed a
good relationship over the course of the year. We spent a lot of
time together, and I found out that he really loved the game of
basketball just as much as I do. So we developed a great
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Sprewell has done with his Knicks teammates _ even
though it took time. Sprewell, a former All-Star, looked like
anything but early this season, but he has come around, one of the
main reasons the Knicks are in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what his athletic ability is, what he's capable of
doing,'' said Knicks assistant coach Don Chaney. ``The reason why
he is so productive now is that he is playing within the framework
of the team concept. In other words, he's doing his thing, but he's
also involving everybody else. Early on, I thought he was just
doing his thing and was sort of blind to the other guys. Not on a
selfish note, that was just his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's learning that other guys are capable of scoring as
well and he can make them better by dishing and drawing attention
to the defense. I think he's really developing into a complete
player. To me, the true makings of a superstar is when you can
involve and make everybody else better. It's good to make yourself
better; you have the God-given talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put up numbers. But when you can get numbers and help
other guys get numbers, to me, then you're in the superstar
category.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's putting them up as a starter now, after coming off the
bench for much of the regular season. Sprewell disagreed with that
role, and often spoke his mind when asked about it. But if there's
one thing life's lessons have taught Sprewell, it's acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've accepted my role because I know that's the way it is
going to be; I can't change it,'' Sprewell said this week. ``So I
mean, that's just the way it is. You know some things in life and
some things you can't change, you just have to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means Sprewell also accepts that he will be treated like
public enemy No. 1 almost everywhere he goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I use to help me get going,'' Sprewell said
with a smile. ``When the fans are all over you, the other team
knows that you're pretty good. It puts the pressure on you to make
something happen. I want to hopefully try to quiet them.''

MARKET PLACE: STOCK OF 3COM, MAKER OF PALM PILOT, IS SAGGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATT RICHTEL with SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a trade show presentation a few weeks ago, Dr. Robert
Metcalfe, a co-founder of 3Com Corp., and Eric Benhamou, the chief
executive, engaged in a brief discussion over who was older.
Metcalfe, it turned out, was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Benhamou told the crowd, ``but I'm aging faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The embattled executive whose job it is to infuse new life into
3Com's maturing products has reason to feel that he has added a few
years and gray hairs in recent months. The once-ballyhooed company
stunned investors with a weak earnings report in March, and many
analysts say 3Com must find an overall focus for its diverse
businesses and manage its products better if it is to regain its
old momentum and reputation as a high-growth company.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the company splits its attention among four distinct
product lines: modems, Palm Pilot handheld organizers, adapter
boards that hook computers to the Internet, and network equipment
for big corporations and communications carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, 3Com plans to announce that it is starting yet another
business, one that would provide wireless phones, pagers and
advanced handheld computers with access to Internet data, including
news, stock quotes and sports scores.

<P>
   The new venture, called Opensky, in one respect is the most
radical departure yet for 3Com. While other 3Com businesses involve
selling hardware, Opensky will be a service provider. At the same
time, it may signal that the popular Palm Pilot will become the
centerpiece of a newly defined 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even investors who see the Palm Pilot and supporting
businesses as the company's possible savior have grown impatient
with the company's disappointing stock performance. The big blow
came in March when 3Com acknowledged that fully 45 percent of its
business was in sectors that were no longer growing. The previous
month, the company announced that it was cutting the prices of the
Palm Pilot, a move that will eat into profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has plunged, closing Thursday at $28.0625, well off
the $51.125 it hit in late December. The slipping stock price has
led to speculation that the company might be sold in whole or in
parts.
</P>
<P>
   3Com is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday, and
the Wall Street consensus calls for 23 cents a share. That would be
down from 24 cents a share the previous quarter, which in turn was
down sharply from 35 cents three months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company's bread and butter remains enterprise networking
equipment, like routers, hubs and switches, which represent about
40 percent of overall revenue. The good news is that revenue in
this unit continues to grow 10 percent to 20 percent a year, said
Paul Johnson, senior technology stock analyst with BancBoston
Robertson Stephens. 3Com makes it difficult to verify such
estimates because it does not discuss performance by individual
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The other businesses present far greater management challenges.
Perhaps the most intriguing is the Palm Pilot. Though it is getting
some competition from Microsoft and Psion, Palm is a clear industry
leader, with more than 65 percent of the worldwide market for
personal companion devices in 1998, according to IDC, a market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Pilot generates only about 10 percent of the $5.8
billion in revenue that 3Com is on track to report for this fiscal
year, but it is in a sexy category (certainly sexier than a router
or a hub) that could be used to enhance shareholder value. In
recent interviews, Benhamou has played up the Pilot, saying 3Com
intends to define it as a platform for Internet connectivity and as
a symbol of the company's commitment to ``connect people and
organizations to information.'' Indeed, this appears to be his
explanation of the rubric that defines 3Com, and he has said that
``the soul of the company is all about'' networking.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have not been impressed. ``That's a little amorphous,''
Johnson of BancBoston said about Benhamou's explanation. ``You
still have to sell something.'' Still, Johnson says the stock could
hit $50 by the end of the year if the company lives up to its
potential.
</P>
<P>
   For the Opensky project, 3Com is joining with Aether
Technologies, a small wireless technology developer, and declined
to say how much it is investing. Michael Dolbec, a 3Com vice
president for business development, said the effort was meant to
encourage sales of hand-held devices like the Palm Pilot. (Opensky
will also support competitors' devices, including those based on
Microsoft's Windows CE operating system.)
</P>
<P>
   The Opensky deal may end speculation that 3Com might spin off
all or part of its Palm Pilot unit. Analysts say that such a move
could mean a short-term boon to the stock price but would be offset
by a loss of control. ``If I were in their shoes, and I weren't
breaking the company up, the last thing I'd want to sell is Palm,''
said Luke T. Szymczak of Prudential Securities. ``There's a lot of
good stuff happening there.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a more lucrative alternative would be to sell the unit
that makes products for telecommunications companies and big
corporate customers. That business could be attractive to makers of
communications gear.
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer options for modems, which represent fully 20
percent of 3Com's revenue. The company got into the field in 1997
by buying U S Robotics, the world's leading maker of modems, which
connect computers to the Internet through telephone dial-up
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Even 3Com has conceded that the once red-hot modem business is
losing out to higher-speed connections, like cable-based Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, 3Com has said that its business in adapter boards,
which are used to connect personal computers to a network, is in a
mature market and facing stiff competition from the likes of Intel.
</P>
<P>
   But the company contends that it is regenerating. In March, the
company said it had reduced its inventory 36 percent in the last
year, while cutting long-term debt 15 percent and raising cash on
hand to $1.7 billion from $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company only hopes that the wireless network and the
financial figures to be released Tuesday will steady the nerves of
a few more investors. Then, perhaps, Benhamou's aging process will
steady, too.

   KACANIK, Yugoslavia _ The two Black Hawk helicopters had not
been in the air more than a few minutes on Thursday afternoon when
the order came to check out a report that the Kosovo Liberation
Army had set up a roadblock outside a hamlet called Pagonavic.
</P>
<P>
   As one hovered overhead, the other landed in a river gully, and
eight soldiers from the second platoon, Company C, 307th Engineer
Battalion of the 82d Airborne Division lumbered out not more than a
100 feet from a makeshift checkpoint at a small bridge. Rifles held
across their waists, they made their way to the road in a ragged
column.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Orlando L. Tagaloquin Jr., the platoon leader,
stopped short of three men and reached out to shake their hands.
They were dressed in civilian clothes but stood beneath the
red-and-black flag of the Kosovo Liberation Army. They did not
understand a word he was saying. So like a tourist lost in a
foreign land, he resorted to gesturing emphatically, pointing to
his rifle and loudly asking if they had their own.
</P>
<P>
   They shook their heads, but he ordered his men to search a hut
at the end of the bridge anyway. There they found three AK-47's,
hidden under a chair. Tagaloquin then pointed to the rifles, to
himself and to the sky. ``What I was trying to say,'' he explained
later, ``was, `These are going with me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Within 15 minutes, the second platoon was gone aboard its Black
Hawk. The checkpoint was still there, though for the time unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's operation in Kosovo entered its sixth day, patrols
like Tagaloquin's have become critical to expanding the security
presence NATO commanders pledged to provide. With no agreement yet
for disbanding the Kosovo Liberation Army, the patrols have become
a cat-and-mouse game with the rebels for preeminence, especially in
villages and towns dominated by Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a third of the 50,000 troops NATO will eventually
deploy in Kosovo having arrived so far, NATO officials have
acknowledged the limits of their reach, something that Serbian
civilians have cited as they flee Kosovo in fear of retribution
from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 3,000 American troops who have arrived in Kosovo _
including soldiers from the Army's 82d Airborne and First Infantry
Division and the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit _ are slowly
expanding their control over what will become the American sector
in the southeast part of the province. From two hilltop bases about
10 miles apart, the Army and Marines have begun to extend their
presence beyond the main roads and cities. ``It's really just a
show of force,'' Lt. Robert J. Schexnayder, commander of air
operations for the Army's contingent in Kosovo, said. In most
cases, the rebl army has got there first.
</P>
<P>
   From Pagonavic, the second platoon flew to Kacanik, a
predominantly Albanian town that until the last day or two was
deserted. One after the other, the Black Hawks landed on a field in
the town's center, and the members of the second platoon climbed
down, lying in a defensive circle as a small crowd of Albanians
gathered nearby on a foot bridge to watch the helicopters leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``One. Two. Three. Four.'' Capt. Terrence L. Johnson, the
company's deputy operations officer, began to count the men on the
bridge wearing the uniforms or berets of the army of Albanian
rebels. ``Two more back there,'' he said as the platoon climbed a
berm to the city's main road. ``That's six. Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   As they rounded an apartment building, Sgt. James R. Kettner
barked at Pvt. Second Class Jacob E. Nelson to be mindful of
snipers. No one in the village seemed threatening, and most
Albanians have welcomed the American and NATO troops like
liberating heroes, but Thursday's patrol came a day after the
Marines stopped a company of rebels, detained their leaders and
seized a cache of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After crossing over a bridge and then circling back underneath
it, the platoon moved into the city's center. As they rounded a
corner, they encountered another rebel position, this one manned by
uniformed, but unarmed rebels. A banner strung across the street
and inscribed with the rebel force's Albanian initials said, ``Mire
Se Vini,'' or ``Welcome.''

 INSCRIPTION AT TOMB WILL HONOR VIETNAM MIAs  
 (af)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans missing in action from the Vietnam War
will be honored by an inscription on an empty crypt at the Tomb of
the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery, the Pentagon said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The inscription will read, ``Honoring and keeping faith with
America's missing servicemen,'' Under Secretary of Defense Rudy De
Leon said in announcing that no new remains from Vietnam would be
interred at the tomb for now, or perhaps ever.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes a year after a few pieces of bone
interred at the tomb in 1984 to honor the unknown dead from Vietnam
were identified as those of 1st Lt. Michael J. Blassie, whose Air
Force plane was shot down on May 11, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Since the disinterment of Blassie's remains in May 1998, for
reburial near his boyhood home outside St. Louis, there have been
discussions within the Pentagon on what to do about the now-empty
Vietnam War crypt. It had been known for months that Defense
Department officials were leaning against placing a new set of
remains there, since scientists can now identify even the tiniest
human remnants through DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   American remains found in the rice paddies or jungles of
Southeast Asia are taken to the Army's Central Identification
Laboratory in Hawaii, which now has more than 120 sets of remains
and hopes to identify each eventually.
</P>
<P>
   De Leon acknowledged the advances in science when he was asked
if there were any remains at the laboratory that were positively
unidentifiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there is no candidate,'' he said. ``Indeed, given
the advances in science, and with the commitment to a full
accounting'' of the missing, it is possible that the Vietnam War
crypt will be forever empty.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of Blassie's bones left the remains of three
servicemen at the Tomb of the Unknowns _ one each from World War I,
World War II and the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   De Leon said Defense Secretary William S. Cohen would dedicate
the new inscription on the Vietnam crypt on Sept. 17, the date when
American prisoners of war and missing in action are honored.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Greer, who works in the Pentagon office dealing with
missing servicemen, said that at last count, 2,060 from the Vietnam
War remained unaccounted for.

COLUMBINE (Phoenix) _ Brooks Brown would rather be identified as
the best debater in Phoenix this week than as the controversial
friend of the two Littleton, Colorado gunmen. But as he stood
outside the Tempe conference room where he is competing in the
national high school debate championships, even the Arizona heat
couldn't distract him from thinking about that cold day when he
lost four of his friends. He's one of 2,300 high school students
participating in the National Forensic League's Desert Sun National
Speech and Debate Tournament this week. This year he's the
tournament's best-known competitior _ for reasons he and his
teammates would rather forget. Brown even selected Columbine as a

OK (Undated) _ More than a century after the gun smoke cleared,
Americans still are fascinated. Movies, books, Web sites _ all
still wrestle with the enduring controversy surrounding one of the
most famous shootouts in the Wild West. The gunfight at the OK
Corral in Tombstone took 27 seconds and about 30 shots. Three
people died. Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp were arrested but never
tried. Until now. Next week, prominent Arizona attorneys and judges

or the OK Bathhouse, the Old West's most famous gunfight might not
have become so famous. And thanks to the fuzziness of contemporary

 &HT;    Four tied atop Open

<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ That's it, fellas. That's the end of the grace
period. No more flying the ball at the flagstick and finding soft
surroundings. Forget the flop shot and return to the bump-and-run.
The sun is finally out at Pinehurst No. 2, which is firming up as
we speak, and birdies are about to become scarce around here as
skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the bad news for the field of 156 players in the 99th
U.S. Open. Even with No. 2 at its most defenseless in Thursday's
first round _ receptive greens, wimpy rough and hardly a breath of
wind _ only 23 players broke par.
</P>
<P>
   Four players share the lead at 3-under-par 67 _ David Duval,
Phil Mickelson, Billy Mayfair and Paul Goydos _ and most of them
probably would take even-par from here on in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf course played as easy as it will play because of the
rain,'' Mickelson said, ``but it's a tribute to the golf course to
how difficult it is, because there aren't really any low scores....
It's not a golf course where 4-, 5- or 6-under even enters your
mind.... I think we're going to be in for a long weekend if the
greens were to dry out.''
</P>
<P>
   One shot off the lead, the mix really becomes interesting. With
68s were Tiger Woods, Dave Berganio Jr., 1991 champion Payne
Stewart, Japan's Kaname Yokoo and John Daly.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus' Larry Mize was in group at 69 that included PGA
champion Vijay Singh, former Marietta resident Bob Tway, Jim Furyk
and Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Island's Davis Love III opened with an even-par 70, shooting
2-under on the back nine despite two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Lee Janzen had a 74 _ four shots better than
Jack Nicklaus, playing in his 43rd Open.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's Bryce Molder, appearing in his first event with
the world's top professionals, managed a respectable 73, three
shots better than teammate Matt Kuchar, who struggled after
double-bogeying his first hole.
</P>
<P>
   Of the leaders, Mickelson's story is the most compelling. With
wife Amy two weeks from delivery back in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
Mickelson has pledged to exit Pinehurst regardless where he stands,
if she unexpectedly goes into labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very fortunate to be able to have a child,'' Mickelson
said. ``We thought we were going to have problems and it came very
easily. That's something I don't want to miss. I have a once in a
lifetime opportunity to be there, whereas the U.S. Open takes place
every year. . . It's not worth a tournament. This is the most
important thing as far as our family is concerned and she will call
me and let me know. I'll be very disappointed if she were to go
into labor and not call me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson has a beeper in the bag, with caddie Jim MacKay of
Athens standing by for alarming sounds. The jet is at the airport,
ready to taxi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a little code in case somebody calls (the number)
accidentally or gets a wrong number and beeps us accidentally,''
Mickelson said. ``So if she punches in that code, I'm getting out.
I'm getting a car as soon as I can and getting to the airport. . .
I figure I'll have about five hours and 15 minutes from the time I
get the beep and I arrive at the hospital . .I've got a plane
standing by and, as you know, I'm a pilot. I've got my co-pilot
ready to file (the flight plan), and we'll go.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after burning his right thumb and forefinger on a hot
pot, Duval heated up his game. He went to 3-under with a masterful
fade 7-iron at the 191-yard, par-3 17th and a 10-footer for birdie.
Steadier than the barometer, the former Georgia Tech player made
three birdies and no bogeys. The nearly clean cuffs of his white
slacks told the story -- only two missed fairways from the world's
no. 1-ranked player.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can hit it in the fairway and not 3-putt this week,''
said Duval, ``I think I'll be in here Sunday night talking to you,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from closing birdies at 17 and 18, Woods mostly continued
the scrambling act he displayed in an impressive win at the
Memorial, posting his best first-round score in five U.S. Opens by
six shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw me play today,'' said Woods, ``you'd say there's no
way he could have shot the number he shot. It was not a pretty
round, but I scored.''
</P>
<P>
   The forecast for the next couple of days is for sunny, warm
conditions. No. 2 will play shorter, but with sharper angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If if firms up,'' said Duval, ``I don't think you're going to
see too may balls close to the hole.

WHEN THE BOSS TUMBLES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Ariz.)   (af)  
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My boss is in trouble. Last November, my third month as a fellow
at the Harvard Divinity School, Ronald F. Thiemann, who brought me
to the school, abruptly stepped down as dean to take an
unexplained, and much whispered about, sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his sudden departure emerged last month. It was
reported that Thiemann had been asked to resign after pornographic
images were found on the Harvard-owned computer he used in his
Harvard-owned home when he asked Harvard technicians to add more
memory.
</P>
<P>
   In his 13 years as dean, Thiemann, an ordained Lutheran
minister, had quadrupled the school's endowment and strengthened
its faculty, hiring such luminaries as Cornel West. Yet after the
reports last month, he was pilloried in the national and campus
press and was no longer seen on the Harvard campus. Thiemann, on
leave, has had no comment on the episode.
</P>
<P>
   My quandary will seem familiar to anyone who has had a boss
tumble into some form of public embarrassment _ the chief executive
who is discovered to have been cheating on a spouse, say, or one
who draws unwanted attention by being drunk in public. Do I stand
by someone who has done his job well _ in this case, defend
Thiemann's right to view whatever he wants to in the privacy of his
own home? Or do I decry the man as someone who, because of his
station, should be held to some higher standard?
</P>
<P>
   The decision in such instances ought to ride on whether the
person being knocked from his pedestal really did anything wrong.
Particularly when it comes to sex, organizations often uphold
higher standards than what the rest of us _ aware of our own
foibles _ care to impose. (How else to explain President Clinton's
rising poll numbers during the impeachment proceedings?)
</P>
<P>
   Reports about Thiemann indicated that none of the images on his
computer involved children and there was no suggestion that any
laws had been broken. So issues of right and wrong quickly became
squishy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's widespread disagreement about the morality of
pornography even among feminists,'' says Janet Jakobsen, an
assistant professor of religious studies at the University of
Arizona, and, like me, a fellow at the Divinity School's Center for
the Study of Values in Public Life.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in 1990, Harvard's Fogg Art Museum proudly exhibited
Robert Mapplethorpe photographs, which some people consider
pornographic, and a CD-ROM of Mapplethorpe's works is among the
holdings at the Lamont Library in Harvard Yard, available for
public viewing.
</P>
<P>
   From the reports, it is hard to see a reason for Thiemann to
have been forced out _ except, perhaps, his having been caught
simultaneously in the undertow of two cultural bogeymen: sex and
the Internet. Would Neil L. Rudenstine, Harvard's president, have
asked for Thiemann's resignation if graphic magazines had been
found in a desk that the dean sent out for refurbishing by
university workers? What if illegal reproductions of copyrighted
paintings had been found on his computer?
</P>
<P>
   Word of such an incident would have been unlikely even to make
its way to Rudenstine. But word of sexual images on a computer,
coupled with a man who bespeaks values in society and _ bam _
Thiemann is banned in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue raised has less to do with computers or
pornography than it does with scale and fairness. People should be
punished for their actions and not for the positions they hold.
</P>
<P>
   So what do I do now that my boss has crashed and burned in a
very public way? It is a problem that any worker has a decent
chance of facing, because bosses, being people, are imperfect. I
considered my choices: If I truly thought the dean's actions were
immoral, then I should join in the pillorying. But if I believed
the university's reaction was rooted in embarrassment that the dean
got caught, I should say that as well.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what I'm saying _ namely, that the incident was
remarkable only because it was embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   Thiemann's behavior had no impact, as far as I could tell, on
his ability to do his job. It was only after the embarrassment of
the reports that things went awry.
</P>
<P>
   Because someone embarrasses us is no reason to condemn him. You
have to wonder about the values of people who do. &QL;

THE FALL OF GOLIATH 30 YEARS AGO FOREVER CHANGED TWO WRESTLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For eight minutes, they locked into the most meaningful
wrestling match held in this country. Nearly 30 years of separation
have followed.
</P>
<P>
   In all that time, Dan Gable and Larry Owings have hardly spoken.
They competed once more, but they've never gotten past the
perfunctory takedowns and reversals. They prefer it this way.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives, once so closely intertwined, need distance; not
just to show proper respect, but to exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever did sit down and talk with him and become close with
him, it would take the edge off my life that I want there,'' Gable
said, in Seattle this week for the U.S. freestyle wrestling world
team trials. ``It's an edge that keeps me going every day.''
</P>
<P>
   On a snowy night in 1970, Gable lost.
</P>
<P>
   This was a news bulletin everywhere. Wrestling wasn't that big
with the American sporting public, but Gable was. And he lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the 142-pound finals of the NCAA Championships at
Northwestern, Iowa State's Gable stepped onto the mat with an 181-0
record and came in second, falling 13-11 to Owings, an Oregon
teenager competing for the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This happened after Gable had taped a spot for ABC's Wide World
of Sports, 30 minutes before the match, imploring viewers to tune
to the replay a week later.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had me say, `Come watch me next week finish my career
182-0,''' he said. ``Obviously they couldn't use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the two wrestlers still see each other as larger than
life, almost as spiritual influences.
</P>
<P>
   Gable, 50, is one of three national team coaches piecing
together the American wrestling team for the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, Australia. Owings, 48, is facilities director for the
Molalla School District, a half-hour southeast of Portland, near
his original hometown.
</P>
<P>
   They have less hair and more pounds. Their middle-aged aching
joints, or, in Gable's case, new joints, are testament to the
physical sacrifices that were required. They are healthy enough to
take part in the occasional mat workout, but well past their prime.
</P>
<P>
   That one night in Evanston, Ill., shaped their lives forever,
but not necessarily as one might have expected.
</P>
<P>
   The setback would only drive the maniacal Gable to greater
heights, assuring him legendary status as both wrestler and coach.
</P>
<P>
   Owings, however, had peaked. He would never wrestle
internationally, never make it to the Olympics, never even win
another NCAA title. He's still not sure the Gable victory was
totally worth it. Along the way, he lost his identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known what was going to come, I don't know if I would
have beat him or not,'' he said. ``It was a culture shock going
from underdog to a person everybody is shooting for. I went from
nobody to celebrity. It was very difficult for me to adjust to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dealt with criticism better.''
</P>
<P>
   In Stillwater, Okla., one of the more popular items at the
Wrestling Hall of Fame is a tape of the 1970 Owings-Gable match.
People come to see the fall of Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   As shy and introverted as Owings might claim he is, he shrewdly
calculated his moves leading up to the 1970 NCAAs. He won the
then-Pac-8 championship at 158 pounds, but dropped two weight
classes specifically to face Gable. This was no secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interviewed by Sports Illustrated before the meet and he
(the writer) asked me why I would be so stupid to cut weight and
come down and meet Gable,'' Owings recalled. ``I looked him right
in the eye and said, `I'm going to beat him.' I remember the guy;
his jaw fell open, he was speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Gable. He started obsessing about Owings, watching all of
his matches, wondering who he was. Gable had beaten Owings, a high
schooler at the time, at the Olympic trials two years earlier. But
this wasn't the same guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically said he was going to whip me,'' Gable said.
``When somebody is direct and bold like that, it diverts your
attention. Nobody had said that to me before.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Owings, ``I always had this thing that if someone had
beaten me, I wanted a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a crowd of 8,500 at Northwestern's McGaw Hall, Owings
scored three takedowns and four escapes. He used a fireman's carry,
getting a shoulder under Gable, and a double-arm bar, letting his
shoulder go limp to free himself from Gable.
</P>
<P>
   During the match, the great Gable felt tired and sluggish, which
was unusual. He remembers the crowd making gestures and getting on
him. He twice lost contact lenses. He even was called for stalling,
another first.
</P>
<P>
   Gable still led 11-9 with 25 seconds left. He tried to put
Owings away. He got greedy. Owings escaped twice _ and made
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat him mentally, not physically,'' Owings said. ``I didn't
take that approach, it just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Kraft, Northwestern senior athletic director and former
wrestling coach, was on the sideline, working as a broadcaster for
ABC's delayed telecast. He saw a classic. He wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it would have kept going and going,'' Kraft said. ``It
was so exciting and had so much drama. I wanted it to last another
10 minutes. I knew what it meant. I think it had more impact on
amateur wrestling than any other match in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Gable was in shock, tears streaming down his cheeks during the
awards ceremony. Still, he got a four-minute ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The enormity of what happened didn't sink in until Gable saw
headlines in the Iowa papers the next day. Iowa State had won the
team title, but he was bigger news.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred cheering students greeted the team on campus. They
went dead silent when Gable emerged from a car.
</P>
<P>
   His mother called repeatedly. He choked up every time. Finally,
she drove to see him. It took him a few months to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really the same person for quite a while,'' Gable
said. ``I'm still not. He put a big mark on my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gable would return with a fury, eventually winning a gold medal
at the 1972 Olympics. He was so good, he wasn't scored on. He
thanks Owings for that.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after the NCAAs, Gable thought he had a rematch
with Owings in the Midlands Tournament at Northwestern. He wanted
it bad. Owings got upset in an early round. Gable was incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrestling someone else and watching him wrestle at the
same time,'' Gable said. ``I won 10-2, but I gave up a lot of
points watching him.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Gable finally got Owings on the mat again and
won a lopsided decision. There was instant relief.
</P>
<P>
   Both wrestlers would turn to college coaching. Owings spent
several years at Clackamas Community College (Ore.), enjoying
modest success. Gable became an icon at the University of Iowa,
bringing the Hawkeyes 15 NCAA titles in 21 seasons before stepping
down last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gable stays fit, but with two hip replacements he can't really
mix it up anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Told that his old nemesis could be had again, Owings kiddingly
listed his own various ailments. Then he turned serious. He's had
his eight minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go on the mat again with him,'' Owings said.
``I've got nothing to prove.''

DOES IT TAKE A MANAGER TO RAISE A CHILD?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I learned to be a father the hard way. A year after my first
child, Marian, was born, my wife got a job offer she couldn't
refuse. But the job was 1,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   So until Marian was 3, Mommy came home on weekends and I was
Marian's only parent during the week. During that time, I did many
dumb things, but had to take her to the emergency room only once
and learned not to change her diaper on an airplane as she squirmed
on my lap. (The time I did, the man next to me moved to another
seat after giving me his cocktail napkin.)
</P>
<P>
   If I hadn't been thrown into Daddy skills, I wouldn't have
developed them. But in my wife's absence, I had to focus on Marian
as hard as I focused on my job. With my next three children, I knew
what I was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Many men, however, don't care to know. They have always thought
that to succeed at work, they have to limit their responsibilities
at home.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you combine the domains? Can you take skills that
make you effective at the office and apply them to raising
children? And can you take domestic skills to the office?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hirschfeld, a venture capitalist at Patricof &AMP; Co. who lives
in Brooklyn, says you can. In his new book, ``Business Dad: How
Good Businessmen Can Make Great Fathers (and Vice Versa),''
published by Little, Brown, he follows in the tradition of books
that seek to draw management lessons from the likes of Attila the
Hun, Jesus Christ and Pat Riley. But ``Business Dad'' has chapter
headings like ``The Org Chart,'' ``Conflict Resolution'' and
``Human Capital'' _ to make the point that raising a family isn't
much different from doing a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld had an epiphany one night while he and his son,
Benjamin, now 5, debated bedtime. ``I realized it was like
negotiating deals,'' the author said in an interview. ``I found
that skills I had in the office could be often very useful to me as
a father.''
</P>
<P>
   Skills like discipline. ``Most business dads have heard of
`management by objective,' in which employees sign onto certain
quarterly or annual goals,'' he writes. ``You can apply the same
technique to discipline by getting specific about what you want
from your children and what will happen if they do it or don't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld wrote the book with his wife, Julie, a psychologist.
She told me that many fathers don't feel competent taking care of
children and often make the kind of mistakes that drive their wives
crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you not put a sweater in a diaper bag at the end of
October?'' she asked. ``If you can manage deals in Frankfurt and
Texas in your head, you can notice that you need a sweater in a
diaper bag in October.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz, director of the Child Study Center at
New York University, doubts that business skills offer the best
approach to parenting. But if dads can relate to the idea, it's
worth a try, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American dad is spending about 10 minutes of
quality time with their children'' a day, he said. ``In general,
middle- and upper-middle-class men are doing more than their
fathers did, but women still are doing more than their mothers.
They are working, and they still have the lion's share of household
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Wess Roberts, author of ``Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun''
(Warner Books), said Hirschfeld might be pushing management
metaphors too far. ``You should leave the father at home and leave
the executive at work,'' he said. ``You have to make calculated
decisions at work. If you make calculated decisions at home, I
think that wrecks the family environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts says that even Attila separated family and work. From
what he knows about him, Roberts said, ``he would have been a very
loving and doting father. He wouldn't have tried to be king of the
Huns at home.''

CROWNING YOUR SUCCESSOR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C., N.Y., Nev.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I've been promoted, and one of my first new tasks is finding
someone to fill my old job as a department head. The people in the
department work well together and are technically all equals, but
they see a definite pecking order. My first choice for the job,
however, is not the person they all assume is in line for it.
Should I go with the better candidate, knowing that she and I will
be resented, or suffer with a less capable manager in order to
preserve group harmony? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Always go with talent. Otherwise, your short-term fear of
workplace friction will undermine the department's performance over
the long haul _ and that ultimately reflects poorly on you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to think of this in a long-term perspective,'' said
John Hawkins, president of Leadership Edge, a consulting firm in
Durham, N.C. ``This will help orient you toward a choice that has
the most potential for development, growth and accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you should make every effort to minimize fallout.
Take time to explain your logic to the troops, said Aminata Njeri,
chief operating officer of Dynamics of Leadership, a leadership
training company in Brooklyn, N.Y. ``When people have an
understanding of your reasoning,'' she said, ``it reduces the
possibility of them resenting your decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But be careful how you approach the subject. Don't point out
that you know your choice was not the expected one, advised Mary
Shurtleff, a management consultant based in Las Vegas. Instead,
focus on how you expect the strengths and abilities of the new
department head to benefit the team.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how eloquent your explanation, however, you should
hope for the best and prepare for the worst, Hawkins warned. To be
safe, he said, explain your decision to your boss _ in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, if the troops start grumbling and circumvent you and
go to your supervisor, your supervisor will know what's going on,''
he added. The boss will also be better prepared to support your
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Your new appointee can also take steps to smooth the transition,
Ms. Shurtleff said, by asking her workers for ideas on dealing with
the group's challenges. But encourage her to follow up on the
suggestions, or she'll be headed for real trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not just say, `I want input,' then put it away in a
drawer,'' Ms. Shurtleff added. ``That's the worst thing you can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that your decision will send a message to the
department's employees about the qualities you consider important
in a leader. ``It seems as though the group has a misconstrued
notion of what makes someone promotable,'' Hawkins said. And that
gives you an opportunity to do some re-education.
</P>
<P>
   It's important, he said, for employees to know ``that people
don't get ahead based just on seniority or who screams the loudest
in meetings or who is the squeakiest wheel.''

 &HT;    Fledgling firm gears up expansion to get 100 trucks in tow
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. _ A fledgling firm in Boynton Beach is
working to create a national brand in towing, starting with a name
that should be easy to remember, 1-800-AutoTow.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded two years ago and owns towing companies
in three states _ Florida, Texas and Pennsylvania. But now it's
planning to close this month on deals for eight more towing
companies, one in Texas and seven in Florida, including one in West
Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The company employs 30 people, with five in Boynton Beach. It
has about 30 trucks at three companies it owns _ two in Tampa and
one in Pittsburgh. It will have 100 trucks if all the deals are
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Chairman and Chief Executive Joel Nagelmann declined to
disclose the company's sales, whether it's profitable and the names
of the companies it's buying. But he said, if all eight deals go
through, 1-800-AutoTow will generate about $13 million a year in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we will be profitable,'' Nagelmann said.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1997 when three businessmen read a
Success magazine story about Vince Gelormine's idea of
consolidating towing companies. They called Gelormine, a former
business development manager at Boca Raton-based HotOffice
Technologies, about joining him.
</P>
<P>
   The three are Nagelmann, a business consultant and former
marketing employee for IBM; Chief Operating Officer Eugene Iarocci,
the former transportation director for Union Carbide; and Josh
Konigsberg, a health services and Internet entrepreneur. Gelormine
is AutoTow's vice president of business development.
</P>
<P>
   The group started with slightly less than $1 million in seed
money from family, friends and small investors. The partners took a
year to study how to integrate small companies into one large
towing business, what kind of technology to use to increase
efficiency and how to put together commercial contracts with other
companies with large fleets.
</P>
<P>
   They began to buy towing companies last year.
</P>
<P>
   They are using a combination of stock (OTC-BB: AUTW, 61 cents),
cash and debt to complete the deals, Gelormine said. In some cases,
the company also assumes debt.
</P>
<P>
   AutoTow has hired an investment bank to find investors for the
company and to put together financing to buy trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to stand out through technology, using
satellite tracking to keep tabs on its trucks and communicating
with drivers on two-way pagers. Ultimately, it wants to put
computers in tow truck cabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can give customers a real (estimated time of arrival),''
Gelormine said. ``That's the key. If you call and they say they'll
be there in 30 minutes, a lot of times it takes an hour and 30
minutes.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ There was a day when Jack Nicklaus' presence
on the golf course at a major tournament was enough to make other
competitors tremble.
</P>
<P>
   But at age 59 and just six months after hip replacement surgery,
Nicklaus is but a shadow of his former self. Thursday he struggled
to an 8-over par 78 _ tied for 146th in the 156-player field _ in
the first round of the U.S. Open which began at the fabled
Pinehurst No. 2 course.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when he walked up the 18th fairway to the green, the
gallery in the grandstands gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time on the day, Nicklaus doffed his cap in
acknowledgement. He followed that with a modest wave of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be the Jack of yesteryear, but he's still regarded as
one of the best ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play very well,'' Nicklaus said afterwards. ``That's
about all I can say. I didn't drive the ball very well. My iron
game was not very good and my putting wasn't very good either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, I was fine,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in an early morning drizzle and fog, Nicklaus said he
had trouble focusing on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see very well anymore in low light,'' the four-time
Open champion said. ``I was over a pitch on the second hole, and I
couldn't focus where the ball was. I had my caddy read the first
three greens for me, because I couldn't see.''
</P>
<P>
   With sunshine expected today, and a near-noon starting time,
Nicklaus said that could make a big difference in his game.
</P>
<P>
   The dampness made the course too long for him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hit it far enough any more to play under these
conditions,'' Nicklaus said. ``I was hoping for a hard, fast golf
course and I didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the way it goes. I'm still not back yet, ready to
play, but I'm doing my best. I feel fine, I'm just not that strong
and that was pretty obvious today. On a heavy day, I just didn't
have the strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, who had just one birdie on the round, missed more
greens than he made _ 12 missed, six made.
</P>
<P>
   He first made the green in regulation at the third hole, but
three-putted to fall three over par. At four, however, he made the
green and collected his first par, raising his hands in salute of
the ovation of a large gallery which followed him all day, despite
his play.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus made another par at seven, where he missed the green,
but used his putter from well off the putting surface to get close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time,'' Nicklaus said when asked how often he used his
putter when off the green. Some of those shots were from 15 yards
out or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pin placements were pretty tough,'' he said. ``They didn't
spare any of the horse. If the greens had gotten quick, we'd have
had 8 to 10 shots that would have rolled off the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus used that roll to get his only birdie of the day. At
the dogleg-right eighth hole, he hit his tee shot into the rough at
the corner. Then, he followed with a long, low shot that hit in
front of the green, rolled up and bumped the pin, bouncing back a
couple of inches.
</P>
<P>
   But by and large, Nicklaus was easily outdriven by his two
companions _ Hal Sutton, who shot a one-under 69, and former Open
champ Curtis Strange, who was all over the course and also finished
with a 78.
</P>
<P>
   The drizzle that fell on the trio subsided at the turn and,
although the sun didn't come out, the course began to get better.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus wants it to dry quickly and get a lot faster. With
that, he hopes to be able to make the cut when today's play comes
to an end. At this point, that's an iffy situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harder, faster: That's the only chance I have of playing,''
Nicklaus said. ``If the course is fast, it would make up for some
of my lack of strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``A heavy golf course makes a par 70 a long golf course for
me,'' he continued. ``I used woods off (the fairways) of par fours
today four times and that makes the game a little harder.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I didn't get it there then.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys were playing 8- or 9-irons and I'm playing 2's and
3's. I guess I'm getting a little bit of my own medicine. I had it
that way for years,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's all right. I'll get stronger.''

U.S. SAYS PHOTOS SHOW NORTH KOREA PREPARING FOR MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American intelligence agencies have uncovered
evidence that North Korea is making initial preparations to test
the launch of a ballistic missile later this summer, Clinton
administration officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence agencies say aerial photographs show that North
Korea is refurbishing its launch pad and that the country is most
likely to test its longer-range ballistic missile, the Taepo Dong
2.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence agency officials said the range of the North Korean
Taepo Dong 2 missile test would be significantly longer than last
summer's test of the less sophisticated model, which traveled
almost 4,000 miles, before it splashed into the ocean. These
officials said that once deployed the Taepo Dong 2 would be able to
hit Alaska or Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery comes as North Korea and South Korea have reached
a standoff on the seas where they fought a 30-minute battle early
Tuesday at their disputed maritime border. The conflict ended with
the sinking of a North Korean ship and the possible deaths of more
than 20 sailors. On Wednesday North Korea suspended all contacts
with the South.
</P>
<P>
   To better monitor the dispute, the Pentagon dispatched two
warships and surveillance combat jets to the area from their bases
in Japan. The reports Thursday were optimistic. ``It's clear that
the North Koreans have moved their ships back, and currently there
is a clear separation between the boats of both sides,'' said a
Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Should North Korea test a ballistic missile in a month or more,
as intelligence agencies now estimate, it would jeopardize the
Clinton administration initiatives to improve relations and reduce
tensions on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``This underscores why the most dangerous place on earth is not
downtown Pristina but the Korean border,'' a senior Clinton
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   After North Korea launched a three-stage rocket over Japan last
summer, the Clinton administration stepped up proposals to develop
regional missile defense systems with Japan and South Korea. The
increased range of that missile raised alarms in Congress as well
as the administration. The 37,000 American troops based in South
Korea and nearly 50,000 others serving in Japan appeared far more
vulnerable to the improving North Korean missile system.
</P>
<P>
   This winter Secretary of Defense William Cohen visited Japan to
further discussions of a research project with the United States to
develop their theater missile defense. At the same time, Japan
delayed financing of several nuclear energy reactors for North
Korea to show its displeasure over what the Japanese public
considered a provocative launch.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago North Korea was reminded by former Secretary of
Defense William Perry that Japan and the United States would not
tolerate another missile launch. Perry visited Pyongyang to float a
proposal that would promise a lifting of United States sanctions
against North Korea in return for promises to stop testing missiles
and selling missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans and defense analysts, already skeptical of
Perry's initiative, said Thursday's news could torpedo that effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the testing of a missile by North Korea would have
a very severe political impact, more even than a military one,''
said Richard Armitage, a defense analyst and former Reagan
administration official. ``It will increase the fervor for a
theater missile defense system and dampen any enthusiasm for
Perry's ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   While all officials expressed concern over any new test, several
said these initial intelligence findings were not conclusive proof
that the North Koreans would launch a missile this summer and
should not cut off the continuing diplomatic efforts to lower
tensions on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is minimizing the thought that the next launch would be
very provocative and very dangerous,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass. ``The missile piece is not a surprise at this point. You
just have to make sure another test doesn't happen, and I think
this is more reason to keep engaged with North Korea.''

POLITICAL BRIEFS: ORRIN HATCH AND DAN QUAYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Miss., S.C.)   (bl)  
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Presidential Talk, and Hatch Is Listening
</P>
<P>
   The hot political talk in Utah is that Sen. Orrin Hatch has not
given up on the idea of seeking the Republican presidential
nomination next year and, in fact, has pretty well made up his mind
to form one of those ``exploratory committees'' to test the lay of
the political land.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old senior senator from Utah says he is
``courteously listening'' to all the talk, but otherwise refuses to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are long that a hard-right conservative like Hatch
could win the nomination, given the momentum building behind Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and given, too, the number of other hard-right
conservatives already off and running. As the senator put it the
other day: ``I'd be the longest of long shots. I know that. It's
very late in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, The Salt Lake Tribune said Thursday, without naming any
names, that Hatch's ``closest aides and friends'' are expecting
that he will announce the formation of a committee ``as soon as
next week.''
</P>
<P>
   That development came on the heels of reports that the senator
has hired a pollster to test his national standing with voters, and
is looking to hire some political professionals to help him put
together a national campaign organization that, for starters, will
open offices in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states that
traditionally start the quadrennial nominating process.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Hatch seeks the presidency, he faces a
re-election race next year for a fifth term in the Senate, a race
he is heavily favored to win. Spencer Stokes, who is managing that
campaign, cautions that while many people close to the senator
believe he is poised to jump into the presidential race, ``only one
person really knows if he is, and that's Orrin Hatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a new Utah law, Hatch can run for both offices at the same
time. The law was pushed through the state Legislature earlier this
year by Hatch supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Funny Things Happen to Quayle in Dixie
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Dan Quayle should give up on scheduling trips to the Deep
South to raise money for his quest for the Republican presidential
nomination next year.
</P>
<P>
   First, the former vice president planned to hold a fund-raiser
in Jackson, Miss., on June 23, figuring his family-values pitch
would be a real money-maker with the state's heavily conservative
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Come on down, by all means, said Gov. Kirk Fordice, an old
friend who had earlier been appointed as one of the Quayle
campaign's national chairmen. But then came the disclosure that the
governor had slipped off to Europe for a vacation with a woman who
is not his wife, and upon his return _ a stormy return when
reporters showed up _ had demanded a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Fordice remains one of Quayle's campaign chairmen, and the
candidate says he is ``pleased to have his support.'' But the
fund-raiser has been postponed _ for a reason, or reasons, that the
campaign refuses to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's schedule also calls for him to travel to South Carolina
on July 7 for a fund-raiser and golf tournament in Columbia. The
hosts for that visit, according to an announcement from Quayle
headquarters, will be Lou Holtz, the head football coach at the
University of South Carolina who won a national championship when
he coached at Notre Dame, and former Gov. Carroll Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful that two of my longtime friends are joining me,''
Quayle says in the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   This is no small deal. In football-crazed South Carolina, Holtz
is almost as revered as the Good Lord. And Campbell is not far
behind, at least with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _
</P>
<P>
   The former governor insists that this is all news to him. Or, as
he told The Columbia State on Wednesday, it is ``completely an
overstatement.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he has many ``good friends'' running in the Republican
presidential race and is sitting on the sidelines at this point,
just watching, not scheduling any events, totally uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   He will make up his mind in his own good time, Campbell says,
adding that in the meantime, he's not going to be ``pushed into a
corner and trapped.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jim Merrill, the director of the Quayle campaign in
South Carolina, Quayle would not ``presume'' to speak for Campbell.
Still, Merrill says, hanging in there, Quayle ``appreciates'' the
former governor's assistance.

HOUSE APPROVES MEASURE TO ALLOW TEN COMMANDMENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move apparently aimed at the hearts and minds
of the nation's youth, the Republican-controlled House approved a
controversial measure Thursday that would allow the Ten
Commandments to be posted in the nation's public schools and
government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, offered as an amendment to a sweeping juvenile
justice bill designed to crack down on minors who commit violent
crimes, was approved 248-180 over the objections of opponents who
called it a ``clear violation'' of the constitutional separation of
church and state.
</P>
<P>
   But the amendment's chief sponsor, Rep. Robert Aderhalt, R-Ala.,
insisted that a display of the Ten Commandments would help instill
``the right values'' in children and help calm the atmosphere of
violence that he said is so prevalent today in the nation's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent shootings in Littleton, Colorado, provide an
unfortunate picture of the terror infested in our schools today,
children killing children in the halls of our schools, children who
do not understand the basic principles of humankind,'' Aderhalt
said. His legislation would allow the posting of a well-known
``religious symbol'' but would not endorse a specific faith, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He called on colleagues to take a stronger stand on promoting
traditional values and discipline, and said that while posting the
Ten Commandments ``will not change the moral character of our
nation overnight ... it is an an important step to promote morality
and an end of children killing children.''
</P>
<P>
   Aderhalt's effort to impose a religious-based solution on youth
violence won the support of 45 Democrats and 203 Republicans. Only
15 Republicans opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All 13 GOP members of the Texas delegation voted for the
amendment, as did Democrats Gene Green of Houston, Ralph Hall of
Rockwall, Max Sandlin of Marshall, Charles Stenholm of Abilene, Jim
Turner of Crockett and Solomon Ortiz of Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill was one of several amendments sponsored by conservative
Republicans aimed at broadening the role of religion in public
places. Another measure approved with the help of conservative
Democrats would also allow religious symbols to be placed on
memorials on school grounds that honor victims of school violence.
One amendment passed paved the way for faith-based groups to
administer juvenile justice programs as long they do not ``preach
their religious beliefs,'' as one lawmaker put it.
</P>
<P>
   And taking a step that was highly critical of Hollywood, the
House also approved a resolution sponsored by Rep. Jo Ann Emerson,
R-Mo., urging the entertainment industry to curtail ``portrayals of
pointless acts of brutality'' in movies and video games.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson accused the industry of actively marketing violence to
young people and said that tweaking the gun laws would not stop
teen-agers intent on killing. She said it was time for Congress to
help parents win back ``a sense of security and control'' in their
schools and homes to help prevent future tragedies like the April
shooting and bombing incident at Columbine High School that killed
14 students and one teacher.
</P>
<P>
   But despite her call for congressional action on the ``cultural
problems'' confronting America, Emerson acknowledged that Congress
``can't legislate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ten Commandments measure and Emerson's resolution were just
two of 43 amendments offered to a larger $1.5 billion juvenile
justice bill approved by the House late Thursday before it turned
its attention to a variety of gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-control amendments, including competing measures that
would close a loophole in federal law allowing gun show dealers to
sell weapons without conducting background checks on buyers, was
expected to ignite a heated debate over the amount of time allowed
to conduct the checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved a bill requiring background checks at
all gun shows and pawn shops and setting a three-business day
deadline on completing the checks to determine whether a buyer has
a criminal record or is under age.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., a former board member of the
National Rifle Association, and other anti-gun control advocates
introduced a weaker version of the gun show legislation requiring
that checks on transactions be completed within 24 hours. If the
checks couldn't be done in that time, the buyer would get his gun
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Dingell bill also would weaken existing background check
regulations for licensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the Dingell measure, which appeared likely, would
represent a major victory for conservative House Republicans led by
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who seized on the Dingell measure
as a way to ``take the air out of the gun control lobby,'' as one
GOP aide put it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dingell measure was expected to pick up the support of 45
Democrats and most Republicans who fear that voting for tougher
gun-control legislation could hurt them in next year's elections,
as it did in 1994 when Democrats were targeted by the NRA because
they voted for a ban on assault-style weapons.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, with the NRA's backing, actively lobbied Republicans to
vote for the Dingell bill and offered reassurances that it
represented ``a safe vote'' that won't haunt them next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dingell measure is designed to undercut not only the Senate
bill but a similar amendment set for debate late Thursday that
would require background checks at gun shows and flea markets with
three business days to complete them.
</P>
<P>
   The competing amendment is sponsored by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy,
D-N.Y., whose husband was shot and killed on a commuter train.
McCarthy and Democratic leaders, including President Clinton,
worked Thursday to gain support for her measure, but it appeared on
the verge of being voted down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in Europe for a meeting of the world's largest
industrialized nations, was up early Thursday morning calling
wavering Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope and pray that Congress will do the right thing,''
Clinton told reporters, after seeking them out to voice his concern
about the Dingell amendment. He called on lawmakers to think
``about those children (in Littleton) and other children that we
can still save.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Dingell was intentionally trying to undercut
the administration and his party leaders on the gun-control issue,
Clinton said he thought the senior congressman was doing ``what he
believes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Dingell, however, was less kind in assessing the president's
attempts to defeat his amendment, and claimed that the president
was responsible for the loss of the House by the Democrats in 1994
because he encouraged Democrats to support gun-control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president with his machinations in 1993 on gun control
cost us the control of the House and a lot of people here
remember,'' Dingell told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Clinton and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., spent much of Thursday lobbying Democrats that a strong
position on gun control would not hurt them at the polls because
public attitudes have changed.
</P>
<P>
   As the late debate on gun control began, Gephardt reminded
colleagues that children were dying everyday because of guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost more kids yesterday (to gun violence) than we lost in
Kosovo or in Bosnia,'' he said. ``Thirteen kids a day go down to
school violence,'' he said, citing government studies. ``This is a
national crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he
``couldn't agree more'' with Gephardt's appeal to members to help
prevent the violence.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``Oh, my God, the problem _ it goes far beyond
guns.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Divx's Death Pleases Opponents  &HT;     By Dan Fost  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The death of the Divx video disc was mourned by its fans yesterday,
but it put smiles on the faces of the die-hard techies who fought
it.
<P>
   Divx, short for Digital Video Express, was touted by its
creator, Circuit City, as a way to rent movies without having to
return them to the store after viewing. But videophiles feared that
it could supplant what they saw as a superior format, DVD, and that
it carried ``Big Brother'' implications of corporations spying on
what movies people watched, and when.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ding dong, Divx is dead,'' said a gleeful John Giberson, a
Texas real estate agent who ran the  &LR; www.bandivx.com  &LR; Web site.
``I'm happy that everybody that was unhappy with the format spoke
up and let the companies know where they stood on it. I think they
made their point.''
</P>
<P>
   Divx discs look just like digital video discs and CDs. Like
their digital counterparts, they offer superior quality to
videotapes. Unlike DVDs, which list for $30 to $35 and are offered
for sale, Divx worked on something closer to a pay-per-view model:
People could buy Divx discs for $4.50, and then watch the disc any
time they chose.
</P>
<P>
   Once they started watching, though, they only had 48 hours in
which they could watch the movie as often as they wanted until
digital codes made it ``expire.'' After that, they could throw the
disc away, or pay to ``recharge'' it for two more days, or for
life. All activities were handled by the Divx player dialing in to
a billing center over phone lines. That sparked privacy concerns
from people who did not like the idea of their TV making a midnight
call to report their viewing habits.
</P>
<P>
   A Divx machine can play ordinary DVDs, but a regular DVD player
can't play Divx discs.
</P>
<P>
   Divx proved popular with some consumers who were sick of having
to return their videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bitter. I thought it was a great product, and a great
concept,'' said Gregg Stauffer, 43, of San Francisco, the office
manager for a doctor. ``Now I have to go stand in these lines again
at Blockbuster. And then I'll have to give it back in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Stauffer, who had bought more than 100 Divx discs, had even
posted a Web site defending the product, but he quickly found
himself flamed by Divx haters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be one of the few consumer products that was
destroyed before consumers had a chance to say whether they liked
it or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City, the consumer electronics giant that developed and
pushed Divx along with its partner, a Los Angeles entertainment law
firm, launched Divx only one year ago. But at that time, said Van
Baker, director of consumer research for Dataquest, consumers could
not rent movies on DVD, and movie studios were dragging their feet
on releasing their films on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   If that scenario had remained in place, Baker said, then Divx
might have sparked a format war reminiscent of the 1970s contest
between Sony Corp.'s Betamax and VHS.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the backers of DVD regrouped, got the studios on board
and put DVDs into video rental stores.
</P>
<P>
   And in the process, Divx faced new hurdles. It could not
persuade all of Hollywood's studios to release their movies in the
Divx format, and, Baker said, ``The fact that it came out of
Circuit City was a problem, as other retailers were very reluctant
to support a model that would help a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Divx faced a vocal minority of technology magazines and
so-called ``early adopters'' like Giberson.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two main beefs about Divx,'' Giberson said, ``were No.1,
ownership. When you go to the store, you purchase a DVD, you own
the disc and the rights to watch it wherever and whenever you want
to. With Divx, you could only watch it in a certain time period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other issue was privacy,'' he added. ``No one really has
the right to know what movies you watch, when you watch them, or
how often you watch them. Why should anyone have access to that
info?''
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City said it will take a $114 million charge to
eliminate the Divx division. It will give Divx customers a $100
rebate for their machines (they cost about $100 more than regular
DVD players), and it is unloading the discs for $1.99 each.
</P>
<P>
   At that price, even arch-rival Giberson bought one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually stepped into a Circuit City store for the first
time in 18 months and bought a souvenir,'' he said. ``I'm going to
frame it, with a page from my Web site and the press release
(announcing the demise of Divx).''
</P>
<P>
   And what movie did he buy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Appropriately enough,'' he said, ``I bought `48 Hours.'''

FOR COMPANIES, IT CAN PAY TO RECOGNIZE THE NEEDS OF PROFESSIONAL
WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Debby Hopkins, 44, is senior vice president and chief
financial officer at The Boeing Co., which makes her one of the
most powerful and highest-ranking female executives in the country.
</P>
<P>
   She's also a mom.
</P>
<P>
   As such, she knows the only thing more challenging than keeping
watch over the balance sheets of one of the largest corporations in
the world, is guarding the balance between her work and family
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Women (and men) everywhere are trying to strike a magical
equilibrium that allows for both career growth and a real life.
</P>
<P>
   But that balance can shift depending on where a woman is in her
life, according to a survey by Deloitte &AMP; Touche. Recognizing those
shifts can help companies better design programs to keep and
attract talented women.
</P>
<P>
   ``As younger women continue to assume more leadership positions,
we wanted to look at the trends and patterns of professional women
at varying stages of their career,'' said Trish Zuccotti, a
director at Deloitte &AMP; Touche, and organizer of the study. ``We
were curious to learn whether women in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s
have more similarities or differences when it comes to workplace
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche surveyed 111 professional women in Washington
to see how their career values changed at different ages.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that women in their 20s and 40s share some
career values. Women in their 20s are looking for opportunity and
women in their 40s want both income and change.
</P>
<P>
   Women in their 30s, many of whom are starting families, value
job stability and flexible hours above income and change.
</P>
<P>
   And for women in their 50s, job satisfaction is the primary
career motivator.
</P>
<P>
   These are generalizations, but they are also useful reminders
that women (and men) have different needs at different times in
their lives, Zuccotti said.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping women has been a growing challenge for many companies,
she said. Six years ago, for example, Deloitte &AMP; Touche realized
women at the accounting firm weren't always getting the same plum
assignments as men and thus weren't getting the same opportunities
for advancement. Since then, the company has started a mentoring
program and other initiatives aimed at meeting women's needs.
</P>
<P>
   It's paid off. The company is keeping more women and its overall
turnover rate has fallen from about 24 percent to about 17 percent,
she said. ``All the things we're doing to retain women _ the
work-life balance programs _ also benefit men.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart companies work to attract, develop and retain talented
women, Boeing's Hopkins said. And in that kind of environment,
women can go as high as they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barriers (to advancement) are pretty limited at this point
in time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Giving women opportunities to expand their skills in different
departments is especially critical for women who want to advance to
senior positions in companies, said Hopkins, who has held a variety
of positions at General Motors, Unisys Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get out of your functional area,'' she said.
``If you're in finance, get an opportunity to work in sales or
marketing so you're seeing a different part of the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   That breadth makes a woman more valuable to the company, and
gives her more opportunity to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins has managed her own rise while raising a son, now 18,
and daughter, 13.
</P>
<P>
   Just after her son was born, she was working for a ``Fortune
10'' company and being asked to work overtime for the sake of
working overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to leave, even though it was a strong career
environment for me at the time,'' she said. ``It was important to
me that I wasn't working every Saturday just for the purpose of
saying I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she still works to balance time with her family with the
demands of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins drags a ``briefcase that looks like a suitcase'' home
with her, but she has dinner with her husband and time with her
kids in the evenings before wrapping up her paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always try to make a connection at one end of the day,'' she
said. ``That's the model that works for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The way people get their work done is less important than the
quality of the work they do, she said. She tries to give her own
employees the flexibility they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger issue is to focus on what that person delivers vs.
whether they deliver it in the same way you always have,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins' advice to other women? ``It's the same thing my mother
said to me: You can do anything you want to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And it's the same message she's passed to her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Hopkins was telling her daughter she'd be a great
reporter on CNN someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Mom, I'm gonna own CNN.'''

 WORKWAYS/ILANA DEBARE  &HT;     Slacker Boss Skips Out Of Work 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I work in a very small off-site department for a fairly large
corporation. The only employees are myself (an hourly employee), my
manager (a salaried employee) and one on-call employee. The
problem: My manager seems to be fiercely abusing the corporate
``time off'' policy. He leaves the office on personal business for
long stretches of time, which sometimes leaves me overwhelmed with
work. Since ours is an off-site location, none of his superiors is
in a position to notice. I'm afraid of retaliation from him if I
tell the company. How should I handle this?
<P>
   A: When companies are reluctant to approve telecommuting
arrangements, this is precisely the scenario they fear _ employees
who take advantage of their invisibility to slack off or stop
working altogether.
</P>
<P>
   It is not common. But when it happens, as you are seeing
firsthand, it can be a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   You should start by talking to your manager. Do not criticize
his absences directly. Instead, describe the crunch they create for
your own workload and the office's productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him about the issues that come up when he's not around
and how you have trouble getting your work done,'' suggested
Marcelle Bolding, a human resources consultant in Oakland. ``Ask
him to help figure out how to resolve those problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your manager will take the hint and spend more of his
time on the job. If not, maybe he will come up with some other way
to help you out, such as increasing the hours of your on-call
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   If talking to your boss directly does not work, your only option
is to approach someone at headquarters. If there are people in
management who you know and trust, start with them.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways that the company can focus a little extra
scrutiny on your boss without letting him know you blew the whistle
_ for instance, by having someone from headquarters stop by the
field offices occasionally without advance warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vice president used to call me his eyes and ears,'' said
Emily Elliott, a human resources consultant in Walnut Creek who
used to work in HR for a company with out-of-town satellite
offices. ``I'd go to the branch offices to do training in some new
system. But while I was there, I'd always talk with people about
how things were going, and what was or wasn't working.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Union Accountability
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work at a unionized company where I pay nearly $1,000 a
year in union dues. I have never seen any information about the
union's budget and have no idea what my hard-earned cash is spent
on. I'm also curious about things like travel guidelines for the
union leadership. Am I legally entitled to this information and, if
so, how do I go about getting it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unions representing private-sector workers are covered by the
Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, according to Carl
Biers of the Association for Union Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   That federal law requires would require  &LR; your union to file an
annual report called an LM2, which should include some budgetary
information such as the group's assets, liabilities and officers'
salaries. You can get a copy by calling your local office of the
U.S. Department of Labor and asking for the Office of Labor
Management Standards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some unions are required by their constitutions to
issue financial reports to their members. However, neither an LM2
nor an annual report is likely to go into the level of financial
detail, such as travel spending, that you're seeking  &LR; you seek.
</P>
<P>
   Your first step should be the most obvious one _ asking your
union representative for answers to your questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're an honest, open union, they will make this
information readily available,'' said Biers. ``But if a union is
stealing money from its members, it's going to do its best to bury
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, if the union is misusing your money and covering up
its finances, the only way to change things may be to put together
a reform group and run for union office yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Want some help? Contact the Association for Union Democracy, a
nonprofit in New York that counsels union members in their
democratic rights. They can be reached on the Web at
 &LR; www.uniondemocracy.com  &LR; or through their West Coast office at
(415) 621-8468.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Early Warning Penalty
</P>
<P>
   Q: A co-worker gave two weeks' notice. Our boss then informed
him that he would only need to work one week. Is he eligible to be
paid for the entire two weeks?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Nope. Unless your colleague was covered by a union
contract or individual employment contract, he was most likely an
at-will employee.
</P>
<P>
   And at-will employment means that either the worker or the
company can terminate the relationship at any time, for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   Your colleague did the ethical, courteous thing by giving two
weeks' notice before leaving. It would have been nice if the
company had thanked him for the advance notice rather than
terminating him even earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But nice or not, his dismissal is still probably legal.

 _ SF CHRON  
 GRABBING A PIECE OF THE PIE  &HT;     By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Binay Cahn, a lifelong lover of animals, was thrilled to get three
job offers this spring from e-commerce companies selling pet
supplies. But she was perplexed about how to compare the three
offers _ especially the part that involved stock options.
<P>
   ``I had a couple of different offers, and it was really hard for
me to figure out what they meant,'' said Cahn, who started work
this week as director of corporate communications for Petstore.com
in Emeryville. ``I kept asking my friends, `Just tell me how many
options I should ask for.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cahn wasn't alone in her uncertainty. Stock options have become
a common part of job offers in Silicon Valley. Savvy applicants now
realize that a hefty option grant from a fast-growing tech firm can
lead to a windfall of $100,000 or even $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   So an increasing number of Bay Area employees are trying to
figure out how to negotiate for stock options _ how many options
they should seek and what different option packages might be worth.
</P>
<P>
   Some valley veterans already have worked at enough startups to
be confident, knowledgeable option negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Cahn, who are newcomers to the startup world
feel like they are groping in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is complicated by the fact that there is no simple
yardstick for option grants: Offers vary widely from firm to firm
and job to job. And unlike salaries, there are no surveys of
``average'' option grants available in print or on the Web to the
average job seeker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations get very hot and very heavy because employers are
trying to hold on to a great deal of equity and employees are
trying to get equity,'' said Ted Ganchiff, founder of a Santa Clara
startup called TalkNetRadio. ``The problem is that there's not a
lot of information out there. Applicants are asking for numbers (of
options) that are vastly different from what the founders are
saying. People are coming into this entirely uneducated _ both on
the employee side and the founder side.''
</P>
<P>
   How do stock options work? In a nutshell, they give someone the
right to buy a certain number of shares of stock at the current
price, at a specified date in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If the value of the company and its stock rises during that time
period, the option holder can make a profit. If the value falls or
stays flat, however, the options are worthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get burned if the market goes flat, but you can really
make money if the market goes up,'' said Matt Ward, a compensation
consultant with WestWard Pay Strategies in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options have long been a perk for chief executives and
other top managers. But in the 1990s, more and more firms started
extending option grants to mid- and low-level employees., too. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  A 1997 survey of 1,100 public companies by the American
Electronics Association found that 53 percent offered options to
all their employees. Among startup technology firms that have not
yet  &LR; gone public, the figure probably is closer to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, Silicon Valley is the country's stock option
mecca. Employees are not the only ones getting options here: Many
startups also offer options in lieu of cash to their outside
lawyers, accountants or marketing consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside the valley, salary and benefits are people's No.1
concern, but in the valley, it's stock,'' said Greg Hampton, CEO of
a Sunnyvale startup called Clairvoyant Software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here even receptionists come in and ask, `What's my option
package?''' said Bruce Bourne, an independent financial adviser to
startups in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
How Much Is `More?'
</P>
<P>
   Startup firms typically offer options to their employees to make
up for lower-than-average salaries and an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   So one general rule of thumb is: The newer and riskier the
venture, the more stock options you should expect. If you are
willing to work at a steeply discounted salary, you should expect
even more options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earlier you join a firm, the more you should get _ but how
much is `more'?'' said Steve Patchel, a senior compensation
consultant with Watson Wyatt. ``That's a number that's virtually
impossible to quantify.''
</P>
<P>
   Compensation experts say it is a mistake simply to compare the
number of options offered by two employers _ to grab automatically
for 10,000 options at Company A rather than 5,000 options at
Company B.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, job applicants should try to figure out what percentage
of the company they are being given through their options. The
bigger the ownership stake, the greater the potential gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five thousand shares of a company with 1 million shares
outstanding is not as good as 5,000 shares of a company with 50,000
shares outstanding,'' Patchel said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, applicants should assess how much they expect the
company's stock to rise in value. Will your $2 options rise to a
market price of $5 or $50 by the time your vesting date arrives? Or
will the price flounder at $2.50 or (heaven forbid) plummet to 50
cents?
</P>
<P>
   This requires guesswork, but at least you can do some informed
guesswork. Look at how comparable companies in your industry have
performed in the market. Read what analysts say about the company's
prospects. And if the company is not yet public, find out how many
more rounds of outside investment it expects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a company secures an additional level of financing,
it causes dilution of the stock,'' said Claudia Lindquist, a
recruiter with TechniQuest in San Jose. ``You may have a terrific
option price, but if the company has to bring in more investors, it
will dilute the value of your package.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Benchmarking
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you have come up with an estimate of what you think an
option offer is worth.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know if that is enough _ or whether you should ask
for more?
</P>
<P>
   First, consider the compensation at your last job. If you had
options before, you should be getting a package that is more
valuable than what you had there.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to friends in comparable positions, too. ``The easiest way
to know competitive option practices is to call around to your
buddies and find out if they're willing to share what they've
gotten,'' said Linda Amuso of iQuantic, a San Francisco firm that
advises companies on their stock option plans.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is some general benchmarking you can do.
</P>
<P>
   Companies usually set aside certain ranges of option grants for
different kinds of positions. CEOs of early stage startups
typically get options worth 5 to 10 percent of the outstanding
shares. Other top executives, such as the chief financial officer,
may get options worth up to 3 or 4 percent of the company.
Nonexecutive employees typically get less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you are dealing with a public company, it will have filed
proxy statements saying how many options were given to top
executives. That can help you figure out how much you can
realistically seek.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a midlevel manager, for instance, do not set your
sights on the same number of options as the CEO. But within a lower
range, you probably have some room to push for a better package.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples: Compensation consultant Dee DiPietro surveyed
technology startups and found that individual senior engineers
earning $100,000 receive options worth anywhere from 0.123 percent
to 1.390 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, midlevel engineers earning $78,000 receive options
worth anywhere from 0.016 percent to 1.044 percent of the company,
said DiPietro, president of Advanced HR Inc. in Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies very frequently allow negotiating room,'' said Bill
Metzger, a compensation consultant with Assets Unlimited in
Campbell. ``If they typically pay a position 20,000 shares, they
may lower their initial offer 20 percent to give themselves some
bargaining room.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Only One Factor
</P>
<P>
   The upshot? Yes, you can negotiate for more options. But
remember that options are only one factor among many to consider in
taking a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see guys with three young kids haggling over 200 shares of
stock when maybe they should be haggling over the amount of
vacation they'll get,'' said Lindquist.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to think about how you're going to feel two years
from now if the stock doesn't go anywhere,'' said Marianne
Adoradio, a career consultant who leads workshops on salary
negotiations at the Career Action Center in Cupertino. ``Will you
feel OK with the job, with the salary and with what you've learned
on the job?''
</P>
<P>
   In Binay Cahn's case, she gave herself a crash course in how
options work. She read articles about options and spent more than
an hour interrogating a friend who founded a startup.
</P>
<P>
   Cahn ended up deciding to join Petstore.com, not because of the
option package, but because of her overall confidence in the
company and its business strategy. Even so, her new knowledge about
options came in handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing to me was to go with a company that I
deemed successful and a winner in its category,'' Cahn said.
``Then, in the end, I believed in the company so much that I
negotiated a package that had higher options and lower salary.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Trying to Take Tedium Out of Web Conference   &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
More than 900 executives turned out for an Internet marketing
circus yesterday at Fort Mason that included Dennis Rodman, but
failed to produce a promised camel.
<P>
   The Web Attack conference _ which promised ``No boring panels!''
_ was billed as an attempt to teach online marketers to think
creatively.
</P>
<P>
   By adding entertainment to the two-day affair, the event's
producer and emcee, Michael Tchong, tried to appeal to busy
executives who would rather analyze a 12-page clickstream data
report than attend another mind-numbing tech conference.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Rodman _ and camels _ have nothing to do with
the Internet. And never mind that conferences on identical topics
are held almost weekly. Tchong's M.O. seems to be: You gotta have a
gimmick _ or better yet, a pavilion full of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tech business is notoriously lame when it comes to
marketing,'' especially in comparison with consumer brands like
Calvin Klein and Taco Bell, said Tchong, whose main business is
Iconocast, a weekly e-mail newsletter that is considered the
leading authority in Web marketing. ``That, to me, is where it has
to head.''
</P>
<P>
   So Tchong recruited Rodman (``A perfect example of
self-branding!'') as his keynote speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of promotional brochures, Tchong sent out glossy posters
featuring a fire-breathing monster under the headline, ``Web
Attack! The Ultimate Internet Marketing Event.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep heads from nodding, Tchong recruited attendees to play a
Web trivia show on stage. He also put his stamp on last night's
official conference dinner _ a ``2001 Arabian Nights'' harem party
complete with belly dancers. Fort Mason officials put the kibosh on
Tchong's plans to beef up the ambience with a rented camel.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Tchong, who grew up in Aruba and graduated from
Fordham University, was the omnipresent emcee. In the world of Web
self-promotion, he rivals Tiffany Schlain, organizer of the Webby
awards, who wheeled her infirm grandmother on stage at this year's
show to sing a song about the Webbies and ``Tiffy.''
</P>
<P>
   While the conference's gimmickry was as blatant as the 14-foot
Web Attack lizard towering over the stage, content was also given
its due. Tchong's staff edited the presentations to make sure they
included insights or helpful facts and figures, rather than the
typical dull sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Attendees at yesterday's events had mixed feelings about Web
Attack, which continues today. Kate Delhagen, an analyst with
Forrester Research, noted that Rodman pulled up on his motorcycle
25 minutes late and then didn't have much to say. ``He's a
resounding thud as a brand, he's more of a bland,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the conference is ``hugely well attended, so
it's high on the schmooze scale,'' said Delhagen, who enjoyed
touches such as a stock ticker, featuring Web stocks, scrolling
above the stage.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Casey Taylor, a programming analyst with America Online, took
lots of notes during the conference and loved the appearance of
Rodman, who Tchong recruited after finding him registered for the
domain name Rodzilla; the conference initially had been dubbed
Webzilla.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also liked the audience participation and the
not-your-father's-conference atmosphere. ``I begged my boss to let
me come,'' said Taylor, an avid Iconocast fan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Behind the harem girls and the giant lizard, Web Attack is
ultimately a promotional vehicle for the Iconocast newsletter. This
year's event probably will not make a profit, although black ink is
more likely in future years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're No.1 a publisher, and the No.1 goal of this event is to
reach (potential subscribers)'' said Tchong, a former advertising
executive and founder of the now-defunct MacWeek magazine. ``This
is an opportunity to create a default home page for all
marketers.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-year-old Iconocast, which is free, currently has 45,000
subscribers and aims to recruit 69,000 by December and 150,000
eventually, Tchong said. There is a waiting list for its six ad
slots, which sell for up to $3,600 a pop, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Web Attack, Iconocast has a strong entertainment element,
specifically a gossip column by Tchong's adolescent alter ego, the
Jacobyte, who floats industry rumors and dishes dirt. For example,
Jaco reported that Disney had acquired the rights to the domain
name ``Mybigstiffy.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Web Attack, Jaco has his fans and his detractors. ``I
always read Iconocast as soon as I get it, but I could live without
Jacobyte,'' said Manish Bhatia, vice president of interactive
services for Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bhatia, Jaco/Tchong once reported that Bhatia was
ready to leave Nielsen and was job-hunting _ something Bhatia
swears is not true. Tchong didn't run the item past Bhatia before
printing it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tchong is at the forefront of the hot interactive
marketing sector, which is estimated to reach $31.4 billion in
2002, according to C.E. Unterberg, Towbin. Tchong's next
conference, slated to take place in New York next May, ``will have
3,000 people, guaranteed,'' he promised.

 S.F.'s Providian Scrutinizing Sales Tactics  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Facing lawsuits and a probe by the San Francisco district
attorney's office, Providian Financial Corp. says it is carrying
out a top-to-bottom review of its high-pressure sales tactics.
<P>
   The concession has taken some of the heat off the giant San
Francisco credit card company. But observers wonder whether
Providian's spectacular profit growth will slow if it cleans up its
act.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how much of Providian's profits are based on sales
techniques the company will be forced to halt, such as telephone
pitches for credit insurance that consumer groups have called
misleading. Ending such practices, some industry experts warn,
could take a large bite out of Providian's sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to understand why it wouldn't affect
revenue,'' said Robert McKinley, chief executive of CardWeb.com, a
Maryland company that tracks credit cards. ``It ought to lower
it.``
</P>
<P>
   Providian, which specializes in offering credit cards to people
who have previously had problems paying off debts, said the
controversy will have little effect on earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game is customer satisfaction,'' said
spokesman Marc Loewenthal. ``If our customers are satisfied, the
revenue growth will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of slower revenue and profit growth are big worries
for investors already spooked by possible legal action against the
nation's ninth-largest credit card issuer. Once a high-flying
stock, the company's shares have swooned 30 percent since the
district attorney's probe was disclosed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Providian's revenue and profits jumped to $2.4
billion and $296 million respectively, up more than 50 percent from
1997. Much of that gain came from soaring fee income, which more
than tripled in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies and consumer groups are now questioning
how Providian generated those fees.
</P>
<P>
   They have received hundreds of complaints from people who say
Providian sold them products they did not want, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd like to do is send you out our Welcome Package with
all the information so you can look it over at your convenience,''
reads one script used by telemarketers to sell credit protection,
which allows customers to skip payments for a year if they become
unemployed or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   If the customers said yes, that was treated as a sale. Customers
have complained they did not understand the sales disclosures that
accompanied the pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they would sell a small fraction of their credit
protection if consumers understood what it really is,'' said Linda
Sherry, a financial services specialist for Consumer Action, a San
Francisco advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   After news reports that the district attorney's office was
investigating such practices, Providian said it was reviewing its
marketing language. The company also said it would give refunds to
customers who believed they had been charged improper fees.
</P>
<P>
   And, in response to complaints that it failed to post payments
on time, Providian extended deadlines two days and hired the
accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young to examine its payment-processing
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company repeated previous projections that
per-share earnings would rise from $2.04 in 1998 to $3.50 in 1999
and $4.72 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said Providian has been quietly telling
them it does not expect to significantly alter the way it does
business. Analysts are divided on whether that view is realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look for them to make material changes,'' said
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette analyst Moshe Orenbuch, who forecasts
only a marginal loss of revenue. Meanwhile, Orenbuch noted,
Providian has accounting tools to prop up earnings, such as setting
aside less money to cover credit losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Friedman, Billings, Ramsey analyst Todd Pitsinger looks for
a slowdown in sales of credit protection and an overall $60 million
decline in fee revenue next year from levels the company otherwise
would have reached.
</P>
<P>
   One thing analysts agree on is that Providian's situation is
volatile and unpredictable. Said Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods analyst
David Berry: ``The real answer is that nobody knows what will
happen.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 3Com Forming Wireless Net Access Firm  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Santa Clara's 3Com Corp. is joining with Aether Technologies today
to create a new company to provide wireless access to e-mail and
the Internet for people on the go.
<P>
   OpenSkycq &LR; , a joint venture to be based in Palo Alto, will act
as a wireless data service provider, allowing users with
specialized cell phones, handheld electronic organizers and pagers
to surf the Web, access e-mail and view corporate intranets.
</P>
<P>
   3Com hopes to capitalize on the demand for handheld wireless
Internet devices, which is expected to explode during the next two
years. More than 3 million people already use wireless Internet
devices, and that number is expected to grow about 50 percent by
2000, according to industry watchers.
</P>
<P>
   To take advantage of this developing market, 3Com and Aether of
Owings Mills, Md., are rolling out something akin to a wireless
Internet service provider. Like America Online or Excite AtHome,
OpenSky will provide content, as well as e-mail and an Internet
connection, but for wireless users. It will let customers share
files and access corporate intranets.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies also are trying to cash in on the wireless
Internet wave with plans similar to OpenSky's. Last year, Microsoft
and Qualcomm formed a joint venture called Wireless Knowledge,
which will give cell phone users the ability to access the Internet
and wirelessly tap into corporate networks. Cisco and Motorola also
have teamed up to do something similar.
</P>
<P>
   OpenSky will employ the same technology that the new PalmPilot
VII uses to surf the Internet. But although the company is jointly
owned by 3Com, which makes the popular Palm personal digital
assistant, OpenSky plans to offer its service on a variety of
mobile devices _ including those that use Palm's rival technology,
Windows CE.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers said that's important because not everybody
will use a Palm device to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a huge market but with lots of different
devices,'' said Albert Lin, who follows the wireless industry for
the Abernathy Group in San Francisco. ``There are different groups
that need information in a mobile environment,'' and not all those
groups use the Palm devices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the company has not announced any agreements yet, OpenSky
officials said they are working with a number of wireless carriers
and other companies who are interested in offering the service.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans a nationwide launch by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   OpenSky will use 3Com's Web-clipping technology, which allows
users to get specific bits of information from various sites. Right
now, those sites include ABCNews.com, E-Trade and Moviefone. The
company also will use Aether's AIM.net technology, which will allow
OpenSky's service to work on a variety of networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What OpenSky does is put all the pieces together,'' said
Patrick McVeigh, the former vice president of worldwide sales for
3Com's Palm division who will be OpenSky's CEO. ``We take
responsibility for customer billing and care ... and we understand
how applications and data need to be formatted for small devices.''
</P>
<P>
   OpenSky plans to sell its service to individual consumers, as
well as wireless carriers and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like UPS or FedEx, for example, could sign up with
OpenSky and give their workers the ability to access corporate
intranet sites, company e-mail and other services while on the
road. Individual carriers like Nextel or Sprint PCS also could sign
up with OpenSky and offer the service to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wiggins, who follows the wireless data market for the
Yankee Group in Boston, said OpenSky's business plan makes sense
because wireless Internet users will want more than just a gateway
to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is focused around content delivery to handheld
devices enabled by the Internet,'' Wiggins said.

CARDINAL HUME , LEADER OF ENGLAND'S CATHOLICS, DIES AT 76  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz. )   By NEIL MacFARQUHAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinal Basil Hume, who led the Roman Catholic Church in
England and Wales for 23 years, forging a renewed public role for
the institution in a country where even the word ``popish'' had
long been a derogatory adjective, died Thursday in London. He was
76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his official spokesman said just hours
after calling for renewed prayers for the cardinal because his
sickness had reached its final stages.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's office did not release any details of his
illness, but it was reported in the British press as abdominal
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Hume, a relatively unknown abbot running a Benedictine Monastery
when Pope Paul VI appointed him to head the British church in 1976,
had informed his priests that he was sick in an April letter. He
wrote that he would continue working as long as he could and hoped
to welcome in the new millennium, which he viewed as a time for
revived prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have received two wonderful graces,'' he wrote. ``First, I
have been given time to prepare for a new future. Secondly, I find
myself _ uncharacteristically _ calm and at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been due to address a gathering of more than 200 American
bishops meeting in Tucson, Ariz., this weekend, but sent a taped
message because he was too ill to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Hume was considered something of a moral compass in Britain
because he spoke with empathy about issues like abortion, birth
control, the public acceptance of homosexuality, the relief of
Third World debt and the release of those wrongly accused of
carrying out attacks for the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he did not waver from the ironclad positions
set down by the church hierarchy, although he kept Rome's overt
influence over the British church to a minimum. So he managed to
attract conservative followers fleeing the Church of England over
issues like the ordination of women as priests.
</P>
<P>
   His more prominent converts to Catholicism included the duchess
of Kent, a cousin of the queen and Graham Leonard, a retired
Anglican bishop of London. Queen Elizabeth II, temporal head of the
Church of England, took the exceptional step of attending a vespers
service at Westminster Cathedral, Hume's seat in 1995. Prime
Minister Tony Blair, a Protestant, regularly attended Mass and took
communion with his wife, Cherie, a Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Hume left the hospital briefly for an audience with the
queen, who honored him with an Order of Merit, one of the awards
she hands out by her own choice rather than by government
recommendation. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Critics accused the Cardinal of maintaining seemingly
contradictory positions.
</P>
<P>
   On homosexuality, he wrote a paper in 1993 saying that gay men
and women should ``not develop a sense of guilt or think of
themselves as unpleasing to God. On the contrary, they are precious
to God.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he wrote that because the church believed
in the sanctity of marriage it could not condone homosexual unions,
and that since sexual relations were meant to transmit new life the
church did not approve of homosexual sex.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Critics note that despite his attempts to present the church as
a more welcoming institution, church attendance dropped during his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago 1.38 million Catholics regularly attended Mass,
but by last year the number had dropped to 1.1 million, and the
number of young priests in training had plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent British Catholics did not always approve of his
efforts to be so embracing, complaining that he spread his
attention to too many issues. For example, Auberon Waugh, famous
for carrying on the curmudgeonly outlook of his father, Evelyn,
once condemned the cardinal as ``a profoundly silly man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church in England had been considered a suspect,
foreign-influenced institution since 1533, when King Henry VIII
broke with Rome by marrying Anne Boleyn against the pope's wishes
after divorcing Catherine of Aragon. In doing so he created the
Anglican Church.
</P>
<P>
   The modern Catholic Church's influence was also tainted by the
fact that many members of its hierarchy like Hume's predecessor,
John Heenan, were of Irish origin and prone to rabble-rousing. But
Hume changed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``His line is to talk a matter through quietly and reasonably,
and he does get listened to,'' Peter Stanford, Cardinal Hume's
biographer, told The Independent in 1997. ``He talks to ministers
on equal terms because he's English and upper middle class; he's an
establishment figure who understands how the establishment works.
He never gets on his soapbox, but if the time comes for it he will
emerge humbly into the limelight.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born George Haliburton Hume on March 2, 1923, in
Newcastle and inherited his Catholicism from his French mother,
whom his Scottish Protestant father had met while with the army
fighting in World War I. His father was a heart specialist who was
later knighted.
</P>
<P>
   He attended, and then taught at, Ampleforth, which is a major
abbey and is also considered the most prestigious boarding school
for Catholic families in Britain. He studied history at Oxford
University. He admitted that after he chose to become a Benedictine
monk, adopting the name Basil, that he often had early doubts about
pursuing the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was an old prior who was about to go into hospital
and he asked me to make no decision until he came back,'' Hume once
said. ``Well he never came back, so I never left.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew him said he never lost the air of the Benedictine
monk, emphasizing prayer and work throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   When he reached the usual retirement age of 75 last year, he
proffered his resignation to Pope John Paul II, who refused it. The
cardinal had said he wanted to return to his monastery, Ampleforth
in North Yorkshire, for fishing and school rugby games. (One reason
he was considered a priest-of-the-people was his often-expressed
support for the Newcastle soccer team that he started following as
a child.)

 WASHINGTON: blatantly unconstitutional.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York City also raised constitutional
questions. ``Whose Ten Commandments?'' he asked. ``Which version?
The Catholic version? The Protestant version? Or the Jewish
version?''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in 1980 declared unconstitutional a Kentucky
law requiring that a copy of the Ten Commandments be posted in
every public school classroom. The court held that the law violated
the constitutional separation of church and state, serving neither
a ``secular legislative purpose'' nor an educational function.
</P>
<P>
   In other votes touching on religion, the House overwhelmingly
approved measures allowing the use of religious language in
memorials on school grounds and allowing religious organization to
compete for government social service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   A day after rejecting an effort to impose a prison term on those
selling violent entertainment to teenagers, lawmakers also debated
and approved several measures that served primarily to make
Congress' displeasure with the entertainment industry known. One of
these proposals directed the surgeon general to prepare a report on
the effects of interactive video games on youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   The House also overwhelming approved a non-binding resolution by
Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., calling the entertainment industry
irresponsible in its marketing to youth and urging it to curtail
``portrays of pointless acts of brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can there be any doubt at all that the entertainment industry
has contributed to the culture of violence that has manifested
itself in Colorado, in Georgia, in Jonesboro, Arkansas?'' asked
Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich., listing sites of recent school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   California Democrats complained that the resolution was too
broad. ``Don't condem a whole industry,'' said Rep. Howard Berman
of California, protesting ``blanket guilt by association.'' Rep.
Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., shot back sarcastically, ``I suppose the
Democrats would never condemn an entire industry'' _ an implied
reference to Democratic attacks on tobacco and gun manufacturers.

SPURS' DUNCAN DOMINATES OPPONENTS, KEEPS QUIET ABOUT IT
</HEADLINE>

By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Tim Duncan has the emotion of Tom Landry and all
the charisma of Styrofoam.
</P>
<P>
   And, in case you've been too bored by his Vanilla Nice game to
notice, he also appears to have the New York Knicks at his mercy
and the entire NBA in the palm of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   During a 33-point, 16-rebound performance in San Antonio's Game
1 victory in the NBA Finals, the Spurs' 7-footer shrunk one of the
NBA's 50 Greatest Players (teammate David Robinson) into a
role-playing Robin and melted the macho Knicks defense into a speed
bump. Most impressive, he did it without a single ``look at me!''
dunk, without any oohs or aahs from the crowd, and with only a
rumor that he broke a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a person on the planet that can stop him
one-on-one,'' said beleaguered Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, whose
team takes another shot at slowing down Duncan in tonight's Game 2
at The Alamodome. ``Whatever we do, he's going to have big numbers
all series.''
</P>
<P>
   If the undermanned and overmatched Knicks are to avoid getting
swept out of the Finals, they must find a way to defend the
league's best, most boring player. Working as hard as a mosh-pit
bouncer to get position, then catching the ball in traffic as if it
were a butterfly and finally turning into a ballerina around the
basket, Duncan scored at will over smaller, weaker New York
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Without even a hint of tongue-wagging or camera-mugging, he took
turns schooling New York's Kurt Thomas, Larry Johnson and Chris
Dudley with an arsenal of moves. He scored with a 20-foot jumper,
fadeaways spinning both left and right, layups with each hand, a
rebound tip-in, a head-fake dribble drive on the baseline, a
12-foot bank shot and even a finger-roll layup.
</P>
<P>
   In a league that likes its leading men much more animated, ``The
Big Easy'' is more Brad Daugherty than Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a star, he's a superstar,'' said Robinson, the passer
on several high-low post sets that resulted in easy Duncan hoops.
``When he's on a roll like that, you just keep passing it into him
and then jog back down court to play some defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Though yesterday he typically ho-hummed the performance, Duncan
joined the Rockets' Hakeem Olajuwon as the only players this decade
with Finals games of at least 30 points and 15 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect 33 points, honestly,'' Duncan said. ``I'm sure
they're going to change it up and attack us more in the post. It's
nice to get numbers like that, but when I woke up this morning I
was still a pretty boring guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but those who know Duncan best say he's closer to
eccentric than boring.
</P>
<P>
   He's got an expansive knife collection, a passion for paint
ball, tattoos on his back (a joker) and chest (a dribbling Merlin)
and a knack for pick-pocketing unsuspecting teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really plays up this `Dull 'ol me' stuff,'' said teammate
and best friend Antonio Daniels, ``but he's really a prankster.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to his textbook footwork on the court, Duncan's mind
can be downright quirky. His idol is the psychologically probing
Matt Damon character in ``Good Will Hunting'', he always wears his
practice shorts backward and he has this crazy idea for his own
clothing line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to sell stuff with surprise blemishes,'' he said. ``You
know, like pants that turn pink after one wash, or a shirt with one
sleeve cut out. You won't know what it is until you open the box or
wear it a couple of times. I'll call it `Ultimate Rejects.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With more games like Wednesday's, Duncan will become as big a
star here as he is in his homeland of St. Croix, Virgin Islands. It
was there that Duncan was one of the world's top 14-year-old
freestyle swimming prospects until Hurricane Hugo destroyed the
Virgin Islands' only indoor pool in '89. Unwilling to train in the
ocean because of a fear of sharks, Duncan only then turned to
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like our king,'' said Dominic Rauges, one of 165 natives
of St. Croix who have flown in for the Finals' first two games.
``The new gym is named after him, his picture is everywhere. He
even got a 100 percent tax break on his sports bar.''
</P>
<P>
   With his unassuming personality, long arms and ears so big Duke
fans called him ``Spock'' while at Wake Forest, Duncan is quietly
taking over the NBA as he did his island homeland. He is yet to be
late for practice, laughs at the thought of doing a rap album,
doesn't whine for the ball, stayed quiet during the lockout and is
mum on his possible free-agent departure after next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``His shyness is part of his charm,'' said Nova Lanktree,
director of the Sports Celebrity Network advertising firm. ``He has
something most athletes don't, and that's an elegance about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, ``MTV won't be running after
him because he's old school. Stuff can be swirling all around him,
but he stays focused and relaxed. I call that being on island
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's image is Spurfect for San Antonio and the NBA.
Opponents probably wouldn't pay to see him play, but they would
certainly cough it up to avoid playing against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's impressive to say the least,'' Dudley said. ``We banged
on him pretty good, but he's just oblivious to it all. He just goes
about his business quietly, then all of the sudden you're exhausted
and he has 33 points.''

FOUR SHARE OPEN LEAD WITH 67s 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ In terms of medical marvels at the U.S. Open,
David Duval and his blistered right hand pale in comparison with a
limping Ben Hogan winning in 1950 after his rehabilitation from a
near-fatal car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't even rate with a dehydrated Ken Venturi staggering
down the final fairways before hoisting the trophy in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   But if Duval keeps hitting shots the way he did in Thursday's
opening round at Pinehurst Resort and Country Club, the world's
top-ranked golfer predicted he will soon join the list of Open
champions who overcame physical afflictions during tournament week.
</P>
<P>
   With his right forefinger and thumb taped because of
second-degree burns suffered in a household accident last week,
Duval shot a bogey-free 67 at Pinehurst No. 2. He joins Phil
Mickelson, Billy Mayfair and Paul Goydos atop the leader board on a
day when the par-70 layout was softened by overnight rains, yet
induced a scoring average of 72.9 from the 156 starters.
</P>
<P>
   Duval got there by avoiding three-putts, splitting 10 of 14
fairways and finishing with a stress-free effort of 3 under par.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purely off ball-striking, this is probably the best round I've
ever had at the Open,'' said Duval, who burned his hand on a pot
while boiling water. ``I had no expectations when I started. But if
I keep hitting it in the fairway and avoid three-putts, I think
I'll be back in here Sunday night, talking to you again.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, remains 54 holes in the future. But Duval
joined a high-profile group of players in taking advantage of soft
scoring conditions on a day when Pinehurst, in the estimation of
Tom Lehman, ``gave you as much as it will ever give you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, you had to worry about sucking the ball back off
the greens, they were so soft. Not exactly your typical Open
conditions,'' said Lehman, who has played in the final group on
Sunday at the past four Opens.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman failed to capitalize Thursday, soaring to a 73. But five
players, including Tiger Woods, Payne Stewart and John Daly, stand
in a group one stroke behind the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 156 starters, 23 broke par. Only Duval and Mayfair
completed their rounds without bogeys, but they did so in
remarkably different fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Duval covered the flagsticks with his approach shots. His three
birdie putts traveled a combined 20 feet, matching the shortest of
three birdie bombs holed by Mayfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to death. I went out and did exactly what I
wanted to do,'' said Mayfair, who made matching 20-foot birdie
putts at Nos. 1, 9 and 10. ``You have a lot of long irons into
these greens. If you're going to score, you have to make some long
putts to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless your name is David Duval, of course. Duval, winner of
four events on the PGA Tour this season, had birdie putts of two
and 10 feet at two of the par-3 holes. He knocked an approach to
eight feet for birdie at No. 2 and spit out birdie putts from 10
and 18 feet on two other holes.
</P>
<P>
   Duval found himself in greater control of his destiny than
playing partner Mickelson, who scrambled to a share of the lead
with a five-birdie, two-bogey effort. Included was a chip-in for
birdie from 25 feet at No. 5, a 30-foot birdie putt at No. 13 and
an 18-footer at No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Although pleased with his fast start, Mickelson _ who began play
at 6:30 a.m. CDT _ said he was surprised he was not passed by
another player as the first round unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tribute to how difficult this course is,'' Mickelson
said. ``For 3 under to be hanging up on top of the leader board,
with the course playing as easy as it can, I think we're going to
be in for a long weekend if the greens dry out.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of the players with Tarrant County ties makes it to
the weekend rounds remains unclear. Burleson resident Greg Gregory,
a former UT-Arlington player, had the lowest score of the bunch, a
3-over 73. Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks shot 74 and former TCU
golfer Alberto Ochoa shot a 77.

DALLAS NATIVES JOHNSON, THOMAS NOW FRIENDS, KNICKS TEAMMATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Larry Johnson has a vivid memory of his first
encounter with Kurt Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1995, just before Thomas' rookie NBA season. Johnson
was working out on the SMU track, and Thomas was also there,
boasting about leading the NCAA in scoring and rebounding as a TCU
senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt's got a mouth on him,'' Johnson said yesterday. ``He was
hyped and was saying, `I'll bust your ... I'll bust your ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about to run around the track,'' Johnson said. ``But
Kurt made me go home and get my shoes, and we went to the gym and I
put a smashing on his butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas remembers that incident as if it happened yesterday.
Nowadays, though, he and Johnson have fun talking about the long
odds of their being from the same city and winding up as New York
Knicks teammates while playing in the NBA Finals for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks and San Antonio Spurs will play Game 2 of the NBA
Finals at 8 tonight at the Alamodome. The Spurs won Game 1, 89-77,
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who entered the NBA in 1991, grew up in the Dixon
Circle area of South Dallas and graduated from Skyline High School.
Thomas graduated from Hillcrest High School, and Johnson reminded
one and all that Thomas grew up with a finer pedigree than he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt's talking about he's from Oak Cliff, but Kurt's from
North Dallas,'' Johnson said, while laughing. ``He didn't grow up
in the 'hood.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been so attached to Dixon Circle _ one of Dallas'
more depressed areas _ that he has purchased a lot of property
there. He also helped finance the Larry Johnson Recreation Center,
which opened last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some Dallasites have criticized Thomas for going back on his
word after he told Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson he
was going to sign a one-year, $1 million contract with the
Mavericks in January. Thomas instead signed a two-year, $3.67
million contract with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, whose career has been riddled with injuries, said the
Mavericks should have offered him a more lucrative contract. As
evidence, he cited the six-year, $33 million contract the Mavericks
gave point guard Steve Nash, and the six-year, $14.2 million deal
they awarded Erick Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   ``\R(The Mavericks\S take chances and pay guys $33 million,''
Thomas said. ``No names need to be mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another guy \RStrickland\S that they took a chance on,
and he got 14-something million dollars. You just can't find
6-foot-9 players who can do the things that I can do out there on
the floor, offensively and defensively, and not be willing to take
a chance with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he wouldn't mind coming back to the Mavericks and
playing for Nelson, Thomas said: ``I don't really know if Nellie is
going to be in Dallas. But I'm going to always be in Dallas, even
if they hate me in Dallas. I have too much family and too much love
for the city, so they can't kick me out.''
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, Thomas and Johnson both tried to contain the Spurs'
Tim Duncan, but to no avail. Duncan finished with 33 points and 16
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas shined in other areas, with 13 points and 16 rebounds.
Meanwhile, Johnson played on a bad right knee and was limited to
five points and one rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thomas and Johnson have become fast friends as they
experience the finest moment of their basketball careers. They even
have the same personal trainer, Ken Roberson of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go up to the Redbird gym and watch him play against
all of the other guys,'' Thomas said of Johnson. ``When I first
really met him, we did get to play and he kicked my butt, and I
learned from that and just continued to work on my game.''

RUSE AT BORDER: BORROWED CHILDREN EASE ILLEGAL PASSAGE  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to replace phrase ``aliens'' with ``illegal immigrants''
throughout story; subs 19th graf for insert concerning whereabouts
of baby used in ruse; subs headline) (sw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Agent Griselda Vidrio had just wandered
into the U.S. Border Patrol's processing center after several hours
patroling the weed-girded Rio Grande when she caught sight of the
young Honduran couple and the seven-month-old baby in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is with a baby, you see one and you go up to
them,'' Ms. Vidrio, a border agent, said. ``The baby looked at me
and smiled and something struck me. I knew that baby. I had held it
in my arms. I thought, no, this baby has already been here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vidrio's memory flash on March 31 led to uncovering a
smuggling network that, U.S. officials said, had been doing
something they had suspected was occurring with increasing
frequency along the border _ the use of infants and young children,
perhaps kidnapped, perhaps rented from impoverished parents, as
living props to bamboozle border agents.
</P>
<P>
   The baby ruse is just the latest wrinkle in the game of
cat-and-mouse between border agents and illegal-immigrant
smugglers, a game that has only intensified following recent
federal crackdowns and dramatic rises in the number of agents along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers, it seems, have discovered an inadvertent loophole on
the U.S. border. If illegal immigrants are taken in custody and
claim to be a family, especially with babies or young children,
they are simply cut loose and asked to report for a later court
date, as there are no facilities for housing families on the border
and agents say they do not want to split up families.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of letting families go began several years ago, but
has become more frequent since thousands of Central Americans have
tried to get into the United States in in the wake of Hurricane
Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that most of them don't show up for their court
date, but we do it for humanitarian reasons, because we don't have
the facilities and it's better than breaking up the family,
especially one that's already suffered something like Hurricane
Mitch,'' said Fernando Quiroja, who initially spearheaded the baby
investigation in Brownsville until it was transferred to the
federal antismuggling unit in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   This latest, particularly ugly wrinkle in the struggle between
smugglers and border agents picked up steam after a recent U.S.
crackdown along the border that has seen agents grow in number in
some stations by threefold. In Brownsville, the 18-month-old
Operation Rio Grande has increased the size of the locally based
force to more than 350. When Quiroja first joined the Brownsville
station a dozen years ago, there were fewer than 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Border Patrol is without doubt a more formidable presence
around here,'' said Ivan Welker, Brownsville's assistant city
manager. ``Back before Operation Rio Grande, down at the municipal
golf course near the border, golfers would routinely see groups of
people who had crossed the river coming out of the trees and
trotting across the golf course. You'd always be seeing groups of
people downtown who looked like maybe they didn't belong in
downtown Brownsville. Now, you don't see that. You don't see that
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Already last summer, when South Texas and much of the nation was
caught in a vicious drought and heat wave, border agents received
gruesome evidence of the desperate lengths smugglers were forced to
go in the form of the corpses of dozens of illegal immigrants who
had been led across the border in increasingly remote areas and
died from heat and lack of water.
</P>
<P>
   In Brownsville, illegal immigrants arrested in the last year
have reported that the price of being brought across the border had
risen from an average of $300 to $500 a few years ago to an average
of $1,400 to $1,800 today. And that is for Mexican nationals coming
across. Those traveling from farther away, like Hurricane Mitch
victims, must often pay much more.
</P>
<P>
   Border agents found themselves investigating g more cases
involving the use of unexpected and expensive modes of
transportation, including planes chartered out of Brownsville's
airport. A new route sprang up to bring illegal immigrants up the
Gulf coast from Mexico using a network of boats and ferries that
connected northern Mexico with Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
   All along the border, from El Paso to the Rio Grande's mouth
near Brownsville, border agents have seen smugglers make increasing
use of the 18-wheel semis that are moving back and forth across the
border by the thousands since passage of the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't search every semi,'' Quiroja said. ``You'd back up
the whole border, and they know that. So they corrupt a few,
individual truck drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent, very typical case, a truck was found with 101
illegal immigrants hidden in its trailer. ``In cases like that, a
driver might make $100 to $500 a head,'' Quiroja said. ``Do the
math. That's $10,000 to $50,000, a lot of money. And the smugglers
are probably keeping $1,000 a head.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vidrio said she became convinced there was something fishy
about the mud-streaked infant when she spotted a turquoise and
red-bead bracelet on its right wrist, triggering the recent memory
of another Honduran illegal immigrant, a man claiming he had been
left alone with this very same infant when his wife was killed
during Hurricane Mitch. She peppered the young couple with
questions. In short order, the scheme unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The woman admitted, border officials said, that she had given
$1,000 to a smuggler in Matamoros, Mexico, just across from
Brownsville. The man had paid $1,050. They were both Honduran, but
had not known one another before they met at the smuggler's safe
house that day. They were given the baby, which they had never seen
before, and told to swim across the Rio Grande just upstream from
Brownsville and immediately give themselves up to border agents.
When being processed, they were to tell officials that they were a
family. Once given their court date and released, they were to
travel by bus to Houston and call the smuggler's accomplice from
the bus station.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was federal agents who called the number from the
Houston bus station. They arrested two men who arrived in response
to the call, both of whom were identified by the illegal
immigrants, now material witnesses in the federal probe, as among
the smugglers they had seen in Matamoros. The investigation led to
a Houston apartment where another woman was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the couple who are the apparent real parents of
the infant walked into a Houston police station to report their
child kidnapped. They were taken into custody, and federal
officials suspect that they had actually rented the baby several
times to the smugglers, probably for as little as a few hundred
dollars. The baby is now with Child Protective Services in
Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury has been hearing the case in Houston and
was expected to hand down indictments, perhaps including the
infant's mother, as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials say they have uncovered at least three
instances in which this particular infant was used by smugglers,
but suspect it had been used even more often _ just as they suspect
that the same ruse, involving other children, is being used with
increasing frequency up and down the border, partly in response to
the federal crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vidrio said she was particularly incensed by the callous way
the baby was treated. In none of the three known cases, did the
phony parents carry extra diapers or a change of clothes for the
infant, or more than one bottle of infant formula. And they just
hopped into the Rio Grande and swam across the river with the baby.
``You can imagine what that baby must have gone through,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is apparently worth it to the smugglers who must find new
ways to circumvent the federal crackdown along the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of when you build a better mousetrap, the mice
have to get smarter,'' Quiroja said.

KNICKS' TASK: HOLD THE MIRACLES AND DEVISE A PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Knicks began Game 1 with the dreamy look of a
team that had put its faith in fairy tale endings and wishes upon
stars. If the team just believed hard enough, everything would come
true.
</P>
<P>
   But as Wednesday night unfolded, destiny ran into reality. The
magnitude of Tim Duncan's performance, David Robinson's presence
and Jaren Jackson's dispiriting 3-pointers has put the Knicks into
unfamiliar territory as Game 2 of the National Basketball
Association finals looms Friday night at the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' underdog attitude wasn't enough to continue their
momentum-stealing tricks that had left them ahead in every playoff
series of their wild run. This time, the Spurs withstood the
Knicks' early threat in the fourth quarter and then methodically
picked them apart during a 13-4 run that led to an 89-77 poke at
the Knicks' confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it might wake them up a little bit, but it's not
going to kill their confidence,'' Robinson said Thursday after the
Spurs' practice session. ``They're going to come in with high
energy, but now they realize they're in with a team that's going to
fight them every bit of the way. We won the Western Conference. We
didn't win it for nothing. We played good basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe they were a little surprised that we were able
to take control of the game like that. But it's one game. They're
not going to be totally discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the Knicks' nature. They didn't exactly know how they
were going to create open shots against the Spurs, or how they were
going to guard the Twin Towers without landing in the hopeless foul
trouble they found in Game 1, or how they expected to hold up when
their big men were growing more injured by the minute. But somehow,
they were determined to find a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one game,'' the Knicks' Chris Childs said. ``With eight
minutes left, we were only down six last night. And we weren't even
playing our best. We'll see Mr. Robinson Friday night when we're at
our best.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, what goes for their best? Coach Jeff Van Gundy
was left looking at a team that keeps adding lines to its medical
chart with more injuries than the night before. During Game 1,
Chris Dudley bruised his elbow; he will play but doesn't know if
the pain and swelling will allow him to shoot, block shots or
rebound with full mobility. Marcus Camby caught a knee in his right
thigh and has a contusion that may irritate him in Game 2. And
Larry Johnson, who was at the mercy of Duncan and Robinson in Game
1, will continue to play on a sprained knee that needs two or three
weeks of rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough on everyone,'' Dudley said. ``But we have to fight
through it and pull off a miracle for Patrick Ewing's ring.''
</P>
<P>
   More than miracles, they need a plan. The Knicks need their
remaining big men to be just as aggressive but not reckless in
putting Duncan and Robinson on the free-throw line. They need
Latrell Sprewell to run free on the break but be less frantic in
the halfcourt after finishing Game 1 shooting nine for 24, with 19
points, six turnovers and a couple of mental lapses on defense that
allowed Jackson to open up for 3-pointers down the stretch. They
need Allan Houston to shake off the fatigue that seemed to sap him
near the end of his 43-minute night and keep driving and kicking
the ball out.
</P>
<P>
   And both Sprewell and Houston need to be undaunted by the
shot-blocking prowess of Duncan and Robinson and keep going to the
basket. In Game 1, Houston went to the free-throw line five times,
while Sprewell didn't go at all. As important as Houston and
Sprewell are, the Knicks are at their best when they make the extra
pass, find Kurt Thomas for open jumpers on the pick-and-roll and
hit Johnson on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spree and myself, we can't take all the burden to get it
done,'' Houston said. ``I think that's kind of what happened last
night when we got into foul trouble.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The fouls left the big men tentative. Camby was lively but
played just 23 minutes because of foul trouble. Johnson and Thomas
were also limited with fouls. But the conundrum in facing Duncan
and Robinson goes beyond the issue of foul management. If the
Knicks defend Duncan from behind, he can maintain his post position
and score. If he is doubled, he can pass to the open man for a
3-pointer. If the Knicks defend Duncan from the front, he has great
hands to receive a lob pass inside from Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   So then what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was just thinking about that,'' Van Gundy said, and
then added: `'You're not going to do anything radical. You have to
do certain minor things that can help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Things could change before game time, but Van Gundy was planning
on sticking to his Game 1 lineup. As he explained, he needs
Sprewell to start for scoring purposes and knows Johnson could not
keep up with Sean Elliott's quickness at small forward. And he
wants Johnson at power forward despite his mismatch with Duncan or
Robinson because his knee will tighten up if he sits too long.
Besides, Duncan's 33 points was not the burning issue with Van
Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Duncan is playing,'' Van Gundy said, `'there's not a
man on the planet that can stop him. I don't think his 33 beat us
as much as the foul trouble that him and Robinson forced upon us
and then Jackson's 17 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson hit three of four 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to
help the Spurs pull away. But that shot was there all night. At
alternating moments, Sprewell, Childs, Houston and Ward left
shooters like Elliott, Mario Elie and Steve Kerr wide open by being
slow on their rotations or losing their man in transition. As it
turned out, those three hit just one for five from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   When it ended, it didn't matter. Duncan, Robinson and Jackson
were plenty to open the Knicks' eyes to a challenge they may not
have grasped before Game 1 began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been behind in a series, so this is new for us,''
Childs said. ``But we're still loose, still fired up. We feel that
if we come out with a better game plan and play a lot harder, that
we have an excellent opportunity of winning one here.''
</P>
<P>
   They still believe.

FIDELITY RAISES $1 BILLION IN BOND SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments sold $1 billion in long-term debt Thursday
amid strong demand from institutions, which for the first time got
a detailed look at the giant fund company's finances.
</P>
<P>
   The bond sale, which was raised by $250 million from the
original $750 million, was priced so Fidelity will pay an interest
rate about 150 basis points higher than comparable Treasury bonds,
a yield reflecting investor confidence in the company, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   In documents circulated to prospective investors before the
sale, the company, which normally discloses little detail about its
operations, provided financial information that financial analysts
said suggested its total market value if it were publicly traded
would top $30 billion. Among the disclosures was that the company's
cash flow this year could be more than $2 billion before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization.
</P>
<P>
   Most striking perhaps is that Fidelity's fast-growing brokerage
business could garner a market valuation approaching that of the
company's core mutual fund and money-management business.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage business, with 2.6 million online accounts and an
average of 75,000 online transactions a day, is on pace to generate
more than $1 billion in revenue this year. If that revenue were
valued along the same lines as the revenues of Charles Schwab Co.
or E(ASTERISK)Trade Group, the Fidelity unit could have a
stand-alone market value of $12 billion to $15 billion, analysts
said, even after the 40 percent decline in online brokerage stocks
the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the luck of the draw, that brokerage business is worth
significantly more than the money management business, on a
multiple basis,'' said Dean Eberling, research director at Putnam,
Lovell, de Guardiola and Thornton in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's money-management business would be worth $15 billion
to $25 billion, analysts said, or 2 to 3 percent of its $800
billion in assets based on the valuations of public mutual fund
companies. Its majority stake in Colt Telecom Group PLC, a British
telecommunications concern that is publicly traded, is worth an
estimated $7.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Fidelity's offering were first reported in The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The bond sale has prompted speculation that Fidelity wants to
assess its potential valuation if chairman Edward C. Johnson III,
whose family owns about 49 percent of Fidelity's voting stock, ever
wants to take the company public or sell a piece to a large bank or
Wall Sreet firm. A public offering, analysts noted, could help
retain key employees who have equity stakes. It could also make it
easier for Johnson's daughter Abigail to take control of the
company, though Ms. Johnson, a senior Fidelity executive, already
owns 24.5 percent of the voting stock.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity officials reiterated Thursday that there were no plans
to sell anything. ``We really do like our private status,'' said
Tom Eidson, a company spokesman. ``We have absolutely no intention
of going public or selling off parts of the company, merging, or
making a large acquisition. It's just not in the cards.''
</P>
<P>
   In the debt offering led by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Fidelity
issued $750 million worth of 30-year bonds priced to yield 7.57
percent, and $250 million of 20-year bonds at 7.49 percent, yields
that compare with blue-chip financial services companies.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, which has had about $1.5 billion in capital
expenditures in the last three years, has earmarked the funds for
technology, Internet operations and an expansion of its Texas
back-office operations, which is expected to cost several hundred
million dollars alone, according to people close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the factors driving this debt offering is the fact that
this can no longer be viewed as an industry that is not capital
intensive,'' said Burton Greenwald, a mutual-fund industry
consultant in Philadelphia. Companies like Fidelity, he said, are
now ``playing in a global environment and competing against a
handful of giant financial services organizations, driving the need
for capital for both more technology and marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line trading ventures have grabbed some of the spotlight in
recent months away from the mutual fund industry. But Fidelity's
ability to place this debt on fairly favorable terms,'' Greenwald
said, ``certainly suggests that some very sophisticated investors
are still extremely optimistic about the future of the fund
industry.''

SCREAMING LORD SUTCH, ECCENTRIC EVEN FOR ENGLAND, DIES AT 58  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Screaming Lord Sutch, the leader of the Official
Monster Raving Loony party, who delighted even the victims of his
lampooning of British politics over three decades, has died in
London. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   He was discovered hanged in his North London home on Wednesday
afternoon by his partner, Yvonne Elwood. Friends told the police
that he had been on medication to offset recurring bouts of
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in howlingly unfashionable clothes and armed with a
rusty bullhorn, he campaigned in more than 40 elections, losing
them all but winning for himself the appreciation of a society with
a fondness for eccentrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the man who brought gaiety to politics and pricked the
pomposity of politicians,'' said his friend, Harry Greenway, a
former Conservative member of Parliament. Among the tributes to him
Thursday was one from 10 Downing Street, where a spokesman for the
prime minister's office said: ``Screaming Lord Sutch will be much
missed. For many years he made a unique contribution to British
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in his standard campaign uniform of top hat and
oversized jacket in gold lame or a leopard-skin pattern, he
campaigned under the party slogan ``Vote for insanity _ you know it
makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw only one of his campaign pledges make it onto the statute
books _ lowering the voting age to 18. The rest were notable for
their merry ring of sheer nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to know why there was only one Monopolies
Commission. He proposed breeding fish in wine so they could be
harvested ready-pickled. He said the European Union should take the
famous mountain of butter that was created by overregulation of
dairies and turn it into a ski slope. He proposed heated toilet
seats for pensioners and no closing hours for pubs.
</P>
<P>
   During the prime ministership of Margaret Thatcher, he said he
felt compelled to change his group's name to the Raving Sensible
Party on the ground that by comparison with her ministers, his
membership was no longer loony at all.
</P>
<P>
   Party members arrived at one convention in a balloon so they
could propose pie in the sky, and their victory parties, always
held before the elections, were enlivened by the party dance, the
Cabinet Reshuffle. He detested joggers and said they ought to be
put to good social use by being made to power treadmills to
generate cheap electricity.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed extending branches from the Channel Tunnel to the
islands of Guernsey and Jersey so all of Britain could be declared
a tax haven. When Edinburgh and Glasgow disputed the location of
the new Scottish Parliament, he proposed putting it on wheels and
moving it from city to city.
</P>
<P>
   With his sense of the theatrical, Sutch entered his first race
for Parliament in 1964 from Stratford-on-Avon. Quite by accident,
he set two records in British public life: He was the country's
longest-serving party leader and most frequent candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He was born David Sutch but had his name legally changed to Lord
Sutch in the 1970s. An only child, he was brought up by his mother,
Nancy, after his father, a London policeman, was killed in a
bombing attack during the blitz. She died two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sutch was said to have come by his exhibitionism through his
father and grandfather, both of whom had been soapbox orators at
Speakers Corner in Hyde Park. In the 1960s he became a minor rock
star with a group called the Raving Savages, and he continued to
raise money over the years for his election entry fees by giving
concerts and playing in clubs throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He never married but he had a son, Tristan, who is 24 and lives
in the United States, by Thann Quantrill, a former American model
who helped out in one of his early campaigns by riding naked
through a town on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, election officials raised the entry fee to keep
irreverent candidates from entering races, but it did not work _
until last week.
</P>
<P>
   The entry fee for last week's elections to the European
Parliament was $8,000, a new high, and Sutch said he could not
enter at that price. He predicted the extinction of his party,
saying, ``It's a bad day for loonies, it's a sad day for
democracy.''

BOEING DEFENDS WORK ON NAVY SUPER HORNET AGAINST CRITICAL GAO
REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A top Boeing executive took issue Thursday with a
General Accounting Office report that identified 84 deficiencies in
Boeing's new F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Wednesday, said the problems could cause
the attack fighter to fail its ongoing operational evaluation with
the U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   It recommended the Defense Department not award Boeing an $8
billion multiyear contract for 222 of the new fighters until all
the deficiencies have been corrected, incorporated into the fighter
design and successfully tested.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sears, president of Boeing's Military Aircraft and Missile
System group in St. Louis, said the attack fighter has met all its
requirements, it should pass the operational evaluation, and
multiyear funding should be approved.
</P>
<P>
   If the multiyear contract is delayed, he said, taxpayers will be
the losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This multiyear buy saves the government nearly three quarters
of a billion dollars,'' Sears told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
in an interview at the Paris Air Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I was telling a congressman, this is the Navy being a good
business manager, running their business well, saying, `We know we
are going to take these airplanes ... everything is going well ...
let's commit to the multiyear (deal) and save three quarters of a
billion dollars.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Hornet recently finished an extensive flight test
program and late last month began a six-month operational
evaluation. Based on that evaluation, the Pentagon is to decide in
March whether to begin full production.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the Navy, the F/A-18E/F is meeting all
performance,'' the GAO report said. ``We do not agree.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said the operational test schedule does not leave
enough time to fix the deficiencies before the full-rate production
decision is made.
</P>
<P>
   It identified deficiencies in the plane's performance as well as
its ability to detect enemy missiles during combat maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Hornet has the Navy's highest acquisition priority.
The Navy wants to buy 548 of the jets for an estimated $46 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A recommendation to award Boeing the multiyear Super Hornet
contract was made in an April memo to Defense Secretary William
Cohen from Jacques Gansler, the Pentagon's acquisition chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testing to date has been very successful and so far looks very
promising for a future multiyear buy,'' Gansler wrote to Cohen and
Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said a five-year purchase of 222 Super Hornets for $8.8
billion would save the Navy more than $700 million from 2002
through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The multiyear buy requires congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Even a year's delay in approving the contract would amount to a
``significant'' amount of lost savings, Sears said. That's because
earlier production planes are the most expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The multiyear contract, similar to what Boeing received to
supply 120 of its C-17 cargo transport planes to the Air Force,
would ensure production of the company's most important fighter
plane for the life of the contract. It would protect the program
against possible cuts in defense spending for fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Hornet, which is now in low-rate production in St.
Louis, is a bigger and more advanced version of the F-18C/D Hornet,
the Navy's mainstay carrier fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Hornet's fuselage is 4 feet loner than the F/A-18 C/D,
its wing is 25 percent larger to store more fuel, and it has
upgraded engines.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Hornet was designed to have a longer range and be able
to carry more weapons for either air-to-air combat or bombing
ground targets.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Hornet is one of the military's biggest arms programs
and one of Boeing's most important military airplane projects.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the Super Hornet is starting just as production is
winding down for Boeing's F-18C/D Hornet and the F-15 flown by the
Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 Boeing workers build the wings and forward fuselage
of the Super Hornet in St. Louis, where final assembly takes place.
Subcontractor Northrop Grumman builds aft and center fuselage
sections in California.
</P>
<P>
   At peak production, Boeing expects to make about 48 Super
Hornets a year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gansler's memo said the Super Hornet has met or
exceeded all key performance goals, the plane's flight test program
was not without problems.
</P>
<P>
   Something called ``wing drop'' first appeared on test flights in
early 1996. The jet would lose lift and unexpectedly roll to the
left or right during certain high-speed dogfighting maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Wing drop was just one of 29 deficiencies in the Super Hornet
cited in an operational test report last summer. All those
deficiencies have been corrected, the Navy has said.
</P>
<P>
   Sears said that in the fall of 1991, a program was put in place
to take the Super Hornet from development into production, and in
the process go through all the critical milestones that are part of
the acquisition process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single one of those milestones over the last seven and a
half years have been met, every single one,'' Sears said. ``The
airplane is meeting every technical requirement .... So if you look
at that data and say, `What is the risk of having a problem during
Opeval' (operational evaluation)?' you would have to say it is
small, because for seven and a half years, we have met every
milestone along the way. This (operational evaluation) is just one
more milestone in a very disclipined acquisition process.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the respected publication Defense Daily reported
that the Super Hornet had received approval for several minor
temporary waivers for technical issues that needed to be solved in
additional testing.
</P>
<P>
   On issue cited by Defense Daily is a strobe light that must
still be installed under the jet to identify it as an E/F, rather
than the C/D Hornet. The light will permit carrier landing
personnel to correctly set deck mechanisms for the proper airplane
weight.
</P>
<P>
   None of the issues, Defense Daily reported, involve changes in
the Pentagon's five requirements for the aircraft: increased range,
increased weapons carriage, increased growth potential, increased
survivability and increased bringback.
</P>
<P>
   Survivability refers to the plane's stealth. Bringback refers to
the ability of the plane to return with its weapons and fuel loads
to the carrier.

BRICKS, MORTAR AND SOCIOLOGY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Canada)   (af)  
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Nortel Networks consolidated its global headquarters in a
renovated building in suburban Toronto in 1997, Roy Dohner, the
vice president for real estate, wanted to see to it that the
company changed its culture as well.
</P>
<P>
   Employee surveys told him that the most irksome feature of the
company's old main office was reserved parking. ``If you had to
park very far from the front door, it might give you an indication
of the value the company placed on you,'' Dohner said. So the new
lot is general admission, and the staff is happier, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Moves like that make Dohner the very model of a modern corporate
real estate executive, according to people familiar with the field.
Today's real estate professionals do far more than just buying,
leasing and building; much of their work is collaborative _ gauging
employee happiness alongside the human resources department,
consulting with the finance people on costs and conferring
regularly with the crew in information technology. Over all, they
are a ground-level force for better morale, lower costs and higher
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   That was the talk at a recent conference for real estate
executives in Boston, sponsored by a professional association
called the International Development Research Council. And it is a
theme that many managers have picked up.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading the rest of the world of their importance to
corporate America's bottom line is a matter of survival for real
estate executives.
</P>
<P>
   The profession had a brush with extinction in the recession of
the early 1990s, when corporate downsizing and a trend toward
contracting out support functions combined to wipe out many
in-house real estate departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the clean-out period,'' said Bill Agnello, vice
president for real estate and the workplace at Sun Microsystems.
``The real estate function was at the end of the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing its rolls dwindle, the professional association began
promoting the idea that real estate can offer a competitive edge
and that real estate managers are the people pushing that edge.
</P>
<P>
   The new style addresses the human element _ Dohner's egalitarian
parking, for example, or a stress-reduction drive at Charles Schwab
&AMP; Co. that was led by the company's real estate chief, Parkash
Ahuja. To ease workers' minds about nagging personal annoyances,
Ahuja introduced on-site concierge and dry cleaning services and
asked the cafeteria to start selling take-home meals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``we have less absenteeism and employees tend to
stay longer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the work of the real estate staff can also achieve other
savings for a company.
</P>
<P>
   When Cisco Systems found that its sales representatives spent
only about 30 percent of their time in their offices, the real
estate department switched its focus from just providing square
feet of space for those employees to supporting their mobility, and
it saved $12.6 million over five years in the company's Manhattan
office through a desk-sharing arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   At Nortel, the move of offices from three Toronto locations to a
renovated former factory in Brampton, Ontario, cut occupancy costs
by two-thirds. The $50 million renovation, which included
graffiti-style art to promote a casual atmosphere, was successful
enough so that Nortel held its shareholder meeting in the new
offices, piping the proceedings to television sets around the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, real estate people want to have real estate
monuments,'' Dohner said, adding that this project was about
``people, process and productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has yet demonstrated a clear link between pretty
buildings and productive office workers. Measuring output is easy
in factories, said Marina van Overbeek, a planning and design
executive at Cisco, but gauging it in office work with a creative
element is more elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the next challenges is white-collar productivity,'' she
said. ``How does the workplace impact productivity? It may not be a
dollar measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Without an objective yardstick, executives rely on instinct.
``What's really important is what feels good for us,'' said Agnello
at Sun Microsystems. His company, with 15,000 new workers in the
last five years, is changing too fast to stay with old real estate
standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Sun's new $123 million facility in Burlington, Mass.,
individual offices are smaller than those the company had
previously, and there are more spaces for small group meetings.
Whether the design will prompt impromptu brainstorming sessions
when employees pass in the hall, as the designers hoped, remains to
be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Is ``corporate infrastructure resource management'' _ a phrase
that the International Development Research Council has registered
as a service mark _ keeping corporate real estate professionals
employed?
</P>
<P>
   At Sun, the real estate department has 140 people, as it did
five years ago. But now only a third of those workers handle
traditional property-management tasks; the rest work on research
and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   For some real estate executives, the new approach is paying off
in greater responsibility and more respect at the conference table.
Agnello now reports regularly to Sun's chief financial officer and
has the ear of the company's chairman, Scott McNealy.
</P>
<P>
   And the work of Ahuja at Schwab has grown beyond just real
estate; he now oversees all the corporate services that touch
employees, including travel and payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Although the council provides reams of literature on ``strategic
alignment'' and ``integrated management,'' it is hard to say how
many companies have embraced the new philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Buzzwords aside, experts like Michael L. Joroff, a lecturer at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a proponent of the
broader collaborative approach to real estate management, say that
technology, human resources and real estate departments will need
to collaborate more, come what may. Trends toward telecommuting and
the wider adoption of mobile communications mean that the future of
business will be ``intertwined platforms of brick and mortar and
cyberspace,'' Joroff said.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments is moving toward giving its employees cell
phones as their only telephones _ but not before it studies how
comfortable the workers will be with the setup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy technology,'' said Charlie Brenner, senior vice
president at Fidelity's Center for Applied Technology. ``It's odd
sociology.''

   Is a Stock Offering Near At an On-Line Magazine? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is Forbes Inc., publisher of the glossy business magazine,
planning to sell its Internet jewels to the public through an
initial offering?
</P>
<P>
   According to an internal memo dated May 7, Timothy Forbes, chief
operating officer, said the company was ``in discussion with
investment bankers exploring possibilities for our Internet
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some Internet analysts, a possible offering of
Forbes.com, which includes sites for several Forbes magazines,
raises the chances that other business or investment magazines,
like Smart Money, will spin off their on-line divisions as initial
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, this is a business where maintaining a talent
base is predicated on the ability to build equity,'' said Patrick
Keane, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, a research firm in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes declined to comment on a possible offering of Forbes.com.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the company said that the site _ which is free
and generally attracts a younger audience than Forbes magazine _
had about 3.3 million visitors during the 30 days that ended in
mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes.com is a rival of TheStreet.com, an on-line service in
which The New York Times Co. owns a minority stake. &QL;

   Springtime for Hedge Funds &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's been a profitable spring for many hedge fund managers. In
May, hedge funds outperformed the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index, the second month in a row that they have done so, according
to Van Hedge Fund Advisors International, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds returned 1.2 percent, on average, for the month
while the S&AMP;P 500 lost 2.4 percent. For the first five months of
the year, the average hedge fund has returned 10.7 percent, versus
6.5 percent for the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over all, hedge funds are shining in the current market
environment,'' said George P. Van, chairman of the firm. ``If the
year continues to be volatile, hedge funds could produce superior
returns and provide valuable downside protection in traditional
long-only portfolios.''
</P>
<P>
   Among United States hedge funds, the best-performing types in
May were the so-called opportunistic funds, which can use a variety
of investment approaches. Those returned 4.6 percent for the month.
The worst performers were the market timers, which switch in and
out of various asset classes to take advantage of upturns and
selloffs. They lost 3.6 percent, on average.
</P>
<P>
   For the year through May, the best class was the ``macro''
funds, which use a top-down approach to take advantage of changes
in international interest rates or currencies. Those funds returned
18.8 percent, on average, for the five months. The worst were
short-selling funds, which returned just 1.3 percent, on average. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Market-Neutral Funds: A Category Stuck in Reverse? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the newer varieties of mutual funds is called ``market
neutral.'' Such funds keep half their portfolios in stocks, usually
chosen because of attractive valuations. The other half is sold
short, meaning that the manager borrows shares and resells them,
hoping they will fall in price so they can be replaced at a lower
cost.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to produce positive returns regardless of the
market's direction.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, tracks five
market-neutral funds, none of them more than two years old. But
according to a Morningstar study, each fund has lost money from its
inception through April.
</P>
<P>
   The causes, according to Morningstar, are annual expense ratios
that top 2.0 percent on average, portfolio turnover of more than
200 percent, and poor stock-picking.

PEDREGON MOVES QUICKLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cruz Pedregon is proving to be as fast off the drag strip as he
ever was on.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1992 National Hot Rod Association Funny Car
champion parted company with Joe Gibbs Racing just three weeks ago,
he has already begun to form a new team and is expecting to compete
at the All-Star Winston No-Bull Showdown in early July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have seemed like it then, but it really wasn't a bad
thing (to leave Gibbs),'' said Pedregon, who owns some of the
quickest and fastest passes ever in the Funny Car division. ``It
just set the stage for my future. I've known for a long time that I
wanted to own the next car I drove.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon, who was rumored as a possible driver for the John
Force entry into the Top Fuel ranks, will do that. He has already
obtained a Pontiac Firebird and is now in the process of forming a
crew and securing sponsorship for his new team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've set our sights on Bristol,'' said Pedregon, who despite
missing the past two national events is still in fourth place in
the point standings. ``We're burning the midnight oil, doing
whatever it takes to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon's quick formation of his new team has been no surprise
to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was preparing for it all along,'' said Pedregon's older
brother, Frank, himself a driver in the Funny Car wars. ``It was a
surprise to some (that he wanted to leave to form his own team),
but not really for him. There's always been this talk that Gibbs
might just go on and stick with NASCAR. So Cruz was at the
position, `Hey, I'd better start looking into that.' And now is as
good a time as any.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll run Bristol, run a few races this year and get ready for
a hard charge at 2000.'
</P>
<P>
   A change in drivers did little to alter the lack of
starting-line performance of the Gibbs' Funny Car.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Top Fueler Tommy Johnson Jr.'s debut at this past
weekend's Pontiac Excitement Nationals saw him lose on a hole shot
in the first round. Johnson ran a 5.083-second pass compared to
Frank Burkart's winning 5.087.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the first round my main concern was to keep the car
straight,'' Johnson said. ``I was having trouble getting used to
the steering in qualifying and as a result I wasn't keeping the car
in the groove. When I got to the starting line (Sunday) I gave more
thought about keeping the car in the narrow grove than leaving on
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also didn't expect Burkart to make the kind of run he did.
Give him credit, he made his best run of the weekend when it
counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Covina's Andy Manna Jr. doubled up on opposition this past
weekend, winning at both the Federal Mogul All-Star race on
Saturday and the Pontiac Excitement Nationals on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Manna, who competes in the NHRA Competition eliminator sportsman
class, defeated Mike Saye in the Federal Mogul All-Star final with
a 8.536-second pass. He then ripped off a 8.503 to defeat Robert
Bailey in the Competition Eliminator final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Higa, a resident of Millani, Hawaii, and Adam Saruwatari
were the big winners last weekend at the IDRC West Coast Nationals
at Pomona Raceway.

 WASHINGTON: blatantly unconstitutional.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York City also raised constitutional
questions. ``Whose Ten Commandments?'' he asked. ``Which version?
The Catholic version? The Protestant version? Or the Jewish
version?''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in 1980 declared unconstitutional a Kentucky
law requiring that a copy of the Ten Commandments be posted in
every public school classroom. The court held that the law violated
the constitutional separation of church and state, serving neither
a ``secular legislative purpose'' nor an educational function.
</P>
<P>
   In other votes touching on religion, the House overwhelmingly
approved measures allowing the use of religious language in
memorials on school grounds and allowing religious organization to
compete for government social service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   A day after rejecting an effort to impose a prison term on those
selling violent entertainment to teenagers, lawmakers also debated
and approved several measures that served primarily to make
Congress' displeasure with the entertainment industry known. One of
these proposals directed the surgeon general to prepare a report on
the effects of interactive video games on youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   The House also overwhelming approved a non-binding resolution by
Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., calling the entertainment industry
irresponsible in its marketing to youth and urging it to curtail
``portrays of pointless acts of brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can there be any doubt at all that the entertainment industry
has contributed to the culture of violence that has manifested
itself in Colorado, in Georgia, in Jonesboro, Arkansas?'' asked
Rep. Joe Knollenberg, R-Mich., listing sites of recent school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   California Democrats complained that the resolution was too
broad. ``Don't condem a whole industry,'' said Rep. Howard Berman
of California, protesting ``blanket guilt by association.'' Rep.
Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., shot back sarcastically, ``I suppose the
Democrats would never condemn an entire industry'' _ an implied
reference to Democratic attacks on tobacco and gun manufacturers.

 &HT;    Governor appoints new Florida lottery chief
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSE, Fla. _ Florida's new lottery secretary doesn't
intend to gamble with multistate games anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position is you need to look back in your state to maximize
revenues,'' said David Griffin, a Republican appointed Thursday by
Gov. Jeb Bush to the $105,000-per-year job.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, 36, is a businessman with a law degree who rose to
assistant executive director of the Ohio Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The captain of Penn State's 1984 basketball team, Griffin, who
is married with two children, said he does not play the lottery
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin said his priorities are to run an efficient, ethical
department while studying how to increase sales that have sagged
from a $2.3 billion peak in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He leans away from multistate games such as Powerball, which
Bush recently rejected, and video lottery machines, which the
Legislature considered, but rejected this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had his eye on Griffin even before he named Sue
Cobb interim lottery secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to David in the transition and found him to be an
excellent candidate at that time,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, Griffin also served as interim director in a lottery
also suffering sales declines and similar to Florida's 12-year-old
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin excelled at negotiating contracts _ one saved the state
$1 million _ and was ``very self-confident,'' said Ohio Lottery
Director Mitchell J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown chalked up sales declines to competition from casinos and
other gambling, among other economic reasons _ not a failure of
management.
</P>
<P>
   Among the outside challenges to the lottery in Florida is gaming
operations run by Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   A change in federal rules last April allows the Secretary of the
Interior to intervene when states refuse to allow Indian tribes to
operate gambling casinos, although Florida is suing to block the
rule.

HOUSE BACKS 10 COMMANDMENTS IN SCHOOLS, THEN TURNS AGAIN TO GUN
CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs 6th graf to correct spelling of Gary Condit's name) (rm) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted Thursday to allow the Ten
Commandments to be posted in schools, and then turned to a tense
debate over the most significant gun control legislation to come
before it in in five years.
</P>
<P>
   With both parties searching for an answer to school violence,
gun regulation came center-stage after two long days of sometimes
impassioned clashes over God, values, the entertainment industry
and the Constitution. That debate culminated Thursday night in
287-139 vote to pass a wide-ranging bill that would provide $1.5
billion for fighting juvenile crime and enact tough new mandatory
sentences for young people in gun crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In a significant victory for social conservatives, the House
voted 248-180 to include in the crime bill an amendment sponsored
by Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., giving states the right to allow
the display of the Ten Commandments in public places, including
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, the House turned to a separate bill on gun
control, which is the preferred political ground of the Democrats.
A dozen separate gun amendments were under consideration, running a
gamut from a measure requiring child safety devices to be sold with
handguns to a proposal to repeal the District of Columbia's ban on
the possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant showdown was over rival measures of varying
strictness to regulate sales of weapons at gun shows, at which
collectors and hobbyists selling firearms are not currently
required to conduct the kinds of background checks on buyers that
licensed dealers are.
</P>
<P>
   In a fierce lobbying blitz, President Clinton arose at 5 a.m. in
Paris to telephone four wavering Democrats: Gary Condit and Mike
Thompson of California, Marion Berry of Arkansas and Ron Kind of
Wisconsin to urge them to vote for a gun show amendment sponsored
by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was shot to death
by a gunman on the Long Island Railroad in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy for the United States to be the only advanced
country in the world that doesn't take comprehensive, sensible,
thorough steps to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals,''
Clinton told reporters in Paris. ``It's just _ it doesn't make any
sense.'' To hammer home the point, the White House sent Attorney
General Janet Reno to the Capitol late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority
whip of Texas, shored up support among conservatives for a weaker
version sponsored by another Democrat, Rep. John Dingell of
Michigan, who is a former member of the NRA board.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell _ whose victory would be a blow to the president and the
Democratic congressional leadership _ insisted that he was going to
win. He said that Clinton would not make headway with conservative
Democrats because ``he cost us control of the House and a lot of
people remember that.'' The Republicans won the majority in 1994,
months after Congress enacted a ban on assault weapons avidly
sought by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the NRA has largely held sway on Capitol Hill. But
after the shocking school shooting in Littleton, Colo., the Senate
last month _ with Vice President Gore casting the tie-breaking vote
_ approved a proposal that would compel all vendors at gun shows,
licensed or unlicensed, to run such checks. Law enforcement
officials are given three business days to complete the checks.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell's version on gun shows is much less stringent. It
narrowly defines what constitutes a gun show, and only 24 hours
would be allotted for background checks. Mrs. McCarthy's version
largely mirrors the Senate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the procedures for the debate, Dingell's measure was to be
considered first, and both sides considered it the most likely to
pass. But even a majority vote does not guarantee its survival. If
Mrs. McCarthy's amendment also wins a majority vote, it trumps the
Dingell proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, Reps. McCarthy, Nita M. Lowey of New
York and Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut made last-ditch phone calls to
undecided colleagues from Mrs. McCarthy's office. And Mrs. McCarthy
and Ms. Lowey even agonized over the order of the speech-making to
come on the floor, as if that might decide the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats expected about 45 of their members from the South and
West to vote with Dingell. Gun control advocates thought they had
30 Republicans firmly on their side. That left the outcome of the
vote in the hands of about two dozen wavering lawmakers, most of
them Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of this debate have become so convoluted that no
matter which gun show measure prevails, final passage of a gun
control bill remains in doubt. No one could predict whether
conservatives _ even those who join Dingell to water down gun shows
language _ will vote for the legislation if any other gun
restrictions also prevail. Liberals, on the other hand, are likely
to bolt if Mrs. McCarthy's proposal fails.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The two parties were already preparing to blame each other if an
odd coalition of conservatives and liberals caused the legislation
to collapse. ``If Republicans cynically vote for Dingell and
against the bill then their strategy is no gun safety,'' charged
Rep. Stenny Hoyer, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said of the final bill, ``the less gun control, the more
apt it is to pass.'' And Dingell refused to say whether he would
vote for the final measure if his amendment prevailed, but other
gun control provisions like a child safety device or a raise in the
minimum age for all handgun purchases from 18 to 21 also were
approved.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday and early Thursday the House approved a variety
of measures signaling support, sometimes symbolic and sometimes
more concrete, for public expressions of religion. The debate over
the Ten Commandments was the most spirited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that simply posting the Ten Commandments will not
instantly change the moral character of our nation,'' Aderholt, the
measure's sponsor, said just before midnight Wednesday. ``However,
it is an important step to promote morality and an end of children
killing children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., displayed the copy of the Ten Commandments
he hangs in his office. He repeatedly mentioned God and argued that
display of the commandments did not _ as his critics charged _
violate the Constitutional guarantee of separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in these Ten Commandments that reaches out
and grabs somebody and forces them to abide by any particular
religious belief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of Congress disagreed. ``This amendment seeks to
elevate one particular religion over all others,'' said Rep. Robert
Scott, D-Va. ``This singling out of one religion is contrary to the
American ideal of religious tolerance and is blatantly
unconstitutional.''

 &HT;    Millwood perfectly fine vs. Astros
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Forget that they've been the most consistent starters
for the top two pitching staffs in the National League. The
strikingly different personalities of Kevin Millwood and Jose Lima
are what made Thursday night's game interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood's laid-back style won out over Lima and his
demonstrative act on the mound in the Braves' 8-5 win. Millwood
flirted with a no-hitter for the second time in his last three
starts, struck out a season-high 11 and drove in two runs.
</P>
<P>
   An early exchange over an errant Millwood pitch up and in to
Lima gave the game an undercurrent that added to a meeting between
division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As the Braves won the series 3-1, Millwood backed up wins by Tom
Glavine and Greg Maddux by outpitching both of them, which wasn't
easy to do. He had a perfect game through six innings before giving
up back-to-back singles to Craig Biggio and Bill Spiers to start
the seventh. The Astros broke up the shutout that inning on a
run-scoring fielder's choice by Carl Everett and a Millwood wild
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Braves offense took out a little of its hitting
frustation on Lima, the National League's winningest pitcher this
year with 11. Atlanta piled up 10 hits and a season-high seven runs
against him and ended his night after six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez matched his career high with four hits, including a
home run and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   With memories of last Saturday's first-inning pounding by
Baltimore fresh in his mind, Millwood worked the first inning
against Houston very carefully. He struck out Jeff Bagwell on three
pitches, and continued that trend by setting down the next 15
batters. Not until Biggio lined his first pitch of the seventh into
center was the no-no done.

SUBURBAN GROWTH DRIVES WILDLIFE INTO POPULATED AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After wandering at least 100 miles, a 175-pound black bear found
its way into the heart of the business district of West Haven,
Conn., about 2 a.m. on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Some police officers, all rookies at capturing a downtown bear,
gave chase, imitating barking dogs as they ran. Their first yelps
were feeble, recalled West Haven's animal control officer, Judy
Rettig. ``They were barking like Chihuahuas,'' she said. ``I said,
`Rottweilers, men, Rottweilers!'''
</P>
<P>
   The bear dashed through the parking lot of a video store, past
some startled students outside their dormitory at the University of
New Haven, and up a tree. In short order, the bear was
tranquilized, tagged and transferred to the woods of northwestern
Connecticut, almost a year after conservationists in New York state
tagged it deep in the Catskill Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rettig is plenty busy these days. Once she was simply West
Haven's dog warden. But the job description grew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just do dogs anymore,'' she said. ``Now we're bear
control, raccoon control, possum control. You name it. No day is
the same anymore. You never know what you're going to catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the New York region, wildlife biologists and
ecologists echo her sentiments. The world of wildlife is far
different from what it was a generation ago, as more housing eats
into once distant wilderness. All sorts of species no longer stay
secluded in deep woods. They are popping up in odd spots: moose on
the developing outer fringes of suburbia; coyotes, fox, deer and
the ubiquitous Canada geese in older suburban towns; bears and
turkeys in cities.
</P>
<P>
   Development has disturbed the instincts of animals and their
natural fear of people, wildlife experts say. The steady push of
people into once-rural areas has eroded woodland habitats and
reduced the open space for yearlings and weaned animals as they
follow their instincts and leave their birthplaces to search for
their own turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what's in front of them,'' said James
Applegate, a wildlife ecologist at Cook College, part of Rutgers
University in New Jersey. ``Now, in any direction it heads, it will
run into trouble sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Kilpatrick, a biologist with the Connecticut Department
of Environmental Protection, said that animals ``just wander
randomly.'' A meandering animal ``has no perception of what's down
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William Weber, a wildlife ecologist with the Wildlife
Conservation Society, based at the Bronx Zoo, said that the
animals' final destinations are a matter of chance. ``Some of them
head in the right direction and they wind up in other forest,'' he
said. ``Some wind up in suburbia. If we just keep clearing
everything and animals keep getting squeezed, they're going to
disappear, or they'll settle in our own backyards.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Smallwood, an ecologist at the University of Richmond,
notes that a ``behavioral evolution'' has enabled animals to live
more comfortably than their predecessors near houses and humans.
``I strongly suspect some of what we're seeing with this wildlife
invasion is changes of behavior by cultural evolution,'' he said.
``They're learning how to get along in the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   If these vagabond animals feel safe to eat and breed in a new
domain near people, they will stay, experts say. ``They'll learn to
eat what you plant in your backyard,'' said Susan Predl, a wildlife
biologist with the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection.
</P>
<P>
   For years, deer have roamed Barbara and Nick Van De Giesen's
front yard in the Bergen County borough of Old Tappan, N.J. Over
the Memorial Day weekend, a doe jumped the fence surrounding their
backyard and gave birth. At first, the doe nursed the fawn in the
seclusion of white pines and underbrush at the rear of the yard.
Now the feedings occur in the unsheltered front yard.
</P>
<P>
   Once, moose were content to stay in northern New York and
northern New England. But in the last two years, their wandering
has taken them to Kingston, N.Y.; Branchville, in northwestern New
Jersey, and northern Connecticut. Last June, a 500-pound female
moose meandered all the way to Old Saybrook on the Connecticut
coast before a car hit and killed it on Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
   Peregrine falcons, once nearly extinct, now nest on bridges and
office buildings in New York City and thrive on the flocks of
pigeons. A pair of red-tailed hawks has a nest on a luxury
apartment building at Fifth Avenue and 74th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Wild turkeys are thriving in the region because of
rehabilitation programs started in the 1980s. In late winter, eight
wild turkeys rummaged around the suburban homes in West Orange,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Like the red-tailed hawks, turkeys have reached New York City.
They were spotted this year at Orchard Beach in the Bronx, on ball
fields in nearby City Island and at the Bronx Zoo near the flamingo
pen.
</P>
<P>
   Even coyotes, normally shy and furtive, are just about
everywhere in the region, wildlife ecologists and biologists said.
On April Fool's Day, one found its way to Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very, very adaptable, much more adaptable than we
thought 30 years ago,'' said Robert Eriksen, supervisor in charge
of wildlife control for New Jersey's environmental department.
Normally, coyotes eat rabbits, squirrels and other small wild
animals. But Eriksen and other experts cautioned that pet cats left
out at night are becoming a favorite prey.
</P>
<P>
   Weber said that coyotes are starting to ``behave like wolves''
and form hunting packs on the edges of the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, deer have made it to urban areas like
Elizabeth, N.J., and East Rutherford, near Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And black bears are not only reaching West Haven; some have also
made it to downtown New Brunswick and Trenton. Last Friday, a bear
was spotted in Morristown, N.J., near the town's busiest stores.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, calls about nuisance bears have increased from 15 to
330 a year in a seven-county region of southern New York just north
of New York City, including Westchester, Rockland and Orange, said
Dick Henry, a big-game biologist with the state's Department of
Environmental Conservation. He estimates that there are 4,000 bears
in the state. Glenn Cole, a wildlife biologist who is Henry's
colleague, recalls a black bear that broke through the screen door
of a house near Kingston and helped itself to a fresh apple pie and
some cookies on a kitchen counter, before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's bear population is estimated at 30 to 60, double
the estimate in 1994. Paul Rego, a state wildlife biologist, said
that in the first five months of this year, the state received 70
calls of bear sightings, up from 25 in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since New Jersey banned bear hunting in 1971, the state's bear
population has doubled to about 600, and some seem to be getting
more aggressive toward other animals, said Dave Chanda, a state
wildlife biologist. Earlier this year, he said, a bear killed a
llama in a pen in Rockaway Township.
</P>
<P>
   People in southern New York are increasingly gripped with
``bearanoia,'' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, the people fear they'll eat the kids and
eat the house,'' he said. ``Bears live around people a lot better
than people live around bears.'' Henry said black bears are not
known to bite or cuff at people unless people try to touch them.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, environmental officials in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut have prepared leaflets with tips on reducing encounters
with bears. Bears are attracted to the grain in bird feeders, bee
hives, table scraps left on compost piles, uncovered garbage cans
and greasy barbecue grills.

CHURCH LEADERS URGE SERBS TO STOP FLIGHT FROM KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
(subs 31st graf to note British estimate of 10,000 civilian
deaths) (rm)

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ At the Gracanica monastery, the holiest
site in eastern Kosovo, leaders of the Serbian Orthodox Church and
a NATO general joined Thursday night to implore some 2,000 anxious
Serbs to remain in Kosovo rather than follow the thousands who have
fled in long convoys behind withdrawing Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Pavle, Serbian Orthodoxy's highest-ranking cleric,
urged Serbs not to sacrifice the efforts of their forebears to keep
Kosovo Serbian under the Ottoman occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Artemije of Rasca and Prizren called on them to trust
in the peacekeeping forces, known as KFOR, to be patient and to
remain at home for a few days, saying: ``So my message is that our
national interest is to stay in our homes and in our churches and
in our towns and in our Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining them, with a priest translating from the balcony, was a
British major general, John Drewienkiewicz, who said: ``KFOR is
here for all the communities of Kosovo, and that means every one of
you. You live here, and you belong here.'' He promised that an
agreement being worked out ``would lead to the demilitarization of
the so-called KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Drewienkiewicz was chief of operations of the Kosovo
Verification Mission, run by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As Yugoslav forces completed their withdrawal from the south of
Kosovo, the NATO-led peacekeeping forces have been slow to move
into the west of the province, near the Albanian border, creating a
vacuum of authority that has led Serbian civilians to flee, fearing
revenge from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Artemije himself fled the city on Wednesday, despite the
presence of German troops, NATO and U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting here Thursday with the bishop and the patriarch,
the foreign military and political leaders promised all possible
efforts to show their evenhandedness and to convince the minority
Serbs that they will be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Michael Jackson, the commander of KFOR, and Sergio Vieira
de Mello, the special representative of the U.N. secretary general,
apparently failed to convince Bishop Artemije to return immediately
to Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   But he promised Thursday that he would return when security
improves. He was sharply critical of NATO, nonetheless, for
allowing attacks on Serbs fleeing from Prizren, saying: ``Armed
members of the KLA in uniform in the center of the town disarmed
Serbs, kidnapped them and mistreated them,'' and he said that a
priest was arrested by the KLA ``and we don't know where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Vieira de Mello also appeared on Kosovo state
television with local leaders to reassure the Serbs and answer
questions from viewers.
</P>
<P>
   They have met with Albanian political leaders of all stripes,
including Jakup Krasniqi, the political spokesman for the KLA,
urging patience, calm and reconciliation, even as the military is
working out an understanding with the insurgents on how they will
be demilitarized.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Vieira de Mello, who is in charge of
the civilian life of Kosovo, said that the future of the KLA is
political, not military.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no point engaging in this whole operation unless the
ultimate objective is to transform Kosovo into a model of
multiparty democracy that settles arguments without guns,'' he
said. ``So the KLA will become a political force with whatever name
it chooses, while its fighters will presumably demobilize.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the insurgents would form the backbone of a new police
force, Vieira de Mello said that there would be an international
police force set up with some 3,000 foreigners, who would recruit
and train a multiethnic police force. That force would, at least
initially, put Serbian police in Serbian areas and Albanian and
other Muslim minorities as police in their own areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those fighters who wish to apply for the new Kosovo police
force we will set up and train will be welcome to apply,'' he said
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Part of Vieira de Mello's problems are bureaucratic and
institutional. The United Nations is still trying to decide what
``interim civil authority'' means in the Security Council
resolution that governs the Kosovo settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a state within a state, giving Vieira de Mello and his
permanent successor full executive and administrative power here,
like a czar? Or is it a weaker idea, with effective power to be
shared with Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and its designated local leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The presumption here is that the United Nations will opt for a
stronger authority to keep order while a local census, elections
and institutions can be built over time to give Kosovo real
self-government and autonomy within Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For now, Vieira de Mello says he is operating with a skeleton
staff of 20 policy professionals and 10 support people, including
security, all of whom were seconded from other agencies. But now
that the United Nations, only on Monday, advanced its Kosovo
mission some $200 million, he is able to start hiring.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees has only
another 20 people to start, and various charities, like the World
Food Program and Doctors of the World, are beginning to work here
in earnest. They delivered emergency food supplies Thursday
morning, for example, to blasted Albanian villages like Stimlje and
Petrovo, where the Mother Theresa Society, the local Albanian
charity, will distribute aid to the needy, including refugees
returning home from the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is now a heavier KFOR presence along that road, which has
been the scene of heavy KLA sniping and where German and British
journalists have been wounded over the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   Fehmi Baftiu, the head of the Mother Theresa chapter in Stimlje,
said the Albanians appreciated all aid, but needed more substantial
supplies of flour, cooking oil, sugar, beans, macaroni, blankets
and even spoons and forks. ``Our reserves are spent and we could do
no planting at all,'' he said. ``We don't have milk. The Serbs even
stole our cattle and our corn.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in a medical clinic that was looted by Serbian forces,
who took all the medicines, beds and diagnostic equipment,
including an EKG machine. About 60 percent of the town of 13,000
people was burned the first night of the NATO bombing, March 24,
Baftiu said. ``That night they started to burn and shoot, whether
people were in their houses or not.'' The rampage lasted five days,
leaving Stimlje a ruin and its population mostly dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with Kosovo's reconstruction, which will be the bulk of
the world's commitment here, U.N. agencies will handle the issue of
aid; the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will
probably handle democracy training and institution-building; the
European Union will handle and pay for reconstruction of homes,
roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations will be in charge, Vieira de Mello
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The trickiest issue, he said, is how to handle civil
administration. For example, who pays the civil servants here,
Belgrade or the United Nations? What happens to local taxes? Who
collects the garbage or runs the water system? Will the Yugoslav
dinar remain the local currency, or will the informal currency
here, the German mark, become the formal one? Does Belgrade
continue to get the profits from electricity supply and from state
industries like vineyards and coal mining?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of Vieira de Mello's earliest tasks will be to appoint five
district commissioners and 29 municipal administrators to help him
run Kosovo. Each municipality will have a U.N. police commissioner
to set up the initial police force of 3,000 foreigners to take over
local policing from KFOR troops.
</P>
<P>
   The municipal administrators will appoint civil-liaison
officers, who will themselves set up local advisory councils, to
deal with residents, local leaders and civic needs and services.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is lots of work to do, more than in Bosnia or
Cambodia,'' Vieira de Mello said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain estimated Thursday that the Serbs had killed at least
10,000 civilians, and the uncovering of wartime horrors continued
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In towns like Poklek, Bruznik, Berisht and Vlastica, journalists
were shown or told of a series of killings of Albanians by the
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Lt. Col. Robin Clifford Thursday urged
journalists not to use ``emotive words like mass graves'' before
any proper forensic investigation. ``There are fresh burial
sites,'' he said. ``But remember there was a war here. It's up to
the tribunal to investigate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said that 26,000 of Yugoslavia's 40,000 troops and police had
withdrawn from Kosovo on schedule. All Serb forces must be gone by
Sunday night, while several hundred will return to guard border
posts and holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   British troops also brought journalists on a guided tour of an
interrogation center at police headquarters here. The cellar
contained knives, batons, batteries, baseball bats, brass knuckles,
a box of condoms and a sword. After the display, they cordoned the
building off for tribunal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials said it was odd that the police would have
cleared the building of every file and lightbulb but left a
so-called ``torture chamber'' to be discovered, complete with even
a chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   But KFOR's biggest victory Thursday was finally restoring the
water supply to Pristina after three hot summer days. Serbian
workers at four pumping stations fled after failing to get the
protection they sought from KFOR, and some of them disabled the
stations.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of changing times, the first two KLA soldiers
showed up at the Grand Hotel, where the Serbian army and police
often ate and worked. They were not authentic Kosovo Albanians,
however, but an English mercenary and an American Albanian who came
to offer themselves for interviews.

WINSTON WEST KEEPS GROWING
</HEADLINE>
 WEST-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE -- In NASCAR, the trickle-down theory stretches to
more than just the Busch Grand National and Craftsman Truck series.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest benefactors has been the organization's
Winston West series. The series, which is in its 45th year, has
more prize money, more rookie drivers, more returning drivers and
more publicity than ever before. The series makes its first
appearance at Irwindale on Saturday night in the Irwindale 250,
presented by Jan's Towing.
</P>
<P>
   Winston West spokesman Kevin Green says there's two simple
reasons for the upsurge in the division: money and new tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our growth has been unprecedented,'' he said. ``The series has
had its ups and downs through the years, but Winston sees potential
for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, R.J. Reynolds posted $50,000 to the series'
points fund. Last year, it boosted the fund to $300,000, the same
amount it will award this season. The overall funds are expected to
surpass $500,000 for the 14-race series this year, which will
include two Irwindale events and a season-finale points race in
Motegi, Japan. Saturday's purse is $107,526.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really like any other business,'' said series points
leader Mike Chase, who commutes from Concord, N.C. to the west to
race. ``It's supply and demand. If you have the right supply and
good luck, you can make some good money racing this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Chase, who won the series title in 1994, nor Bill
Sedgwick, who won the series title in 1991 and 1992, raced in the
series last year. Both cited the formation of the Craftsman Truck
series and money stagnations for the diluting of talent in the
series in 1994. Chase, Sedgwick, Butch Gilliland, Ron Hornaday,
Mike Skinner, Jack Sprague and Rick Carelli, now all top drivers in
the Truck and Winston Cup series, left in droves.
</P>
<P>
   But then, western superspeedways in populated areas began
popping up: California Speedway in Fontana, Las Vegas Motor
Speedway and Pikes Peak in Fountain, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracks were being built, the money came up and now there's
really good racing,'' said Chino Hills' Gilliland, who won the last
NWWS race, at Mesa Marin Speedway in Bakersfield. ``This is just
showing the growth of racing on the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer are drivers fleeing the series for any ride in any
division. Chase says he turned down a ride in the Truck series this
year to race in the NWWS. Mike Wallace, who has run in the Winston
Cup series, has raced in three of the events, winning two. The
brother of Winston Cup veterans Rusty and Kenny Wallace, and former
NWWS champion Ron Hornaday -- last year's Truck champion -- will
race in the Truck series tonight in Portland and compete at
Irwindale Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Other Winston Cup regulars to have taken part in this year's
races include Jerry Nadeau, Bobby Hamilton Jr., Ricky Craven and
Ken Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are a record 18 rookies running the series
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a newer group of kids and some really good older
drivers, like Chase, who have dropped back to Winston West,'' said
El Monte's Kenny Smith, who runs a limited NWWS schedule. ``We get
these bigger drivers here and it can be tough to run against their
(money) every race. Even in my situation (as a multi-million dollar
lottery winner), I cannot afford to run with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase said it has made it more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be probably six to eight guys who could win at
any given time,'' he said. ``Now, there's 12 to 15 guys who can win
any time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Winston West cars are similar to Winston Cup cars except for
compression ratio and tires. Approved models in both series must be
the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Pontiac Grands Prix and Ford Thunderbird
and Taurus. The car must weigh at least 3,400 pounds and have a
110-inch wheelbase.
</P>
<P>
   The differences in engine compression is 12.5:1 for Winston Cup
and 9.5:1 for Winston West. Winston West has specific tire
specifications for each track. At Irwindale, all cars must run
Goodyear W-2 on the left side and W-4 on the right side, or Hoosier
1011 on the left and 1014 on the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think drivers in our series aspire with the idea to go from
the West to the three major series, Winston Cup, Truck, and (Busch)
Grand National,'' Green said. ``Running the West is the opportunity
for them to gain experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Sedgwick says the series is a perfect training ground for
drivers.

   ``In Winston Cup or in Craftsman Trucks, if you don't qualify
each week, you can't get the experience,'' the Acton resident said.
``You go home without getting experience. In Winston West, you have
a better chance. You can work on things every week and save your
tires.''

MICKELSON SHARES LEAD BUT MAY NOT STICK AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., N.C.)   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ His wife is expecting a child June 30, and
until Tuesday morning, Phil Mickelson was not sure he would play in
this year's U.S. Open. Winning a major championship is very
important to Mickelson. But he said the birth of his first child,
and the health of his wife, Amy, rank much higher.
</P>
<P>
   So with his caddie carrying a beeper, and with a private plane
waiting to take him back to Scottsdale, Ariz., at a moment's
notice, Mickelson teed off this morning, and, for a few hours,
turned his attention from fatherhood to fairways. If his wife goes
into labor before the tournament ends, he vows he will leave, no
matter what, to be by her side. But if the beeper stays quiet, and
if Mickelson stays on the same path, his first major championship
and his first child may both arrive this month.
</P>
<P>
   Displaying the all-round talent that makes him a threat to win
here on a course that suits his skills, Mickelson finished at
three-under-par 67 and shared the first-round lead with three other
players. Joining Mickelson at 67 were David Duval, the world's No.
1-ranked player _ who performed well despite having slightly burned
his right hand last Friday _ and two players who have never
contended at a U.S. Open, Billy Mayfair and Paul Goydos.
</P>
<P>
   Five players were tied at 68, one stroke off the lead, led by
Tiger Woods, who birdied his last two holes; John Daly, who has
struggled this year but who has won two majors in his career; Payne
Stewart, the 1991 Open champion; David Berganio Jr. and Kaname
Yokoo of Japan. A host of other familiar names hovered near the
lead _ Jim Furyk, Justin Leonard, Vijay Singh and Hal Sutton are
among the 13 players at 69 _ setting up a weekend filled with
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day when Pinehurst Resort and Country Club's fabled No.
2 course proved it would be a difficult test, no matter what the
conditions. Heavy rain Wednesday night became steady rain this
morning, and it lasted until midday, softening Pinehurst's
turtleback greens. If ever a low score could be had on this
difficult course, this was the day to shoot it.
</P>
<P>
   But Pinehurst's excellent drainage system, coupled with
difficult pin placements, kept the teeth in the course, and many
players felt its wrath. By afternoon, the sun was out, the course
was drying, and it became apparent that it would be difficult for
anyone to shoot lower than 67.
</P>
<P>
   So Mickelson finished his round excited to share first place and
glad that his beeper had stayed quiet. As for the future, Mickelson
hoped that his wife's doctor was as accurate with the due date as
Mickelson was with his putter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting it to be at least June 30, possibly a little
more, according to the doctor,'' Mickelson said. ``She's seeing the
doctor every day, but with labor, you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would leave the tournament if he was tied for the
lead Sunday morning and the beeper went off, Mickelson said that he
would.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very fortunate to be able to have a child,'' said
Mickelson, who turned 29 on Wednesday. ``We thought we were going
to have problems, and it came very easily. That's something I don't
want to miss. I have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be there,
whereas the U.S. Open takes place every year. I didn't know if I
would feel that way or not. But if she punches in that code, I'm
out. I'm getting a car as soon as I can and getting to the
airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, from the first hole until the last Thursday, Mickelson
managed to focus on golf. Possessing one of the world's best short
games, Mickelson used that skill to deftly navigate his way around
Pinehurst's treacherous greens, saving strokes with his putting and
chipping in situations where many others faltered.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing to stay with his wife until the last possible moment,
Mickelson didn't arrive at Pinehurst until Tuesday night, and he
played only one practice round, on Wednesday. But he looked as if
he had been hanging around all week. He got off to a sizzling
start, making birdies on three of the first five holes. On No. 2,
he made an 18-foot putt for birdie. On the par-5 fourth, he hit a
radar-like pitching wedge approach to 8 feet that led to a birdie
putt. And then Mickelson birdied one of Pinehurst's toughest holes,
No. 5, chipping in from 25 feet off the edge of the green.
</P>
<P>
   After making bogeys at Nos. 6 and 8, Mickelson regrouped with
birdies at Nos. 13 and 14. Mickelson's putter did the trick at the
13th, where he made a splendid downhill 30-footer. Then at 14,
Mickelson hit a nice 9-iron approach shot from 135 yards to within
8 feet of the cup, setting up his birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   While Mickelson obviously had reason to be distracted, he looked
upon his late arrival this week as a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practice rounds at major tournaments are a chore,'' he
said. ``It's a six-hour round, you're supposed to sign autographs
all day, and you're trying to prepare for one of the biggest
tournaments of the year. I feel like I like I'm much fresher.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval looked fresh as well, playing in the same group with
Mickelson. After burning his right thumb and forefinger on a pot
while making tea last week, Duval arrived at Pinehurst not knowing
how much the burns would hinder him. But they did not bother him at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove the ball well, hit my irons where I was trying to, and
I made a few putts,'' said Duval, who has won 11 times since
October 1997 but who is still looking to win his first major. ``I'd
be very content to do that for three more days.''
</P>
<P>
   So would Mickelson, but first he must get the opportunity to
play for three more days. A licensed pilot, Mickelson said he might
fly the plane back to Arizona himself if his wife called, although
he had a co-pilot available.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the tournament remained wide open. The greens were
soft Thursday, yet approach shots that were not placed perfectly
still rolled off the greens, down the slopes and into trouble. So
while Mickelson was smiling after his round, he and his peers knew
that the fun had just begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best test of golf that I've played in a major
championship,'' Mickelson said. ``It tests every area of your game.
I think were in for a long weekend if the greens dry out.''

BOEING WRAPS UP PARIS AIR SHOW WITH FINAL FLURRY OF ORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Boeing Co. wrapped up a successful Paris Air Show
Thursday with firm orders for 25 more airplanes worth about $1.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The final flurry of orders raised Boeing's tally during the
world's biggest and oldest air show to 62 firm orders for airplanes
worth about $3 billion at list prices.
</P>
<P>
   The total does not include 50 next generation 737s ordered by
International Lease Finance Corp. Boeing said it did not include
that order in its official tally because the contract will not be
signed until next month, even though it was Boeing's highlight
order announcement of the air show.
</P>
<P>
   If those orders by International Lease are included, Boeing
announced firm orders for 112 airplanes worth more than $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   International Lease also took options for 50 more next
generation 737s.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Boeing orders announced at the show were for the
twin-engine next generation 737.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing came into the air show having made public only 52 firm
orders worth about $3.9 billion at list prices during the first
five months of 1999. So Boeing more than doubled its 1999 order
book in less than a week at the air show.
</P>
<P>
   That is not surprising. Traditionally, Boeing and rival Airbus
Industrie save orders so they can announce them at the air show.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus entered the air show saying it had 153 firm orders this
year. But it is difficult to calculate the Airbus tally at the
show.
</P>
<P>
   The European airplane maker issued a statement Thursday saying
that about 53 of its announced air show orders were actually
commitments rather than firm orders.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg news reported that if those commitments are included,
the European planemaker had 146 orders and commitments valued at
$6.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But that figure includes a 30-plane order by International Lease
for the new A318. Even though that firm order was announced during
the air show, Airbus had included those planes in the 153 firm
orders it claimed to have going into the air show.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Airbus said Northwest Airlines Corp. will buy 30
single-aisle Airbus Industrie planes worth $1.2 billion, as it
converts options for the jets into firm orders. Northwest will buy
18 A319 planes, which seat 124, and 12 A320s, seating 150, with
deliveries to begin in January 2002 and wrap up in 2004. The
options were first taken in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The orders announced by Boeing Thursday included six next
generation 737-600s ordered by Southwest Airlines. The planes are
scheduled to be delivered in 2000 and 2001.

CLINTON IS SAID TO ORDER CIA TO DESTABILIZE MILOSEVIC'S REGIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
 (bl)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has approved a covert action
program that calls for the CIA to try to destabilize the government
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, said U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The president has signed a secret ``presidential finding''
authorizing the CIA to try to weaken Milosevic's hold on power, and
open the way for a new government in Belgrade, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Yugoslavia bowed to NATO's demands, Clinton and other NATO
leaders have made clear that they want Milosevic out of power,
saying that until that happens Yugoslavia _ except for Kosovo _
will get no help from the West in rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   The covert plan for Yugoslavia was first reported in Newsweek
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has become increasingly wary of such plans for covert
action that appear to have been made without regard for how they
fit into broader U.S. foreign policy goals. Last year, Republican
congressional leaders considered the Clinton administration's
proposed covert action against Saddam Hussein so detached from the
administration's broader Iraq policies that the Senate took the
drastic step of blocking funds for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Few details of the new covert action plan, which officials say
was approved by Clinton earlier this year, are known.
</P>
<P>
   The plan does not include U.S. military assistance for the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the officials said. But they say it does
call for computer attacks on foreign bank accounts held by
Milosevic and other Serbian leaders, such as draining assets or
altering banking records.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has moved large amounts of money from Yugoslavia into
bank accounts in Russia, Switzerland, Cyprus and, more recently,
Lebanon, according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   A Treasury Department expert and other U.S. officials first
traced Milosevic's money to Cyprus in 1993. Cypriot officials have
denied any knowledge of Milosevic's use of banks in their country.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that the presidential finding is not directed at
Milosevic personally but at the entire leadership of his
government. While Milosevic has been indicted on charges of war
crimes by the international tribunal at the Hague, the United
States has no plans to kidnap him and bring him to justice.

FORD RAISES PRODUCTIVITY AT ITS PLANTS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The big difference in labor productivity between
American and Japanese automakers in the 1980s, then a matter of
considerable dismay in the United States, has been sharply reduced
by Ford, but General Motors and DaimlerChrysler still lag,
according to a comprehensive study released on Thursday..
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, Japanese car makers enjoyed a labor cost
advantage of roughly $1,000 a vehicle, adjusted for inflation,
according to Harbour &AMP; Associates, a manufacturing-consultant in
Troy, Mich., which published its annual productivity report on
Thursday. The labor cost difference has persisted for GM and
DaimlerChrysler, which have only improved as quickly as the
Japanese makers.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford has cut the gap in half, and has nearly eliminated it,
if Ford's huge costs for retired workers are excluded. Ford
factories are now almost as efficient and in some case more so than
Japanese-owned factories in North America, which in turn are almost
as efficient as Japanese company factories at home.
</P>
<P>
   Because the majority of Japanese-brand cars sold in North
America are now assembled here, Detroit automakers now compete most
directly with North American factories, unlike in the 1980s, when
they competed mainly with cars from plants in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the number of hours of labor needed to produce each
vehicle, the most efficient assembly plant in North America last
year was the Toyota Corolla factory in Cambridge, Ontario, which
required 17.66 hours for a vehicle. The next two in order of
productivity were the Ford Taurus factories in Atlanta and Chicago,
at 17.72 and 18.09 hours of labor a vehicle, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The most efficient light-truck factory in North America last
year was the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle factory in
Louisville, Ky., at 19.29 hours. It was the first time that an
American-owned factory has led either of Harbour's lists of the
most efficient car and light-truck factories.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's overall productivity in North America is now almost the
same as that of Nissan, Honda and Toyota, according to the report.
By contrast, GM and DaimlerChrysler still require nearly 50 percent
more labor for a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Harbour, the president of Harbour &AMP; Associates, said that
GM and DaimlerChrysler were still spending billions of dollars
annually for unscheduled overtime, mainly because of
factory-equipment breakdowns and the need to repair cars that do
not come off the assembly line in salable condition. By contrast,
he said, Ford has done a much better job maintaining factories and
managing production to avoid unscheduled overtime.
</P>
<P>
   GM issued a statement on Thursday noting that it had two
factories on Harbour's list of the 10 most efficient car assembly
plants, and two more on the list of the most efficient light- truck
factories. The GM factories were near the bottom of each list. Ford
had four of the most efficient car factories and six of the most
efficient light-truck factories.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler had no factories on either list. David Barnas, a
DaimlerChrysler spokesman, said that the automaker believes it has
an edge in vehicle design. Harbour said that DaimlerChrysler's
profits a vehicle, at $1,470 last year, were the highest in the
world, partly because of attractive designs and also because of the
company's heavy reliance on sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks
and minivans, which are all very profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's wage and benefit costs now exceed those in Japanese-owned
factories in North America by only $154 a vehicle, according to
Thursday's report. The cost of pensions and retiree benefits put
Ford at an additional disadvantage of $348 a vehicle because Ford
has as many retirees as active workers.The Japanese factories in
North America have virtually no retirees.
</P>
<P>
   GM and DaimlerChrysler's wage and benefit costs lag behind the
Japanese by roughly $500 a vehicle. Their retiree costs are also
slightly higher than Ford's.

LIGHTHOUSE IS SAVED FROM THE BATTERING SEA

<P>
   BUXTON, N.C. _ In a steady downpour with a powerful surf
crashing nearby, the 128-year-old Cape Hatteras Lighthouse began
its journey Thursday toward a new resting place.
</P>
<P>
   Using a sophisticated hydraulic system, movers pushed the
4,800-ton structure about 10 feet. Within two months, the
lighthouse will move 2,900 feet into the scrub pines, far from the
encroaching ocean that was threatening its foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a great sense of satisfaction,'' said Robert Reynolds,
the superintendent of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, who
stood on the lighthouse balcony, nearly 200 feet up, through the
first five inches of the move.
</P>
<P>
   For Reynolds and others on North Carolina's Outer Banks who
worked to relocate the lighthouse, moving day has been a long time
coming. The National Parks Service first proposed repositioning the
lighthouse in 1988, but it was only last year that Congress
appropriated nearly $12 million to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The parks service, which cares for the lighthouse building while
the Coast Guard maintains its light, believed the only way to save
the building from the ocean that had crept to within 150 feet was
to move it. When it was built in 1870, it was 1,600 feet away from
the surf. Although it will be moving 2,900 linear feet, because of
the curving shoreline, the lighthouse will once more be 1,600 feet
from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was met here with some derision by folks who considered
moving the nation's tallest lighthouse akin to spraying graffiti on
the White House. They had suggested building a sea wall instead to
stop the erosion, something not allowed under North Carolina
coastal regulations. But they maintained the move would destroy a
piece of history. Plus, it could crack, crumble or tip over, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   None of that happened on Thursday, and the simmering
disagreement was not apparent. But some who came to see the
lighthouse in place one last time said it was bittersweet to see it
stripped from its granite base and resting on a mat of huge steel
beams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a different animal now,'' said Ron Berlinguet, a
real estate appraiser from Richmond, Va., who has vacationed on the
Outer Banks almost every year since 1969. ``Now it's being moved,
it doesn't seem that solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Cape Hatteras Lighthouse was built on a spit on the Outer Banks,
a thin sea island in the northern section of North Carolina, to
replace one nearby that had been damaged in the Civil War. The
light helped boaters navigate the perilous Diamond Shoals, which
were responsible for the hundreds of shipwrecks that gave this area
the nickname, Graveyard of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise in modern navigation equipment, the light had
become much less essential, but the allure of the black-and
white-striped lighthouse remained unchanged. Vacationers _ about
250,000 _ make pilgrimages here every year; motorists look for the
light in the distance as they trek across Pamlico Sound.
</P>
<P>
   More than a thousand people streamed into the park Thursday to
glimpse the lighthouse. One hundred hydraulic jacks and two sensors
will make sure the structure stays level as it moves. Top speed
will likely be 100 feet each day. The move is so slow, it is all
but imperceptible, ``like watching kudzu grow,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 500 or so people watching when the lighthouse moved
the first few feet did not respond until a parks service volunteer
announced the news. Then they clapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It moved easier than we thought it would,'' said Jim Matyako,
one of the owners of Expert House Movers of Maryland, which along
with International Chimney Corp. of Buffalo, N.Y., is conducting
the move.
</P>
<P>
   Matyako said he was not particularly worried about the challenge
of actually moving the structure. More daunting, he said, was
lifting the lighthouse five feet to make it even with the ground.
The job is one of the heaviest his company has undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're usually through with a move in two weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   International Chimney relocated all three lighthouses that were
moved in recent years, but the tallest of those _ Southeast
Lighthouse on Block Island, R.I. _ is only a third as tall as the
Cape Hatteras structure.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Expert House Movers moved the two keepers
houses, an oil storage building and some cisterns to the new
location for the Cape Hatteras light. The buildings are arranged
exactly as they were on the original site. The Park Service expects
the lighthouse and surrounding buildings to be open by Memorial Day
2000.
</P>
<P>
   One person who is looking forward to that time is 8-year-old
Ryan George of Bergholz, Ohio, who came out Thursday to see what
was happening with the lighthouse. He is a lighthouse climber, and
he climbed the Hatteras light last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to count the steps but couldn't make it,'' he said,
clutching a World Wrestling Federation magazine and looking up at
the lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing they can move it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berlinguet, the real estate appraiser, agrees, but adds, ``Once
they move it, the beach will probably start building back and the
man upstairs will be laughing at all of us.''

   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Jaren Jackson of the San Antonio Spurs is
not surprised that opponents often challenge him to sling
3-pointers from the outside. After all, he has had his doubters
before.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, throughout most of his professional basketball career,
Jackson has been perhaps the only person with faith in his skills.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a nine-year veteran, has played for eight franchises in
the National Basketball Association, four of which cut him and two
of which sent him looking for work after he toiled through
consecutive 10-day contracts.
</P>
<P>
   If that were the extent of Jackson's basketball-related travels
and tribulations, it would be the story of one of the emerging
stars of this championship series, with the Knicks also being a
noteworthy story.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson, who supplemented Tim Duncan's dominance down low by
scoring 17 points in the Spurs' 89-77 victory in Game 1 on
Wednesday, has overcome much more than being undervalued by the
Nets, Golden State, the Los Angeles Clippers, Portland,
Philadelphia, Houston and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6-inch swingman has experienced life in the
Continental Basketball Association, touring the heartland to play
before tiny crowds with the Wichita Falls Texans, the La Crosse
Catbirds, the Pittsburgh Piranhas and the Fort Wayne Fury. Jackson,
31, even spent a season with the Dayton Wings of the little-known
World Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
   So disregarded was Jackson when he graduated from Georgetown in
1989 that in addition to not being selected in the NBA draft, he
was a mere fourth-round pick in the CBA. Through it all, however,
he never questioned whether he could become a major contributor in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some low spots,'' said Jackson, who scored all of
his points on Wednesday on outside jumpers, including five
3-pointers. ``When you're getting cut and stuff like that, that's
not too high of a time. But I didn't lose confidence in my game. I
never let the fact that a team cut me affect my belief in what I
could do on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who played for two championship teams in the CBA, did
not have to endure such basketball hardship to put food on the
table. He earned a degree in finance from Georgetown, and his wife,
Terri, is a lawyer currently teaching a course on women in sports
at Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Jackson had his dream. ``I've always known that if
this didn't work out that I could move on and be successful in the
real world,'' said Jackson, who plans to return to school
eventually to earn his master's degree. ``But deep down inside I've
always felt that I can play in this league just as well as any of
these guys. This was a dream of mine, and I knew that it was going
to happen at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   That point came in September 1997 when the Spurs signed Jackson
to a one-year deal. But Gregg Popovich, the team's coach and
general manager, admittedly had no idea that he was getting a
deadly 3-point shooter who would eventually be called the
Eliminator for helping San Antonio sweep the Portland Trail Blazers
and the Los Angeles Lakers from this year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very honestly, I did not sign him because I thought he was
going to drill 3-pointers,'' Popovich said. ``I signed him because
we wanted to have somebody come off the bench and have a defensive
presence, have some toughness and be able to guard more athletic
people at the two position. But once we got him into camp and he
started shooting some 3s here and there, we decided to make that a
priority of his, and he loves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's transformation from a player known solely for his grit
and hustle into a long-range marksmen has caught nearly everyone
but himself by surprise. After making only 6 of 34 3-pointers in
his first six NBA seasons combined, he shot 37 percent in making
112 3-pointers in the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this season, Jackson started over Mario Elie
but after the Spurs' sluggish start, Popovich reversed the two
players' roles.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the playoffs that Jackson emerged as a driving
force in San Antonio's quest for a title. Against the Lakers, he
made eight 3-pointers, including a franchise-tying six in Game 3,
and scored 42 points in the Spurs' final two victories over Los
Angeles. Then, he hit nine triples in scoring 30 points in Games 3
and 4 against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do whatever the team needs,'' Jackson said, ``whether it's
playing tough defense or shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Spurs go on to win the title, Jackson, who refused to
sign a two-year deal with the Spurs this season, should receive
more than a championship ring. As an integral part of their attack,
he should attract major interest and dollars as a free agent this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the Spurs will want him back, Popovich grinned and
said, ``Depends on how many more 3s he hits this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is a good chance the Spurs will come calling this
summer. &QL;

   The Kellogg Co., seeking to break out of a prolonged slump, said
Thursday that it might close a portion of a plant in its hometown
of Battle Creek, Mich., and dismiss as many as 700 of the 1,100
workers there.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts could come by the first quarter of next year and would
produce savings of $35 million to $45 million a year, according to
the company, which makes Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies. Analysts
said the company would probably cut most of the 700 positions.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed cuts, the analysts said, are a signal from Carlos
M. Gutierrez, who became Kellogg's president and chief executive in
April, that he intends to make the tough decisions necessary to
awaken the sleeping giant of a company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they would actually close capacity in their
hometown, which is pretty small, is a statement that Gutierrez
really means business and is really going to cut costs to be a
low-cost provider in the cereal business,'' William Leach, an
analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc., said.
</P>
<P>
   The planned cuts would include hourly and salaried workers. The
company said it intended to meet with union officials representing
the plant workers before making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``An integral part of our strategy is continuing to reduce costs
and improve efficiency to enable greater reinvestment for
profitable growth,'' Gutierrez said. ``Streamlining our operations
and avoiding future costs would help keep our North American cereal
business cost-competitive going into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg has been struggling with how to expand its business
after watching sales tumble and profits shrink as consumers have
switched to cheaper generic cereal brands and more convenient
breakfast foods like bagels. Largely for those reasons, Kellogg's
profits have dropped in each of the last four quarters, including a
15 percent decline over the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said, however, that it would take more than cutting
costs to reinvigorate the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately you can't cut your way to growth,'' Andrew Lazar,
an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said. ``Cutting costs must be
combined with innovative new product launches and high-quality
marketing spending to try and get the consumer to eat more
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez has said he intends to focus on developing more
noncereal products as part of his growth plan. The company is
expanding its distribution of such products as Rice Krispie Treats
in convenience stores and other outlets and is investing heavily in
product development to expand its brand of snack foods like
Nutri-Grain cereal bars.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg is also marketing its core cereal products for the
health benefits the company contends they provide rather than for
the sugar rush.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves, combined with Thursday's reminder that the company
is focusing on efficiency, might ordinarily be enough to move the
needle on its slumping stock. But Kellogg investors know from past
disappointments not to get too excited about such announcements.
The company's shares were flat Thursday, falling 18.75 cents, to
$33.8125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kellogg is a company that has been long on excuses and short
on results,'' Donaldson, Lufkin's Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed cuts would be the second round in six months. Last
December, the company, which employs about 14,500 workers
worldwide, eliminated 525 executive and administrative positions at
its headquarters. A new round of job cuts ``certainly would have a
significant impact'' on the workers and town of 54,000 people, said
Robert B. Young, president and chief executive of the Battle Creek
Area Chamber of Commerce. &QL;
