<HEADLINE> WHO Welcomes G-8 Support for Communicable Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has expressed gratitude to the Group of Eight (G-8) for its
commitment to controlling and reducing the surge of communicable
diseases.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that the G-8 has recognized the leading
role WHO has to play in the surveillance and control of infectious
and parasitic diseases and recommended that it and other bodies
assist WHO in its efforts to tackle this problem," said WHO
Director-General Dr Hiroshi Nakajima here Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the G-8 foreign ministers which concluded in
London on May 9, ministers from the world's eight largest
economies confirmed that experts from G-8 countries and WHO will
meet later this month to review current surveillance systems
throughout the world and examine options for assisting WHO as it
helps to develop global surveillance networks for infectious and
parasitic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Nakajima said that WHO fully agreed with the G-8's concern over
the continued impact of infectious and parasitic diseases,
including malaria, lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis and
intestinal worm infections, adding "Parasitic diseases control is
one of WHO's priorities and at the same time one of the most
difficult to accomplish".
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to assist countries in the development of
surveillance systems for any and all infectious and parasitic
diseases which are major public health concerns, as forewarning
and better epidemiological data are two of the best means of
limiting their impact," Nakajima said.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Cuts Oil Output by 1 mln bpd in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Oil production of the members of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) stood at
27.95 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, 1.03 million bpd
less than in February, according to the International Energy
Agency (IEA) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based agency said in its monthly oil market report
that last month, OPEC has implemented most of the production cuts
it pledged in the March output cuts deal in an effort to help
rescue oil price on the world market.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's April output cut was 80 percent of the 1.25 million bpd
cut from April 1 it agreed in a deal signed in March with non-OPEC
producers to reduce world production by two percent and it helped
remove some of the second quarter oil surplus, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency cut its 1998 non-OPEC oil supply forecast
to 45.1 million bpd by 200,000 bpd, which is another factor for
the world oil market.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Uses International Aid to Control AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is strengthening
international cooperation to control the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
A signing ceremony for "HIV/AIDS Prevention in Vietnam" was
held here on Monday, the Vietnam News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The nearly 525,000 U.S. dollar project, which is funded by the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will be
carried out from now to the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The project focuses on three principal areas, namely promoting
public health approaches, behavior change and risk reduction, and
private sector partnership in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) prevention and
control.
</P>
<P>
It will be implemented by the National AIDS Committee of
Vietnam in collaboration with the Family Health International.
</P>
<P>
This is the first project within a framework agreement on
bilateral cooperation to control the spread of AIDS, which was
signed between Vietnam and the U.S. in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the U.S., Japan and the European Union have helped
Vietnam to promote the fight against HIV/AIDS by providing
condoms. Canada plans to provide 96,000 dollars to a project for
preventing AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
The German government has also planned to give another 400,000
U.S. dollars for the second phase of the Vietnam-German technical
assistance project to prevent HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has
pledged to continue granting 750,000 dollars for a project to
strengthen AIDS management and the administration capacity of the
health network in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has played a part in an anti-AIDS project jointly
performed by Southeast Asian nations and China.
</P>
<P>
By May 9, 1998, Vietnam had detected 8,632 HIV victims,
including 1,202 AIDS patients. Six hundred and fourteen people
were reported to have died of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Intravenous drug users accounted for 65 percent of Vietnam's
HIV patients.

<HEADLINE> SBC to Acquire Ameritech in Largest Phone Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The SBC Communications Inc., the
No. 3 telecommunication giant, has agreed to purchase the Ameritech
Corp. for 62 billion U.S. dollars in a stock-swap deal, which would
be the second-largest merger in the telephone history.
</P>
<P>
According to an AP report reaching here from Chicago, the deal,
which was announced Monday, would create a powerhouse
communications company with operations in nearly every region of
this country, likely to pose as a potent rival to AT&AMP;T Corp., the
largest telecommunications firm in the country and to WorldCom
Inc. after its pending 37 billion dollar takeover of MCI
Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the deal, the combination of the two
companies would be second only to the pending 82 billion merger of
Travelers Group Inc. and Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
The proposed SBC-Ameritech combination would give the combined
company to be known as SBC 57 million phone lines, or nearly
one-third of the nation's total. By comparison, Bell Atlantic,
with operations along the East Coast, has 41 million phone lines.
</P>
<P>
The companies reportedly expect to save at least 1 billion
dollars with the combination.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Communications Commission, which must approve the
deal, had no immediate comment. But some consumer groups and major
rival giants expressed their strong opposition to the combination.
</P>
<P>
In a series of mergers and acquisitions since deregulation
began in 1996, communication companies have been scrambling to
outgun the competition by getting bigger and offering a wider
array of services, including cellular, local and long-distance
phone service.
</P>
<P>
SBC Communications, formerly called Southwestern Bell, has led
the way. It bought San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group a
year ago for 16.5 billion dollars and is working to complete its 5
billion dollar acquisition of Southern New England
Telecommunications Corp. of Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> APEC Secretariat's Executive Director Visits Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Vietnam's National
Assembly Nong Duc Manh said here Monday that he hopes APEC will
continue assisting his country's effective participation in APEC's
activities once Vietnam becomes a full member of the organization.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam News Agency said Manh made the remark while meeting
Noor Adland, executive director of the Secretariat of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), who arrived earlier for
a six-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Manh welcomed Adlan's visit as a manifestation of the goodwill
between himself and APEC in helping Vietnam join the organization.
</P>
<P>
He said, in the ongoing renovation drive, Vietnam attaches
importance to expanding its relations and cooperation with other
countries, and international as well as regional organizations for
peace, independence and development.
</P>
<P>
Noor Adlan said he was glad to see that Vietnam would join APEC
this November. He described it as a success of not only Malaysia,
the host country of the coming APEC session, but also of the whole
organization.
</P>
<P>
The APEC official spoke highly of Vietnam's application for
entry into the organization and stressed that APEC mainly works to
boost the cooperation, equality and development among member
countries.

<HEADLINE> New French Army Chief Backs Arrest of Bosnian War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The new chief of staff of the French
armed forces, General Jean-Pierre Kelche, said on Monday that the
arrest of war criminals in Bosnia is "an indispensable step in the
long process of return to civil peace" in that former Yugoslav
republic.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Monde, Kelche, who took over
the post from General Jean-Philippe Douin last month in Bosnia,
also denied that French soldiers serving in the NATO Stabilization
Force (SFOR) in Bosnia were not active in arresting war criminals.
</P>
<P>
The southeast division SFOR in Bosnia, which is led by a French
officer, is not a French sector but a multinational one, and it
does not take orders from Paris but from the NATO command, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"SF0R is not for the mandate of carrying out operations to
search for and arrest these criminals.... That needs special units
for this type of mission with means of investigation and
particular actions at their disposals, and that they should be
perfectly coordinated at an international level," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that France will participate this kind of operations if
they are decided multilaterally instead of unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
'It is clear in my mind that the arrest of war criminals is, in
Bosnia, an indispensable step in the long process of return to
civil peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States last month accused a French military officer
serving in SFOR of deliberately damaging a NATO plan to arrest
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic by leaking the plan to the latter
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
France denied the accusation but admitted the relations between
the officer and Karadzic could have been "abnormal".

<HEADLINE> GCC to Hold Economic Cooperation Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Economic ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states will hold a meeting on May 18 in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to bridge the gaps in tearing down their
customs barriers.
</P>
<P>
Adnan Al-Khdheir, director of the Arab and Gulf Economic
Cooperation Department at the Kuwaiti Finance Ministry, said
"unifying custom tariffs among GCC states will top issues in the
agenda."
</P>
<P>
He added that Kuwaiti Minister of Finance and Communications
Sheikh Ali Salem Al-Sabah will represent the Gulf emirate at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The issue of unifying customs tariffs was highly recommended
during last December's GCC summit in Kuwait. A solution to this is
expected to pave the way for the long-sought establishment of the
unified customs union and Gulf common market under an agreement
signed 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The six GCC states - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain - have already agreed on the
categorization of over 900 goods out of 1,280 for tariff
reduction, after several rounds of talks over the past years.
</P>
<P>
However, they remain split on reducing the percentage of
national contribution to the added value of products of industrial
units. A technical committee met last week and recommended
lowering that percentage to 30 percent from the current 40
percent, but Saudi Arabia was opposed to the cut.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will discuss the proposed cut in their Riyadh
meeting.
</P>
<P>
A GCC secretariat source said last week that "lowering that
percentage means more factories will be exempted from customs and
such a move will motivate them into upgrading production."
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt this will increase trade among member
states and contribute to efforts to set up a common market," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Trade among GCC states has remained below 10 percent of their
total commercial exchanges of around 120 billion U.S. dollars a
year.
</P>
<P>
The Riyadh meeting would also discuss enhancing economic ties
among the GCC member states, Al-Khdheir said.
</P>
<P>
During the December summit, Kuwait submitted a working paper
regarding economic integration among GCC states.

<HEADLINE> Low Turnout Leaves Hungary's Election Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's first-round
parliamentary election on Sunday failed to yield specific results
due to low voter turnouts, the elections commission said.
</P>
<P>
General election returns showed that only about 50 percent of
Hungary's 8.1 million voters went to the polls, signaling a
significant drop in turnout from the 1990 and 1994 elections,
which had 65.1 and 68.92 percent turnouts respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the states of Hajdu-Bihar and Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg, voter
turnouts failed to reach the 50 percent threshold, leaving their
party elections invalid .
</P>
<P>
As a result, the elections commission could not decide, as
planned, which parties had pocketed more than five percent votes
and were eligible to enter the parliament. The final results will
not come out until the second-round election on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Initial results showed that Hungary's ruling socialists took
the lead with 32.25 percent, followed by the Federation of Young
Democrats with 28.2 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The Small Holder's Party, the Alliance of Free Democrats and
Hungarian Justice and the Life Party were also possible entrants
to parliament.
</P>
<P>
The low voter turnouts in the election caused an outcry in
various circles of the country. An authoritative person, in a
television speech, attributed it to a "crisis in the democratic
system and Hungarian society".
</P>
<P>
President Goncz Arpad, however, said most of those who did not
vote failed to feel the improvement in the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Abrasion Found in 50 Percent of Boeing 737s Inspected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- In 50 percent of the Boeing 737
planes examined emergently, there was extensive wear in power
lines running through their wing fuel tanks, a U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
By Monday morning, 47 aircraft had been inspected and mechanics
found some signs of abrasion in half of the wiring bundles
examined, Jane Garvey, Federal Aviation Administrator, said on
NBC's "Today" show.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the FAA ordered operators to make emergency
inspections on Boeing 737-100 to 500 series planes for possible
fuel pump damage. The order was made three days after the agency
gave airlines up to a week to inspect their Boeing 737-100s and
200s for signs of wear in the wiring or the pipes that carry the
wires through the fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
The inspections would affect 15 percent, or some 270, of the
737s operating in the United States.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, mechanics inspecting a United Airlines 737 found
one wire bundle that showed signs of sparking in one spot and a
second area where the wires had been worn bare, most likely from
vibration over the plane's 50,000 hours in flight
</P>
<P>
Officials feared the mixture of fuel, air and electricity could
spark an explosion such as that which downed TWA Flight 800 in New
York in 1996, killing 230 aboard.
</P>
<P>
Boeing supported the action, which followed its own service
bulletin to aircraft owners on April 24. The manufacturer said it
was rushing repair kits to the airlines.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the FAA ordered inspections within 60 days for
Boeing 747 and 767 aircraft to make sure they had the necessary
protection around their fuel-tank wiring.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,088 Boeing 737s in the United States and 2,716
registered worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Writethru-3: "Generally Peaceful" Voting in Philippine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Voting for Monday's national and
local elections was held in a "generally peaceful and orderly
manner" with a heavy voter turnout across the country except for
some areas where polling was marred by violence and election
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commission on Elections, about 80 percent of
the 34 million voters turned out and cast their ballots to choose
a president, a vice president, 12 out of 24 senators, 260 members
of the House of Representatives and more than 17,000 local
officials and local councilors.
</P>
<P>
The voting was "generally peaceful and orderly", the Commission
on Elections said.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning in Metro Manila, some people began to wait
outside their precincts even at 6 a.m. (22:00 GMT Sunday), one
hour before the voting starts. Poll watchers told Xinhua that
everything was orderly at dozens of precincts at a public
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
All major political parties assigned poll watchers to almost
every precinct and no fraud and cheating had been found in the
process of voting, the poll watchers said a few hours after the
voting started.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures showed that a total of 10 people were killed
all over the country in Monday's voting, bringing to 46 the death
toll in election-related violence incidents since election
campaigns began in February.
</P>
<P>
However, compared with the previous elections including the
ones held in 1992 and 1995, the polls may be the most peaceful and
orderly in the country's election history, poll watchers said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 elections, about 169 people were killed in election
related violence while in the 1995 senate elections 210 people
died.
</P>
<P>
To ensure "honest, peaceful and orderly elections," the
government has identified 425 towns and municipalities as
"sensitive areas" and deployed 116,000 troops and policemen across
the country.
</P>
<P>
A failure of elections had been declared in seven towns in
Lanao del Sur province, five towns and cities in Maguindanao
province and four precincts in Lanao de Norte province, affecting
144,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"We have reports that commission officials in Davao had
declared failure of elections," Commission on Elections
commissioner Evalyn Fetalino said, adding that the commission had
the right to re-schedule a special election as quickly as possible
in the above areas.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the confirmed reports of failure of elections,
buying of votes, missing of names, cases of disfranchisement and
double registrations of voters were also reported in central
Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Voters confirmed to police officials that leaders of at least
three gubernatorial candidates in the Lao del Sur were paying
voters from 300 to 400 pesos (about 10 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the voting ended at 3 p.m. (7:00 GMT), the
counting started at the precinct level and are ongoing in some
areas in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
The latest exit poll conducted by the private radio station
DZRH showed vice President Joseph Estrada, candidate of the Laban
ng Makabayang masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipinos
Masses) far ahead of the other 9 presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 34.6 percent of the 41,840 voters surveyed
across the country said they voted for the 61-year-old former
movie star.
</P>
<P>
After casting his vote in a Manila suburb precinct, Estrada,
surrounded by a large crowd of supporters, said he would win the
election by "a landslide victory."
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Jose de Venecia, who was anointed by President
Fidel Ramos as the standard bearer of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party
in the presidential race, trailed with 16.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other main contenders include former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim
and senator Raul Roco of Akson Demokratiko (Democratic Action).
</P>
<P>
After the counting at the precinct level, election inspectors
will turn over the election returns to the municipal or city
level. The total election returns will be recorded and tabulated
and then given to the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
The forms will then be forwarded to the House of
Representatives for the counting for presidential and vice
presidential positions, while the Commission on Elections will
count the votes for the congressional posts.
</P>
<P>
The process is expected to take four weeks. But a private
watchdog organization conducting a quick count under the
accreditation of the Commission on Elections said it can release
the final results within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
As no candidate is expected to get majority support in the
final results, it is too early to say who will win the presidency,
analysts said. More violence could take place before the winning
bet is officially proclaimed, they warned.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Reiterates Stand on Cyprus' Missile Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said Monday that its position
on the Cypriot government's plan to deploy Russian-made S-300
missiles on the divided island remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"Our views on the deployment of the S-300 missiles have been
put forward on various occasions in the past and there has not
been any change in Turkey's position on that issue," Turkish
Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli said at a weekly
news briefing Monday,
</P>
<P>
Turkey's military has vowed that it will take all necessary
measures to prevent the missiles from entering the island,
underlining that the deployment will threaten Turkey's security.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli dismissed as groundless recent Greek press reports,
which claimed that Ankara would make concessions on the Cyprus
issue if the missiles were really deployed.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports have said that the S-300 missile system
might be deployed in Cyprus later this year under a
Russian-Cypriot deal signed last year.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Turkish Chief of General Staff Ismail Hakki
Karadayi's visit to Moscow scheduled for next week, Atacanli
said, "it is an important part of our policy to improve relations
with the Russian Federation."
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to disclose what measures Turkey would
take if Russia insisted on going ahead with the missile deal.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the missile issue will top the agenda of
Karadayi visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Turkey firmly supports Turkish Cypriots who unilaterally
declared in 1983 a "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which
was recognized only by Ankara.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- France Monday formally denied an
accusation by a regional military official of Angola that it is
backing the separatist movement of the Angolan oil-rich enclave of
Cabinda.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman of defense of Cabinda, General Futi, said in
an interview with the weekly Folha-8 published in Luanda on May 5
that the chief of the separatist Front of Liberation of the
Enclave of Cabinda is living in France.
</P>
<P>
France is providing a "more than just moral" support to the
Cabinda separatists, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot but give a formal denial to this kind of estimations
which are groundless and aimed at discrediting our policy toward
Angola," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The French oil group Elf-Aquitaine is having tremendous
interests in the oil resources in Angola and its neighboring
country of Congo Republic.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Gross Reserves Fall in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's total gold and
foreign exchange reserves fell marginally to 32.72 billion Rand
(6.48 billion U.S. Dollars) in April, the Reserve Bank said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reserves dropped 81.36 million Rand (16.1 million Dollars)
from the historic high of 32.8 billion Rand (6.5 billion Dollars)
in March, South African Press Association quoted the bank as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The decline surprised the markets which had expected reserves
to rise to at least 34 billion Rand (6.73 billion Dollars) on the
back of net purchases of 12.7 billion Rand (2.5 billion Dollars)
of South African equities and bonds by foreigners during April.
</P>
<P>
In a monthly statement of assets and liabilities, the central
bank said gold reserves picked up from the March figure of 5.37
billion Rand (1.06 billion Dollars) to 5.48 billion Rand (1.09
billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
But foreign assets fell by 196.34 million Rand (38.9 million
Dollars) from 27.43 billion Rand (5.43 billion Dollars) in March
to 27.23 billion (5.39 billion Dollars) in April.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Offer Zimbabwe 12 Million Pounds Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government has set
aside 12 million Pounds sterling for development programs in
Zimbabwe this year, British High Commissioner Peter Longworth
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
After paying a courtesy call on Zimbabwe's acting President
Simon Muzenda Peter Longworth told the Zimbabwe News Agency that
the money was allocated to poverty elimination, improvement of
water supplies and education.
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship is not based on the land issue. I have had a
very good conversation with Zimbabwean Minister of Lands and
Agriculture Kumbirai Kangai, and explained our position (on the
country's land reform) clearly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Zimbabwean government has already designated
1,500 farms or five million hectares for compulsory acquisition
for the new resettlement program. The land policy has been
criticized by the British government and some other west
countries.
</P>
<P>
Longworth said Britain and Zimbabwe shared the same objectives
and were trying to establish an arrangement where the land
redevelopment program was directed to the elimination of poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said during the half-hour discussion he assured Muzenda
that Britain had a strong interest in working side by side with
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very strong trading relationship. Today a group of
British business people has come in to see what kind of business
they can do in Zimbabwe," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said three missions would be coming this year, including
one from the Leicester Chamber of Commerce.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Speeds up Implementation of Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa hoped to
implement 44 bilateral investment treaties by the end of this
financial year, the Trade and Industry Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Such agreements provided guarantees that foreign investments
would not be nationalized willy-nilly, or expropriated, thus
reassuring individual investors that their money would be safe,
South African Press Association quoted deputy director Robert
Moodie as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This solid collection of treaties...indicate that we are
moving progressively ahead in providing an ever stronger base for
foreign direct investment," Moodie said.
</P>
<P>
Moodie said eight such agreements had been put into effect
since 1994, when the program began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
The process to implement these treaties had since been
streamlined, enabling the treaties to reach the binding stage
more quickly.
</P>
<P>
The eight treaties already in place were concluded with China,
Germany, France, Denmark, Cuba, South Korea, Switzerland, and
Austria.
</P>
<P>
Several others were in various stages of implementation with
countries including Iran, Italy, Britain, Canada, the
Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and Russia.

JOHANNESBURG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki is due to attend Thursday a Great Lakes
Summit in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, his
aide Ricky Naidoo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, he dismissed a report that Mbeki would hold a series
of meetings with the Congolese government leaders to convey the
South African government's concern on a number of issues,
including human rights practices in the country.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the trip was to attend the summit at the
request of D.R. Congo President Laurent Kabila, Naidoo said.
</P>
<P>
The regional summit was aimed at securing permanent peace and
stability in the Great Lakes region. A regional development would
also be launched, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was likely to leave Thursday and return home by
Saturday, before travelling to Namibia the following day to
attend the World Economic Forum's Southern Africa Economic
Summit, Naidoo added.

GENEVA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Director-General Nominee of the
World Health Organization (WHO) Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland has said
that she is determined to fight against tobacco.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland was nominated to the post by the 101st session of
the WHO Executive Board during its session last January. The 191
WHO member states will formally elect her on May 13.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by the situation in which children in the developing
world are being drawn into smoking, Brundtland said legislation
prohibiting children from smoking similar to that in much of the
West is needed in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco has to be fought now because the children and young
people are becoming influenced now," she said before the start of
the week-long 51st World Health Assembly, WHO's highest governing
body.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to tell the world why it is dangerous and give
advice on how to deal with it on a regulatory fashion because
governments have to pass laws like we have done in Europe and the
United States," said Brundtland.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO's annual report released here Monday, in 1997
different cancers killed 6.2 million people around the world. Lung
cancer alone killed 1.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Government Spokesman on Turkish Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government is trying to
draw world's attention to the "direction of Turkey which made
threats against Cyprus" as more countries expressed concern about
Cyprus' decision to deploy Russia-made S-300 missiles.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing Monday, government spokesman Christos
Stylianides said "the Cyprus government has clearly expressed its
views on the issue to those expressing concern about
destabilization and those who advise against the deployment of the
S-300 missiles."
</P>
<P>
"Turkish threats with regard to the government decision to
deploy the Russian defense missile system S-300 on the island are
well known and so is the reaction of certain circles of the
international community," Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "those expressing concern should look to
the direction of the Turkish government and not to the government
of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated the Cypriot government position that
the S-300 will not be deployed if there is an agreement for
demilitarzation of the island or if there is substantial progress
toward a comprehensive solution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974, when Turkey landed its
troops on the island and took over the northern third in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has so far maintained around 45,000 troops in northern
Cyprus, which was declared unilaterally by Turkish Cypriots in
1983 as "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only by
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government decided last year to purchase Russian
S-300 surface-to-air missiles to upgrade its defense capability.
The missiles are scheduled to be delivered later this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reacted strongly to the deal, threatening to block
the delivery and, if that fails, to destroy the missiles.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has criticized Ankara for its threats, but echoed by
the European Union, it has also warned Cyprus against deployment,
which it considers as "counter-productive."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent discussions between U.S. State Department
Special Co-ordinator for Cyprus Thomas Miller and Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos concerning military overflights in
Cyprus, the spokesman said there have been coordinations between
the Nicosia and Athens governments.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos "always acts within the joint strategy between Greece
and Cyprus, concerning issues relating to the Cyprus problem,"
Stylianides noted.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Greek daily "Kathimerini" Sunday,
Miller expressed serious concern with the possibility of a "hot
summer" in Cyprus and the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
He noted that to avoid any negative developments the U.S. is
studying a recent suggestion by Pangalos for the creation of a
no-fly zone of Greek and Turkish military planes over Cyprus, with
guarantees from the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to which both Greece and Turkey belong.

cooperation and advice on preservation issues.
</P>
<P>
Masire would be the first recipient of the proposed yearly
prize, given to people in the political arena for their efforts
to preserve natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
The society said it aims to challenge other politicians to
take conservation seriously. It said people's negligence has

<HEADLINE> World Automotive Industry Acquisition at 28 bln </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- World automotive industry underwent
more than 700 merger or acquisition deals with a value of around
28 billion U.S. dollars last year, according to a survey published
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The annual automotive global deals survey by accountancy group
Price Waterhouse said that the factors leading to the acquisition
deals were Asia's economic turmoil, global over-capacity and poor
prospects for growth.
</P>
<P>
It said that Europe was the main focus of the merger process
last year, with acquisition activity jumping 50 percent from 10 to
15 billion dollars, covering 371 individual transactions.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that as the overall outlook of the markets in
Western Europe and North America is now flat at best, the pace of
consolidation will quicken throughout 1998 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the industry has to continue to globalize
in order to contain costs, requiring investments in technology and
organizational improvements by vehicle distributors as well as
component makers.

<P>
A ceremony to this effect was held in the presence of the

one side, and a miniature of the European continent on the other.
</P>
<P>
France will start to produce the series of euro coins -- from
0.01 euro to two euros -- in several weeks, while Germany,
Belgium, Spain and Italy will also start producing the euro soon.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Revenue Collection to Fall Short of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's revenue collections for
this fiscal year which ends in June are expected to stand at 810
Ugandan Shillings (675 million U.S. Dollars), 30 billion
Shillings (2.5 million Dollars) less than the projected target.
</P>
<P>
In his 1997/98 budget speech last June, Financial Minister,
Jehoash Mayanja-Nkangi set a target of 700 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
A report carried by Monday's East African weekly put the blame
on a number of factors including extreme weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
It said heavy rains across east Africa in September 1997
caused devastation to communication, destroyed crops, lowered
crop yields and prevented farmers from transporting produce to
the markets.
</P>
<P>
This revenue shortfall has also been blamed on global rise in
crude oil prices and the smuggling of petroleum and petroleum
products. The poor performance of imports and value added tax are
also held responsible for the decrease.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's revenue collections have been on the increase since
the creation of the Uganda revenue authority in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991/92 financial year, some 180 billion Shillings (150
million U.S. Dollars) was collected. In the following years, it
rises by leaps and bounds. The revenue collection in the 1996/97
fiscal year hit the record high of 733 billion Shillings (610
million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Uganda, which recently received a debt relief of 350 million
Dollars under an international initiative targeted at debtor
countries with a good financial management record, has a total
external debt burden of more than 3.6 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Uganda will get debt relief totalling 650 million
Dollars from its external creditors.

<HEADLINE> Blair Urges IRA to Decommission Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
warned Sinn Fein on Monday it would have no place in a Northern
Ireland administration unless the Irish Republic Army
decommissioned its Weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We can't have a situation where people who have not given up
the path of violence are taking office in the Northern Ireland
government," Blair was quoted by BBC as saying.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came a day after Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, overwhelmingly voted to back the Northern Ireland peace
agreement which is aimed at ending the 30-year bloody conflict in
the divided province.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has built-in rules to ensure that they would be
"excluded or removed from office" if there was no decommissioning,
Blair added.
</P>
<P>
His latest comments were seen as an effort to reassure the
pro-British unionists who are strongly against Sinn Fein joining
the local assembly before IRA was decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
BBC report said Blair will visit Northern Ireland again this
week to campaign for a yes vote in next week's referendum on the
peace deal which was reached on April 10, this year.
</P>
<P>
Like other major parties involved in the peace process, Sinn
Fein endorsed the peace agreement on Sunday and will urge its
followers to vote yes to the peace deal at the referendum on May
22.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Not Likely to Change Poll Rules: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi said Monday there is no likelihood of changing
the country's electoral legislation before the municipal
elections scheduled for the end of June.
</P>
<P>
This is because bills should be submitted at least 45 days in
advance to the country's parliament for consideration, Southern
African Broadcasting Association quoted Mocumbi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition, Renamo, and 17 other political parties
have announced their boycott of the elections, the country's
first municipal polls since its independence from Portugal in
1975.
</P>
<P>
They accused the ruling Frelimo party of preparing fraud in
the voters' roll, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mocumbi suggested there could be changes in the
electoral legislation, but only after the first round of polling
on 33 cities and towns on June 30.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has done everything in its power to
ensure as many as possible votes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano Monday
reiterated his call on voters to take part in the municipal
elections, saying eligible voters should exercise their right to
choose their leaders.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally in the northwestern province of Tete,
Chissano said there was hope of a better future in people's
lives.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Expresses Deep Regret Over India's Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Monday expressed deep regret over India's announced
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
India announced on Monday that it had conducted three
underground nuclear tests in the western desert state of
Rajasthan.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said, "
for quite some time now, there has been a de facto moratorium on
nuclear testing. The moratorium and the successful conclusion of
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in September 1996
are seen by the international community as setting a norm with
regard to nuclear non-proliferation,"
</P>
<P>
Noting that India is not a signatory to the CTBT, Annan said he is
very concerned that the latest testing is inconsistent with the
pattern which has been firmly endorsed by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General called on all States for maximum
restraint with a view to facilitating nuclear non-proliferation
and nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
He strongly supports accelerated measures of nuclear
disarmament, cessation of all nuclear tests by all States and
strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Install 20 Radio-TV Transmitting Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is planning to make big
stride in broadcasting by installing over the next two years 20
stations capable of transmitting FM radio and TV signals at once.
</P>
<P>
According to a report carried by the latest issue of East
African, a weekly published in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, the
new stations will be able to send signals to over 70 percent of
the country's population and set new standards of sound and
picture quality for east Africa.
</P>
<P>
This broadcasting expansion project is to be carried out in
two phases and will cost some 4.5 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The first phase, likely to be launched in May, involves
setting up FM stations in 12 major towns while the second phase
involves the installation of smaller stations.
</P>
<P>
The number of FM stations across the country will shoot up
from nine at present to 29 on the completion of the project,
giving Uganda the highest FM coverage in eastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The project is widely expected to boost Radio Uganda and
Uganda Television revenues, which have been on the decline since
the setting up of private FM radio stations.

<HEADLINE> WEU Ministerial Meeting Begins in Rhodes, Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rhodes, Greece, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-six Foreign and
Defense Ministers from 28 countries of the Western European Union
(WEU) began later Monday their two-day meeting on the Greek
southeastern Aegean island of Rhodes to discuss the organization's
future role and how to upgrade its operational capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the joint session of foreign and defense ministers,
WEU Secretary-General Jose Cutilheiro said that WEU now had an
important and clearly defined role to play in the European
Security and defense architecture.
</P>
<P>
He added that with this new strengthening both of their
military and their overall political-military structure, added to
the concepts and plans they had already developed, WEU was better
placed than ever to shoulder the responsibility of political
control and strategic direction for a European-led Petersberg
operation, that was crisis management operations in which North
Americans would not wish to involve themselves directly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos stressed
that the WEU's aim should be to contribute by all means to the
enhancement of security and stability by ensuring a commensurate
European participation in collective defense and by an active
engagement in conflict prevention and crisis management in Europe
and elsewhere befitting the Union's political and economic weight.
</P>
<P>
He said that the WEU's most important task remained to gather
the political will required for Europe to shape a truly European
defense identity which he also describes as "a challenge" for the
WEU, European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Greece, which is currently holding the WEU's six-month rotating
presidency, became a full WEU member in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1955, the WEU, the military arm of the EU, now has
10 full members which consist of Belgium, Britain, France,
Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Portugal and
Spain.
</P>
<P>
The WEU also has three associate members that include Iceland,
Norway and Turkey; five observers made up of Austria, Denmark,
Ireland, Sweden and Finland; 10 associate partners from Bulgaria,
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The last WEU ministerial meeting was held in Erfurt, Germany,
in November 1997.

<HEADLINE> Zambia-Egypt Trade to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's participation in the Common
Market for Southern and Eastern Africa (COMESA) will produce
increased trade opportunities between the north African country
and Zambia, the Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (ZACCI) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
ZACCI Chairman Goerge Chabwera said that Egypt's joining the
regional trade group will provide a huge market to Aambia and
other COMESA member countries.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has already exported copper and other commodities to
Egypt and his country's export potential is likely to increase
tremendously if Egypt joins COMESA, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's trade terms are more favorable than those prevailing
in the region thereby giving Zambia an alternative cheaper
market, Chabwera said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia's products are still finding it hard to enter
markets like that in Zimbabwe because of the existing tariff
barriers. But this is not likely to be the case with the Egyptian
market.
</P>
<P>
He urged the COMESA secretariat to expand on its information
capacity in order to woo more trading partners as an important
step to integrate COMESA into the global market.
</P>
<P>
A draft agreement on the accession of Egypt to the COMESA
treaty was concluded here last week by an Egyptian government
delegation and the COMESA secretariat in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will be admitted into COMESA at the group's next
summit to be held next month in Kinshasa, the capital of the
Democratic Republic of Congo.

<HEADLINE> Caspian Environment Protection Fund to Be Set up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A Caspian Sea environment protection
fund is to be set up with the financing of the U.N. Development
Program (UNDP), the European Union (EU) and the World Bank (WB).
</P>
<P>
U.N. resident coordinator in Iran Michael V.D. Schulenburg made
the announcement Monday in Ramsar in the northern province of
Mazandaran, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator said the fund, with an initial capital of 50
million U.S. dollars, is to start operation in June.
</P>
<P>
He said that 12 million dollars would come from the U.N., 6
million from the EU, and the rest from the WB, adding that various
Caspian-based oil exploration companies were also required to
donate.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea was not a regional issue, but a global one, and
the whole world was duty-bound to preserve the ecosystem of the
world's largest inland sea, the U.N. official stressed.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of oil drilling and exploitation in the
region, the Caspian has been facing a growing serious
environmental threat as thousands of tons of various chemical
substances are discharged into the sea every year.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that pollution from and competition among
the littoral states in oil exploitation will damage the ecosystem
and finally destroy the natural resources in and around the sea,
particularly the caviar, a delicacy known as "black pearl."

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Kills 150 S. Leone Junta Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
ECOMOG Monday killed about 150 troops of Sierra Leone's fleeing
junta forces and allied rebels in a battle in the east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The force also captured another 30 of the anti-government
troops, according to a British Broadcasting Corporation report
monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The battle started on April 30 when ECOMOG forces launched a
full scale offensive across the border from neighboring Guinea
into Kailahon District.
</P>
<P>
The district in eastern Sierra Leone is the traditional
stronghold of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which
became allied to the junta shortly after the coup a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Both the junta and RUF were driven out of the capital Freetown
by ECOMOG in mid-February, and the remnants retreated to the
east, promising to fight back from the countryside.
</P>
<P>
A mopping up exercise has since been carried out.
</P>
<P>
After Monday's heavy fighting, some other junta members fled
across the border into Liberia, the report said, quoting a
commander of the civil defense group Kamajors, which fight
alongside with ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajor director of war said soon his men will be pursuing
the junta and RUF troops into Liberian territory because "it is
being used as a safe haven".
</P>
<P>
He also warned any attempt by flying rebels to attack towns or
villages in Guinea will be disastrous.

<HEADLINE> Air Tanzania Refutes Reports on Landing Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Air Tanzania Corporation
(ATC) has refuted media reports that one of its planes diverted
from the runway and got stuck in the mud at the Mwanza airport
when it was landing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
ATC managing director, Dominic Rwenhumbiza, said in a
statement issued Monday that the plane, christened "Serengeti",
landed at the airport as scheduled after getting clearance from
the control room.
</P>
<P>
Rwenhumbiza explained that the pilot, captain John Mturi, was
assured by the control tower that although the runway was wet
following a downpour, normal landing was possible.
</P>
<P>
On touching the tarmac, the statement said, the pilot found
that the runway was submerged by water which was four to five
feet deep. He waited for the water to drain before taxiing to the
airport building where passengers disembarked using a normal
ladder.
</P>
<P>
He said the plane was not stuck in the mud and the passengers
did not use emergency rescue ladder.
</P>
<P>
Since the runway was wet, the aircraft was not cleared to take
off to Kigali as scheduled and had a night stop in Mwanza and
left for Kigali at 09:00 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
The plane came back to Mwanza and then returned to Dar es
Salaam airport at 02:15 p.m., according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to say that it was not true that the
plane had to circle for two hours as reported by some newspapers,
noting that technically it was impossible because it would have
sought an alternative landing port or flown back.
</P>
<P>
Dar es Salaam newspapers reported Monday that passengers
aboard an Air Tanzania Corporation (ATC) Boeing-737 had a narrow
escape after the plane slipped into mud Sunday at an airport in
the Mwanza Region.

<HEADLINE> IRNA Chief Acquitted by Press Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Fereydoun Verdinejad, managing
director of the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) and
publisher of the moderate daily newspaper Iran, was acquitted on
Monday by a special press court after a four-hour deliberation.
</P>
<P>
IRNA reported that two charges were brought against Verdinejad
in the press court, which works under the jury system, but the
IRNA chief "outright rejected" the accusations.
</P>
<P>
Parliament member Ahmad Rasoulinejad accused the Iran daily of
publishing a caricature which was believed to have resemblance
with him. But the court ruled in Verdinejad's favor.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Rasoulinejad, a conservative parliamentarian,
strongly criticized former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
for supporting Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, who was
temporally detained on embezzlement charges.
</P>
<P>
Another charge against Verdinejad was the publication of news
related to the country's police, which claimed that the
dissemination of the news about its activities in the newspaper
would weaken the force's ability, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Defending the newspaper, Verdinejad told the court that his
paper was fully prepared to assist the police in strengthening
the foundation of the country's security.
</P>
<P>
Verdinejad started the publication of the pro-government
newspaper Iran in 1994, which served as one of the main
supporters of President Mohammad Khatami after he was elected last
May.

<HEADLINE> VVD Gets One More Seat From CDA in Dutch Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The People's Party for Freedom and
Democracy (VVD) got one more seat from the Christian Democratic
Appeal (CDA) in the Dutch general election, according to the final
result announced by the election committee on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, a major coalition
with the Labor Party, was awarded 38 seats in the 150-seat lower
house of the Dutch parliament when an intermediate result was made
public last Wednesday. It now has 39 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democratic Appeal now has 28 seats, Dutch
television NOS-TT reported.
</P>
<P>
The number of parliamentary seats for the Labor Party and the
minor coalition Democrats 66 remained unchanged at 45 and 14
respectively.
</P>
<P>
They are followed by the ecological group Green Left with 11
seats.
</P>
<P>
A total of 22 parties took part in last Wednesday's general
election, the 17th of its kind after World War II, and 13 of them
did not get any seat in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Persistent drizzles caused a low turnout rate. Official
figures showed that only 73.2 percent of the 11.7 million eligible
voters went to cast their ballots on the election day.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch public is waiting for the formation of the next
government, of which the Labor Party and the People's Party for
Freedom and Democracy are certain to be in.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats 66 pronounced that if it lost too many of its
seats it would not join in the coalition again. The minor
coalition had 24 seats from the previous election and lost almost
half of them this time. It is still to announce whether to join
the new coalition.
</P>
<P>
The three-party coalition, known as the purple politics, that
took office four years ago, won solid praise from the Dutch public
for its practical economic policies.

<HEADLINE> Former Govt Soldiers in Court on Genocide Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan military has opened
the genocide trials of former government soldiers who were
involved in the 1994 genocide of Tutsis and opposition Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Second-lieutenant Pierre Bizimana and sergeant Aloys Mazimpaka
appeared in Butare war crimes tribunal this Monday morning to
respond to several charges relating to the atrocities they
committed during the 1994 bloodbath that claimed over one million
lives.
</P>
<P>
The two soldiers are the first ex-government soldiers to be
tried for genocide crimes since trials began here in December
1996, Rwanda News Agency quoted official sources in Kigali as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of ex-government soldiers in connection
with the massacres that rocked Rwanda for about 100 days was
still unknown. When genocide broke out here, the presidential
guard of late President Juvenal Habyarimana and other ex-FAR were
on the helm of the atrocities.
</P>
<P>
The two soldiers were from northwestern Rwanda, home to late
President Habyarimana, and were based at Butare college cadet
offices (ESO).
</P>
<P>
The defendants were assisted by a Belgian lawyer, Jerry Jeert
hired by the non-governmental organizations Lawyers Without
Borders based in Brussels. Seventeen genocide survivors were also
present at the opening of the trial, but were not assisted by any
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
After the military prosecutor had read out charges to the
accused, the defense counsel requested the postponement of the
trial claiming that he did not give enough time to examine the
files of his clients. The trail will resume on May 24, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, over 130,000 genocide suspects are detained in
Rwandan jails. About 300 last year were judged, with about 100
death sentences.
</P>
<P>
The first 22 genocide culprits were publicly executed on May
24,1998 and more are expected to follow either in public or
secret places, government officials indicated.

<HEADLINE> Barak Suggests Draft Seminary Students to Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor Party
leader Ehud Barak submitted Monday his bill to Knesset
(parliament) Speaker Dan Tichon, calling for the draft of seminary
students (yashiva) to the defense forces.
</P>
<P>
Terming his intention as not against Israel's Jewish yashiva
students, Barak said the country's defense requires equal
participation of all young people from different religious groups.
</P>
<P>
In his bill, Barak suggests that 700 Jewish yashiva students be
exempted from military service each year.
</P>
<P>
These students, who can be exempted from service permanently,
must remain in yashiva full-time until 25. If they drop out of
yashiva before the age, they should be subject to the draft.
</P>
<P>
Drafting yashiva students into the defense forces is not only
a religious but also a political issue in Israel because the
yashiva students have been exempted from serving in the defense
forces.
</P>
<P>
During the Sunday cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu raised this issue and instructed to set up a committee
headed by the retired Supreme Court Justice Zvi Tal to study the
issue to prevent it from turning into a political crisis in the
country.

LAGOS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone Monday broke silence on
the arms deal involving British firm Sandline, saying the weapons
brought in by the company were not used in fighting against the
legitimate government but the military junta.
</P>
<P>
The British parliament has recently become boiled when
ministers were briefed about Sandline's involvement in Sierra
Leone and whether the arms shipment was in breach of the United
Nations arms embargo on the west African country.
</P>
<P>
However, the Sierra Leonean side ruled out the involvement of
the British government in the arms deal, according to a British
Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
"The president (Ahmed Tejan Kabbah) entered into an
arrangement with Sandline. I don't believe he consulted with the
British government in any formal way," said Information Minister
J. Spencer.
</P>
<P>
He argued the arms and ammunition were used to restore the
legitimate government ousted in a coup last May, thus the case
had nothing to do with the U.N. arms sanction.
</P>
<P>
The British government should be proud even if it was involved
in the deal, the minister stated.
</P>
<P>
He said the weapons probably have been used by ECOMOG, the
sub-regional peacekeeping force which dislodged the junta and
helped restore Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
Under the original agreement, the minister said, the Sierra
Leonean government would allow Sandline to prospect minerals in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He refused to say whether there is any change in the agreement
as Sandline has to deliver what it should have delivered.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Urges U.S. to Press Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia Monday called on
the United States to exert pressure on Israel in an effort to
revive the stalled Middle East peace process, according to Saudi
Press Agency reports from Saudi Red Sea coast city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
The agency said quoting Saudi Information Minister Fuad Faresi
as saying that a cabinet meeting chaired by King Fahd "discussed
the faltering Middle East peace process and ways to reactivating
it according to what was agreed in Madrid, Oslo and Washington."
</P>
<P>
The minister said the cabinet urged "the co-sponsors, the
U.S. and Russia, in particular the United States, to make maximum
efforts to push forward the peace process on the right track."
</P>
<P>
The call came amidst what was seen as playing with time by
Israeli right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to stifle the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton was to be hosting a meeting in
Washington on Monday with Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, but the plan was blocked as Netanyahu refused to
agree with a new U.S. initiative to hand over 13.1 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians to end the 14-month-long deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. peace coordinator Dennis Ross left Israel Sunday after
meeting with both the Israeli and Palestinian leaders and
officially told Arafat the Washington meeting slated for Monday
was delayed.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Arab League (AL) on Monday also
urged the sponsors of the Middle East peace to confront with
firmness the policy of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid warned in a statement
of potential dire consequences of the prevailing atmosphere of
pessimism and frustration in the region.

<HEADLINE> Canada Strongly Deplores India's Nuclear Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada strongly deplored the nuclear
weapons test explosions carried out by India early Monday, and
announced by Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned and very disappointed with India's
decision to carry out these nuclear tests," Canadian Foreign
Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement released here.
</P>
<P>
"This incident is contrary to the international norms
established by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)," Axworthy was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"These tests could have grave implications for global
non-proliferation and disarmament, as well as for regional
security."
</P>
<P>
"We urge India to renounce its nuclear weapons program and to
sign on to the NPT and CTBT," said Axworthy, who is in London for
the G8 Summit.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has asked the High Commissioner for
Canada in New Delhi to ensure that the Indian government clearly
understands Canada's view on this matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy also urged restraint by countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
"On the eve of the G8 Birmingham Summit, G8 heads of state and
government will undoubtedly wish to discuss this serious
development," he added.

<HEADLINE> Over 45% Ugandans Malnourished: Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Vice President Specioza
Wandira Kazibwe said here Monday that some 45 percent of Uganda's
population is malnourished.
</P>
<P>
She made this statement when addressing the opening ceremony
of a two-day workshop on food security and agricultural policies.
</P>
<P>
Food shortages in Uganda, she said is a result of bad weather
conditions caused by the El-Nino phenomenon and lack of
agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
She called for more and better policies to ensure food
security in the country.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said there is need for the growth of food
production to exceed population growth if the people hope to
realize higher incomes and better life.
</P>
<P>
The major challenges facing the agricultural sector, she
added, include food security policy, agricultural technology,
marketing output and job creation by the sector.
</P>
<P>
She predicted that as many as 2.5 million jobs will be created
if the farming families become commercially oriented.
</P>
<P>
She also called for a change in people's nutritional structure
and urged investors to vigorously engage in more agricultural
trading and processing by setting up food processing units in
rural areas.

<P>
ANKARA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook is to visit Ankara on May 19 in an effort to mend the
strained relations between Turkey and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy
spokesman Sermet Atacanli at a weekly news conference here.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the visit will contribute something (to the
Turkish-EU ties), and it is up to the EU to take steps and we
will see if there is such a step," Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
However, he affirmed that Turkey will not discuss "political
issues" with the EU because the European body excluded Ankara
from its enlargement process at its Luxembourg summit last
December.
</P>
<P>
Cook, whose country holds the current EU presidency, is
expected to persuade Turkey to attend the routine Turkish-EU
Council meeting scheduled for May 25.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli added that the British foreign secretary might also
touch on the stalled Cyprus peace talks in his meeting with
Turkish officials since Britain is one of the major international
mediators for the issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkish-EU relationship has been tense since the EU rejected
Turkey's membership efforts and accused the Muslim country of poor
human rights record, poor economic performance as well as creating
tensions with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Top House Fund-Raisers for Mid-Term Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Republican and Democratic
leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives are the top
fund-raisers so far for the November elections, according to the
Federal Election Commission (FEC).
</P>
<P>
The FEC reported Monday that Speaker Newt Gingrich, a
Republican, took in 3.8 million U.S. dollars between January 1,
1997, and March 31, 1998, while House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt, a Democrat, took in 3.1 million dollars during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
Following them were Representative Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat,
and former Representative Bob Dornan, a Republican, each with 1.8
million dollars. Dornan, who is running to get back the seat he
lost to Sanchez in a hotly contested 1996 race, has raised more
money than any other challenger for a House seat. But he faces a
primary for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
The House member with the most cash on hand as of March 31 was
Representative David Dreier, a Republican, with three million
dollars, followed by Gephardt, with 1.9 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the Senate side, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, had
the most money on hand as of March 31 -- 10.6 million dollars. One
of three Democrats vying for the nomination to challenge him,
Representative Charles Schumer, had 8.2 million dollars to spend.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Senate and House candidates reported taking in 338.2
million dollars during the 15-month period. That's 41 million
dollars, or 14 percent, more than they raised during the
comparable period in 1995-96.

<P>
NICOSIA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
predicted Monday that the country's economic growth rate this year
is expected to reach 4.5 percent, up 2 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that meanwhile the fiscal deficit, which accounted for
5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997, is expected
to shrink in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remarks at an annual meeting of the Employers
and Industrialists Federation, which opened in Nicosia Monday. He
said that if employers and the workers' unions exercise necessary
restraint, unemployment and inflation rates are expected to fall
to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Referring to tourism, whose income reached 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars last year and accounts for over 20 percent of the
country's GDP, Clerides said measures would be taken this year to
enrich the island's tourism services to attract more middle- and
upper-class tourists.
</P>
<P>
Clerides stressed that the government's goal was not only to
fulfill the Maastricht Treaty criteria, but also to achieve the
harmonization with the European Union (EU), social justice,
economic stability and development.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty, which went into effect in 1993, aims to
create a political alliance and single currency in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, with a per capita income of 12,800 dollars, began
accession talks with the EU in March.

plan in this regard to help release Pollard who is serving a life
sentence in a North Carolina prison, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Immigration and Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein,

a great step toward the release of Pollard.
</P>
<P>
Pollard, a former U.S. naval analyst and was arrested in 1985
for passing classified military documents to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Despite Pollard's repeated pleas to ask Israel's acknowledge
him as a Israeli agent to seek chances for a pardon, Israel has
always maintained that Pollard acted alone.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel last months reversed its attitude to decide to
work out a plan acknowledging Pollard as its agent.
</P>
<P>
Edelstein said Pollard will be informed of the decision Friday
and the plan is the official position of Israeli government.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States will formally
protest to India over its surprise underground nuclear tests, the
White House said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Mike McCurry said the testing "runs counter to the
effort the international community is making to promulgate a
comprehensive ban on such testing."
</P>
<P>
"The president is deeply distressed by the announcement of
three nuclears tests," McCurry told reporters. "He has authorized
a formal presentation of our displeasure to be made to the
government in New Delhi."
</P>
<P>
He said the protest was likely to be sent to the Indian
government from the U.S. embassy in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials said Washington was possible to impose
sanctions on India for its nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"We're just huddling to assess what happened and what we're
going to be able to do," said one of the officials.
</P>
<P>
And McCurry said possible U.S. sanctions against India were
under consideration. He declined to speculate on whether President
Bill Clinton would go ahead with a planned fall trip to India and
Pakistan this fall.

WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
urged Pakistan not to respond with its own nuclear tests after
India announced its three underground nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly urge Pakistan to refrain from responding with a

Rubin said India's announcement of the tests was a "very very

now considering "next steps," including sanctions as a reaction to
the unexpected development.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions could affect direct bilateral aid, trade assistance
and international financing, he said.

Rubin said India's ambassador to Washington had discussed the
tests with undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering and indicated
the United States found the Indian explanation unsatisfactory.

Several villagers have been trained and given ammunition to
combat poachers.

CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Ahmed
Esmat Abdel-Meguid said on Monday the Arab world is worried about
the stalemate in the Mideast peace process, particularly after the
imminent Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid made the statement after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not go to Washington to meet with
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has proposed to hold the talks on Monday in Washington
under the condition that Israel accepts its initiative to withdraw
from 13.1 percent of the West Bank. But Israel has failed to meet
the demands.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the mediation made by Albright between Arafat and
Netanyahu in London on May 4-5, Abdel-Meguid said the talks did
not have any positive results.
</P>
<P>
He said this state of affairs shows that Israel is not serious
about seeking a just and durable peace in the region, which he
said will "provide security to everyone and returns to the
Palestinians their occupied lands."
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. and Russia, co-sponsors of the peace
process, to stand firmly in the face of the Israeli intransigence.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief called for support for the Palestinians
in the struggle for restoring their legitimate rights, including
the establishment of an independent state with Jerusalem as its
capital.

<HEADLINE> Protection Pact to Boost UK Investment in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A recent agreement between Uganda
and the United Kingdom to ensure protection of each other's
investment in either territory is to boost British investment in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
This pact is aimed at protecting UK investments as Britain has
some 503 licensed projects in Uganda while this former British
colony has comparatively few investments on British soil.
</P>
<P>
This agreement outlines the terms under which compensations
will be paid out in case of losses resulting from
nationalization, expropriation, armed conflicts, state of
national emergency or insurrection.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, nationals or companies of either country
whose investments suffer losses shall be accorded the same
treatments as nationals of that state as regards restitution,
indemnification, compensation or other settlement.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for the unrestricted transfer of investment
returns from either country.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Mugabi, an official with the Uganda Investment
Authority, said,"with the signing of this agreement, we expect to
get more investors from the United Kingdom, because even before
this development Britain was the leading investor in Uganda."
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been engaged in an international campaign to
attract investment, but many investors have been skeptical,
citing the 1972 expulsion of Asians from the country and the
expropriation of their properties.
</P>
<P>
Although the expelled Asians repossessed their property some
time later, quite a number of investors demand government
guarantees that their investments would be protected from
arbitrary military take-overs.

<HEADLINE> FSA Reaches Agreement With Sumitomo on Hamanaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Financial Services Authority
(FSA) Monday announced an agreement with Sumitomo Corporation of
Japan in relation to the copper-trading activities of Yasuo
Hamanaka.
</P>
<P>
In reaching this agreement, the FSA has decided that no purpose
would be served by further consideration of possible use of its
enforcement powers against Sumitomo in relation to Hamanaka,
former head of its Non-Ferrous Metals Department.
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo recognizes the part played by the FSA investigations
in causing Hamanaka finally, in June 1996, to confess to 10 years
unauthorized trading and fraud.
</P>
<P>
Without admission of any liability, Sumitomo now agrees to pay
5,000,000 pounds to the FSA for its investigation and other costs.
</P>
<P>
In reaching the agreement, the FSA recognizes that Sumitomo has
given prompt, valuable and extensive cooperation following
Hamanaka's confession in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
On 13 june 1996, Sumitomo announced the dismissal of Hamanaka
and the discovery of his unauthorized trading over a 10 year
period at a cost to Sumitomo of 2.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo agrees to continue to assist the FSA in the
finalization of its investigations.
</P>
<P>
The FSA said that it has also received substantial cooperation
in investigating and dealing with the Hamanaka affair from
relevant authorities on a world-wide basis.
</P>
<P>
This cooperation is continuing, in particular with the
Securities and Futures Authority and the London Metal Exchange
regarding the finalization of investigations and involvement in
Hamanaka's activities of UK regulated firms and individuals, it
added.

on Wednesday in Washington to find ways for breaking the
deadlocked peace process in the Middle East, the State Department
announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Albright just got off the phone with Prime Minister
Netanyahu and they agreed to meet here in Washington on Wednesday
to discuss ways in which we can overcome remaining differences"
between Israel and the Palestinians, spokesman James Rubin told

Rubin made the announcement after Albright held talks at the
White House with President Bill Clinton, National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger and U.S. special Middle East envoy Dennis Ross.

with Netanyahu would determine whether the basis exists to launch
talks like that of the aborted Washington summit, which was
proposed by the president last week in an effort to revive the
stalemated Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to the scheduled plans, Clinton promised to enter
final status talks between Israel and the Palestinians, but on the
condition that Israel accepts a U.S. proposal to make a further
pullback on a 13.1 percent areas of the West Bank.

LUSAKA, may 12 (xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) countries are expected to import 12
million tons of cereal this year to offset an increasing
shortage.
</P>
<P>
COMESA acting Secretary General Erastus Mwencha said here
Monday statistics show that output of wheat, maize, rice, millets
and sorghum have continued going down in the region, Zambia Daily
Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The large import figure will no doubt have major implications
on the foreign exchange situation in our region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the potential areas under-utilized include irrigatable
land of 20 million hectares out of which 2.5 million hectares are
being currently irrigated, according to the national newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The region also has three major river basins -- the Nile,
Congo-Oubangui and the Zambezi -- which will boost irrigation.
</P>
<P>
"The potential in agriculture could be achieved if all COMESA
member countries are on the same wave length in terms of general
policy orientation and program implementation, " said Mwencha.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Revises U.S. Travel Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has advanced his trip to Washington to meet with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright up to Wednesday from
Thursday, it was announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Albright invited Netanyahu for a meeting during their
telephone conversation Monday night and Netanyahu revised his
U.S. travel plans, advancing the departure time from Thursday to
early Wednesday morning, Netanyahu's office said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington meeting between Albright and Netanyahu will
intensify the diplomatic efforts for arranging
Israeli-Palestinian talks in Washington later this month under
President Bill Clinton's aegis and try to overcome the remaining
gaps between the Israeli and the U.S.-Palestinian positions on the
percentage of Israel's next troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
U.S. has proposed Israel to have a 13.1 percent troop
redeployment in the West Bank and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has accepted this proposal. Israel insisted that
it could only hand over 9 percent of the Wast Bank territories to
the PNA during the next redeployment.
</P>
<P>
But a deal was reportedly reached by Netanyahu and U.S. peace
envoy Denis Ross, who has just returned to Washington from Israel,
that Israel would hand over 9 percent now, and an additional 4
percent would be held "in escrow" by the United States, pending to
be handed over to the PNA on condition of their compliance of the
obligations including fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The planned Washington Israeli-Palestinian talks for Monday
were forced to be postponed to later this month, due to Israel's
rejection of U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
The frenzy of diplomatic activity that preceded the latest
Netanyahu-Albright conversation evidently upset National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon. He instructed his office to
issue a statement Monday night criticizing the manner in which the
current diplomatic contacts are being made behind the cabinet's
back.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Sharon views the attempt to develop
"creative ideas," a term used by Netanyahu, while casting "a fog"
over them at the international level as a "grave and worrisome
situation."
</P>
<P>
It charged that an attempt was being made to implement a 13
percent redeployment and contended that "hints to that effect
have been conveyed to the Americans."
</P>
<P>
Sharon was said to be holding the view that a withdrawal that
exceeded 9 percent threatens national security.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit in the United States, Netanyahu will
do the rounds of his supporters in the congress, make speeches
among American Jews and give several interviews to the
U.S. media.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of offices of foreign
companies in Beijing is increasing, and is not decreasing as some
Chinese papers have reported, today's Economic Daily says.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes officials from the Beijing Industry and
Commerce Bureau as saying that the city had 6,617 offices of
foreign firms at the end of March this year, compared with 5,612
in 1996 and some 6,300 in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is in charge of registering those offices, so its
statistics are accurate, the daily says.
</P>
<P>
The recent reports by some newspapers about a "sharp downturn
in the number of foreign offices in Beijing" are untrue, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The daily also quotes the Press Office of the Beijing Municipal
Government as saying that, in the first quarter of this year, 152
more foreign-funded enterprises registered in Beijing.

Demand from the power industry is expected to be up 30 million

China will try to hold its coal output at the same level as
last year and will restrict production at small and medium-sized

CAIRO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will
start a three-day state visit to France on May 18 upon an
invitation from President Jacques Chirac, with Mideast peace
expected to top the agenda of their talks.
</P>
<P>
"The visit is particularly significant given the delicate
situation being experienced by the Mideast peace process which
arouses concern of all parties interested in the resumption of the
process," said Ali Maher, the Egyptian ambassador to Paris.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador was quoted Tuesday by local English daily the
Egyptian Gazette as hailing France's stance on the Mideast peace
process. Paris has been demanding the implementation by both sides
of the Oslo accords and relevant U.N. resolutions and supporting
the formation of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Maher expected that Mubarak and Chirac would discuss prospects
for a joint action to push forward and salvage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Several French ministers have visited Cairo over the past few
months to explore closer cooperation with the Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
Cairo and Paris are now studying preparations to celebrate the
200th anniversary of the establishment of Egyptian-French ties.
</P>
<P>
In 1798, the French Expedition led by Napoleon Bonaparte
invaded Egypt, marking the start of the bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Gene Mutations May Have Linkage with Hypertension: Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Mutations in a gene called
"angiotensin converting enzyme" (ACE) may be an important cause
for high blood pressure in men, but not in women, two separate
U.S. research teams reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A multicenter team led by Christopher J. O'Donnell of the
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston said that they found
consistent evidence in men but not in women of association and
genetic linkage of mutations in the ACE gene with diastolic blood
pressure (the second number in a blood pressure reading) and
association with hypertension.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, men with the variant gene had a 59 percent higher
risk of high blood pressure, said the report based on data drawn
from 3,095 men and women participating in the Framingham Heart
Study.
</P>
<P>
Another team led by Myriam Fornage of the University of Texas
at Houston Health Science Center reported some additional findings
that support a role for the ACE gene in blood pressure control.
</P>
<P>
Using data on 1,488 siblings with an average age of 15, the
investigators evaluated the contribution to blood pressure
variations of alterations in four gene regions, including the
region for ACE.
</P>
<P>
"In sex-specific analyses, genetic variation in the region of
the ACE gene significantly influenced individual blood pressure
variation in males...but not in females," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Eric Boerwinkle of the University of Texax, senior author of
the second report, said that ACE gene was a likely suspect for
high blood pressure because the enzyme that the gene encodes plays
a role in keeping the blood volume normal by controlling salt and
water balance.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the researchers now must analyze the gene region more
closely to map the exact address of the ACE gene -- and the genes
next to it -- to determine their exact functions.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Equally Important: Lithuanian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania attaches equal
importance to relations with the United States and Russia,
Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Moscow News, Adamkus said Lithuania
is a European country and intends "to coordinate" its moves
officially with other European nations.
</P>
<P>
He said he does not want to "put any special stress on
relations with the U.S.," Adamkus said. "Washington will be given
as much attention as our eastern neighbor, democratic Russia."
</P>
<P>
When answering a question why Lithuania rejected the security
guarantees proposed by Russia last autumn and gave preference to
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
Adamkus said Russia's proposals were "declarative" and that it was
unclear how they could be ultimately implemented.
</P>
<P>
NATO is proposing a radically different concept. "It's a
process in which all European nations are involved, which
guarantees security in the whole Europe," he said, adding that the
position on ethnic minorities in Lithuania differs from those in
Latvia and even Estonia.
</P>
<P>
Adamkus said he stands for diplomatic moves and mutually
acceptable terms in settling problems existing between Russia and
Latvia.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Downplays Unofficial Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos on
Tuesday advised all the leading presidential candidates not to
bank too much on the initial results of the unofficial counting of
the ballots in Monday's elections.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here, Ramos said the people should
wait for the official announcement from the Commission on
Elections (Comelec) and the quick count conducted by the National
Movement for Free Elections (Namfrel).
</P>
<P>
Namfrel is the only duly-accredited citizen arm of the Comelec,
the government agency overseeing elections, to conduct the
unofficial quick counting of the votes cast for the president.
</P>
<P>
But several other groups including a private radio station DZRH
and a local television station ABS-CBN also conducted unofficial
counting of the votes.
</P>
<P>
According to partial results issued by these groups including
Namfrel as of Tuesday noon, Vice President Joseph Estrada of the
main opposition LAMMP (Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses) has
held a massive early lead among the 10 official presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The results also showed that Speaker of the House of
Representatives Jose de Venecia, picked by Ramos as the
presidential bet of the ruling party, lagged far behind Estrada.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos, who is to step down on June 30 when his
constitutionally-mandated six-year term ends, called on all the
presidential contenders to be cautious on the initial unofficial
count.
</P>
<P>
"The reports constitute only 1.5 percent of the actual vote,
assuming that there was a large turnout from 75 to 80 percent,"
Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
The Comelec earlier estimated that 80 percent of the 34 million
registered Filipino voters cast their votes in Monday's national
and local elections.
</P>
<P>
Ramos told reporters that he is still confident that his
preferred successor De Venecia will be the victor in the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also commented on the upbeat mood in the stock market and
the strong performance of the peso in the foreign exchange market
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramos, the major reason for the stability of the
two markets was the conduct of honest, orderly and peaceful
elections Monday as well as the assurance of the presidential
candidates and parties that they will respect the will of the
people.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to Monday's elections, the local stock and
currency markets had been turbulent due to fears of a failure of
elections to be caused by election violence or massive cheating.
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, the voting was conducted in a relatively
peaceful way despite sporadic election-related violence incidents
during which at least 13 people were reportedly killed.

<HEADLINE> Standard Chartered Bank Gives More Financial Aid to Chinese Auto Maker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Standard Chartered Bank
will provide a package of fund-raising services for China's
largest light-duty automobile manufacturer -- Jiangling Group,
according to an agreement signed by the two sides here today.
</P>
<P>
From now on, Standard Chartered will provide Jiangling with
financial services including letters of credit, loans for working
capital, and forward foreign exchange contracts, the agreement
said. Jiangling's loans from the British bank will therefore rise
from 50 million US dollars to 80 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said that today's agreement heralds "a firm
step forward" in the cooperation between Standard Chartered and
Jiangling Group. Last year the two parties, together with Ford
Motor Co. Ltd., developed a commercial vehicle called Transit.
</P>
<P>
Jiangling Group, 30 percent of whose stake is held by Ford,
boasts an annual production capacity of 60,000 vehicles. Chairman
Sun Min noted that Jiangling's production capacity for the Transit
brand can reach 20,000 units in a short period of time and the
vehicles it produces will be sold both in China and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates have put China's domestic demand for
commercial automobiles at 200,000 units per year. A recent survey
by the State Information Center indicates that Transit has bright
market prospects.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Calls on Nation to Unite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Tuesday called on all the candidates, political parties and the
entire nation to unite in the heat of the electoral contest to
ensure the country's continued march to peace and development.
</P>
<P>
"I am calling on all of our people to unite after this very
intense and exciting election campaign," Ramos said in a briefing
at the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
"The voting is over, the counting has begun and it is the duty
of everyone to protect the sanctity of the ballot by making sure
that the vote cast by the voter is counted for the candidate that
he voted for," he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report from the Philippine National Police, Ramos
noted that a total of 151 election-related incidents were recorded
in 1998, compared to 97 incidents in the 1995 midterm polls.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the number of casualties is much less in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"As of the last report, 40 have been killed in various parts of
the country in 1998 -- which is a 45 percent decrease compared to
the 73 in 1995," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president attributed the lower number of casualties during
Monday's elections to the less use of deadly weapons and the
country's more efficient electoral system.

<HEADLINE> Watchdog Group Warns of Cheating in Philippines' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A poll watchdog group in the
Philippines warned Tuesday that cheating could happen at the
municipal and provincial level within three days if it continues
to be denied of a copy of the election returns.
</P>
<P>
Jose Concepcion, chairman of the National Citizens Movement for
Free Elections (Namfrel), told reporters here that cheating could
be prevented if the sixth copy of the election returns is given to
Namfrel coordinators and volunteers, which they would use in
determining whether the votes for the candidates are identical.
</P>
<P>
Under the election law, election returns are impressed in seven
copies. While Namfrel should be provided with the sixth copy, the
other copies are given to the Congress, the election commission,
and major political parties.
</P>
<P>
Namfrel is the only non-governmental organization authorized by
the Commission on Elections to conduct unofficial quick count
operations.
</P>
<P>
"It (sixth copy) is important in the precinct level because it
can be corrected," said Concepcion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Guillermo Luz, secretary general of Namfrel,
admitted the slowness in tabulating the initial results, but said
that this was due to the refusal of polling officers to provide
the sixth copy.
</P>
<P>
Namfrel said earlier that it could release the final unofficial
results within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The official vote counting has been going on at a very slow
pace since it began Monday afternoon after the poll closed. The
final results may not come out in two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of 34 million Filipino voters cast ballots
Monday, choosing a new president, a vice president, 12 out of 24
senators, 260 members of the House of Representatives and
thousands of local officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Automatic ticket machines have
been installed at the railway station in Nanchang, capital of
east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The ticket machines' software, the first of its kind in China,
has been developed jointly by the railway station and the Nanchang
branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the
country's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
Passengers with cards issued by the bank and railway ticket
cards can touch the machine screen and buy any tickets for 85
pairs of trains from Nanchang to elsewhere in China.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of ticket machines has not only provided
passengers with easy accesses but also helped to reduce workload
and accelerate fund settlements, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The Nanchang Railway Bureau has decided to extend the automatic
ticketing machine network to 25 railway stations under its
jurisdiction within this year.
</P>
<P>
Nanchang is the only provincial capital on the Beijing-Kowloon
route, one of China's busiest north-south railway arteries.

CHENGDU, May 12 (Xinhua) -- World champion Marion Jones of the
United States justified the world title by clocking her personal
best of 10.71 seconds to win the world fastest women race in the
100 meters sprint here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
By beating local heroine Li Xuemei, who shocked the world in
her personal best of 10.79 seconds last year, the American woman
sliced off 0.05 seconds of her previous personal best of 10.76
seconds set in the World Athletics Championships last year in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
Days ago in the IAAF Grand Prix in Japan, the 22-year-old Jones
timed 10.79 seconds, signalling her readiness and top-notched
calibre to clinch the title of the world fastest woman.
</P>
<P>
"The track seems pretty good, I can definitely lift my personal
best in this big race," said Jones in a pre-race press conference
yesterday, who arrived here Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Li Xuemei of Sichuan province, who broke both the women's 100
and 200 meters in the Chinese national games, finished in a
distant fourth place in 11.21 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed with my performance today, because I was
slow in the start which was the main reason for my defeat," Li
Xuemei said on the spot.
</P>
<P>
A pair of Bahamas women sprinters finished second and third,
with Savatheda Fynes in 11.06 seconds and Chandra Sturrup in 11.09

dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 270 to 57, while 267
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Guthrie was the most actively traded stock as it registered a
turnover of 12.66 million units. It was followed by TSM which had
11.72 million shares traded. Hong Kong Land was next with 6.41
million of its shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 led the gainers of

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Vice PM Calls on France to Resume Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice Prime Minister Tarik Aziz
Tuesday called on France to resume diplomatic relations with Iraq,
which were cut by Baghdad seven years ago for France's
participation in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who is on a five-day visit in France from Monday, said
during a meeting with the president of French Senate, Rene Monory,
that there is no bilateral dispute between Iraq and France.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the government and public opinion of France
support Iraq. We appreciate the attitude of France and the efforts
it has deployed over the past few years. But we want more
intensive activities in this direction, more understanding and
more support from our French friends," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. sanctions against Iraq has lasted too
long and it has brought tragic consequences to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
On the cooperation between Iraq and the United Nations special
commission of arms inspection (UNSCOM), Aziz said he was "above
all satisfied" with it although both sides have to face up to
many difficulties in their relations.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Aziz will be received by President Jacques
Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
He is also scheduled to meet with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, who is on a visit here, on Tuesday.

BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is seriously

Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks when asked to comment on India's recent
nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
He said that progress has been gradually made in the
process of nuclear arms reduction, with the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons being prolonged indefinitely
and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty being reached.

Under such circumstances, Zhu said, India's conducting of
nuclear test runs against international trend and is detrimental

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Leader Offers Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The leader of Sierra Leone's former
military junta has been confirmed to be on the way to surrender,
according to a statement from the west African peace keeping
force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued in the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown
Monday, said the ECOMOG High Command was aware of the attempt of
Johnny Paul Koroma, the fleeing junta leader, to surrender to the
Catholic mission in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Koroma has offered surrender to
the Catholic Dioceses headed by Bishop George Biguzzi in Makeni,
northern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He did not want to surrender to ECOMOG for fear of his life
and that of his family.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG said the sub-regional force would encourage the former
junta leader and his followers to surrender to ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, ECOMOG was not interested in dead
bodies, which is seen as indication that Koroma and his men would
not be killed if they gave themselves up to the force.
</P>
<P>
Koroma, who seized power from the elected government of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah last May, was dislodged in
mid-February by the Nigerian-led ECOMOG forces.
</P>
<P>
While he ran out of the net of the sub-regional force,
remnants of his army, along with the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) rebels, have since been waging war against the advancing
ECOMOG in the eastern and northern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
After nearly two weeks' heavy fighting, ECOMOG has seized the
town of Koidu in the east border with Guinea when it announced
Monday the killing of some 150 Koroma loyalists and RUF rebels,
as well as the capture of 30 others.

PARIS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan will meet here on Tuesday with Iraqi Vice Prime
Minister Tarik Aziz, U.N. officials said in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is on a three-day visit here, will make a statement
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first meeting between Annan and Aziz when the
U.N. secretary-general signed an agreement on the U.N. inspection
of Iraqi presidential sites with Aziz in Baghdad on February 23.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss the implementation by Iraq of the agreement
and Aziz is expected to raise the issue of lifting U.N. sanctions
against his country which have been extended by the U.N. Security
Council for six months.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the U.S. CNN television last week, Annan
said that he was "personally very satisfied with the cooperation
of Iraqi authorities since February 23," when he and Aziz signed
the memorandum.

<HEADLINE> Shipping Lines's New Levy in Port Mombasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- International shipping lines have
introduced a 70 U.S. Dollars per container congestion surcharge
for all cargoes shipped in and out of the port of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
The International Organization of Vessel Sharing Agreement
(IOVSA) members trading among South Africa, East Africa, Middle
East and Pakistan last week issued a notice, saying that the
surcharge was imposed because of major delays in berthing,
discharge and loading of containers at the port.
</P>
<P>
"Shippers are aware that major delays have occurred at the
port since the end of December 1997 and in the foreseeable future
such berthing delays are expected to continue," the Kenya Daily
Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted the notice as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) held an emergent meeting last
week with shipping lines under the East African Conference Lines
(EACL) to avert the introduction of the levy, said the report.
</P>
<P>
By last week, more than 12 vessels were waiting to discharge
their cargo and some of the waiting vessels which arrived as
early as last month were still anchored mid-stream due to lack of
berthing space.
</P>
<P>
Shipping lines complained that the congestion at Port Mombasa
was so severe that ships were delayed to up to between five and
eight days before they got berthing space.
</P>
<P>
KPA Managing Director Lenny Mwangola in a statement attributed
the ship congestions at the port to the collapse of roads and
railways network in the east African country caused by El Nino
rains.
</P>
<P>
He said that heavy rains during the past several months had
slowed the off-take of cargo from the port due to constraints in
the rail and road transport system.
</P>
<P>
In order to regain a fluid situation and movement of cargo, he
said, KPA will facilitate the removal of hundreds of
containerized imports which had over-stayed at the port.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Bars Foreign Equity in Local TV Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will not allow
foreign stakes in local television stations although foreigners
have sought for such equity holding, it was announced here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat said this had been decided
as there is no national policy providing for "equity participation
by foreign entities or individuals in terrestrial stations."
</P>
<P>
The minister said at a press conference here that he was aware
that foreigners were keen in owning equity stakes in local
broadcasting companies.
</P>
<P>
"But before we strayed, let me reiterate that the country's
television stations are for local equity participation only," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed speculation that the operator of the Johor-based
Best 104 radio station had been granted permission to also run a
television network.
</P>
<P>
"Best 104 has only been given a radio broadcasting license.
Even if they apply to start a television station, they will not
get the approval as the government will no longer issue new
licenses for television stations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has now six television networks, including the two run
by government-owned Radio and Television Malaysia (RTM). The rest
are TV3, Metrovison, NTV7 and the recently licensed Langkawi-based
IMT-GT which covers the Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia growth
triangle.

SEOUL, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government Tuesday
issued a warning for the whole country against septicemia as its
vibrio has been found in fish and clams caught in western and
southern coasts of South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
The disease is reportedly caused by eating raw fish and
shellfish carrying septicemia bacilli and its virus can be lethal
to human beings.
</P>

The Ministry of Health and Welfare particularly cautioned
those who have liver problems not to eat raw fish, clams and
other seafood.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also warned that fishermen could be infected with
the virus through cuts or other wounds suffered during their work.
</P>
<P>
Septicemia is an epidemic in the coastal areas of the nation in
June-October every year.
</P>
<P>
This year's high temperatures have been blamed for having
brought the the disease 20 days earlier than previous years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics of the ministry showed that South Korea had 23
septicemia patients last year, of whom 11 people had died.

<HEADLINE> Australia's New Election Could Be Imminent: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard Tuesday
warned his colleagues to prepare themselves for an election that
could be called within weeks as his treasurer prepared to hand
down a budget that could well decide the outcome of the poll.
</P>
<P>
However, Howard told the coalition party meeting that he had
not yet made up his mind when the election would be called, but
ruled out a poll before the end of the current budget session of
parliament, which is due to run until July 2, the Australian
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Howard made clear the government would be going to the polls on
its economic record, which will be confirmed Tuesday night with
the first budget surplus for eight years.
</P>
<P>
"I am very proud to say that the economy of Australia is the
strongest it has been for a quarter of a century," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were backed up by Treasurer Peter Costello in his
final remarks before handing down the statement.
</P>
<P>
Costello said the statement would "put our house right" and
"get the economic fundamentals right" to create opportunities for
future Australians.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Dengue fever, a cholera-like
disease, had killed 780 people as of May 8 in Indonesia, showed
statistics issued by the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Over 33,000 people had been infected by the disease in 16
provinces of the country since mid January this year, leading
local newspapers Tuesday quoted the statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, has been worst hit by a dengue
fever this year. As of May 8, the death toll in the city had
reached 78, while some 9,488 had been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
However, the dengue fever epidemic is showing signs of abating,
deputy governor in charge of social welfare, Djailani said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of people admitted to hospitals for the disease has
significantly dropped thanks to government-sponsored fumigation
against the virus carrier, the mosquitoes, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The campaign should go on to eradicate the mosquitoes,
although I'm not that optimistic that the disease can be totally
eradicated," Djailani said.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever, an acute tropical disease transmitted by
mosquitoes, leaves its victims with fever, rash and severe pains
in the joints and back.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a dengue fever killed 240 people and afflicted
13,207 others in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Stronger Ahead of Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
stronger ahead of the release of the federal budget Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank foreign exchange dealer Nick Volanakis said
the Australian dollar had a strong move-up overnight in New York
to 63.90 U.S. cents, before slipping back from that level.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 63.56 U.S. cents, up from 63.36 U.S.
cents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Volanakis said the market had been generally bearish over the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
"Ahead of the budget there has been a bit of a square-up," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Volanakis said early selling was seen out of Europe, with the
fear of lower growth estimates from the budget.
</P>
<P>
Also putting downward pressure on the Australian dollar from
Monday night's highs was a weakening in the Japanese yen against
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
But Volanakis said there was good support for the Australian
dollar seen around Monday's lows of 63.22 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello Tuesday said the value of the
Australian dollar had been remarkably stable for a long time
despite the Asian crisis, pointing to the stability of the trade
weighted index which measures the Australian dollar against the
currencies of the country's major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
"We have a currency that responds to external events and in
trade-weighted terms it has been remarkably stable over a long
period of time," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 84.65 from 83.98 against the
Japanese yen, and at 1.1298 from 1.1202 Against Deutsche mark.

<HEADLINE> Tax Free Asia Pacific Show Held in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Tax Free Asia Pacific (TFAP)'98
was kicked off here Tuesday with a total of 260 exhibitors from
more than 20 countries and regions displaying a wide range of duty
and tax free products.
</P>
<P>
Organized by Tax Free World Association (TFWA), the event is
being held in Hong Kong for the first time, in recognition of its
premier status in duty free sales in the Asia Pacific region,
Jacky Paquet, president of TFWA, said at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Sales of tax free products in Hong Kong amounted to 830 million
U.S. dollars in 1996 while the Kai Tak Airport, with sales of 380
million U.S. dollars, beat all the other rivals to be the region's
No. 1 retail outlet, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over 350 brands covering all categories -- liquor, tobacco,
fragrances and cosmetics, accessories, jewelry, gifts and
confectionery are displayed at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center through Friday to an anticipated 3,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the exhibition, a conference was held Monday,
reviewing the events and changes in the duty free industry over
the past year and assessing the effects of the Asian financial
crisis on the industry.
</P>
<P>
TFAP was started in 1995 in Singapore in light of Asia's ever
growing duty free market. In 1996, Asia's sales of duty free
products reached 6.4 billion U.S. dollars, representing 30.7
percent of the industry's worldwide sales, according to TFWA
figures.
</P>
<P>
TFWA was created in 1984, whose members represent up to 90
percent of the global tax free industry. It organizes Tax Free
World Exhibition in Cannes, France, every year.

<HEADLINE> China's Protection of Intellectual Property Rights Improved: US Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- There has been definite
improvement in the protection of intellectual property in China in
recent years, Thomas Moga, an American legal specialist in
copyrights, patents and trademarks, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Moga, who has had extensive consultancy and teaching experience
in China's mainland and Taiwan on intellectual property
protection, said that the U.S. companies should not lose the
opportunities for entering the Chinese market due to their
concerns over the intellectual property protection situation in
China.
</P>
<P>
Moga made the remarks when he met with foreign and local
journalists as well as correspondents from China's mainland and
Macao at the American Consulate General in Hong Kong on his way
from the United States to Shenyang, a city in northeastern China.
</P>
<P>
However, Moga reminded the U.S. companies that intend to enter
the Chinese market to register their trademarks in China first in
a effort to protect their copyrights.
</P>
<P>
Many American companies are not aware of the present Customs
situation in China, Moga said, adding the foreign owners of the
intellectual property rights should pre-register their rights in
the Chinese Customs offices.
</P>
<P>
There are laws in China which people can use to protect
themselves, Moga said. For example, the Consumers Rights Law will
protect the rights of the consumers.
</P>
<P>
"If you find the quality of what you have bought are not
satisfactory, you can take it back to the supplier and get your
money back, and there will be penalty for the sellers," Moga said.

<HEADLINE> BMW Won't Raise Offer for Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- German auto maker BMW AG reaffirmed
on Tuesday that it will not raise its offer for British luxury
car manufacturer Rolls-Royce despite a much higher counter bid
by its German rival, Volkswagen AG.
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances will BMW withdraw or change its current
offer," BMW chief Bernd Pischetsrieder told a shareholders
assembly in Munich.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the battle over Rolls-Royce was not over yet,
Pischetsrieder also noted that only BMW now had an agreement with
British engine maker Rolls-Royce PLC on the exclusive right to the
name of Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
Pischetsrieder's remarks came after the bidding war for the
noble British brand took a surprise turn last Thursday after
Vickers, the parent firm of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, turned to
support Volkswagen to take over the car-maker.
</P>
<P>
The about-face was due to an improved bid from Volkswagen,
which was about 430 million pounds (713.2 million U.S. dollars),
well above the 340 million pounds (564 million dollars) offered by
BMW.
</P>
<P>
BMW had previously engaged in exclusive talks with Vickers on
the planned takeover. But the British company argued that the
higher offer made by Volkswagen would bring more benefits to its
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
A decision is due to be made by a special shareholders meeting
of the British company on June 4.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Bulgarian Trade Ministers Meet in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to work with
Bulgaria to explore new ways for bilateral economic and trade
cooperation, according to Shi Guangsheng, Chinese Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here today with Valentin Vasilev, Bulgaria's
minister of Trade and Tourism, Shi said that Sino-Bulgarian
economic and trade relations are generally good.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the simple means of bilateral trade formed
under the old planned economy can't meet the needs of a changed
economic situation both between the two nations and in the world
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to expand its trade with Bulgaria, and will
encourage domestic companies to set up new enterprises in the
eastern European country or buy shares of its enterprises, Shi
said, adding that China is also ready to make joint efforts with
Bulgaria to explore international markets.
</P>
<P>
Vasilev said he welcomes Chinese investment in Bulgaria, and
that he will provide them with assistance.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Chinese and Bulgarian entrepreneurs held an
economic and trade seminar in which Bulgarian President Petar
Stoyanov delivered a speech.
</P>
<P>
After the seminar, Yu Xiaosong, president of the China Council
for Promotion of International Trade, and Bojidar Bojinov,
president of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of Bulgaria,

<HEADLINE> EU Grants Humanitarian Aid to Southern Caucasus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the 15-nation European Union (EU), cleared on
Tuesday humanitarian aid worth 9.66 million ECU (10.56 million
U.S. dollars) for southern Caucasus countries.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be provided to Armenia (1.6 million ECU),
Azerbaijan (4.1 million ECU) and Georgia (3.96 million ECU).
</P>
<P>
The aid, to be managed by the European Community Humanitarian
Office, will enable non-government organizations to carry out
assistance programs in the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The grant was made in response to a United Nations appeal on
behalf of the region which is experiencing a slight economic
upturn after extreme hardships in the wake of independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The aid is also expected to complement resources made available
by other European Commission services, and bilateral aid from EU
member states, as well as funding from the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, commission officials said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and
humanitarian aid is essential to ensure the survival of the most
vulnerable in the southern Caucasus region. Their situation
results from conflicts in Abkhazia, Ossetia and Nagorny-Karabakh
where peace talks are underway.

<HEADLINE> No Withdrawal of Financial Support for Mozambican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) has no
intention to withdraw its financial support for the local
elections scheduled on June 30 in Mozambique, one European
Commission official has said.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the office of the European Commission in Mozambique
Neves Da Silva said here Monday that the European Union and the
United Nations Development Program have worked out a
20-million-U.S.-Dollar plan to support the Mozambican government
with the local elections.
</P>
<P>
"Technically speaking, the National Electoral Commission (CNE)
of Mozambique, the Technical Secretariat of Election
Administration (STAE) and other government organs have done
excellent work. The preparatory plans have been carried out
quickly and in time. I am satisfied," the Noticias newspaper
Tuesday quoted Silva as saying.
</P>
<P>
Silva, the EU representative to Mozambique and the ambassadors
from some western countries held discussions with Mozambican
Minister of State Administration Alfredo Gamito last Wednesday,
agreeing that various plans for the elections have been
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Silva disclosed that Mozambican government has signed
contracts with the suppliers of the materials to be used in the
elections, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
He added that EU formally assured the suppliers that the
problems had been resolved. But he did not give the details.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the weekly Domingo quoted a diplomat based in
Maputo as saying that EU would withdraw its financial support for
Mozambique because the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party
(FRELIMO) and the biggest opposition party Mozambican National
Resistance (RENAMO) and other opposition parties were unable to
reach accommodation on the issue of local elections, especially
on the redefinition of the roles of the CNE and the STAE.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties insisted that their members be admitted
into the STAE while FRELIMO refused their demand on the ground
that the STAE is a government organ and cannot be politicized.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government said Monday that it had not received
any information about EU withdrawing its support for the
elections in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Gamito said that all the goals of various plans have been
achieved and the next step is to order the materials necessary in
the elections.
</P>
<P>
RENAMO and some other opposition parties previously refused to
participate in the local elections to be held in June in the 33
cities and towns on the excuse that there was rigging in the
voters registration in the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
But FRELIMO said that it would participate in the elections
scheduled to be held in June even if all other parties boycotted
the polls.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the international community would impose
pressure on the rivaling parties so that they will make mutual
concessions to guarantee the smooth going of the elections.

<HEADLINE> China To Commend Outstanding Teachers, Students in Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China will commend 10 outstanding
teachers working under the Spring Bud Project, a project aiming to
help girls with their education, and 10 excellent girl students
aided by the project before June 1, the International Children's
Day.
</P>
<P>
Also commended will be groups and individuals making special
contribution to the project. The event, second of its kind, is
organized by the China Children and Youth Fund and All-China
Women's Federation (ACWF).
</P>
<P>
For the 10 best girl students, the Fund will pay for their
education until college graduation if their academic performance
is good enough to last their schooling to university campuses,
according to a circular for the commendation issued by the ACWF
recently.
</P>
<P>
Another non-government project to help school-age children in
poverty-stricken areas to have access to proper education after
the much publicized Hope Project, the Spring Bud Project was
launched in 1989 and has since helped some 600,000 girls return to
school.
</P>
<P>
Improvement of children's health and education in rural areas,
especially in poor areas, remains China's main task in
guaranteeing children's welfare, said Liu Hairong, a ACWF vice
chairperson.
</P>
<P>
Sharp imbalances have been recorded in the conditions of urban
and rural children, with the mortality of rural infants and
children below the age of five twice that of their urban siblings,
and the incidence of severe malnutrition being 4.6 percent for
urban children below five and 19.5 percent for rural ones.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Spring Bud Project commendation, there will be
10 other major events held in Beijing around June 1 in a move to
arouse deeper awareness of the children's welfare among the
citizens.

<HEADLINE> Major Bridge Linking Somali Capital Cut off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 12 (Xinhua)-- The important bridge that linked
Mogadishu to Kismaio has been cut off by the Majerten forces led
by General Mohamed Saeed Jirsi Morgan Monday, reports from the
southern Somali region of Lower Jubba indicated.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses told Xinhua in Mogadishu via VHF radio that
General Morgan's men attached several mines and large explosives
in many parts of the bridge and its underneath then exploded it
on a remote control device.
</P>
<P>
People in the area were terrified by the loud noise from the
bridge which has now fallen for the second time since the
fighting began in mid April.
</P>
<P>
Morgan's militiamen are now in defensive positions behind the
wreckage of Kamsuma bridge, 90 km north of Kismaio.
</P>
<P>
The destruction of the bridge followed a bitter fighting
between the Marehan militiamen and those of the Majerten forces
over the control of the port town.
</P>
<P>
Even though there are many other ways to reach the port town
of Kismaio, still Kamsuma bridge has been the most important road
since it is the only tarmac street linking Mogadishu and Kismaio.
</P>
<P>
According to the Marehan SNF militia commanders, the reason
for blowing off the bridge is due to the weak militia strength of
Morgan's who ultimately decided to destroy the bridge as the best
and cheapest defense against the Marehans.
</P>
<P>
The Kamsuma bridge has been beneficial economically for the
two southern regions of Lower Juba and Middle Juba for its smooth
facilitation of all commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
With the bridge now destroyed, thousands of people are moving
to neighboring towns and villages to avoid further fighting and
possible spread of famine.
</P>
<P>
So far, nearly 200 people are believed to have died in the
conflict over the control of Kismaio in Lower Jubba region and
more than 300 others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Baidoa national reconciliation conference
scheduled on April 15 is obviously not taking place in time.
</P>
<P>
Abdulkadir Mohamed Aden Zoppe, a prominent leader of the
Rahanwein community, told the reporters Tuesday that despite the
financial difficulties, the conference won't start as long as
Hussein Aidid's militiamen remain in the regions of Bau and
Bakol.
</P>
<P>
According to Zoppe, Hussein Aidid has agreed with the
Rahanweins to pull out from Baidoa in a systematic way so as to
avoid the free-lance gangs who would benefit from the power
vacuum in those regions after their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the on-going peace meeting for the faction
leaders in the capital is expected to announce the postponement
of the Baidoa conference by Thursday for another 45 days or more
for the third time since the Cairo peace deal was signed late
last December.

the Thai government and people will surely overcome the current
difficulties and make the Thai economy re-embark on a track
of healthy growth and will play an important role in invigorating
the regional economy.

</P>
<P>
Wan Nor told Jiang that his country has got unselfish help and
support from the Chinese government since Thailand was hit by the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Rejects New Round of Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will reject any call
for the World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting in Geneva next
week to hold a fresh round of trade talks to re-discuss all
aspects of multilateral trade, International Trade and Industry
Minister Rafidah Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's stand is that the resolutions endorsed in the
earlier Uruguay Round should be settled first before a fresh round
of talks could start, Rafidah said after attending the summit
meeting of the Group of 15 (G-15) developing countries in Cairo
Monday, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"As for Malaysia the issue before us is the question of
economic recovery. We don't have the time to concentrate on
discussing again matters relating to a new round of multilateral
trade talks given the limited time," Rafidah was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
She said that despite pressures from developed countries,
Malaysia adamantly maintained that opening the market for specific
sectors could be expedited through sectoral liberalization.
</P>
<P>
"It should not be through what is called as multilateral as in
a global or comprehensive context encompassing all items and all
matters," Rafidah said, adding that Malaysia, as a developing
country, could not afford to do so at the moment because it had to
handle several other problems.
</P>
<P>
Several countries at a meeting of G-15 trade ministers prior to
the summit supported Malaysia's stand, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Several countries share the same stand as Malaysia's on the
WTO. They accept the recommendations of the trade ministers'
meeting where Malaysia itself distributed the policy paper on the
stand of the developing countries in the WTO for next week's WTO
meeting," Rafidah said.
</P>
<P>
In the policy paper, Malaysia suggested, among other things,
that new issues relating to the WTO should require no scrutiny and
that whatever has been agreed to in the past should be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the agenda before us, that's all that we'll have to
implement. The rest is just for information. For example if we
want to discuss government procurement or another issue, it is
only for information. It should not be discussed in the WTO as a
trade issue," she said.
</P>
<P>
During the G-15 summit's first day deliberations, she said,
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad submitted a working paper on the
Asian financial crisis detailing out the negative impact of
currency devaluation and the resultant social and economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
She expected the G-15 leaders to reach certain agreement to
jointly tackle currency-trading problems with other organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union decided Tuesday
to back the establishment of a permanent international criminal
court (ICC).
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union set aside a grant of 390,000 European
Currency Unions (435,000 U.S. dollars) for the 1998 international
campaign to set up the ICC court.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be awarded to the non-government organization,
"No Peace Without Justice" (NGO), which has been fighting for the
adoption of an international treaty on the ICC court by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Societies shattered by the nightmare of war cannot resume
normality unless the guilty are brought to justice. We have seen
this in Yugoslavia, in Rwanda and in other places," European
Commissioner Hans van den Broek said.
</P>
<P>
A grant of 238,330 ECUs (265,880 dollars) will also be
earmarked by the body to help the work of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague with a
specialized library, a technical support system and a study place
for tribunal staff.
</P>
<P>
An international criminal court treaty conference is scheduled
for June and July this year when non-government organizations are
expected to campaign with conferences, advocacy and participation
in Rome.

<HEADLINE> Jones Tapes 10.71 in World Fastest Women Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, China, May 12 (Xinhua) -- American world champion
Marion Jones bolted off from the blockers like a thunder out of
the blue, leading all the way to win the eye-popping world fastest
women race with a fabulous time of 10.71 seconds here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old former basketball star beat off all her
opponents in the 100 meters with a sizable edge, improving her
personal best by 0.05 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Her impressive winning time is the fastest time in 10 years,
and only her compatriot Florence Griffith-Joyner registered faster
clockings in history.
</P>
<P>
Savatheda Fynes of Bahamas, world bronze medalist, romped home
in 11.06, ahead of her compatriot Chandra Sturrup who finished
third in 11.09. The pair also improved their personal bests.
</P>
<P>
China's Li Xuemei, who was regarded as a tough nut to crack for
Jones before the big duel, disappointed her hometown crowd greatly
by wrapping up fourth in 11.21, well out of her personal best of
10.79.
</P>
<P>
"I think I can run much faster than this, I am still in my
early career, I hope I can become a versatile athlete like Jackie
Joyner-Kersee. My goal is to win five gold medals in the Sydney
Olympics, I think it is very possible," said the multi-talented
American who is not only the world number one in the 100 and 200
meters, but also set a year's long jump best last week and did
pretty good in the 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
While Jones celebrated her triumph with a big smile, her
nemesis Li Xuemei was seating in front of some 250 journalists at
the press conference with tears in her eyes. The 21-year-old burst
into tears when she answered questions.
</P>
<P>
"I am sorry I have disappointed all the home crowd and those
who have concern to me. I let them down. I want to say I am
terribly sorry. I don't know why I ran so slowly."
</P>
<P>
However, Lou Dapeng, an executive member of the International
Amateur Athletics Federation and president of the Chinese
Athletics Association, is the Mr. know-how. He pointed out that
lacking experience at international meets is the main reason to
explain Li's failure today.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese athletes only focus on their training, seldom go to
compete in the world, so they often fail to bring out their best
marks and feel nervous in the major competitions," said Lou.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 yelling home fans cheered for the
unprecedented event in history.

<HEADLINE> German Economy to Grow, But No Boost to Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economic growth is set to
pick up steam in the next two years, but this will still be
insufficient to stem the country's record-high unemployment, six
leading German economic research institutes predicted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The general economic conditions as well as the overwhelmingly
positive estimates shared by enterprises all speak in favor of a
continuing and even a strengthening economic upswing," said a
joint spring economic report issued by the six institutes
comprising the government's Council of Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
The report says Germany's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is
expected to grow by 2.6 percent this year and 2.7 percent in 1999,
after rising 2.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The main driving force for the economic recovery would continue
to be exports, which were expected to increase 10 percent this
year but slow to a growth of seven percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
After near stagnation in 1997, domestic demand was expected to
revive this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However the institutes also cautioned that despite the economic
upturn, the outlook on the job market would remain bleak. A
post-war record jobless rate of 11.5 percent was registered in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate is expected to remain virtually unchanged
this year and only fall to 11.0 percent next year.

<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government treasures
its ties with Bulgaria, and respects the country's internal and
external policies and the development road the people have chosen

</P>
<P>
In a meeting here with visiting Bulgarian President Petar

a wide range of major issues.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that your excellency's current visit will serve to
increase our mutual understanding, deepen the traditional friendly
relations between the peoples of the two countries and continue to
push ahead bilateral friendly cooperative relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said traditional friendship exists between the two
nations and for many years the mutually beneficial cooperation and
deep friendship between the people of the two countries have
progressed steadily despite the changeable international situation.
</P>

long-term, stable and comprehensive Sino-Bulgarian relationship
into the coming century in line with the principles of mutual
respect, benefit and equality," Zhu added.
</P>

Stoyanov said the two countries have maintained a lasting
traditional friendship and have a basis for wide-ranging
cooperation.

partnership with China, he said, adding that this is not a
temporary plan but the consensus of all Bulgarian political forces.
</P>
<P>
His ongoing China visit will further enhance friendly
cooperation between the two countries, Stoyanov said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on further
expanding bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the Chinese government is willing to continue
expanding its economic and trade cooperation with Bulgaria on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, both nations are undertaking economic
reforms and the governmental functions are also undergoing drastic
changes.
</P>
<P>
Both sides should explore new means of cooperation, he said,

reputable companies of both countries to start joint ventures,
solely funded firms or to collaborate in opening a third-country
market to expand bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov said China has leading the world in economic reform,
and that the country is now enjoying the fruits of its
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, with a good geographic location, is also undertaking
economic reform, and this provides an opportunity for the two
countries to strengthen bilateral economic and trade cooperation,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov stressed that Bulgaria is ready to closely cooperate
with China in the economic and trade sectors, and that all
departments and regions should also improve their contacts.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that, with the concerted effort of both
sides, bilateral economic and trade cooperation would achieve new
progress.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Stoyanov briefed Zhu on the economic
situation in Bulgaria. Zhu said he was pleased with the economic
achievements of Bulgaria.
</P>

WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- India conducted three underground nuclear tests at a site in
the country's northwestern desert, nearly 24 years after its only
other nuclear test. The move appeared to signal India's
determination to abandon decades of ambiguity in favor of openly
declaring it has nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton ordered Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright to meet Wednesday in Washington with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to try to resolve the latest impasse in the
Mideast peace talks. The United States has given Israel a deadline
for accepting a plan to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank,
but the deadline was extended when the prime minister refused.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Attorney General Janet Reno Monday requested the appointment
of an independent counsel to investigate allegations that Labor
Secretary Alexis M. Herman took part in an influence-peddling
scheme while she served as a White House aide during President
Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
-- The Immigration and Naturalization Service Monday stopped
issuing new visas for temporary ligh-tech workers, saying it
already has reached the category's annual limit. The move injected
new urgency into congressional efforts to raise the cap.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Inspections of older 737s continued after weekend
examinations showed extensive wear around wiring bundles near fuel
tanks in nearly half the 71 jets checked so far, the FAA said.
Airlines said inspections are moving quickly and any disruption of
travel has been minimal.
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton is to travel to Germany and meet with Chancellor
Kohl Wednesday. The visit is to commemorate the 50th anniversary
of the Berlin Airlift, but it is also expected to bolster Kohl's
bid for re-election. He faces a tough race against a strong Social
Democrat rival in the fall.

TOKYO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government expressed
regrets Tuesday over nuclear tests conducted by India Monday, and
urged the Indian government to halt its development of nuclear
weapons.
</P>

India's new administration for to show maximum self-restraint on

self-restraint in order to prevent the Indian nuclear testing from
harming the stability of the region,'' the top government
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hiroshima Mayor Takashi Hiraoka said the Indian
nuclear tests were "extremely deplorable" because they came at the

<P>
The city will also provide such free services as airport

Some Chinese businesses have shown an interest in investing in
Pittsburgh and have contacted the city government, Murphy
said. Although there has been no progress so far, the mayor said
he is confident in the future of Chinese investment in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh is known as the "Steel City" in the state of
Pennsylvania. Since 1994, it has attracted investment valued at
850 million U.S. dollars, and 150 foreign businesses have set up
plants in the city. A total of 29 institutes of high learning and
more than 100 high-tech companies are located in the city.
</P>

Chinese companies began investing in the United States at the
end of the 1970s. By last year, 526 Chinese trading or non-trading
businesses had been set up in the United States with contractual
investment of 682 million U.S. dollars, including 471 million
U.S. dollars from Chinese investors.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese investments cover such business sectors as
agriculture, technology, clothing and insurance.
</P>
<P>
A senior Chinese official in charge of Sino-U.S. trade said
that, although China is not a country of capital export, its

development and processing trade.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the United States, the world's most developed
country, Chinese companies can engage in labor-intensive
businesses, or manufacture products with a traditional competitive
edge.

told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The 1998-1999 financial year starts on July 1, 1998 and ends on
June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In his third and final budget before an election, the treasurer
announced a range of new spending measures which focus on health
and the elderly, including greater access for self-funded retirees
to government concessions.
</P>
<P>
However, the budget indicated that the Asian financial crisis
would start to hit the Australian economy within the next 12
months.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth is forecast to slow down to 3 percent from 3.75
percent this year, unemployment is forecast to drop only
marginally to 7.75 percent by June 1999 from 7.9 percent last
month, and inflation is projected to rise to 2.5 percent next year
from the current 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Australia's current account deficit is projected to worsen to
19.5 billion U.S. dollars during the next financial year, or 5.25
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), due to the Asian
crisis, the treasurer said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest spending measure in the budget is a 630 million
U.S. dollar, four-year plan to allow business to write off the
cost of replacing computer software to counter the year 2000
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The budget maintains the 18 billion U.S. dollar offer for
five-year public hospital funding, representing a 15 percent
increase, although only the Queensland state and Canberra of its
six states and two territories accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
Australia's official aid overseas during the next financial
year will be increased to 1.48 billion Australian dollars (931
million U.S. dollars) from 1.43 billion Australian dollars (900
million U.S. dollars) for financial 1997-1998, a real increase of
0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Vietnam, the three largest
recipient nations of Australia's official aid in the current
financial year, are expected to maintain their positions by
receiving 201 million, 67 million and 44 million U.S. dollars in
aid respectively.
</P>
<P>
Australia's defense spending in the coming fiscal year would be
maintained at 10.9 billion Australian dollars (6.86 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Costello said the budget set Australia on a course to remain a
strong economy in the region, but more reform was needed,
including a shakeup of the tax system.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister Holds Talks with Estonian Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan held talks with visiting Estonian Minister of Foreign
Affairs Toomas Hendrik Ilves here today.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the Sino-Estonian ties have developed smoothly
and mutual understanding between the two countries has increased
since they established diplomatic relations seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved tangible results in various fields," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China attaches importance to bilateral ties,
adding that there are no obstacles for the two to further their
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
China supports the efforts made by the Estonian people in
safeguarding their national independence and sovereignty and
respects the external and internal policies adopted by Estonia,
according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the stance of the Estonian government
in adhering to the "One China" policy and not forming official
ties with Taiwan, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed the hope that China and Estonia will tap
economic and trade potentials so as to uplift such exchanges to a
new level.
</P>
<P>
Ilves expressed his satisfaction for the Estonia-China
ties. "Although Estonia is a small country and China is a big one,
the two share some common points," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said both China and Estonia have hard-working peoples and
hope to develop mutually friendly ties.

<HEADLINE> Jones Confident of Winning Five Golds in Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, China, May 12 (Xinhua) -- World champion Marion Jones
said she is confident of taking five gold medals in the 2000
Syndey Olympics after winning the World Fastest Women 100-meter
Race with a personal best of 10.71 seconds here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"My goal and my dream are to win five gold medals in Sydney
Olympic Games," she said, "I think it's very possible, if I stay
healthy and continue to have fun. If everything goes as it should."
</P>
<P>
The multi-talented athlete is not only the world number one in
the 100 and 200 meters, but also set a year's long jump best of
7.05 meters last week and did pretty good in the 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
The time of 10.71 was not only her personal best, but also the
best since Florence Griffith-Joyner clocked 10.70 in Indianapolis
on July 17, 1988.
</P>
<P>
But Jones kept a low profile on when to break the world record
of 10.49, also set by Griffith-Joyner in 1988.
</P>
<P>
"I only think I can run faster, sub 10.70, that's my goal," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The basketballer-turned-sprinter has made remarkable progress
in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials, she failed to qualify. But in
the 1997 Athens World Athletics Championships, she shocked the
world by taking the 100-meter title in 10.76, which was the year's
best.
</P>
<P>
She maintained the momentum this year, clocking 10.79 to win
the Osaka Grand Prix last Saturday, a day before she arrived in
this capital city of Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
Jones said the wonderful performance here was not because of
money, but because of the exciting atmosphere in the Chengdu
Stadium wherein the race drew about 20,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
"The reason that I had such wonderful performance was because
of you, because of the fans and because of the other competitors,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"I think I have been blessed to have a group of men who
surround me every day, my manager, my coach and my boy
friend. This does give me power."
</P>
<P>
But the American denied that she is the greatest female in the
world and admitted there is still a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
"I do not consider myself such a outstanding female in the
world ever because it's very early in my career. I have fun, I am
still young, I am only 22. We set up the races accordingly, so I
don't get burned out."
</P>
<P>
And she hoped to come to this lucky place. "Definitely, if you
invite me again, I love to come back. I love to come to this
wonderful situation to have another race next year."

<HEADLINE> Growth of China's External Trade Slackened by Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The impact of the financial crisis
in southeast Asia on China's external trade has started to show
as the year-on-year growth rate of its trade volume in the first
four months dropping some 5.1 percentage points from last year's
figure.
</P>
<P>
A latest report from the Customs shows that China's foreign
trade volume from January to April was 97.48 billion US dollars,
up by 7.9 percent from the same period of last year, while last
year's year-on-year growth was 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Drastic devaluation of the currencies of southeast Asian
countries, Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK), all China's
important trading partners, combined with China's own tax rebates
and exemption policies, resulted in an year-on-year exports growth
15.3 percentage points lower than last year's and an import growth
3.6 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
Customs figures show that China made an export volume of 56.19
billion US dollars, up by 11.6 percent over the same period of
last year, and an import volume of 41.29 billion US dollars, up by
3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Naturally, China's exports to southeast Asia, Japan and the ROK
dropped while imports rose, and the pattern just reversed with
the European Union and Russia. Both imports and exports to Hong
Kong and the United States kept growing.
</P>
<P>
State-owned industries and overseas-funded businesses accounted
for 48.8 percent and 48.1 percent in the trade volume for the four
months, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded processing businesses still played a leading
role in achieving growth in export, and the increase of imported
equipment by these businesses as part of its investment
demonstrated the effectiveness of tax rebates and exemption in
promoting overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows that exports and imports of primary goods
dropped by 15.1 percent and 12.8 percent respectively, while those
of industrial products rose by 16.1 percent and 7.7 percent
respectively. Exports of industrial products accounted for 89.2
percent of the total exports.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Curb In-Flow of Unskilled Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government urged
the country's construction industry on Tuesday to restructure
itself fundamentally and reduce its dependency on low-skilled
foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
"The construction industry must restructure itself
fundamentally. It cannot afford to continue with its high
dependency on low-skilled foreign workers," Minister for National
Development Lim Hng Kiang said at an awards presentation ceremony
for the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the current economic climate presented "a good
opportunity for change", as sweeping changes would be more
difficult and disruptive to introduce at a time of frenzied
growth.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1997, the total number of foreign workers in
Singapore more than doubled from over 200,000 to over 450,000, the
minister said, adding that last year alone, the number rose by
more than 100,000.
</P>
<P>
While these figures include foreign workers in different
sectors of the economy, the bulk of the increase in the last two
years came from the construction sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the majority of these foreign workers were unskilled
and their productivity was "very low." The construction industry's
productivity level, measured in value-added terms, dropped from 4
percent in 1991 to minus 5.7 percent last year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In order to curb the in-flow of the unskilled foreign workers
into Singapore, Lim said the government Construction Industry
Development Board (CIDB) will introduce a Basic Skill Test for
foreign workers on August 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The test will cover generic competencies expected of a
construction site worker, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said a certain proportion of foreign workers being brought
into Singapore would have to pass this test before they are
allowed entry.
</P>
<P>
This test-taking requirement will start with 20 percent of all
foreign workers approved to be engaged by a contractor. The
percentage will be increased over the years until it reaches 100
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the carrying-out of the Basic Skill Test, CIDB
will assist the industry in setting up more skill testing centers
in other labor source countries in addition to the existing ones
in China, Thailand and Myanmar, the minister said, but he stopped
short of naming those "other source countries."

BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Publicity Department of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the Ministry
of Education have issued a circular requiring that all
universities and colleges across the country offer a course on
Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
The circular notes that many institutions of higher learning
have started such a course in recent years, with the compilation
of teaching materials and the preparation of many good teachers.

The ministry requires that all universities and colleges offer
the course this fall when a new semester begins.
</P>
<P>
The Publicity Department and the ministry have demanded that
priority be put on selecting teachers with good political
awareness to teach the course. In the meantime, teaching materials
should be compiled and teaching methods be improved so that
students can apply the theory in practice.
</P>
<P>
The department and ministry have also urged local publicity

<TEXT>

SINGAPORE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) is committed to opening up the country's financial
sector to more competition, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,
who is also chairman of the MAS, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The MAS will allow market participants more free play to
innovate and take risk, he said at the opening of a two-day
seminar jointly hosted by the World Bank's Economic Development
Institute and the MAS.
</P>
<P>
The topic of the seminar is the importance of banking and
financial system soundness to economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the Singapore government would undertake these reforms
through a steady series of incremental changes rather than in a
big bang, so that this approach would ensure there would be time
for institutions and participants to adjust and adapt.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to reduce the risk of future crises,
governments must pursue prudent fiscal and monetary policies to
ensure sound macro-economic fundamentals, and bank regulatory and
supervisory systems must be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there must be greater disclosure and transparency,
while Asian countries must develop deep and broad capital markets,
and rely less on banking systems for financial intermediation, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Western Ministers Voice Concern Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RHODES, GREECE, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and defense
Ministers of the 28 Western European Union (WEU) member states
Tuesday voiced strong concern over the situation in the
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a "Rhodes Declaration" released after the two-day meeting,
the ministers said they were deeply concerned about the increasing
violence and growing polarization in Kosova.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been growing since February when Serbian police
clashed with ethnic Albanians of Kosovo who make up 90 percent of
the province's nearly two million population.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians have been calling for independence from
Yugoslavia and integration into Albania, but Belgrade stripped
Kosovo's autonomy in 1990 and strongly opposes independence.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said no changes should be made to the borders of
Yugoslavia, and urged the parties concerned to take immediate
steps to ease the tension and begin an "unconditional dialogue."
</P>
<P>
The ministers also expressed their readiness to promote a clear
and achievable path towards Yugoslavia's full integration in the
international community, should Belgrade take the steps needed to
launch substantive talks on Kosovo's political status.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade, however, is strongly opposed to any external
intervention in the Kosovo issue, and a recent referendum in
Yugoslavia backed the government's stance.
</P>
<P>
Liuis Maria De Puig, President of the WEU Assembly, said
Tuesday the body should now make a decision to prepare for
intervention which would take place only if the situation were to
deteriorate and if no negotiated settlement was possible.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis to Affect Australian Economy: Treasurer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian Treasurer Peter
Costello predicted on Tuesday that the current Asian financial and
economic crisis would have a significant impact on the Australian
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The financial and economic crisis in Asia will have a
significant influence on the Australian economy in (the fiscal
year of) 1998-99," he told parliament when delivering his third
budget.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the influence, he said, Australia's economic
growth is projected to be 3 percent in the next financial year
starting on July 1, 1998, compared with the estimated 3.75 percent
growth rate for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Costello also predicted that the greatest ever financial crisis
in Asia was expected to trigger a 19.5 billion U.S. dollar blowout
in Australia's current account deficit, edging up to 5.5 percent
as a proportion of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Asian economic slowdown would reduce
export returns and when coupled with strong local demand would
lead to a temporary rise in the current account deficit. But the
blowout remained below the peaks in the 1980s and mid-1990s, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"The most obvious effects will be on export volumes and prices,
resulting in lower levels of exporters' incomes than would
otherwise be the case, with consequent impacts on output and
employment elsewhere in the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, as is already evident, the exchange rate (of the
Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar) will also be affected
by these developments."
</P>
<P>
"A lower exchange rate than otherwise would have occurred will
tend to lessen the impact of lower world demand and prices on
exporters' incomes while increasing the impact on consumers
through higher import prices."
</P>
<P>
The treasurer said that in the absence of the downturn in Asia,
Australia's economic growth in the financial year of 1998-1999
would have exceeded the 3.75 percent rate estimated for the
current financial year.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the uncertain Asian outlook, particularly in
Japan, were posing risks to the Australian economy in the coming
financial year and beyond.
</P>
<P>
The Asian crisis would not only have an adverse effect on
exports, but would affect confidence, resulting in slower growth
in business and consumer spending in Australia, the treasurer
said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that in the midst of this turbulence,
Australia's growth would remain as strong as it could be, thanks
to measures taken by the current government to reduce the 6
billion U.S. dollar budget deficit it inherited from the previous
government two years ago, and Australia's healthy financial
system.

<HEADLINE> WEU to Strengthen Relations With NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
RHODES, Greece, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign and Defense
Ministers from 28 Western European Union (WEU) countries decided
Tuesday to further develop relations between the WEU and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
In the Rhodes Declaration released after their two-day
conference here, the ministers reiterated that the Atlantic
alliance must continue to be the basis for collective defense
under the Washington treaty.
</P>
<P>
The alliance had begun a process of adaptation and reform, so
that it could more effectively carry out the full range of its
missions, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The process was aimed at strengthening and renewing the
trans-Atlantic partnership, including building a European Security
and Defense Identity (ESDI) within NATO which would enable all
European allies to take greater responsibility for their security
defense, it said.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also reaffirmed that the union would continue
to take all necessary measures so that the ESDI could be grounded
on sound military principles and appropriate military planning.
</P>
<P>
The WEU was an essential element for the development of the
ESDI, ministers said, reiterating their commitment to continue
their efforts to enhance institutional and practical cooperation
with NATO.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1955, the WEU now has 10 full members, three
associate members, 10 associate partners and five observers.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese officials attended a
lecture today on financial security and improvement of the legal
system in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Senior leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Hu Jintao, Wei
Jianxing and Li Lanqing along with Communist Party and government
officials were present at the lecture given by Cao Jianming, a

state security, the prevention of a financial crisis in various
countries by means of law and relevant legislation on financial
supervision, and hidden domestic peril in the financial sector. In
the meantime, Cao put forward some suggestions on safeguarding
financial security in China.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the lecture, Jiang Zemin, Chinese president and
general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, said that crimes and offenses in the financial sector
must be cracked down on through better legislation, stricter law
enforcement, tighter supervision and more publicity on financial
knowledge.

awareness about the importance of financial work in the national
economy, and make more of an effort to carry out central decisions

<HEADLINE> Japan's Wholesale Prices Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's domestic wholesale prices had
dropped 2.3 percent in April from a year earlier, posting the
biggest fall since July 1987, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In April, the domestic wholesale price index, which measures
inflation on the level of corporate transactions and is considered
to foreshadow trends in consumer prices, stood at 97.6 against the
1995 base of 100.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices of electronics goods fell amid weakened
demand, and petroleum products prices declined due to sluggish
crude oil prices, the Japanese central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The latest data indicated that Japan is facing growing concerns
over deflation, or an economic contraction with falling prices,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the BOJ data, Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, played down concerns that Japan will be caught in a
deflationary spiral.
</P>
<P>
"You are going too far if you are talking about concerns of
deflation without watching inventory movements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the world's second largest economic entity, has seen its
economy grind to a standstill since 1991, and the recent financial
crisis reeling through Southeast Asia had been felt in Japan whose
exports have been badly hit.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
here Tuesday that Russia must adopt a dynamic foreign policy in
its endeavor to fulfill a range of important tasks, Itar-Tass
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a 45-minute address to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the
president said the major tasks included the preservation of
territorial integrity, the guarantee of national security, social
democratization and reforms and economic integration into the
world market economy.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also reportedly urged a speedy ratification of the
Second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START-2) and the signing
of the START-3 agreement with the United States.
</P>

complete balance with the United States in the levels and quantity
of strategic offensive weapons.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also stressed the importance of a balance between
security interests and practical economic possibilities.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia had finally been recognized as a market economy
and economic diplomacy has been gaining increasing significance in
Russian foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the formation of a multipolar world, Yeltsin said
the Group of Eight has taken shape and Russia is facing more
opportunities to exert a positive influence on the world community.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that Russian diplomats must be aware
that Russia had inherited a powerful military complex and an
economic foundation that was not solid from the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the task of domestic and foreign policies to
deal with this imbalance.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China's high-tech enterprises will
enjoy preferential policies, including tax exemptions, when
importing key technologies and facilities, a high-ranking economy
and trade official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"China's enterprises and foreign companies should enjoy the
same policies in the development of high-tech," said Long Yongtu,
vice-minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation during a
speech for International Week featuring new and high-tech
industries, which opened Monday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Long said that high-tech investment projects, as long as they
are in line with China's related regulations, can be exempted from
Customs duties and import value-added taxes.
</P>
<P>
He added that the policies will be issued and implemented by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In recent year, China's introduction of technologies focused on
such industries as resources, transportation, communications,
chemicals and raw materials. Currently, the country is
strengthening high-tech imports in the fields of optical fibers,
satellite communication, nuclear power and aerospace.
</P>
<P>
During the last seven years, China has signed more than 17,000
contracts for technology imports worth 66 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's technology exports mainly include products in computer,
communications, electronics and life sciences. But China's
high-tech exports only account for 5.3 percent of the total
foreign trade volume.
</P>
<P>
According to Long, China will encourage research institutes and
universities to engage in international technological
trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG), Indonesia
and Vietnam, the three largest recipient nations of Australia's
official aid in the current financial year, are expected to
maintain their positions in the 1998-99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
PNG again gets the biggest single share of the Australian
overseas aid program for 1998-1999, with total estimated aid
funding of 320 million Australian dollars (201 million U.S.
dollars), the Australian government said in its budget unveiled
Tuesday for the coming fiscal year starting on July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
That amounted to 21 percent of Australia's total official aid
worth 1.48 billion Australian dollars (930 million U.S. dollars),
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said.
</P>
<P>
PNG, a country with a population of 4.2 million, became
independent from Australia in 1975.
</P>
<P>
PNG is followed by Indonesia, Australia's largest neighbor,
which is expected to receive 67 million U.S. dollars in aid from
Australia next year, 4.2 million U.S. dollars more than that of
the current financial year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, a new market for Australia, is to get 44 million U.S.
dollars in aid from Australia, an increase of 1.3 million U.S.
dollars over the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Island countries are to receive a total of 82 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia will provide special funding in response
to the Asian financial crisis and the El Nino climate effect.
</P>
<P>
A new 3.6 million U.S. dollar Asia Crisis Fund will be
established to provide technical assistance to affected countries,
helping with economic governance and financial sector reform.
</P>
<P>
Emergency funding has been tripled to 21 million U.S. dollars
to enable Australia to respond quickly to help the victims of
droughts, cyclones and floods.

<HEADLINE> Money Hard to Lift China's Athletics out of Doldrums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, China, May 12 (Xinhua) -- To spend just 20 yuan (2.5
U.S. dollars) to watch world champion Marion Jones run 100 meters
in the world's first-ever fastest women race was a nice thing on a
cool summer afternoon?
</P>
<P>
"No, how can I be so stupid to see seven women run 10-plus
seconds?" said a taxi driver, "I prefer spending 200 yuan (25
dollars) for a first division soccer match."
</P>
<P>
Chengdu, capital city of Sichuan province, was the host venue
of Sichuan Quanxing, a second class team of China's 14-member
first division soccer league.
</P>
<P>
The world fastest women race, which ended this afternoon with
Jones prevailing with a personal best of 10.71 seconds, was a
newsmaker than a sports gala.
</P>
<P>
Over 250 journalists from Chinese and overseas media, including
AP, Reuters and AFP, have gathered here to cover the event, which
was similar to the 150-meter showdown last June between 100-meter
Olympic champion Donovan Bailey of Canada and American Michael
Johnson, double gold medalist in the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Zhangchi Public Relations Company, promoter of the event, took
Chengdu as the right place for them to publicize track and field
and cash in on it, since it was the hometown of China's fastest
woman Li Xuemei, who emerged as one of the world's best sprinters
last October in the Chinese National Games with a run of 10.79.
</P>
<P>
But it is hard for the inland province's inhabitants to know
the significance of such a commercial event.
</P>
<P>
"Track and field is the mother of sports. We hope this race
can boost China's track and field," said Shang Xiutang, vice
director of the Chinese Track and Field Adminstratitive Center, in
a pre-race news conference.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, two days before the race and the day when Jones
arrived here, Quanxing hosted a league match against Beijing
Guo'an with a sell-out home crowd of 40,000. Price of tickets in
blackmarket reached as high as 250 yuans (30 dollars).
</P>
<P>
"People know about soccer as little as they know about sprint,
but they prefer to enjoy themselves for 90 minutes in a soccer
match instead of 11 seconds for such a race," another taxi driver
said.
</P>
<P>
Every facet of information show that Chengdu has had China's
most prosperous soccer market since China introduced professional
soccer league in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"You can never expect sports fans to turn their eyes from
soccer to other events," he added.
</P>
<P>
Coincidently, the fastest women race was held in the home venue
of Quanxing soccer team. Right before the race began, players of
Quanxing, who came to watch the world champion's performance, were
greeted by a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
"Please cheer the women sprinters as you cheer the Quanxing
team," said an announcer in the speaker over the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Although there were 20,000 sitting on the stand, most of them
came with free tickets. An official from Chengdu Sports
Commission revealed that less than 3,000 tickets were sold.
</P>
<P>
"I was told that only 2,000 to 3,000 tickets have been sold,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
But Chinese Athletics Association (CAA) took the race as a
long-term investment rather than a make-or-break lucrative
business.
</P>
<P>
CAA president Lou Dapeng said: "Generally speaking, the race
was very successful. By accumulating experiences, we will be able
to host more successful world track and field competitions in the
future."

<HEADLINE> Discrepancies Cited in Philippine Election Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The National Citizens' Movement for
Free Elections (Namfrel), a private watchdog in the Philippines,
reported on Tuesday some "discrepancies" in the official election
returns provided by poll officials.
</P>
<P>
Namfrel is the sole non-governmental organization authorized by
the Philippine Commission on Elections to conduct a quick count of
the votes. It said it would release the final result of the
presidential election within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Namfrel Secretary General Guillermo Luz told a press conference
that some election inspectors who conducted the tabulation at the
precinct level failed to note and fill in the total number of
votes cast.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the factors for the slow reporting of the
initial results of the elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some of them just left it blank when it came to the total
number of votes cast but the tally is there with respect to the
votes garnered by individual candidates," he said.
</P>
<P>
Luz cited two election returns on which the inspectors failed
to fill in the figures for the number of votes cast, the number of
voters registered, the number of voters who voted and the number
of ballots rejected.
</P>
<P>
In the said case, Luz said, Namfrel took the highest sum of
total votes cast for either president or vice president or the
highest ranking senator as the votes cast at the precinct.
</P>
<P>
"While this is not an exact number, it is the closest
approximation we can get for the votes cast. In fact, it'll still
be understated considering that there may be voters who did not
vote for president or vice president," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Luz said, the delay for the reporting of the initial
results was also caused by the failure of Namfrel volunteers to
get a copy of the election returns after some inspectors asked for
many requirements such as a letter of authority from Namfrel to
retrieve the document of election returns.
</P>
<P>
Luz said the identity cards of the volunteers bore the
authority to retrieve the said document.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of some 34 million registered voters Monday
cast their ballots at 175,000 precincts all over the country to
choose a new president, a vice president, 12 out of 24 senators,
260 members of the House of Representatives and thousands of local
officials.
</P>
<P>
As of 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) Tuesday, Namfrel had counted
about 2.1 percent of the votes cast nationwide. Among the
presidential candidates, Vice President Joseph Estrada of the
Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipino
Masses) took a commanding lead with 169,926 votes.
</P>
<P>
Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party
led the other 8 vice presidential candidates with 185,097 ballots.
</P>
<P>
Monday's voting was generally peaceful and orderly despite the
fact that a failure of elections was declared in eight towns,
especially in Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 people were killed on the voting day. Compared
with 169 deaths in the 1992 presidential election and 210 deaths
in the 1995 congressional election, Monday's voting was the most
peaceful in the country's election history.

<HEADLINE> Zhongguancun Falls Short as China's Silicon Valley (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Zhongguancun, a street full of
high-tech companies and international business franchises, is a
crowded computer supermarket rather than resembling Silicon
Valley, analysts said here today.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's Haidian High-tech Development Zone, with a street
featuring electronics products at the core, had more than 34
billion yuan (4.1 billion U.S. dollars) in turnover last year, 25
times 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, businesses around the street earned most of their
profits from the trade on computers and related products.
</P>
<P>
"Silicon Valley in the United States is based on scientific
research and high-tech manufacturing, however, most of the
business runners at Zhongguancun are focusing on computer trade,"
said Cao Gang, vice chairman of the Ziguang Group, affiliated with
the prestigious Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
"Zhongguancun is a big computer fair at most," said Yao Bing,
vice general manager with a computer company, "This is a far cry
from China's Silicon Valley."
</P>
<P>
Experts suggested reducing computer shops along the
five-kilometer-long street. They hoped that more jumbo enterprises
would combine scientific research, manufacturing and commerce in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, many businesses at Zhongguancun planned to upgrade
their companies. They are scheming new development strategies,
especially in information technology, automation, research on new
materials and life sciences.

preserved and maintained the historical relics, and has rebuilt it
into a museum for the benefit of the public, so that they may have
a better understanding of Hong Kong's coastal defense.
</P>
<P>
However, Kwong said, the history of Hong Kong's coastal defense
can be dated back to 600 years ago, when the Chinese navy in the
Ming dynasty fought against the invasion of the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
The history of Hong Kong's coastal defense also includes the
period in which the Qing dynasty soldiers resisted the occupation
of Hong Kong by the British forces.
</P>
<P>
Kwong said the new museum, scheduled to be opened by the end of
next year, was undoubtedly a cultural contribution to the
community.
</P>
<P>
Besides its meaningfulness in history education, the museum
will become a new scenic spot for tourists and then enhancing Hong
Kong's tourism, Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
Kwong noted that the construction of the museum was no simple
task. "While it is necessary to preserve the invaluable historical
relics, it is also essential to make appropriate alternations and
provide additional facilities to meet modern architectural
standards," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the ceremony, Mok Ying-fan, chairman of the
Provisional Urban Council (PUC)'s Museums Select Committee, agreed
that construction of the museum was "a very demanding task as the
site is very rugged and strategic in nature".
</P>
<P>
"There are many complicated technical and architectural
problems to tackle, such as geotechnical structures, electrical
installations, preservation of the historical remains and natural
environment," Mok said.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the new museum will achieve world class
standard," Mok said.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the museum started in last October. The
site occupied 260,000 square meters, an area three times larger
than that of the Hong Kong Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Organized jointly by the Architectural Services Department and
the PUC, the 12-day preview comprises 24 panels featuring the
historical and architectural aspects of the museum.
</P>
<P>
The panels cover the history and changes of Hong Kong's coastal
defenses in the past 600 years and the important military features
such as the redoubt and the defense ditch.
</P>
<P>
In addition, two architectural models and a number of
historical relics are on display. One of the models gives and
overall aerial view of the museum and the other shows some
specific parts.
</P>
<P>
A video showing the historical background and the military
features by three-dimensional animation will be screened at the
exhibition.

<TEXT>
<P>
Analysts estimated that the turnover by 2000 will double
today's figures with half of it from manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
At present, the most famous names of the 4,500 enterprises such
as Stone, Legend and Founder all focus on information
technology. The other three fields on their strategy list are
really new for Chinese entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Many institutions of higher learning and research institutions
are located near Zhongguancun. Some 36 enterprises, most of which
have university connections, earn more than 100 million yuan
annually. Seven listed as nation-level giant companies account for
40-to-70 percent of the domestic market share.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen started their computer trade in the mid-1980s. They
maintain their businesses on the street, but their net profits for
selling a single computer have plummeted to about 200 yuan from
over 10,000 yuan, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"We thought we could create a Silicon Valley at Zhongguancun 18
years ago but, in fact, we didn't even know what Silicon Valley
was at that time," said Chen Chunxian, a former research fellow
with the Chinese Academy of Sciences who began a business on the
street.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to maintain the momentum of
technological innovation -- Silicon Valley is not a trade center,"
said Ni Guangnan, an academician of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Aid Group Holds Mid-Term Review Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Bangladesh Aid Group
held a one-day mid-term meeting here Tuesday to review the
country's economic performance and reform progress, particularly
its privatization program.
</P>
<P>
The donors acknowledged the Bangladeshi government's success in
economic development, backed its efforts to maintain economic
stability, and urged further actions in reforming the country's
financial, executive and local government systems, Finance
Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria told a press conference after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Terming the meeting as "open, candid and friendly," Pierre
Landell Mills, World Bank resident director in Dhaka, said the
donors had a dialogue and exchanged views with the Bangladeshi
government.
</P>
<P>
The donors reached a strong consensus on what was to be done on
the part of Bangladesh, and obtained a commitment from Dhaka
regarding poverty eradication, economic reform and other issues,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh would gain an economic growth rate of 5.5 percent in
the current fiscal year ending June 30, with poverty declining,
investment rising and export growth increasing, a World Bank press
release said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, "slow progress in addressing critical issues such as
financial sector reform, privatization, and public administration
reform are depriving the country and its poor from taking
advantage of the potential gains of rapid economic expansion,"
said the release.
</P>
<P>
The donors urged the Bangladeshi government to speed up
administrative and financial reforms, and make faster progress in
privatization of state-owned enterprises, a separate World Bank
press release said.
</P>
<P>
The donors expressed their commitment to supporting the
country's initiatives in poverty alleviation, with particular
focus on reaching the poorest, it said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, chaired by Mills, was attended by senior officials
of the donors' missions here and senior Bangladeshi officials. A
full-scale Aid Group meeting, titled "Bangladesh Development
Forum," would be held in Paris in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Aid Group comprises 15 countries, including the
United State, Britain, France and Japan, and 12 international
organizations such as the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Britain Unveils Investment Plan for N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Tuesday unveiled an
economic strategy for Northern Ireland worth 315 million pounds
(520 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Finance minister Gordon Brown told an audience in Belfast that
the package would include a 150 million pounds (245 million
dollars) fund for new investment.
</P>
<P>
The money would be spent on transport, education and training
and housing, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
Brown is the only serving British chancellor of the exchequer
to visit Northern Ireland since the 1969 outbreak of guerrilla
conflict over British rule that has claimed more than 3,200
victims.
</P>
<P>
Brown said he and Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam,
together with leading business people, would visit the United
States soon in a bid to drum up further investment in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Before flying to Belfast, Brown told BBC radio the initiatives
were funded by "new money" from the British finance ministry. He
hoped other sources including the European Union and the United
States could follow suit to promote the province as an attractive
base for inward investment.
</P>
<P>
"That's the springboard for what I believe will be very
considerable investment from outside Northern Ireland in business
in Northern Ireland, and of course the generation of new
businesses indigenous to Northern Ireland as well." he said.
</P>
<P>
The British government already heavily subsidizes Northern
Ireland, which has been one of Britain's high unemployment
blackspots for decades.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
proposed on Tuesday a series of steps to control the threat from
terrorism, drug trafficking, illegal immigration and money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
Just hours before his departure for Europe, Clinton unveiled
his International Crime Control Strategy today at the White House,
calling for 289 million U.S. dollars to help combat drug
trafficking and other border-crossing crimes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will attend the G-8 economic summit in Birmingham,
England, starting on Thursday. The summit is to be attended by
leaders from France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Japan, Canada, the
U.S. and Russia.
</P>
<P>
At the G-8 summit, those nations will begin working on a plan
to cooperate on fighting international crime.
</P>
<P>
"We will work with other nations to create a worldwide dragnet
capability to promptly arrest and extradite fugitives from
justice," Clinton said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will work to ensure other nations are also ready to
fight international crime with global standards and goals,
training and technical aid, and programs to modernize criminal
laws elsewhere, added Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that the U.S. work with its allies to share
information on growing crime syndicates to better derail their
schemes, and "we'll work with industries to protect against
computer crime."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. will strengthen border security with a
thousand new Border Patrol agents, new technologies, and stiffer
penalties to put more smuggling rings out of business.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Wounded in Northern Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were wounded in
northern Israeli area Galilee Monday night when Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas unleashed a series of mortar barrages on Israeli
positions along the border, Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They were the first casualties on Israeli territory for more
than two years.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah said the attack served as a
warning to the Israeli army and implied that if the Israelis
continue to claim civilian casualties, Hezbollah's resistance may
step up operations deeper into the Jewish state, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
The attacks came hours after two Lebanese civilians were
wounded by Israeli artillery in Kfar Tibnit, about 15 kilometers
from the Israeli border, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A school and a car were damaged in the shelling, which also
targeted other nearby villages, it added.
</P>
<P>
The casualties brought to 53 the number of Israeli soldiers
wounded so far this year. Four have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer buffer zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the aim to protect its northern area
from Lebanese guerilla cross-border attacks, Lebanon's resistance
led by Hezbollah has been engaging in a war trying to dislodge
some 2,000 Israeli occupying forces from Lebanon.

MAPUTO, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has lost nearly 240
million U.S. Dollars since the European Union imposed a ban on
Mozambique's fish import since this January, a Mozambican
minister has said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Agriculture and Fishery Minister Isidora Faztudo told

more if Maputo could not find new markets.

Premier Pascoal Mocumbi last week said he hoped the EU would
cancel the ban as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has a yearly catch of prawns and fishes of about
20,000 tons, more than half of which have been exported to the EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
Cholera broke out in the country last August and since then
over 30,000 have contracted the disease and about 780 people have

</P>
<P>
The average price per pound dropped to 77 Cents in the first

recored in February while the highest was 79.29 Cents in March.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) produced 56,000 tons
of copper and the newly privatized Roan Antelope Mining
Corporation of Zambia produced 8,500 tons of copper in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Copper production at ZCCM continued to be constrained by
technical problems arising from lack of investment and
uncertainty surrounding the privatization of Nkana and Nchanga
mines.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations over the sale of the two biggest copper mines
in the copper-producing country collapsed last month due to

<HEADLINE> Dozens Lebanese Face Graft Charges in Port Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Lebanese customs agents,
port middlemen and staff of freight companies will all stand
trial in a port scam, the Daily Star newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The accused, including 32 customs agents alone, will face
charges of forging import manifests, tariff evasion or seeking and
accepting bribes.
</P>
<P>
In a 109-page indictment, Beirut investigating magistrate Said
Mirza said the offences were revealed when customs inspectors
suspected that a shampoo shipment imported by Beirut Cooperative
Supermarkets had specifications different from those mentioned in
the manifests.
</P>
<P>
Investigations proved that the manifests and the stamps
applied to them were fake and that fees paid by the importer had
been pocketed by the indicted suspects, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
Later inquiries showed that the problem had started around the
beginning of last year when the port's customs department was
computerized.
</P>
<P>
Mirza said that at least 215 manifests out of 40,000 recorded
during that period were fake.
</P>
<P>
The total loss to the treasury has not been determined but the
indictment said that two of the fake manifests had deprived the
treasury of 41 million Lebanese pounds (about 27,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The magistrate said that he had recommended that the suspects
receive prison sentence raging between three months and seven
years with hard labor.

TEHRAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy and France will grant credits
of 1.6 billion U.S. dollars to Iran's private sector, local
newspaper Iran News Tuesday quoted a senior Iranian official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Vice Chairman of Iran Chamber of Commerce Feredun Entezari
said on Monday that during talks with Iranian officials, an
Italian delegation agreed to grant 1 billion dollars of insurance
credit while a French delegation promised to grant 600 million
dollars financing credit.
</P>
<P>
Entezari said that the credits are designed to finance
commercial, industrial and mining sectors in Iran, adding that
trade delegations from Belgium, the Netherlands, China, India and
Britain will also visit Iran to negotiate industrial and trade
cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Italian and French delegations arrived here last weekend
to explore the opportunity for cooperation with Iranian
companies, defying the Iran-Libya Sanction Act of the United
States, which bans investment of more than 40 million dollars by
any foreign company in the energy sector of Iran and
Libya.

<HEADLINE> China Expects To Make Dunhuang Documents Available To Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Documents discovered at Dunhuang in
the last 100 years are expected to be open to the public thanks to
the efforts of scholars who want to study the unusual relics.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "Wenhui Daily", Hangzhou University has
started to compile the "Dunhuang Document Collection" in 30
million Chinese words.
</P>
<P>
Professor Rong Xinjiang of Beijing University's History
Department says that a large number of Dunhuang Documents from the
5th to the 10th centuries has been scattered about in Britain,
France, Russia, and Japan since they were discovered in in
1900. This has created many difficulties for those who wish to
study these relics, Prof. Rong says.
</P>
<P>
In the '60s and '70s, libraries in Britain, France, and China
began to make some of these documents more available, stimulating
greater interest in Dunhuang culture in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Grottoes, popularly known as the Thousand Buddha
Caves, were carved in a 1,600-meter stretch of rock on the eastern
side of Mingsha Hill, 25 km to the southeast of the town of
Dunhuang, in today's Gansu Province, for the purpose of
propagating Buddhism.

<HEADLINE> China's Trains Getting Rid of Styrofoam Food Boxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to replace the
styrofoam food boxes being used on trains with paper ones within 2
years to deal with the "white pollution" that has plagued the
railway lines.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, trains going to Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou will use paper food boxes beginning on World Environment
Day, June 5.
</P>
<P>
Although China has used biodegradable boxes on trains since
July 1996, the 300 million boxes used every year still add a lot
to the "white pollution" that can be seen along China's railway
lines.
</P>
<P>
The paper boxes will be made from natural pulp and are hygienic
and hold the temperature of food well. They are also recyclable
and biodegradable and pose almost no threat to the environment,
according to one environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the environmentally-friendly boxes, more garbage
bags will be used and they will be dumped at designated places,
the Ministry of Railways says.
</P>
<P>
A recent environmental study by the National Patriotic Hygiene
Campaign Committee, the State Environmental Protection
Administration, and the Railway Ministry found that the "white
pollution" problem has eased up to some degree along railway
lines, and has almost been eliminated along the Beijing-Guangzhou
line.

the respondents expressed a desire to apply and that most
explained their enthusiasm by saying that "it is a better way to
serve the motherland and the people."
</P>
<P>
Others said that being a Party member is an honor and that they
didn't want to fall behind their fellow students.
</P>
<P>
Of those who said they have no intention to join the CPC, 40
percent said they thought they were not qualified to be a Party
member, but the corruption that exists among some Party members
was another reason given for their holding back.
</P>
<P>
Among parents surveyed, 62 percent said they would support
their son or daughter in joining the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that students are paying more attention to

BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Former foreign minister of the
Republic of Korea (ROK) Han Sung-Joo said at a recent workshop on
"China and the World in the 21st Century" that China has
established interdependent and friendly relations with the ROK and
the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the recent financial crisis in Asia, China
actively provided currency assistance to some badly stricken
countries and managed to maintain the stability of its own
currency, thereby contributing enormously to Stablizing the Asian
economy.
</P>
<P>
China's policies have benefited other countries of the world,
and China has already established interdependent and friendly
relations with the Republic of Korea and the rest of Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also praised China for taking a "constructive and
cooperative stance" not only on the question of the Korean
Peninsula, but also in Asia and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The former foreign minister, who is now a professor at Korean
University, expressed his confidence in China's new leadership in
accelerating the market-oriented reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
This in turn will have a positive effect on the Korean
Peninsula, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Han, it is high time for the ROK to upgrade its
relations with China to the level with the United States and
Japan.

BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A sixth-grade student in Urumqi,
the capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region,
committed suicide after he was punished to go home from class for
"unruly" behavior.
</P>
<P>
The twelve-year-old Li Xingrui was told to go home shortly
after the class began on the morning of May 7 and to copy lessons
from his Chinese textbooks for failing to finish his homework
assignment, China Youth Daily reported today. When the boy cried
and pleaded with his teacher who was a model worker with some 20
years' teaching experience, the teacher then asked one of his
classmates to call his father, who was asked to take his son home.
</P>
<P>
Li was said to be unruly and was often criticised by teachers
for his poor classroom performance, and he never seemed to care
much about his lessons, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
China's education system has come under fire in recent years
for putting an unreasonable amount of stress and strain on exam
results, to the detriment of personal quality and cultivation.
</P>
<P>
And a number of suicides and a general outcry have prompted the
Ministry of Education to look into and reform on the primary and
middle school curricula and the university entrance examination
system.

<HEADLINE> "Chocolate" for Livestock Invented in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- After six years of research, Chinese
scientists have invented a kind of nitrogen-building fodder --
called "chocolate for animals" -- which has proven quite useful in
helping livestock survive snowstorms.
</P>
<P>
The research was aimed to provide nitrogen-containing feed for
yaks and Tibetan sheep grazing in high country and cold areas,
especially where snowstorms occur, in a bid to help them lose less
weight and survive natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
From last winter to this spring, nearly a million head of
cattle and sheep in northwest China's Qinghai Province were
exposed to serious snowstorms, but most of them survived because
of large applications of the new feed, a brainchild of the
province's Academy of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science.
</P>
<P>
The brick-shaped hardtack, as local herdsmen call it, is made
of molasses mixed with wheat bran, non-protein nitrogen, maize,
detoxified rapeseed dregs and minerals, said Hu Linghao, director
of the province's Science and Technology Commission, who is in
charge of the research project. The fodder can also be used to
fatten livestock.
</P>
<P>
A trial feeding of yaks and Tibetan sheep for 200 days shows
that yaks that were given the new fodder during cold seasons lost
16 to 22 kilograms of less weight, while sheep didn't lose any
weight.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the survival rate of calves and lambs can be
raised by 20-to-30 percent when using the "chocolate," Hu
said.

<HEADLINE> Top U.S. Cigarette Companies Increase Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Two largest U.S. cigarette
companies announced Monday that the wholesale price increases 5
cents per pack immediately.
</P>
<P>
"The price increase reflects the ongoing cost of conducting
business," said Richard Williams, spokesman of R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Corp.
</P>
<P>
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Corp. and Philip Morris Corp. said that
the price hike of 2.5 dollar per thousand cigarettes were
effective beginning from Monday.
</P>
<P>
A pack of cigarettes currently costs an average 1.95 dollar
including taxes at retail outlets nationwide, according to the
Tobacco Institute, an industry group.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth increase in 14 months by top cigarette
companies in the United States. The latest round of price hikes
began in March 1997, when the companies raised the price 5 cents a
pack, followed by a 7 cent boost in September, 2.5 cents hike in
January.
</P>
<P>
The January price hike came one day after a federal judge
approved Texas's record-setting of 15.3-billion-dollar settlement
with the industry, while Monday's announcement came after tobacco
companies reached a 6.6-billion-dollar settlement with Minnesota
and an insurance company Friday.
</P>
<P>
More states and insurance companies are seeking reimbursement
for health care costs associated with smoking.

<HEADLINE> New Strains of Cotton Seed Needed in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- New types of cotton seeds should be
imported if Thailand wants to increase its cotton production and
thus boost its textile industry, the Bangkok Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although Thailand is a major textile and garment exporter, it
has to spend nearly 18 billion baht (474 million U.S. dollars)
each year on Importing the bulk of its cotton requirements, said
Somyos Jinsirivanich, president of the Thai Cotton Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
Thailand produced 25,810 tons of raw cotton last year and
expects a decline to 14,000 tons this year. The main reason for
the decline is that cotton planters are using lower quality seeds
while trying to cope with high costs of imported insecticides.
</P>
<P>
The yield of Thai cotton fields averaged 250 kilograms per rai
(0.16 hectares) compared with 800 kilogram in the United States
and Israel, both major cotton producers.
</P>
<P>
In view of the situation, the industry has asked the
Agriculture Ministry to approve funds for the import of new
strains of seed to improve production, Somyos said.
</P>
<P>
Somyos said his association wanted to import seeds developed by
Monsanto chemicals in the United States, using genetic
engineering.
</P>
<P>
Tests show that the seed could yield 350 kilograms per rai of
cotton in Thailand, and planters would need to spray insecticides
only three to four times during the four-month harvest season,
instead of 18 times currently.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The followings are major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries released over
the past few days.
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE -- Costa Rica's non-traditional exports rose 11.8
percent in 1997 to 2.24 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a sharp increase of the country's
non-traditional exports. But coffee, banana and sugar remained
the traditional foreign exchange earners.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazil reported 3.16 billion dollars of service and
technology exports in 1997, up 25 percent from the 1993 level.
</P>
<P>
However, this sector still posted a 1.84 billion dollars trade
deficit because five billion dollars were spent on importing
foreign services and technologies.
</P>
<P>
MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's Energy Ministry will invest a total of
69.7 billion pesos (8.17 billion dollars) this year to help boost
the country's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Mexico ranks the fifth in the world in oil production and the
14th in natural gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
CARACAS -- The Venezuelan government will cut down public
spending by 3.43 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
This is because government revenue will fall by 4 billions
dollars in the year due to the falling prices of oil, which is a
major income source of the government.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazil's orange production in the 1998-99 crop
season will go down 30 percent to 298 million boxes (40.8
kilograms per box) as compared with the output of the previous
season.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Exporters Association of Oranges attributed the
fall to the "El Nino" phenomenon and a disease attacking orange
trees.
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil will export two billion liters of
anhydrous alcohol to the United States this year, nearly half of
its last year's production.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to export the same amount of anhydrous
alcohol to the United States in 1999. And the export is expected
to bring 800 million dollars in foreign exchange earnings for the
country annually.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, the world's number one anhydrous alcohol producer,
produced 4.75 billion liters in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Discover Genetic Connection with Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have announced
the discovery of at least 100 human genes, 40 of which have a
connection with some major diseases like cancer.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Fudan University's College of Life Science in
Shanghai, held that the discovery may prove helpful in research on
liver cancer and embryo development.
</P>
<P>
They have chosen to register 80 genes with GenBank, an
international gene database in the United States, and 20 are
expected to be given international patents.
</P>
<P>
However, one geneticist involved in the research acknowledged
that Chinese research in this field is still not as advanced as
that in some foreign countries, and the exact functions of some of
the genes are remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
The project at the Genetic Engineering Laboratory has cost 100
million yuan (12 million US dollars) in its two months of work. It
was started by Fudan University and the New Huangpu Group
Corp. who also set up three genetic engineering companies last
week to speed up genetic research and apply their findings in new
products.
</P>
<P>
According to one earlier report, China plans to spend 7 million
yuan (843,000 US dollars) on studies of structures and functions
of the Chinese genome over the next four years, as part of its
Human Genome Project (HGP). Its purpose is to see to it that China
will be competitive in the field of genetics in the 21st century,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Public Urged to Cut Down Use of Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar electric power
authorities have urged the public in the capital Yangon to cut
down the use of electricity in the face of power shortage in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's The New Light of Myanmar newspaper quoted Deputy
Minister of Electric Power Brigadier General Maung Maung as saying
that some power stations in the country have to reduce its
generation due to two consecutive years' scarcity of rain in the
northern part of the country and the water level at dams is low.
</P>
<P>
To strike a balance between power generation and use,
electricity is being supplied in turn in some areas in the
capital, the deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid urban development of Yangon in the last few
years, a wide gap has emerged between increasing electric power
demand and supply.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of April, the EL Nino phenomena has caused
sustainable high temperatures in Myanmar with Yangon reaching as
high as over 40 degrees centigrade, the highest in the hot season
in 30 years. This has led to more power demand.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Guarantees Bank Deposits: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai people who put money in banks
or financial firms have no reason to worry since the government
guarantees deposits at all operating firms and commercial banks,
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin's Monday speech followed reports that 35 operating
financial firms and some commercial banks have been facing
liquidity problems.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that he had received reports about the liquidity
crunch. but he told the public not to be worried about their
deposits at all operating financial houses as the government had
guaranteed them.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post said Tuesday that the Bank of Thailand, the
country's central bank, reportedly notified the finance minister
that at least three financial institutions and two commercial
banks were in critical condition as they had been hard hit with
deposit runs.
</P>
<P>
However, Tarrin denied the speculation that the government may
not let the remaining financial firms collapse like the 56
cash-strapped firms which had been ordered closed last December.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the responsibility of the shareholders of firms
with tight liquidity to tackle problems by seeking new capital
under the close supervision of the Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
If shareholders failed to boost capital, the ministry would
look into the firms' financial conditions and the central bank's
order about their capital increase.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tarrin said the stability problem of the financial
sector was the main task for newly appointed central bank governor
Chatumongol Sonakul.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol received royal appointment last Friday, replacing
Chaiyawat Wibulsawasdi, who was accused of being responsible for
the collapse of the country's economy.

<HEADLINE> Vote Counting in Philippines Slow at City Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- As official counting in the
Philippines is still continuing slowly Tuesday at the municipal or
city level, unofficial results show Vice President Joseph Estrada
is leading in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Official counting started immediately after the polls closed at
15:00 (0700 GMT) Monday, but was conducted at a very slow pace. So
far, the counting is still at the municipal or city level,
officials of the Commission on Elections said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest initial results from the Commission on Elections
cannot show significantly who is really leading in the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
But according to the latest unofficial partial results provided
by the Namfrel (National Citizens Movement for Free Elections),
Vice President Joseph Estrada, standard bearer of the opposition
Laban ng Makabayang masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipinos
Masses), is leading with 21,071 votes.
</P>
<P>
He was followed by Emilio Osmena, candidate of the Progressive
Movement for Devolution of Initiative, with 16,941 votes, and
former Manila mayor Alfredo Lim of the Liberal Party trailed third
with 9,572 votes.
</P>
<P>
Other presidential candidates include Speaker Jose de Venecia,
who was anointed by President Fidel Ramos as the standard bearer
of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party, and senator Raul Roco of Aksyon
Demokratiko (Democratic Action).
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Imelda Marcos, who withdrew from the presidential race two
days before the general elections, received 389 votes, as her name
still appeared on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
The Namfrel is the sole non-government organization authorized
to conduct the unofficial quick count.
</P>
<P>
The official vote counting has been continuing very slowly.
After the counting at the precinct level, election inspectors will
turn over the election returns to the municipal or city level.
</P>
<P>
The total election returns will be recorded and tabulated and
then given to the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
The forms will then be forwarded to the House of
Representatives for the counting for the presidential and vice
presidential positions, while the Commission on Elections will
count the votes for the congressional posts.
</P>
<P>
The process is expected to take four weeks. But the Namfrel can
release the unofficial final results within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Voting for Monday's national and local elections was held in a
"generally peaceful and orderly manner" with a heavy voter turnout
across the country except for some areas where polling was marred
by violence and election irregularities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commission on Elections, about 80 percent of
the 34 million voters turned out and cast their ballots to choose
a president, a vice president, 12 out of 24 senators, 260 members
of the House of Representatives and more than 17,000 local
officials and councilors.
</P>
<P>
The voting was "generally peaceful and orderly", the Commission
on Elections said.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures showed that a total of 13 people were killed
all over the country in Monday's elections, bringing to 49 the
death toll in election-related violence since election campaigns
began in February.
</P>
<P>
However, compared with the previous elections including those
held in 1992 and 1995, the polls may be the most peaceful and
orderly in the country's election history, poll watchers said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 elections, about 169 people were killed in
election- related violence while in the 1995 senate election 210
people died.

<P>
NANNING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Rosin production has helped
200,000 people living in mountainous regions in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region escape poverty, with related
activities increasing total income in the region by 600 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi, a region blessed with abundant pine forest resources,
produced 270,000 tons of pine resin in 1997. The region processed
210,000 tons of rosin and 30,000 tons of turpentine oil during the
year and recorded a total industrial output value of over 1.2
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The region's forest coverage has grown from 1.7 million
hectares only ten years ago to the current 6.7 million hectares,
including pine forests covering some five million
hectares. Approximately one third of them currently produce pine
rosin.
</P>
<P>
Rosin and turpentine are widely used in the production of paper
making, soap, paint and textiles. The world market demand for
rosin and turpentine has grown by some 5-6 percent annually in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Gross International Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross international
reserves (GIR) reached 11.1 billion U.S. dollars as of last week,
the highest level since the start of the financial crisis in the
country last July, the newspaper Today said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the highest level achieved since July 1997 when the
regional currency crisis started," Gabriel Singson, governor of
the central bank of the Philippines, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The GIR, up 2.3 percent from last month's 10.8 billion dollars,
was boosted by the 291-million net proceeds of the National Power
Corp. Yankee bond issue, which were deposited in the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The GIR, which include the central bank's holdings of gold,
dollars and other foreign currencies, are equivalent to two and a
half months of imports of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
According to Singson, the bigger official reserves were made
possible by the central bank's decision not to intervene in the
foreign exchange market when the peso came under renewed
speculative attack recently.
</P>
<P>
But Singson said the central bank is prepared to adopt measures
to defend the Philippine currency if speculations against it
continue in the coming days -- "a possible scenario considering
the continuing political turmoil in Indonesia."

<HEADLINE> Czech, Chinese Army Leaders Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China, which pursues a defensive
military policy, will reduce its armed forces by 500,000 men in
three years, a visiting senior Chinese military officer said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou, chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army, told his Czech counterpart Jiri Sedivy that China
does not station troops or establish military bases abroad, nor
does it set up military alliances with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Fu, also a member of China's Central Military Commission, said
that China opposes hegemonism and power politics. China holds that
countries, no matter how big or small, should be treated equally,
he added.
</P>
<P>
On the international situation, Fu said the trend toward
multi-polarization is of great significance to worldwide peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Fu affirmed that Taiwan is sacred
territory to China which opposes any attempts to create "two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Fu also exchanged views with Sedivy on
strengthening friendship and cooperation between the armed forces
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that a fundamental conflict of interests does not exist
between China and the Czech Republic. The further development of
the traditional friendship between the two countries and the two
armies will serve the fundermental interests of the two
peoples. It will also encourage peace, stability and development
throughout the region and eventually the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Sedivy agreed and said there had been fruitful high-level
exchanges between the two armies in recent years. He hoped to
continue promoting such exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Sedivy also accepted Fu's invitation to visit China.
</P>
<P>
Fu arrived in Prague on Friday for a five-day visit to the
Czech Republic, the third leg of his four-nation tour. Fu's next
stop will be Spain.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attorney General Requests Independent Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Attorney General Janet Reno
Monday requested an independent counsel to investigate whether
Labor Secretary Alexis Herman engaged in influence peddling or
solicited illegal campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
Reno's decision to seek a seventh independent counsel for a
high-ranking member of the Clinton administration was relayed to a
special court late Monday and described in a brief court document
that was made public.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and FBI agents during five months of preliminary
inquiry have neither corroborated a range of allegations made by a
businessman against Herman nor found other evidence to question
her actions, justice department officials said.
</P>
<P>
The primary allegation was that, as a White House aide during
the first Clinton administration, Herman took kickbacks for
helping a friend's clients. Herman has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton maintained his confidence in Herman,
"and in her ability to set whatever these allegations are behind
her," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Monday. "She's
doing a spectacular job as secretary of labor."
</P>
<P>
Some Justice officials recommended Reno request appointment of
an outside prosecutor because the independent counsel law requires
that step when she is unable to resolve any specific, credible
allegations of federal felonies within 150 days, said department
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Other Justice officials apparently doubted that the remaining
unresolved matters were specific and credible enough to require an
independent counsel, according to news reports.

<HEADLINE> Air Pollution Worsens in Italy's Big Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Air pollution in Italy's big cities is
getting worse despite declining urban populations, the Italian
Statistics Bureau (ISTAT) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Urban population in large cities have been decreasing over the
last decade, with Milan down by 25 percent and Naples 30 percent,
according to ISTAT.
</P>
<P>
The decrease is the result of emigration to the suburbs where
housing is cheaper and the environment better, but suburban
dwellers still drive their own cars to work in city centers.
</P>
<P>
This trend has resulted in more cars on the road, and heavier
air pollution.
</P>
<P>
ISTAT said the government was partly responsible for the
worsening air pollution because it failed to increase public
transport services as more people moved to suburbs. In Milan,
about 900,000 people commute to work every morning, but only a
third take public vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The railway sector should be blamed as well, ISTAT said. It had
canceled many suburban stops for the sake of increasing speed,
which also contributed to the increase in private cars.

<HEADLINE> Official Warns of Grassland Deterioration in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official of the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China has warned local
people of the serious deterioration of the grassland in the region.
</P>
<P>
Yunlongbu, president of the regional government, said that at
present the region's total land area suffering from
desertification, salinization, soil erosion and grassland
deterioration, accounts for 1.18 million square kilometers,
representing half of the region's total land area.
</P>
<P>
The region's area of serious soil erosion is 186,000 square
kilometers, or 15 percent of the region's land space. The region
has more than 3,800 hectares of seriously deteriorated grassland,
according to Yunlongbu. A month ago a sandstorm hit Alxa League in
the central portion of the region, causing an economic loss of
millions of yuan.
</P>
<P>
The region is also threatened by activities involving random
felling of trees and converting grassland to farming.
</P>
<P>
To curb such a situation, the region worked out a plan for
cross-century ecological protection and construction in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, ecological deterioration will be under
control in the next 13 years through tree-planting, building water
and soil conservation projects and converting farmland into
pasture for raising domestic animals. Through another 40 years of
effort, the region aims to set up an environment which is
compatible with the sustained development of the economy.

</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary General of the U.N. and Executive Director
of the UNDCP (United Nations Drug Control Program) Pino Arlacchi
and his party are now on a visit to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Pino and Major General Soe Win, secretary of the Myanmar

SHENYANG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province is attaching importance to high-tech development zones,
which received 57.77 billion yuan in revenue last year, with
nearly 36 billion yuan from high technology.
</P>
<P>
As an old industrial base focusing on heavy and chemical
industries, Liaoning, which is famous for its traditional
industries, has made an effort to invigorate traditional
industries through technology.
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial government said Liaoning
province now has three state-level high-tech zones in cities such
as Shenyang, Dalian, and Anshan, and three provincial-level zones
in cities such as Jinzhou, Liaoyang and Yingkou, covering 71.8
square kilometers of land.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province approved 110 enterprises to enter high-tech
zones, with 17 projects each having an investment exceeding 20
million U.S. dollars. High-tech zones in Shenyang and Dalian have
established good relations with high-tech zones in foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
All these high-tech zones nurtured their own pillar industries
and enterprises, and completed 3.85 billion yuan of investment,
with 1.61 billion yuan in infrastructure facilities last year.
</P>
<P>
In the year 1998, all these high-tech zones in Liaoning will
continue to develop high-tech enterprises and pillar products.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Defies U.S. Pressure for Foreign Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic Monday rebuffed another bid by two U.S. envoys to press
Belgrade to allow foreign mediation of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meeting special envoys to the Balkans Richard Holbrooke and
Robert Gelbard here again, Milosevic said, "The policy of pressure
(on his country) must make way for one of cooperation on an equal
footing with mutual confidence."
</P>
<P>
Cooperation was the best way to achieve peace and stability,
and develop economic and cultural ties in the Balkans, Tanjug news
agency quoted Milosevic as saying.
</P>
<P>
Respecting the territorial integrity and non-interference in
other countries' internal affairs was the basis of attaining peace
and stability in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic said on Monday
that international sanctions against Belgrade would be
counter-productive and make the prospects of a political
settlement more remote.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions and pressure on Yugoslavia "only encourage maximalist
demands by Albanian separatists and terrorists", he warned.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke and Gelbard, on a shuttle mission to reduce ethnic
tensions in the troubled Serbian province of Kosovo, met
Milosevic, Kosovo ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and
Albanian President Rexhep Meidani and Prime Minister Fatos Nano on
Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the United
States -- but not Russia -- decided to impose an embargo on
investments in Yugoslavia, which includes Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, with an ethnic Albanian majority, has sunk into chaos
since ethnic Albanians calling for independence from Serbia
clashed with the local Serb police in February.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav and Serbian authorities have rejected any foreign
involvement or the internationalization of the issue, arguing it
is Serbia's internal affair.

<HEADLINE> Millions of Students May Quit Schools in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- About eight million elementary and
junior high school students in Indonesia may have to drop out of
school because of the prolonged economic crisis, a government
official said.
</P>
<P>
The latest prediction was much higher than the first estimates
of only 2.8 million students (to quit school) made in the early
months of the crisis last year, Deputy Chairman of the National
Development Planning Board Hidayat Syarief told a seminar Monday
in Bogor, 60 kilometers south of Jakarta, reports reaching here
Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
He said the prolonged economic crisis was also expected to
cause an increase in the infant mortality and maternal mortality
rates and malnutrition among children in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the economic crisis, more and more children are
expected to drop out of school, suffer malnutrition and various
diseases, which will put their lives at risk. And this condition
will certainly affect the quality of Indonesian human resources in
the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that many parents in rural areas will also be forced
to remove their children from school because the children would be
needed to help supplement the family's dwindling income.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the government and the public should adopt a
sense of crisis and take immediate action to prevent a high
dropout rate.
</P>
<P>
The government recently increased the minimum working age to 15
from 10 in an endeavor to make the nine-year compulsory school
program a success and to send about two million child laborers to
school under the National Foster Parents Movement.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is experiencing the worst economic crisis in three
decade. The rupiah (national currency) has lost more than 70
percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since July last year.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A six-year-old boy succumbed to his
wounds Monday, raising the death toll of Sunday's cable car
accident in the northern Thai province of Chiang Mai to three, the
Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The boy suffered several serious wounds from the plunge of the
cable car at Phra That Koi Suthep Temple close to Central Chiang
Mai town.
</P>
<P>
The steel wire used to pull the two cable cars snapped Sunday,
sending the two vehicles plunging 50 meters to the foot of the
Phra That Koi Suthep Hill.
</P>
<P>
After inspecting the cable car system, local officials
concluded that overloading caused the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Each vehicle is designed to carry 14 passengers per trip, but
the two cars were found to serve a total of almost 40 people
before the plunge.
</P>
<P>
Sunday was the Visakha Puja Buddhist Holiday when a large
number of worshippers traveled to the temple, which is considered
to be a highly venerated and most visited religious place in the
province, to perform religious ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Mai police chief Anudit Atthsart said the police
arrested the cable car operator and the mechanic for recklessness
leading to the deaths.
</P>
<P>
Chiang Mai Governor Pravit Sihasophon Monday ordered the temple
to close its cable car system permanently despite its negative
effect on tourism.
</P>
<P>
Another 35 people were injured in the accident, many of whom
are still being treated at three hospitals in the northern
province.
</P>
<P>
The plunge is the second failure of the cable car system after
a similar accident occurred in July last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Australia said Tuesday it strongly
condemned India for carrying out three underground nuclear tests
this week and is considering further action against India.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer Tuesday
said, "The Australian government strongly condemns what India has
done," according to Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)
Radio.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn India unreservedly for taking this decision to
detonate nuclear devices," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is in total defiance of the will of the international
community. Over 140 countries have signed a comprehensive test ban
treaty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"India is a country which apparently wants to develop a nuclear
weapons device to escalate tensions in South Asia," the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Downer demanded a meeting with India's High Commissioner Gopal
Parthasarathy to Australia to express Australia's anger at the
blasts.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said Australia's High Commissioner to
India Rob Laurie would be instructed to deliver the Australian
government's condemnation of the tests to the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the high commissioner would also be recalled
immediately for consultations on the kind of action Australia
could take in response.
</P>
<P>
The move is considered here by analysts as the strongest
possible diplomatic protest, short of cutting off bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Australia would be consulting with its "friends and allies
around the world", including the United States, Canada and the
Europeans and countries in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
India's one-month-old government outraged neighboring Pakistan
with the tests in a remote desert, about 500 km southwest of the
Indian capital New Delhi, the Australian Associated Press said
Tuesday.

strengthen government support, urge more enterprises to directly
engage in foreign trade, and diversify trade sources, market
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Though the situation is tough, China has vowed to reach 200
billion U.S. dollars in exports this year, which represents a 10
percent year-on-year increase. Shi Guangsheng, the new minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation, has repeatedly stressed
since his tenure began that the new strategy will be a major means
to cope with the situation.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts noted that the new strategy can help step up
reform in the existing foreign-trade rights approval system and
bring more foreign-funded enterprises into trade operations.
</P>
<P>
As an obvious change, while the central and local governments
have been cautious in granting foreign trade rights, now many
local governments are actively encouraging qualified enterprises
to apply for such rights and are relaxing the approval
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Previously, foreign-funded enterprises were only entitled to
export their own products. Now, they are being allowed to form
solely-owned or joint venture foreign-trade companies.
</P>
<P>
Some people are worried that Chinese foreign-trade companies
will face even stiffer competition and there will be more losses
in the country's foreign-exchange earnings when foreign-funded
trade companies are set up.

<P>
Nevertheless, quite a number of experts acknowledged that the
contributions made by overseas-funded companies to China's exports
should be duly recognized.
</P>
<P>
One major step in the ongoing reform of the foreign-trade
structure is to replace the longtime practice of administrative
approval-and-examination system with a registration system for
granting foreign-trade rights. Such rights are being extended to
more enterprises, including foreign-run and private firms. By the
end of this year, the number of enterprises with foreign-trade
rights is expected to top 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Li Yushi, a renowned foreign-trade expert, said he believes
that the government's macro-economic policy, reforming both the
operating mechanism of foreign trade and import system are three
major issues that will determine the future of China's foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
The relatively high tariff level, the value-added tax levied on
imported goods and stringent administrative management of imports
have affected the importation of advanced technology and equipment
and the import trade as a whole, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li called for transforming the import structure and expanding
imports to sharpen the competitive edge of China's export products.
</P>
<P>
In its effort to simultaneously expand imports and exports, the
Chinese government dramatically cut the tariff in October last
year, and in January this year resumed the reduction and exemption
of import taxes on items needed by foreign-funded enterprises and
key projects.
</P>
<P>
The effort in this regard has helped to spur a 2.5 percent rise
in imports in the first quarter of this year. And experts forecast
that imports can grow by 10 percent for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Li Yushi also predicted that China will further reduce the
scope or remove the administrative management on import products,
cut import quotas, reduce or remove value-added taxes on imports,
and further cut tariffs when conditions are mature.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Public Shocked by Crimes of Unit '731' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 12 (Xinhua) -- People in Shanghai expressed shock
after seeing an exhibition this month showing evidence of the
crimes of Unit "731" of the wartime Japanese army.
</P>
<P>
"It's so frightening. I don't know why the Japanese army did
that to Chinese," said Xu Ming, a primary student in grade three,
after seeing the exhibition with his mother.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot forget it for all my life that when I was a little
boy, I witnessed how the Japanese soldiers threw germ bombs to
villagers and most of villagers died of the plague," recalled an
old man, whose hometown is Ningbo in east China's Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
A teacher from Shanghai Foreign Language University said that
the exhibition brought to light the evidence of atrocity by
Japanese militarists. Nobody should forget history, the teacher
said.
</P>
<P>
The one-month exhibition, the first of its kind in China, was
prepared by the Museum of Evidence of Crimes of Unit "731" located
in Harbin in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, and will
tour other cities including Ningbo, Guangzhou, Haikou, Hong Kong
and Seoul, capital of the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Unit "731" belongs to the Japanese aggressor troop's Kwantung
Army, with its headquarters based in Harbin during World War
II. The unit received a bad reputation for manufacturing germ
weapons based on experiments on living people.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 Chinese people were used for germ experiments
by Unit "731," according to a Japanese army official in charge of
germ experiments.

<HEADLINE> World Sees Hottest First Quarter Since 1866, Worldwatch Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Temperatures registered over the first
three months of this year were the highest the world has seen
since 1866, according to Lester Brown, chairman of the
Washington-based Worldwatch Institute.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Rome to present the prestigious environmental
observatory's annual report -- The State of the World, Brown said
that 1997 was the hottest year since 1866, so it remains to be
seen whether the average for all 12 months of 1998 beats last year.
</P>
<P>
He said 1997 was already the hottest year since 1866 in
absolute terms and 1998 is heading down the same
path. "Temperatures have risen strongly in the first quarter of
the year, and the overall picture is dramatic."
</P>
<P>
According to Brown, all-time highs were recorded last year for
carbon dioxide emissions claimed as a major cause of the
greenhouse effect as well as the concentration of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Energy production and transport are the two main culprits for
carbon dioxide emissions. "Scientists and environmentalists have
long known that the economy cannot expand infinitely without
endangering the ecosystem," said Brown.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the exponential growth of the world economy as
the major cause of the destruction of the world ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
Brown said the world's economic growth in 1997 was the same as
for the whole century of the 1600s, and the consumption of
resources has risen sixfold since 1950.
</P>
<P>
"Water and wood consumption has tripled and the consumption of
fossil fuels has quadrupled," he said. "This consumption of
resources is a cause of stress for the planet."
</P>
<P>
He said the "stress" includes a reduction in fishery resources,
the loss of 16,000 hectares of forests a year, and the loss of
many animal and vegetable species.
</P>
<P>
"Four mammals out of every 100 risk extinction, and these
include our nearest relations in the animal world above all,"
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out three great signs of "stress" in 1997: the
parching of the Yellow River in China, the fires in Indonesia and
the great heat around the world.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Praises Russia's Cabinet Shakeup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
national security advisor Sandy Berger said on Monday that Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's recent cabinet shakeup is a bold step
that produced "probably the most reformist government" in seven
years.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin "made a gamble and won," Berger told a briefing on the
eve of Clinton's departure for a summit meeting of the G-7
countries plus Russia in Birmingham, Britain, where Clinton and
Yeltsin are expected to meet.
</P>
<P>
It will be Clinton's first meeting with Yeltsin since the
Russian president fired his cabinet on March 23. Former Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was replaced by 35-year-old Sergei
Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
"I think that President Yeltsin does have a grip on power, does
have control of his government," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
"I think he took a rather bold action... in dismissing a
government. He felt it was not moving swiftly enough toward
meeting the... economic needs of his people," Berger noted.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has assembled a new government that is young and "does
not carry enormous baggage, that has generally been pragmatic and
committed to reform," Berger said. "I find that very encouraging."
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that Kiriyenko was so young was "not
necessarily a handicap when you're talking about trying to remake
a system which has been frozen for all of those years in a command
economy."
</P>
<P>
Further, Berger said Yeltsin's other deputies "are all men of
enormous competence and professionalism."
</P>
<P>
Berger said Russia still faces formidable problems in expanding
its economy, attracting investment, collecting taxes and meeting
other challenges.
</P>
<P>
"We want to help them do that, but I think in many ways the
events of the last month suggest that President Yeltsin made a
gamble and won," he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the White House's warm assessment sets a
positive tone for the summit between Clinton and Yeltsin scheduled
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Since they met at last June's summit in Denver, relations
between Washington and Moscow have been strained by divisions over
Iraq and Kosovo, and the U.S. push to expand the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).

<HEADLINE> Mexico Deports 40 Italian Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Mexico deported 40 Italian
human rights observers and banned them from returning to the
country for showing disrespect and contempt for Mexican laws and
regulations, a statement issued by the Interior Ministry said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A group of 135 Italian observers, including the 40 expelled,
were allowed to visit Mexico on May 1-10 to observe the situation
of indigenous people living in the southern state of Chiapas, some
1,000 kilometers from Mexico City, the capital.
</P>
<P>
The 40 Italians, expelled by the Mexican government on Monday,
refused to leave Mexico after their visas expired, the ministry
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The acts and deeds attributable to the foreigners, who did not
leave Mexican territory in the fixed period of time, made their
presence in the country inconvenient."
</P>
<P>
The expulsion is reportedly based upon article 33 of the
Mexican Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government sent a special flight to Rome Monday
morning with the 40 deported Italians on board.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- A 13-household village of Pingxiang
city in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is now
crowded with buildings, shops, restaurants, and dancing halls --
all because of thriving border trade.
</P>
<P>
Puzai Village is only one of many examples of the prosperity in
doing trade along the Sino-Vietnamese border. Heavily laden
trucks come and go through the village, carrying goods from both
sides.
</P>
<P>
A local border trade official said that Puzai receives
3,000-to-4,000 trucks every day. Vietnamese traders bring local
products or seafood to exchange for Chinese clothing, cosmetics,
and farm-use plastic sheeting.
</P>
<P>
The region has opened four state-level ports, eight regional
ports, and 25 border trade areas like Puzai along the
Sino-Vietnamese border. It had a little more than 3 billion yuan
in border trade volume last year.
</P>
<P>
Villagers have considerably improved their living conditions by
doing border trade, a Customs official said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Man Charged with Hijacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian man who attempted to
hijack an airplane to the U.S. Sunday night has been charged with
attempted hijacking and five counts of assault, reports said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old man from the city of Toronto appeared in court
Monday where he was charged and ordered to have a psychiatric exam.
</P>
<P>
Elgin Barrett is scheduled to return to court May 20, according
to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Yelling "I have a bomb," the man raced late Sunday night
through a parked airliner and demanded to be flown to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in the cockpit of the Air Luxor L1011 aircraft
shortly after the attempted hijack. Nobody of the 256 people on
board was hurt in the hijack attempt.
</P>
<P>
Police said the man locked himself in the cockpit but was
distracted just long enough for a crew member to unlock the door
and allow police to rush in to subdue him.
</P>
<P>
The whole incident was over in a matter of minutes. The plane
was able to leave for Lisbon, Portugal, after a three-hour delay.
</P>
<P>
All the man carried was only a black gym bag which had only
clothes and a CD player.
</P>
<P>
That's what made people thought he had a bomb. "The people on
the plane were just virtually in shock," police said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Transport Minister David Collenette was reported to
say that he was pleased with the way the situation was handled.

<HEADLINE> Dramatic Changes Brought to Jianghan Plain Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Transferring land leased from the
government to agricultural companies and turning into farm workers
with fixed salaries, that is the new way of life for thousands of
farmers in the Jianghan Plain, a major grain producer in central
China.
</P>
<P>
Different from their counterparts in other parts of China,
farmers in the Jianghan Plain, or the plain between the Yangtze
and Han rivers in Hubei Province have abandoned the traditional
way of farming -- on small individual plots.
</P>
<P>
The 356 farmer families in Wengang Village by Mazi Lake have
200 hectares of rice fields. They transferred the use right of 93
hectares to the Zhengchang Company in exchange for seven million
shares in the company. All the families are share-holders of the
company, and the farmers on the 93 hectares of land have become
employees of the company.
</P>
<P>
So far, about one sixth of 442,000 hectares of arable land on
the plain have been transferred to agricultural companies, and the
people who farm it have become employees of the companies,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The Tianfa Group Co. Ltd, a listed company, invested 400
million yuan (48 million US dollars) to build a salad oil factory
in Jingzhou City and a fine rice plant in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The China Lantian Co. Ltd injected 320 million yuan (38.6
million US dollars) into the development of aquatic resources on
Honghu Lake, one of the biggest freshwater lakes in China; about
30,000 local farmers have benefited from this.
</P>
<P>
Overseas companies have also invested in the plain, and both
overseas and domestic businesses have invested a total of two
billion yuan (241 million US dollars) in local agricultural
projects. Some 100,000 farmers are employed by the companies.
</P>
<P>
This trend will boost the potential of agriculture in China,
according to economists. However, Liu Keyi, an official in charge
of economy in Jingzhou City, warned that companies based in cities
do not have a good understanding of the market for agricultural
products.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Utilize More Invention Patents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Realizing the economic value of
Beijing's great number of invention patents still represents a
great challenge for Beijing's municipal authorities, today's
Beijing Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Wang Youpeng, professor and director of the Beijing Patent
Administration Bureau, was quoted as saying that 80 percent of
last year's 1,674 invention patents have not been put into use.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Beijing submitted 1,677 inventions for patent
registration, far ahead of other Chinese regions (Shanghai:484,
Guangdong Province:680 and Tianjin:257).
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that the main obstacle for putting more
inventions into use is the people's poor awareness of the
importance of patents.
</P>
<P>
Wang said his bureau plans to set up a center especially for
experiments making products using patented inventions.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will also enhance publicity of the importance of
patents this year, in addition to the organization of some
research programs for related official.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by China's National Patent
Administration Bureau, among the 33,666 invention patents approved
in 1997, 20,968 were submitted by foreign researchers.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Urged to Overhaul Environment Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy's main ruling party, the Left
Democrats (DS), on Monday urged the government to give the
environment ministry with extended powers, enabling it to prevent
disasters like the fatal mudslides in southern Italy last week.
</P>
<P>
A statement, overwhelmingly approved by the DS, proposed
creating, within six months, a single Environment and Land
Ministry which will be responsible for land protection.
</P>
<P>
"We want to reform the national government according to the
model used in other European countries," said DS leader Massimo
D'Alema. "On the one side you'll have the environment and the
land, on the other major infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
He said the present system, under which the Public Works
Ministry is responsible for land protection and infrastructure,
was irrational.
</P>
<P>
The DS proposal follows complaints by Environment Minister Edo
Ronchi, of the Green Movement, that his ministry is deprived of
any real power to protect the land and prevent disasters happening
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
Ronchi said he was tired of writing a report and sending it off
to other ministries every time there was a flood or a landslide.
</P>
<P>
"I think the ministry should be given the powers to protect the
environment," he said. "Otherwise, what's its purpose?"
</P>
<P>
The DS proposal also asked other ministries with influence over
the land -- the transport and agriculture ministries -- to take
land protection into account when formulating and executing
policies.
</P>
<P>
Land protection has become a burning issue in Italy since
mudslides in the Campania region of southern Italy killed at least
135 people last week. Experts say uncontrolled deforestation and
illegal construction work are partly blamed for the disaster.
</P>
<P>
About 50 percent of Italian territory faces some form of
landslide, flooding or other danger, said the DS environment
spokeswoman Fulvia Bandoli.
</P>
<P>
"A single Environment and Land Ministry, with power to invest
in and monitor land protection, would make sure land policy does
not get swept under the carpet," she said.

Tuesday across the Philippines, but the pace is very slow.
</P>
<P>
The early partial results provided by the Commission on
Elections early Tuesday Morning cannot show significantly who is
really leading in the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
But the latest unofficial partial results provided by the
Namfrel (National Citizens Movement for Free Elections) show that
Vice President Joseph Estrada, candidate of the Laban ng
Makabayang masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Filipinos Masses)
is leading in the presidential race with 21,071 votes.
</P>
<P>
He is followed by Emilio Osmena, candidate of the Progressive
Movement for Devolution of Initiative, with 16,941 votes. Former
Manila mayor Alfredo Lim of the Liberal Party trailed third with
9,572 votes.
</P>
<P>
Other presidential candidates include Speaker Jose de Venecia,
who was anointed by President Fidel Ramos as the standard bearer
of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party, and senator Raul Roco of Aksyon
Demokratiko (Democratic Action).
</P>
<P>
The Namfrel is the sole non-government organization authorized
to conduct the unofficial quick count.
</P>
<P>
Official vote counting started immediately after the voting
closed at 15:00 (0700 GMT) Monday. After the counting at the
precinct level, election inspectors will turn over the election
returns to the municipal or city level.
</P>
<P>
The total election returns will be recorded and tabulated and
then given to the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
The forms will then be forwarded to the House of
Representatives for the counting for the presidential and vice
presidential positions, while the Commission on Elections will
count the votes for the congressional posts.
</P>
<P>
The process is expected to take four weeks. But the Namfrel can
release the unofficial final results within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Voting for Monday's national and local elections was held in a
"generally peaceful and orderly manner" with a heavy voter turnout
across the country except for some areas where polling was marred
by violence and election irregularities.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commission on Elections, about 80 percent of
the 34 million voters turned out and cast their ballots to choose
a president, a vice president, 12 out of 24 senators, 260 members
of the House of Representatives and more than 17,000 local
officials and councilors.
</P>
<P>
The voting was "generally peaceful and orderly", the Commission
on Elections said.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures showed that a total of 13 people were killed
all over the country in Monday's voting, bringing to 49 the death
toll in election-related violence incidents since election
campaigns began in February.
</P>
<P>
However, compared with the previous elections including those
held in 1992 and 1995, the polls may be the most peaceful and
orderly in the country's election history, poll watchers said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 elections, about 169 people were killed in
election- related violence while in the 1995 senate elections 210
people died.

<HEADLINE> Exports From Philippine Economic Zones Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Exports receipts from the
Philippines' economic zones in the first three months of this year
reached 2.9 billion U.S. dollars, up 22 percent from the year-ago
level, according to the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA).
</P>
<P>
The PEZA said in a report published Tuesday that the exports
from the economic zones accounted for almost one half of the
country's total exports of 6.8 billion dollars in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The report showed exports from the privately-owned special
economic zones outpacing the government-run zones.
</P>
<P>
The exports from the more than 50 privately-owned economic
zones stood at 1.8 billion dollars during the period under review,
while the four government-run zones registered 1.1 billion dollars
in export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Among the four government-run economic zones, the Baguio Export
Processing Zone remains the biggest exporter with 379 million
dollars in export receipts.
</P>
<P>
The exports from the economic zones are expected to move up
further as the peso's depreciation has helped in the
competitiveness in the pricing of the country's exports in the
world market, the PEZA said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government began to establish economic zones in
the 1960s, which have become a major foreign exchange earner for
the country.

MANILA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Philippine newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- The Commission on Elections imposed a total gun ban Monday
night to forestall post-election violence, even as it described
Monday's polls as generally peaceful, marred only by reports of
killings in areas considered traditional "hot spots."
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star
</P>
<P>
-- The Commission on Elections declared a failure of elections
in at least 20 towns in Mindanao Monday due to chaos resulting

</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer
</P>
<P>
-- Vice President Joseph Estrada established an early lead
based on the reports of Inquirer correspondents and the initial
results of three exit polls conducted separately by a private

<HEADLINE> Children Suffering from Asthma Treated in Salt Room </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Five-year-old Xu Zhenqi was all
amazement and excitement when he first stepped into the
room. "Woo, it's all salt," the boy exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
Little Zhenqi's mother liked the room, too, for a different
reason. "Since moving into this salt room, Zhenqi's asthma has
gotten much better," she said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
The salt room, specially designed for treating children
suffering asthma in the Children's Hospital in this capital of
northeast China's Liaoning Province, has become very popular among
children and their parents since it opened a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The walls and floor of the airtight room are covered with salt,
said Wu Ying, head of the hospital. Retaining a certain
temperature and moisture, the room is filled with salt mist
emitted from a computer-controlled generator, making the
micro-weather parameters in the room equivalent or close to those
in a natural cave.
</P>
<P>
A non-medicinal therapy, Wu explained, the room works with the
salt mist entering the patient's bronchiole, enhancing the surface
tension of pulmonary alveoli, dissolving phlegm and thus improving
the ventilating function of the lungs.
</P>
<P>
While being treated in the room, children can play games, do
reading or watch TV just as in any ordinary room. One course
of treatment, taking 21 consecutive days with one hour each day,
yields apparent positive effects.
</P>
<P>
Asthma is a common disease among Chinese children, and a
national survey of 14-year-olds put the incidence of asthma at
0.5-to-2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The salt-room technology cost more than 400,000 yuan (about
48,200 U.S. dollars), according to Wu.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Names 25 Players for World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Football Association
(NFA) on Monday announced a squad of 25 players for the '98 France
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Most of the players were selected from the 1996 Olympic
champion team and the 1994 U.S. World Cup squad.
</P>
<P>
The team includes three African footballers -- Kanu Nwankwo,
1996; Rashidi Yekini, 1993; and Victor Ikepeba, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Uche Justine Akubuike, one of the three goalkeepers, is the
only home-based player in the team.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the only African country that has won an Olympic
soccer gold medal, boosts many talented players. Though it may not
be among the most powerful competitors for the World Cup, it is
widely believed that Nigeria, in its good shape, could be the
No. 1 dark horse in France this summer.
</P>
<P>
There are, however, warnings that the team may not meet the
high expectations from both home and overseas, as its
overseas-based players have not enough time together and seem not
to care enough about team performance.
</P>
<P>
Goalkeepers (3):
</P>
<P>
Ike Shorunmu, Willy Okpara, Uche Justine Akubuike;
</P>
<P>
Defenders (9):
</P>
<P>
Uche Okechukwu, Taribo West, Mobi Oparaku, Celestine Babayaro,
Jero Shakpoke, Kingsley Obiekwu, Ajibade Babalade, Garba Lawal,
Uche Okafor;
</P>
<P>
Midfielders (5):
</P>
<P>
Sunday Oliseh, Austine Okocha, Karibe Ojigwe, Steven Musa, Godwin
Okpara;
</P>
<P>
Forwards (8):

<P>
Finidi George, Tijani Babangida, Kanu Nwankwo, Victor Ikepeba,
Danie Amokachi, Rasheed Yekini, Wilson Oruma, Mutiu Adepoju.
</P>
<P>
The players are expected to arrive in Switzerland for camping
by May 23.

<HEADLINE> China Eyes Closer Cooperation with Germany in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Xie Zhenhua, who heads the Chinese
State Environmental Protection Administration, said here Monday
that he saw great potential for closer cooperation between China
and Germany in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Xie, who is on a three-day visit to Germany, made the remarks
during his talks with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel Monday
in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
With environmental protection to become a key investment area
in China in coming few years, China represented an important
market for advanced environmental protection technologies that
could be offered by German enterprises, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel meanwhile noted that both smaller and large German
enterprises had great interest in participating in environmental
protection projects in China. The German and Chinese economies
supplemented each other quite well especially in this area, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister also said that Germany would make
it a priority for the European Union (EU) to further improve ties
with Asia after Bonn assumes the rotating presidency of the EU in
January 1999. The relations with China would play a particularly
important role in this regard, he added.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Government Initiates Forceful Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile Monday publicly supported the measure taken by the Finance
Ministry against the National Power Company RENEL which had large
debts to the state.
</P>
<P>
According to the national news agency Rompres, Finance Ministry
late last week froze the accounts of RENEL after it proved
incapable of paying its 235 million US dollars debt to the state.
The Prime Minister stated earlier that he had not been informed
about this decision and did not comment on it untill Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was primarily caused by RENEL's failure to keep up
with the payment installments, as State Secretary with the Finance
Ministry Corneliu Gorcea stated.
</P>
<P>
RENEL benefited during the former government from a
re-scheduling of its debts on a two year term (1998-1999).
However, RENEL paid 11,6 million US dollars in the first
trimester, which represents only 5 percent of the total debt.
RENEL was also exempted from the payment of 55,8 million US
dollars in penalties.
</P>
<P>
Authorized sources at RENEL stated that the company was not
able to pay its debts due to the fact that numerous companies were
indebted to RENEL and not paying their debts.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary Gorcea stated that the measure taken was legal
and the accounts of RENEL will be unfrozen only if the government
assumes responsibility.
</P>
<P>
He warned that same measure would be applied to other
autonomous administrations and trade companies which had large
debts to the state. "Besides freezing their accounts, the Ministry
of Finance will initiate forceful measures concerning certain
assets of the debtors," Gorcea stressed.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that the 1998 state budget draft specified an
amount of 517 million US dollars to be collected from debtors.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Purchases of U.S. Treasuries fall in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Total foreign net purchases of
U.S. Treasuries fell to 183.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 from
232.2 billion dollars in 1996 on reduced purchases activity
especially in the official institution sector.
</P>
<P>
Demand declined most notably in the second half of the year,
with only 36 percent occurring in this period, corresponding to
Asia's economic crisis, the U.S. Bond Market Association said in a
report on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Official purchases by foreign official institutions, including
national central banks and monetary authorities fell 49.8 percent
to 43.1 billion dollars in 1997 from 85.8 billion dollars in 1996,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
But purchases by foreign private investors fell only 5.5
percent to 140.1 billion dollars from 148.3 billion dollars a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Declines in this sector were not as significant, said the
report, as the financial crisis resulting from Asia's economic
woes prompted some foreign private investors to seek safety in
U.S. Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
Buying activity in Europe soared to 146.2 billion dollars from
118.8 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Japanese purchases stood at 20.4 billion dollars from 41.4
billion dollars in 1996, according to the report.

NEW YORK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign purchases of U.S.
corporate bonds and debt securities issued by U.S. federal
agencies and government-owned corporations reached record levels
of 86.4 billion U.S. dollars and 49.6 billion dollars respectively
in 1997, according to the U.S. Bond Market Association (BMA).
</P>
<P>
U.S. bond sales to foreigners rose from 83.7 billion dollars in
1996 while U.S. debt securities sales stood at 41.7 billion
dollars in 1996, the BMA said in its latest report.
</P>
<P>
Continued demand from Europe and a sharp rise in buying from
Latin America helped offset weak demand in Asia for U.S. corporate
bonds while the Latin American and Caribbean region bought the
largest amount of U.S. federal agency debt in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The BMA represents securities firms and banks which underwrite,
trade and sell debt securities both domestically and
internationally.

WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House of Representatives
Speaker Newt Gingrich will travel to Israel at the end of May, as
a gesture to show his different attitude toward the Jewish state
with President Bill Clinton, his spokesman said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He will go with a U.S. congressional delegation to Israel but
has not plan to visit any Arab countries, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's announcement came just when the State Department
said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would meet with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to try to revive
the deadlocked Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich has attacked Clinton's Middle East policy, calling it
favorable to Palestinian positions at the expense of Israel's
security needs.
</P>
<P>
Last Week, he urge Clinton to stop bullying Israel to accept a
peace deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich also planned to stop in Italy and meet Pope John
Paul.

<HEADLINE> Cities Behind States in Reducing Welfare Backlog: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- It is more difficult for city
dwellers in the United States to shift from welfare to work than
their suburban and rural counterparts, according to a study
released by the Brookings Institution Monday.
</P>
<P>
The study of 23 cities and urban counties found two-thirds of
cities lagged behind their respective states in reducing welfare
caseloads between 1994 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the city of Bridgeport reduced its welfare
caseload 70 percent more slowly than did Connecticut. San
Francisco reduced its welfare caseload at a pace nearly three
times that of California.
</P>
<P>
The study focused on Northeastern and Midwestern communities.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that the pace at which a city reduced its
welfare rate appeared to closely correlate with the extent of
poverty in that city. For example, San Francisco with a relatively
low rate of high poverty areas, cut its welfare caseload swiftly.
</P>
<P>
However, in St. Louis in Missouri, where more than 25 percent
of residents live in areas of high poverty, the city cut its
welfare caseloads 40 percent more slowly than did the state.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Katz, director of the institution's Center on Urban
Policy, said that while the study confirms what many people
thought to be the case -- that poverty is most heavily
concentrated in urban centers -- it also points out that new
strategies should be developed to get urban people to the
entry-level jobs that often lie outside the urban core.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Warns Sri Lanka's Aging Population Poses Perils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's population is
aging faster than any country in the world, a report form the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) says on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report warns that unless dramatic changes are made in the
country's pension system, the fiscal burden of supporting Sri
Lanka's future elderly population will become unbearable.
</P>
<P>
The reports estimates that in the next two decades, the number
of elderly in the country will double, and that by 2025, the
country will be the only "non-high income" country with an elderly
population representing more than 20 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Suggestions to avert this crisis include increasing the
country's retirement age and encouraging more women to seek paid
employment. "Sri Lanka has a narrow window of opportunity now to
develop policies to avert the potentially negative impacts of an
aging population on the country's economy and society," the
report says.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose just 36.37 points to

The merger, which comes less than a week after Daimler-Benz

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Report on Sanctions Waiver for Europeans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Stated Department
Monday denied that it had indicated to the European Union that
Washington might grant European firms a sanctions waiver relating
to business with Iran.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has received no
recommendation on whether to impose sanctions against three
foreign companies for investing in Iran's energy sector, said
State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
He described as "absolutely untrue" a Financial Times report
Monday that Albright had indicated to European Trade Commissioner
Sir Leon Brittan that Washington might grant European firms a
sanctions waiver before or during a U.S.-European Union summit
next week.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Albright has not received a recommendation yet on
this subject," Rubin said, reiterating that a decision was close.
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly true that we are nearing a decision on that
and that we have been consulting with European governments,
including this past weekend in London, about policies toward Iran
and related issues," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
A 2 billion U.S. dollar deal was struck by France's Total,
Russia's Gazprom and Malaysia's Petronas to develop a major
Iranian oil-field last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been reviewing it. The deal violates the U.S.
Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, which was enacted in 1996. It punishes
companies investing more than 20 million U.S. dollars a year in
the oil or gas industries in those two countries.

NEW YORK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose against the

believed that Germany would raise interest rates soon.
</P>

The dollar edged lower against the yen on renewed fears of
intervention to back up the Japanese currency.

<P>
Investors had expected Germany to raise interest rates to
maintain continent-wide currency stability.

However, economic data released last week and remarks by German
bank officials did not show Germany would make an interest rate
hike.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Seek to Overcome Differences With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
Wednesday in Washington to find ways for breaking the deadlocked
peace process in the Middle East, the State Department announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Albright just got off the phone with Prime Minister
Netanyahu and they agreed to meet here in Washington on Wednesday
to discuss ways in which we can overcome remaining differences"
between Israel and the Palestinians, spokesman James Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the announcement after Albright held talks at the
White House with President Bill Clinton, National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger and U.S. special Middle East envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in a written statement that the purpose of
Albright's discussion with the Israeli leader "will be to seek to
overcome the remaining differences so we proceed immediately with
accelerated permanent status talks."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Albright would report to him after her talks with
Netanyahu to determine whether there was a basis for launching a
peace conference like that of the aborted Washington summit,
originally scheduled to take place right on Monday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that the
president wanted the Israelis and Palestinians "to get on with
serious business of addressing the gaps and differences that
exits."
</P>
<P>
Last week, Clinton invited Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to Washington for a summit, which he said would
jump-start to the final status talks as Israel had suggested, but
it would happen only when Israel accepts a U.S. proposal to make a
further pullback from 13.1 percent of the land on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has rejected the invitation, saying the time had not
ripe to accept the U.S. proposal as it would endanger its
security. The scheduled summit has thus to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
At the White House meeting earlier in the day, special envoy
Ross gave the president his assessment of the situation in the
Middle East after his weekend failed shuttle diplomacy between
Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"It was an assessment of whether we are and what we should do,"
an administration official said. "Obviously no one here wants this
