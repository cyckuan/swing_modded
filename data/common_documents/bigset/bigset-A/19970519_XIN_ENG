The president signed a draft political agreement and memorandum
with the opposition leader Said Abdullah Nuri in Bishkek, capital
of neighboring Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
According to Interfax News Agency reports, both sides will ratify
the mutual understanding agreement and the law of amnesty.

opposition representatives. The government will also lift the ban
on opposition activities after their armed forces being disarmed
and redesignated.

way for constructive development of political situation in
tajikistan.

<HEADLINE> UK Labor MP Denies Bribery Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- One of Britain's ruling Labor
Party's newly-elected members of parliament (MP), Mohammed Sarwar,
said Sunday claims that he bribed a rival election candidate are
"totally false".
</P>
<P>
The claims were made in the News of the World newspaper, which
said that Sarwar, the 46-year-old multi-millionaire Labor MP for
Glasgow Govan, paid 5,000 pounds (8,000 U.S. dollars) to an
Independent Labor candidate not to try hard to win votes.
</P>
<P>
The Glasgow Govan MP, also Britain's first Muslim MP, said that
he would be consulting his lawyers about a possible action for
defamation.
</P>
<P>
Labor officials reacted to the first potentially serious blow
to Prime Minister Blair's administration by ordering an immediate
investigation, warning that Sarwar would face tough action if he
was found to have done anything improper.
</P>
<P>
A senior Labor spokesman said Saturday night that they would
question Sarwar about the allegations.
</P>
<P>
"It is not appropriate to comment until we have heard Mr
Sarwar's side of the story. Should further action be needed in the
light of this, we will not hesitate to take it."
</P>
<P>
If true, the allegations will embarrass the Labor Party, which
won a landslide victory in the May 1 general election and had
promised to change from a Conservative administration riddled with
allegations of financial and sexual impropriety.

<HEADLINE> Cipollini Retains Giro Leader's Jersey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Mario Cipollini snatched his
second Giro d'Italia stage win in 24 hours as one of his chief
rivals crashed on the final bend on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Cipollini strengthened his grip on the lead as
compatriot Nicola Minali crashed 200 meters from the finish of the
211-km second leg from Mestre to Cervia.
</P>
<P>
Minali's back wheel skidded sideways as he chased Cipollini out
of the final bend and Minali and Elio Aggiano slid into the
spectator barriers.
</P>
<P>
Czech Jan Svorada pipped Endrio Leoni for second place with
Cipollini comfortably clear at the line after a final lap
averaging more than 50 kph.
</P>
<P>
Fabio Baldato, another Cipollini rival, had to fight back from
an earlier crash on the 7.8-km circuit and was critical of the
organisation for planning a course with so many corners.
</P>
<P>
Cipollini, who's built a career out of capturing such stages,
also took Saturday's opening leg in a closing dash, edging
countryman Minali.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Publishes Editorial On Land Protection (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-based People's Daily
today published an editorial entitled "Protection of Farmland
Brooks No Delay", urging the whole nation to pay more attention to
the protection of arable lands.
</P>
<P>
Applauding the notice issued by the State Council today further
enhancing land management and the protection of arable lands, the
Editorial said protecting arable lands across the country has
become an urgent need, and some strategic measures should be
immediately taken.
</P>
<P>
Due to the efforts made by the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee and the State Council, the trend of chaotic land
occupation and land abuse has been controlled in recent years.
But, the editorial noted, the whole nation must remain highly
vigilant about the land situation because the problems are still
very serious.
</P>
<P>
"The average arable land area per capita in China is less than
half of the world's average. And most of China's arable lands are
located in mountain, hilly, plateau, arid or semi-arid areas, and
many of them are suffering from soil erosion and deterioration,"
the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the adjustment in agricultural structures and
natural disasters would lead to a loss of some arable land, and
that economic development in China will change many arable lands
into some contruction projects, and the even larger population in
the future will require still more arable lands for food
production.
</P>
<P>
"If correct and effective measures are not adopted now, the
balance between the arable lands' feeding capacity and human
necessity would be destroyed," the editorial said, "so protecting
the arable land is the protection of our own lifeline."
</P>
<P>
In some places, illegal land transactions still exist, and
outside funds are still being attracted at the price of lost
arable lands, the editorial said.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Publishes Editorial on Land Protection (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial noted that leaders of the central authorities
recently pointed out that China should adopt the toughest measures
in the world to manage land and protect arable land.
</P>
<P>
"Concerning our country's specific conditions and the current
situation -- if the misuse of arable land doesn't come to a halt
despite repeated efforts by the central government to ban it,
there are no other options for us," it said.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that the reason why the problem of the loss
of arable land couldn't find a fundamental solution over a long
period of time lies in the incompleteness of China's system for
land management, as well as in the country's legal system.
</P>
<P>
"We need to carry out a scheme of comprehensive management,
which covers all relevant aspects, to solve the land problem," it
suggested.
</P>
<P>
Starting from October 1 this year, the article noted,
activities of sabotaging land resources would receive criminal
penalties in accordance with the amended Criminal Law.
</P>
<P>
"This signifies another major progress our country has made in
completing the legal system for land management," it commented.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the editorial noted, analyses by relevant departments
showed that in the coming 10 to 15 years, by means of intensifying
land management, tapping potentials and promoting the intensive
use of land, the area of arable land could be effectively
increased, while land for construction could also be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is absolutely possible to reach the strategic
goal set by President Jiang Zemin that the overall area of arable
land should be guaranteed an increase, and should by no means
suffer a decrease," it asserted.
</P>
<P>
It added that rearrangement of the land has also been proved to
be a successful way to increase arable land, citing east China's
Jiangsu Province as an example.
</P>
<P>
The province is planning to merge its more than 280,000 natural
villages into over 50,000 villages of larger sizes, which can
produce approximately three million mu (200,000 hectares) of new
arable land.
</P>
<P>
The editorial cited it as the responsibility of every Chinese
citizen to protect the country's arable land, and a social
atmosphere of using the land economically and cherishing the
arable land should be created by enhancing the land awareness
among the entire people, especially the leading officials.
</P>
<P>
"We are obliged to carefully protect and develop the land which
our ancestors have cultivated for 5,000 years, and pass it on to
our future generations," the editorial said.

<HEADLINE> STDS: Main Cause of Infertility of Africans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Sexually Transmitted Diseases
(STDS) have been blamed for being the main cause of infertility
among African men.
</P>
<P>
The Invitro Fertilisation (IVF) Association of Zimbabwe today
said infertility in this southern African nation of 11.5 million
was a 30 to 40 percent male problem.
</P>
<P>
And in females, the association said infertility resulted from
blocked tubes as a result of tubal pregnancy, disease and other
interruptions.
</P>
<P>
About 10 to 15 percent of males in the western world were
unable to conceive and the number is more in Africa because of
the prevalence of STDS.
</P>
<P>
The association, formed in 1987, aimed to provide counsel and
advice for patients, to liaise between its medical team and
members and to undertake any other activities that might further
the cause of IVF.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Leaves for Zaire for Talks With Kabila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 18 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki left Pretoria for Zaire this afternoon for
talks with Laurent Kabila, who declared himself the Head of State
of "the Democratic Republic of Congo" on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who has been deeply involved in seeking a peaceful
settlement to the Zaire crisis, was accompanied by Defense
Minister Joe Modise, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad
during his last-ditch diplomatic efforts to win support for a
South African plan to bring democracy to the central African
nation, said an informed source here.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Mbeki and Kabila are scheduled to take place
tonight at Kabila's stronghold Lubumbashi, the second largest
city of Zaire, said the source.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether South Africa would recognize Kabila's
government, Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo, who was at
Waterkloof Airport near Pretoria to see the delegation off, said
that "the people of Zaire will decide, but there is no reason why
we would not support him."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, President Nelson Mandela declined to comment on
developments in Zaire and Kabila's unilateral assumption of
power.
</P>
<P>
The president will make an announcement once Mbeki returns
from talks with Kabila in Lubumbashi, said Mandela's spokesman
Parks Mankahlana.

<HEADLINE> Calm Returns to Kinshasa After Looting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Guo Ming)
</P>
<P>
BRAZZAVILLE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Calm returned to Kinshasa today as
Zaire's self-proclaimed Head of State Laurent Kabila sent more troops
to gain full control of the capital after overnight looting by
the defeated government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state television and radio said Kabila's men
earlier today captured the military camp of the special division
loyal to Mobutu Sese Seko, the last stronghold of Mobutu's
government forces.
</P>
<P>
"The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
Congo-Zaire has gained full control of the situation in
Kinshasa," said an announcement carried by the state radio which
has already been in the hands of Kabila's troops.
</P>
<P>
An overnight heavy fighting happened in the southwestern part
of the capital where the military camp is located, but Kabila's
troops finally gained an upper hand.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Kabila sent the second dispatch of supporting
troops to Kinshasa to boost his control of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The tv and radio repeatedly broadcasted an order from Kabila,
saying that any forms of crime including looting are strictly
forbidden, and looters would be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
Kabila also called on local residents in Kinshasa to remain
calm and carry on their normal business.
</P>
<P>
Many disgruntled civilians who have long suffered from
poverty, especially the frustrated young people, also took part
in Saturday's looting in downtown Kinshasa. Many shops, hotels,
and houses of the rich people suffered from the robbery.
</P>
<P>
But peace returned to the capital, teemed with a population of
five million, as local residents began to appear in the streets
and clean the looted places in the city.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who has declared to change the country's name from Zaire
to the Democratic Republic of Congo, is scheduled to announce the
name list of his new cabinet by Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zaire and neighboring Congo's state radios both
reported that Mobutu had late last night arrived in Morocco for a
temporary stay. But the final destination of his exile trip can
not be acertained.

<HEADLINE> Iran Strikes Oil, Gas Deal with French Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that it
has signed a 3-billion-U.S. dollar contract with French Total
Company for oil and gas exploitation in southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a press conference
that the agreement was signed by Iran's oil ministry and the
French Total Company.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that the project will be launched in South Pars,
a new and major oil and gas center in south Iran. The Total will
be involved in digging and transferring oil and gas to the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the latest deal might spark a trade
row between the United States and France because U.S. President
Bill Clinton signed a bill to punish foreign companies which
invest more than 40 million dollars in Iran's oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which has made some progress in thwarting the
U.S. sanction in oil and gas sector, also signed a
140-million-dollar contract with a UK-Canadian consortium --
Britain's Pell Frischmann and Canada's Bow Valley.
</P>
<P>
The Total company signed a 600-million-dollar contract with
Iran for offshore exploration at Sirri oil fields last
year. Originally, American Conoco company had the contract to
undertake the project but abandoned it because of a ban imposed
by Bill Clinton in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
Iranian oil industry has dismissed the sanction imposed by the
United States, saying it will be no short-term or long-term
impact on the oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that some companies of the United States had
attended an oil and gas conference held recently in Isfahan
defying Clinton's administrative order.
</P>
<P>
To thwart sanction by the United States, the Iranian oil
industry has announced a total of 11 key oil and gas projects
worth at least 7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran had said that more than 120 foreign oil and gas companies
have offered their bids in the Iranian oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh claimed that "having 92
billion barrels of crude oil reserves, the Islamic Republic of
Iran is one of the significant players in the world energy arena."
</P>
<P>
Iran is the second largest oil exporter in the world, which
pumps 3.6 million barrels of oil and exports 2.5 million barrels
of crude every day.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry is the pillar of Iran's economy. Iran earns
about 18 billion dollars by exporting crude oil each year and the
oil export revenue accounts for about 70 percent of the total
export of the country.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Launch War on Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Labor government will
launch a war on drugs as a new Home Office research shows that one
in five people arrested by police in Britain is on heroin.
</P>
<P>
A study of those arrested in four British cities, London,
Manchester, Notingham and Cambridge, over a 21-month period
reveals that 360,000 of the 1.8 million arrests the police
annually make are regular heroin users.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Prime Minister Tony Blair will Monday
announce a new cabinet task force, a ministerial committee, to
coordinate the war on drugs. The committee will appoint a
high-profile team to lead the fight against drug abuse and the
illegal drugs trade.
</P>
<P>
Under new measures, to be introduced on a pilot basis, an
initial drug test would be carried out on any offender suspected
of being a drug user prior to sentencing.
</P>
<P>
It tested positive, he or she would be forced to accept
treatment and be subject to random tests throughout the
three-month order.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, the number of people
convicted of drug-related offenses has more than trebled over the
last decade to 93,000 last year. The number of drugs seizures has
risen four-fold to 115,000 annually. The number of notified
addicts has doubled since 1986 to 37,000.

message from PNA President Yasser Arafat to Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul Salam Majali a message and asked him to hand it to
King Hussein. The message is said to be focused on the bilateral
relations and the latest development of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arab coordination looks ever more important as the Israeli
government's settlement policy and unilateral measures have led to
the latest mission of U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross to failure,
said Erekat who is on his second visit here within two months.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has refused to meet Ross again and written a letter to
U.S. President Bill Clinton calling for his personal efforts to
reactivate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Majali responded to Erekat's remarks by saying that the
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue is the best way to break the
stalement and Jordan will firmly support the Palestinians to
achieve their rights on their national soil.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, chief Palestinian negotiator with Israel, also told
Majali that the latest Palestinian-Israeli meeting and the talks
with Ross were centered on Jerusalem and Israeli troop
redeployment in some West Bank areas.

<HEADLINE> HK Air Cargo Records Double Digit Growth in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The air cargo at Hong Kong's Kai
Tak International Airport rose 17.2 percent in April, Hong Kong
Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, HK's single air cargo
terminal operator has processed over half a million tons of air
cargo, securing Kai Tak's position as the world's top
international cargo airport.
</P>
<P>
Among the total 139,861 tons handled last month, export cargo
increased by 18 percent over the same period last year to 64,691
tons, import cargo was up 14 percent to 57,985 tons, and
transshipment goods rose a remarkable 23.4 percent to 17,185 tons,
the HACTL listed.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Charter, managing director of the HACTL, said: "In
terms of a single air cargo complex, HACTL handles more tonnage
than any other operator in the world."
</P>
<P>
The rise in April "corroborates our estimates that the
long-term outlook for Hong Kong's air cargo is one of underlying
optimism and growth," he added.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Ban Tobacco Sports Sponsorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Labor government said
today that it would outlaw the sponsorship of sports events by
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Frank Dobson confirmed that the commitment to
end tobacco advertising announced in the Queen's Speech last week
would include a ban on sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
Dobson said in a speech to the Royal College of Nursing's
congress in Yorkshire that sports would be given time to find
other sponsors.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that some sports are heavily dependent on tobacco
sponsorship. We will therefore give them time and help to reduce
their dependency on tobacco and replace it with sponsorship from
more benign sources," he added.
</P>
<P>
The decision was welcomed by anti-smoking campaigners, but
tobacco companies, while disappointed by the move, said that a
variety of sports would suffer financially as a result of the ban,
but they did not think it would have any effect on the consumption
of tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
They argued that a ban on advertising would not cut cigarette
consumption as the ads only persuaded existing smokers to change
brands.
</P>
<P>
Cigarette companies spend millions sponsoring sports such as
cricket, golf, darts, Rugby and Formula One motor racing.

<HEADLINE> China Works Out Plan for Development of Scientific Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build up four
nationwide networks for scientific research, instrument supply,
maintenance of instruments, analysis and testing, and information
in Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities where scientists and
researchers are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
According to China's development plan of scientific research
conditions for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) and
long-range objectives for 2010 issued today, China will form a
relatively comprehensive service network for Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
The scientific research conditions mainly cover instruments for
scientific research, lab animals, chemical reagents, books, and
data that provide the necessary support for launching scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan drawn up by the State Science and
Technology Commission (SSTC), China is to utilize advantages of
high-tech development zones in Beijing, Shanghai, and Changchun
for building bases for producing self-developed patented
instruments.
</P>
<P>
China plans to raise its market share of Chinese-patented
instruments from 13 percent in 1995 to 26 percent by the end of
2000.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China will introduce foreign technology or
establish joint ventures for producing medium and high-grade
instruments for research in biology, biochemistry, new materials,
and mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
An official with the SSTC said that Beijing will lead in
sharing the use of large instruments that have a low utilization
ratio. The SSTC, the State Education Commission, and some other
departments have collected 13 million yuan (1.6 million US
dollars) for establishing a fund to pay the operation charges of
those instruments.
</P>
<P>
The plan stipulates that China will spread the use of
clean-level lab animals by 2000 and SPS-level animals (animals not
carrying specified causative agents) by 2010.
</P>
<P>
China is to improve its chemical reagent production and supply
networks in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China's scientific research institutions
and universities had bought instruments valued at 28 billion yuan
(nearly 3.5 billion dollars) and produced more than 6,000 kinds of
reagents.
</P>
<P>
China has an annual lab animal breeding capacity of 13 million
and established more than 10,000 libraries, archives, and
information centers.

<HEADLINE> China To Step Up Collection of Personal Earnings Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to put more
efforts into the collection of individual earnings tax revenue,
which is expected to exceed the 20 billion yuan mark this year.
</P>
<P>
The government will take new measures to collect more personal
earnings tax this year, especially from people engaged in
architecture, performing arts, and advertising, according to an
official with the State Administration of Taxation.
</P>
<P>
It will also conduct a special examination nationwide to fight
against tax evasion more harshly, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a new law is to be drafted to regulate the collection
of the tax item, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since China first started to impose the tax item in 1980s, the
state revenue from the individual earnings has expanded from five
million yuan in 1981 to 19.3 billion yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Club Beats Ivorian Champions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Primeiro Agosto went on a
five-goal rampage in Angola this weekend to destroy Ivorians
Africa Sports National in a Champions League second-round clash.
</P>
<P>
The result proved the biggest shock of the eight ties and the
Luanda club will join the champions of Algeria, Egypt, Ghana,
Morocco, Mozambique, South Africa and Tunisia in the group phase.
</P>
<P>
Primeiro had won only two of seven previous home games spanning
17 years, never scored more than three goals in front of their
supporters, and failed to progress beyond the second round.
</P>
<P>
After battling to overcome modest Notwane of Botswana in the
first round, Primeiro snatched a last-minute equaliser in the
Ivory Coast against a team packed with international stars.
</P>
<P>
It was an opportune time for the Angolans to make an impact as
prize money is on offer for the first time in the leading
continental club event with each quarter-finalist receiving
150,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The survivors will be divided into two mini-leagues starting on
August 22 with matches staged on a home-and-away basis and the
group winners qualifying for a two-leg final.
</P>
<P>
There was another upset in Mozambique where Ferroviario
trounced Unisport Bafang from Cameroon 4-0 with Jorge Vulande
scoring twice and Arnaldo Ouana and Tomas Inguane once.
</P>
<P>
Veteran midfielder Ahmed al-Kass struck after eight minutes in
Zambia to give defending champions Zamalek from Egypt a 1-0 win
over Mufulira Wanderers.
</P>
<P>
Although the Cairo club have lifted the trophy a record four
times, their away record is poor with this success being the first
in 13 matches covering five years.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian outfit Club Africain equalled the record overall
winning margin after flying to the Indian Ocean island of Reunion
and giving Saint-Pierroise another five-goal hiding.

<HEADLINE> If Ignored, Russia Would Review NATO Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today assured parliamentary leaders that Russia will review its
relations with NATO if the alliance ignores the opinions of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
If the North Atlantic Treaty Organization decides to takes
in former Soviet republics as new members, Russia will reconsider
its relations with NATO, Yeltsin was quoted by the Itar-Tass news
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin met with speakers and party chiefs of both houses of
parliament today, mainly to explain the new deal agreed with NATO,
which is poised to expand eastward to take in former Soviet allies
in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The president said the treaty to be signed next week in Paris
should be seen "not as a compromise but as a balanced result,
corresponding to our interests and the interests of the alliance,"
Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who is apparently trying to overcome criticisms of the
accord with NATO from the opposition, said Russia didn't make any
concessions on issues of principle in the six rounds of
negotiations with NATO.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Russia had to seek to minimize the
consequences of the expanded NATO when its eastward enlargement
became unpreventable.
</P>
<P>
One year ago, NATO said Russia didn't have the right to protest
against NATO expansion. But now, for both sides, the central issue
had become how to find a way to avoid confrontation, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the document was conducive to solving the question of
European security on the basis of equality.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia had won important assurances from the West,
including a pledge not to move nuclear weapons or other forces
into new member states in Eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Some 280 Arrested for Violating Election Codes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 280 people were arrested
for violation of election codes in the capital city of
Tehran in the past few days, a security official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Tosef-Reza Abulfathi, commander of the Law Enforcement Forces
in the Greater Tehran area, said that these people were
arrested because they tore off or destroyed posters or used
government facilities to promote their favorite candidates.
</P>
<P>
The competition is rather intense among two main rivals --
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri and former cultural and
Islamic guidance minister Mohammad Khatami as the countdown began
on the presidential elections slated for coming Friday.
</P>
<P>
The security official warned that any rally or march in
support of a candidate following their speeches is forbidden
without valid permits.
</P>
<P>
"Tearing off or destroying posters or placing one candidate's
poster on the other's is forbidden and those who are seen
doing in that way would be arrested and face law suit," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Election Supervision Council of the Tehran
province today issued a statement asking the presidential
aspirants to be vigilant about the rules in their
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The council warned that the violators will face legal
charges punishable by imprisonment. It also announced three
telephone numbers for report of any violations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The policies implemented in the
rural areas should be further stabilized, said a senior legislator
recently.
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), made this remark during
an inspection tour of northwest China's Gansu province from May 14
to 18.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rural productive forces should be further
enhanced, and the pace of getting rid of poverty should be
hastened.
</P>
<P>
According to Tian, the current policies implemented in the
rural areas include the household responsibility system, the
policy permitting some farmers to develop wealth, and the policy
to encourage the development of rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
More technologies and agricultural machinery should be applied
so as to promote the rural productive forces and to help narrow
the development gap between the country's west and east regions,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"The central government will continue supporting the
development of the western region, while the government at all
levels in the west should emancipate their minds further from
traditional old ideas and introduce more funds from overseas and
seek more cooperative opportunities," Tian said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Asks Iraq to Clarify Fate of Iranian POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Iran today called on international
organizations to put pressure on the Iraqi government to clarify
the status Iranian prisoners of war in Iraq, the Persian Daily
Iran reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Balar, spokesman for the commission in charge of
Iranian Prisoners of War (POW), said that the Iraqi government
should give an explicit response to Iran's request on the fate of
that group of Iranians.
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 "Iranians have disappeared and captured by the
Iraqi regime during the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq from
1980 to 1988," he was quoted by the Persian Daily Iran.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Iranian government in a move to show its good
will has released about 1,000 Iraqi POWs in two stages
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
But, the Iraqi government has not reciprocated Iran's measure,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also criticized the Iraqi government, especially
the Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, for not
abiding by their promises.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Al-Sahhaf in a meeting with his
Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati in Rabat, Morocco, in
March, had promised to take practical steps for the settlement of
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought a bloody war from 1980 to 1988. Iranian
Majlis (Parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said earlier
that the damages inflicted by the eight-year Iraqi imposed war on
Iran totals 1,000 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Beijing-Kowloon Railway Well Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China's longest railway, the
newly-built Beijing-Kowloon Railway, is well maintained by cities
and towns along the railway line.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jiping, office director of the Central Commission for
Comprehensive Management of Public Security, said here today that
all nine provinces and municipalities along the Beijing-Kowloon
Railway have made every effort to keep the transportation artery
safe and clear of obstructions.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from its significance as an artery linking Hong Kong and
Beijing and other interior areas of the motherland, the railway
has also been regarded as a lifeline for regions along it to
develop their local economies," he explained.
</P>
<P>
In Jiangxi Province, the Provincial Department of Public
Security and the local railway administration have jointly
launched a campaign to increase public awareness about protecting
the trunk line, which covered all the towns, villages, schools,
factories and mines along the railway. To date, 170,000 people
have been involved in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
During the past one and a half months, Anhui Province has
checked 20 bridges and 179 culverts on the railway within its
border, to remove any possible threat to a safe journey on the
line.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, many places along the railway have also
introduced a responsibility system, which requires major
government officials to be fully responsible for the safety and
smooth operation of the line.

<HEADLINE> Long Jail Terms Demanded For Hanbo Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Winding up a four-month trial
resulting from the big Hanbo money-for-power scandal, South Korean
prosecutors today asked for long jail terms for 11 businessmen,
politicians and bankers charged with bribery, sleaze and
embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors demanded 20-years imprisonment for Chung Tae-soo,
founder of the Hanbo Group, charged with embezzling 191.1 billion
won (214.7 million U.S. dollars) from the company's account.
</P>
<P>
He was also accused of offering 3.25 billion won (3.65 million
dollars) in bribes to senior politicians and bank officials, in
collaboration with his son and a former company executive, in
return for mammoth loans.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy in January of the Hanbo Steel Company, the
flagship of the Hanbo Group, triggered a chain collapse of
business associates and led to the biggest yet corruption
investigation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors asked for six years imprisonment for Chung's son,
Chung Bo-keun, the present chairman of the Hanbo Group, for
alleged bribery and embezzlement. The group ranks 14th among the
nation's conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Park San-gil said the Hanbo scandal was "a large
scale corruption case perpetrated in collaboration by immoral
politicians, bankers and corporate executives."
</P>
<P>
"It has even damaged the nation's reputation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also asked for five to eight year jail terms for
another nine people allegedly involved in the scandal, including a
former home affairs minister, four lawmakers and three bank chiefs.
</P>
<P>
In a latest move by the prosecution which had vowed to expose
the largest corruption scandal in the country, Kim Hyun-chul, the
second son of President Kim Young-sam, and Kim Ki-sup, former
deputy chief of the National Security Planning Agency, were
arrested for allegedly taking kickbacks.

be appointed by the Chief Executive of the HKSAR;
</P>
<P>
-- The terms of office of members of these provisional district
organizations shall commence on July 1, 1997 and expire on a date
not later than December 31, 1999; and
</P>
<P>
-- The Provisional Urban Council and the Provisional Regional
Council both consist of not more than 50 members, a 25 percent
increase over the two existing councils. The membership of each
one of 18 Provisional District Councils shall be extended by 25
percent to not more than 40.
</P>
<P>
A Bills Committee, chaired by PLC member Chan Kam-lam, has been
formed to study the three bills.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Grows Moderately in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The national economic development
in China continued to grow moderately in April, Ye Zhen, spokesman
for the State Statistical Bureau (SSB), said here today.
</P>
<P>
All state economic indicators showed a moderate increase, Ye
said at a news conference held today, which was attended by Liu
Hong, newly-appointed SSB director.
</P>
<P>
The domestic industrial output value maintained a stable growth in
April. The industrial added-value generated by enterprises at or
above the township level totalled 174.3 billion yuan last month,
11.9 percent up from the last year's same period, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
The added-value secured by light industrial manufacturers rose
to 76.4 billion yuan while that of heavy industrial makers climbed
to 97.9 billion yuan, with each registering an 11.9 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
The sales rate of industrial goods came to 95.21 percent, 0.49
percent higher than the same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, Ye said, the country's
investment in fixed assets was 242.5 billion yuan, representing a
15 percent increase. The growth range was 1.1 percent higher than
the average rate of the previous three months.
</P>
<P>
The retail sales of consumer goods rose 13.6 percent at 210.1
billion yuan, registering a 12.4 percent real growth after
allowing for the price rise.
</P>
<P>
The volume of retail sales of consumer goods in urban districts
totalled 128.7 billion yuan while that in rural areas accounted to
81.3 billion yuan, increasing by 13.4 percent and 10.8 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The national import and export value in April soared to 26
billion US dollars, a 16.7 percent increase compared with last
year's same period.
</P>
<P>
The imports increased 2.9 percent for the first time since the
beginning of the year as a result of more imports by the
processing trade, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
The growth of prices further slowed down in April, with the
retail price of consumer goods rising 1.1 percent from the same
month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Residents consumer prices increased by 3.2 percent last month,
0.8 percent lower than that in March.
</P>
<P>
The national economic operation is on the right track. Key
tasks in macro-economic control for the coming months are to
prevent financial risks, tighten the control over newly-built
projects, deepen the reforms at the state-owned enterprises, and
speed up changes in the economic growth mode, Ye said.

<HEADLINE> Localization of Civil Service Urged in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official has urged the
Portuguese side to take effective measures to step up the process
of the localization of the civil service in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xi'an, representative of the Chinese side of the Three
Leading Issues Working Panel on the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison
Group (JLG), said here today after a meeting with his Portuguese
counterparts that the Chinese side had paid special attention to
the localization of civil service.
</P>
<P>
"The problem with the localization of civil service is that the
 number of Chinese-speaking civil servants posted in middle and
senior positions is so small that it is in sharp contrast to the
fact that the Chinese population constitutes the dominant part of
local residents," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the Portuguese side will have greater sense of
responsibility and urgency in resolving the issue," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The working panel's closed-door meeting today on the three
leading issues -- localization of civil service, localization of
law and the use of Chinese as an official language -- is in
preparation for the upcoming 29th plenary session of the JLG in
June in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the Portuguese side briefed the Chinese
side on the progress in the three leading issues of Macao's
transition. And the Chinese side responded that certain progress
was scored but that was not enough, considering that only two and
half years are left before the handover of power in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side concludes that if the three leading issues,
especially the localization of civil service, cannot be addressed
in time and properly, the smooth handover of power and the stable
transition will be affected," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Portuguese side has made some efforts, it is far
from satisfactory with the localization of civil service," added
Wang.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that greater efforts are needed in the
localization of law and the use of Chinese as an official
language, although there is progress.
</P>
<P>
A large number of laws are yet to be translated and localized,
and Portuguese is still the dominant language in some government
departments, and some government documents only have Portuguese
version without a Chinese version, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Mendes, Wang's Portuguese counterpart, said that the
Macao government is making efforts in the translation of law, and
has stepped up the training of more professionals in law and civil
 service.

charges linked with the bribery scandal surrounding the Hanbo
steel group which collapsed in January.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae Jung, 72, was forced into exile in the 1970s and was
sentenced to death in 1980 by the regime of former president Chun

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain's special envoy for
Cyprus, Sir David Hannay, is to visit the island in early June to
assist the United Nations in solving the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Britain's High Commissioner
in Nicosia David Madden after a 45-minute meeting with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides at Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Madden pledged that the British government would do its very
best to assist U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in what he plans
to do on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has announced his
intention to invite President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash to have direct talks on Cyprus issue in New York in
the second half of June.
</P>
<P>
Madden said he hoped to announce soon an early meeting between
Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides and British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on reservations expressed by the Cypriot
government that there was no enough preparation for direct
negotiations, Madden noted that U.N. preparatory efforts are
continuing.
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that we still have a bit of time," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a reference made to Cyprus by Queen Elizabeth II,
in her speech delivered at the official opening of the British
Parliament on May 14, Madden said that "there was a commitment in
the Queen's speech, that the British government would continue to
work for progress and indeed toward a settlement of the Cyprus
problem."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops occupied its northern
third in the wake of an Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Japan Trade Surplus More Than Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, MAY 19 (Xinhua) -- With the weaker yen promoting
exports, Japan's trade surplus more than doubled in April from a
year earlier, the Finance Ministry announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Figures released on Monday showed that Japan's overall trade
surplus surged 163.7 percent, the highest growth rate since
January 1992.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports in April soared 21.5 percent to 4429.26 billion
yen (38.5 billion U.S. dollars) amid strong exports of automobiles
and office supplies.
</P>
<P>
April imports rose 8.1 percent to 3597.78 billion yen (31.6
billion dollars), because of a 34.1 percent increase in crude oil
imports.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive surplus with the United States shot up even more
strongly, rising 174.1 percent to 468.97 billion yen (4.1 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus with the European Union (EU) and Asian
countries in April also rose after a one-month interval.
</P>
<P>
The surplus with the EU expanded 151.3 percent to 230.89
billion yen (two billion dollars), and that with other Asian
countries grew 34.1 percent to 536.56 billion yen (4.7 billion
dollars), the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus began growing in February for the first
time in 27 months and kept rising in March.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a relatively weaker yen compared with the
exchange rates a year earlier had fueled a rise in exports,
pushing up Japan's surplus, and they cited a possible resurgence
of trade frictions with the United States.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that a similar jump in the trade surplus was
unlikely to be repated in the near future, because the yen's
exchange rate had rebounded on the currency market.
</P>
<P>
Tsutomu Makino, Vice Minister of Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI) told a press conference
that the ministry will closely monitor the trade surplus for the
time being.

TIANJIN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Two special institutions for the

<HEADLINE> China Maintains Stable Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The price index of consumer goods
in China has fallen for 30 months running. How long it will last?
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Statistical Bureau said it will not
rebound sharply this year. The downward trend will continue as
long as the macro-economic control works.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the growth rate of consumer
goods has drifted to 5.2 percent. Economists predict that the
annual growth rate will not surpass six percent.
</P>
<P>
Macro-economic control played a decisive role in keeping the
price stable.
</P>
<P>
The strategic shift from seller's market to a buyer's market is
the internal factor of stable prices in China, said Ren Caifang,
head of the investigation team of the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
A buyer's market means an ample supply of commodities is on the
market with supply and demand balancing the price of the majority
of goods.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural development contributed greatly to sustained
stable prices. Consecutive good grain harvests have kept the farm
produce prices stable. The absolute price is declining.
</P>
<P>
Other leading factors included the readjustment of economic
structures and operation on a fairly large scale. Mass production
has reduced production cost and consequently led a drop in retail
price.
</P>
<P>
Chinese consumers are the beneficiaries of stable market. There
has been a buying spree for large-screen color television sets and
computers as a result of price cutting over the past year.
</P>
<P>
However, government officials and experts said, consumer
purchases were not as active as desired, which has restricted
production though it benefits the stability of prices.
</P>
<P>
This was partially caused by the laid-offs at enterprises in
China's transition of economic systems. Therefore, a key solution
to enliven the market is to create more job opportunities for the
jobless.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, housing and automobile have gradually become
the hot items for purchase in urban districts, which provide an
impetus for national economic development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rural areas have great potential. Higher income for
farmers will help stimulate the market, Ren said.

Oddest Scottish Import

It could be the oddest Scottish import for the year 1997.

championships ordered 200,000 shuttlecocks for the competition

The Scottish organizers know very well that it will cost them
one million pounds to stage the Sudirman Cup and the world

<P>
They also know Glasgow City Council paid 300,000 pounds to the
International Badminton Federation to secure the event and the
Scottish Sports Council scooped a big chunk of 196,000 pounds of
its lottery award in recognition of its status.
</P>
<P>
But they could not forsee the nonchalance of the local
television stations as they would not broadcast a single minute of
the event.
</P>
<P>
BBC Scotland say the problem is the dearth of its resources, as
they have soccer, tennis and golf commitments. Scottish Television
said they were never reached while organizers contended contacts
were made even two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Investment in Southern Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Somali faction led by Ali
Mahdi Mohamed in north Mogadishu today asked the Malaysian
government to suspend their investment programs being carried out
in the south of the city.
</P>
<P>
The investment to one of Mogadishu's factions is encouraging
the renewal of fighting over economical interests in the capital,
he said in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Somali-Malaysian Commercial Bank Ltd.
was inaugurated ten days ago in south Mogadishu, the first
foreign-invested bank there.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent shares of the bank belong to Malaysian
businessmen while the rest of 30 percent to sympathizers of
warlord Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians have also established a large telecommunication
center in south Mogadishu and seem to enjoy mild relations with
south Mogadishu merchants.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that such activities will undermine
confidence to future relations with the Malaysian government by
the rest of the Somali communities.
</P>
<P>
The statement even characterized Malaysia's investment as a
move deliberately taken towards further foreign intervention into
Somalia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
It urged Malaysians to play a proper role in reconciling the
Somali factions or providing an equal assistance to the different
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement also praised the Malaysian government for
actively participating in the U.N. failed operation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"The Malaysians should not destroy their previous reputation
in the Somali community," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Forum Highlights Law on Administrative Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The law on Administrative
Supervision is of great significance to the improvement of China's
legal structure and system of administrative supervision, and
concrete measures must be taken to ensure its full implementation.
</P>
<P>
This is the opinion shared by senior Party and government
officials and legal experts attending today a Beijing forum on the
law's implementation.
</P>
<P>
The law was adopted by the Standing Committee of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) on May 9, and came into force the
same day.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, told the
forum that it is necessary for all relevant departments and
personnel to work out concrete and feasible measures to safeguard
the integrity and authority of the law.
</P>
<P>
"People's congresses at all levels across the country should
also strengthen their supervision on the law's implementation, and
make every effort to correct immediately any activities in
violation of the law," he added.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Li Guixian described the promulgation of the
law on administrative supervision as a major step China has taken
in the process of adopting a rule of law.
</P>
<P>
"The law will play a significant role in raising the
administrative efficiency, and will help improve the
decision-making capability and management skills of leading
officials at all levels," Li said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, minister of supervision Cao Qingze demanded that
supervisory departments across the country take a serious attitude
towards studying, publicizing, and carrying out the law on
administrative supervision.
</P>
<P>
"Supervisory officials should seriously perform the duties the
law has entrusted them with, and exercise their power in strict
accordance with the law," said Cao, who is also vice-secretary of
the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Today's forum was jointly hosted by the Ministry of
Supervision, the NPC Committee for Internal and Judicial Affairs,
the Commission of Legislative Affairs of the NPC Standing
Committee, and the Bureau of Legislative Affairs of the State
Council, China's cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Meets Hong Kong Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that after Hong Kong's return to the motherland, all
commercial activities conforming to the Basic Law will develop
smoothly and Chinese and foreign invested enterprises will enjoy
equal treatment.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with a delegation from the General Committee of the
Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce led by its Chairman James P
C Tien, Li noted that there are 43 days remaining until Hong Kong
returns to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return is a major historic event that will be
celebrated by people across China and also represents an important
step towards the reunification of the motherland, in accordance
with the great concept of "one country, two systems" put forward
by the late Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the implementation of "one country, two
systems" policy in Hong Kong and maintaining its long-term
prosperity and stability are not only the need of China, but also
of positive significance and far-reaching influence to
safeguarding peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce, as an influential industrial and commercial
organization, should contribute to Hong Kong's steady transition,
smooth transfer of the power, and its long-term development.
</P>
<P>
Li said that all people without prejudice will conclude that
the country will maintain the momentum of development.
</P>
<P>
Both Hong Kong and the inland areas are closely connected
economically. The inland's stability and development benefit Hong
Kong's prosperity and stability. Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability will be beneficial to the inland's development and
stability, and also to exchanges and cooperation between countries
and regions all over the world and China in economy, trade, and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Tien said the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce is a
commercial organization with a long history, which is broadly
representative and with global links.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, he said, a great number of Hong Kong enterprises
have come to invest in the inland with the implementation of the
policy of reform and opening-up to the world.
</P>
<P>
Such development will keep on, he said, adding that all members
of the General Chamber of Commerce will contribute to maintaining
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability after its return to the
motherland.

<HEADLINE> UAE Banks' Capital Continues to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Capital of the banks in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) continued to increase last year due to
an impetus from a booming credit market, according to an official
report obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
The shareholders' equities of the Gulf country's 47
commercial banks grew to 6.34 billion dollars at the end of
1996, compared with 5.88 billion dollars at the end of 1995
and 5.42 billion at the end of 1994, said the report issued
by the UAE'S Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the increase came from 19 national banks,
which raised capital to 5.04 billion dollars at the end of
1996 from around 4.16 billion at the end of 1994, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said the increase was mainly facilitated by a surge in
the credit market which boomed over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Figures by the central bank showed credits provided by the
47 banks grew to around 25.9 billion dollars by the end of
1996 from 24.9 billion at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The surge came following an upturn in trade and construction
activities due to higher government expenditures and stronger
private participation.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said high credits has allowed most UAE banks to
make record earnings in 1996, with the net profits of 15
out of the 19 national banks in 1996 peaking at 623 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
They said that the capital increases are expected to
continue this year because many banks had raised more money
and others are following suit to maintain their share of the
credit market in line with the introduction of new lending
rules by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
This would obviously promote the UAE banks to further boost
their financial resources so that they can obtain more
opportunities to provide loans.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Signs 750 Million Dollars Deal With US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- To further expand investment and
utilization of its natural resources, Qatar has signed with a
U.S. petroleum company an agreement to set up a 750-million-dollar
petrochemical complex.
</P>
<P>
The deal was singed by the Qatar General Petroleum Corp
and U.S.-based Phillips Petroleum Co. in Doha on Sunday. The Qatar
General Petroleum Corp will hold 51 percent and Phillips 49
percent of the equities in the joint venture, Khaleej Times,
a UAE newspaper, reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to produce 500,000 tonnes of
ethylene and 467,000 tonnes of polyethylene a year, including
high-density polyethylene and low-density polyethylene, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The project, which is expected to go on stream in 2000,
will also include a Hexene-1 plant with an annual capacity of
50,000 tonnes. Products by the complex will be sold to
consumers in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is regarded as another step to enhance the
policy pursued by Qatar to expand investment and utilization of
its natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The new complex is the gas-rich state's third petrochemical
complex to cash in on its massive gas reserves -- the third
largest in the world after those in Russia and Iran.

The Great Mekong Subregion, which covers China's Yunnan
province, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, is
becoming a new economic growth area in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
To harness the region's full potential for development, the ADB
has begun to identify, design and finance some projects for the
area since 1992. In the past few years, it has provided 318
million U.S. dollars in both technical assistance and loans.
</P>
<P>
However, the cost of the identified priority projects far
exceeds what the six countries (which the Mekong River traverses)
and the bank can contribute in the near future, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, critical private sector financing must be sought to
fund these projects, he said, adding that the private sector was a
huge pool of capital while the governments and donor agencies have
limited funds.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, Lee said, the bank has held a series of
private sector seminars to inform private financial institutions
and investors of the opportunities in the Great Mekong Subregion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank is also studying various options for
absorbing public and private capital, encouraging policy and
regulatory reforms to promote public-private sector cooperation
and redesigning some of the projects to attract the participation
by private investors.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Needs 440 Million Dollars a Year for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria needs about 440 million U.S.
Dollars a year for basic urban services to keep up with future
population growth.
</P>
<P>
This is the conclusion of a series of workshops held between
May 5 and May 14 in Lagos and four other Nigerian cities, with
the attendance of experts from both the World Bank and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Experts say Nigeria's urban population now stands at 45
million and has been growing at 5.5 percent a year since 1980.
</P>
<P>
From 1989 to 1995, the World Bank has lent 878 million Dollars
to infrastructure projects in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nontheless, experts found out that "all types of
infrastructure in Nigeria suffer from massive backlogs of
neglected rehabilitation and maintenance, not to speak of the
investment needed for future growth".
</P>
<P>
Experts identified three options for Nigeria to mobilize the
huge resources needed for infrastructure, including the
concentrating of public funds on projects with high social and
economic impact, encouraging the participation of private sector
as well as non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, experts recommended the selling-off of
loss-making public enterprises, creating a better environment for
private investment and establishing more predictable revenue
flows to states and local governments.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Crown Prince Leaves for Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan left
here today on a 2-day working visit to Italy to further bilateral
rolations under the framework of a Euro-Jordanian partnership in
the domain of security, economy and culture, Radio Jordan
reported.
</P>
<P>
Hassan will first meet with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
on bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
After this, the crown prince is expected to visit the Italian
Center for High Defense Studies and the NATO's College of Defense.
</P>
<P>
At the center, he will give a lecture on Jordan and the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the center is expected to sign a memorandum of
cooperation with Jordan's Institute of Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Hassan is accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister for Development
Affairs and Prime Ministry Affairs Jawas Anani and Minister of
Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a culture agreement with Italy in January this
year.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1996, Italian exports to Jordan increased from
160 million U.S. dollars to more than 250 million dollars and the
Jordanian exports to Italy also increased by 5 times. Meanwhile,
Italy is the sixth largest source of official foreign bilateral
assistance to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, now eager to establish a partnership with the European
Union and join the World Trade Organization, has intensified its
diplomacy in Europe.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, King Hussein and Hassan paid
separate visits to some European countries.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe says Zairean Situation Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said the Zairean situation had improved considerably when meeting
with former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke in Harare today.
</P>
<P>
Hawke, who is on a visit to cement relations between Australia
and Zimbabwe, paid a courtesy call on Mugabe to renew their
acquaintances and relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Really I think it's for the better for Mobutu. For over three
decades he has done absolutely nothing to develop that country
other than amass wealth for himself."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, however, expressed hope that the southern African
region should now use its influence on new Zairean leader
Laurent-Desire Kabila to ensure peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe praised South African President Nelson Mandela, who
begins a three-day state visit here today for his role, in trying
to bring about a peaceful negotiated settlement to Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the former Australian premier's visit had come at
a time when the southern African region has gone through crucial
economic and political changes.
</P>
<P>
He said he could not forget steps taken by Hawke during his
tenure and Brian Mulroney of Canada in the peaceful negotiations
and attempts at ending apartheid in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Hawke told reporters that he maintained a very close
relationship with Mugabe since his tenure of office as Australian
Premier from 1983 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
He said he had reminisced about their days in the Commonwealth
when they worked very closely together in bringing an end to
apartheid rule in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Hawke said they had discussed developments in the region,
especially Zaire, which he said Mugabe was very optimistic about
the future.
</P>
<P>
He said relations between Australia and Zimbabwe were
excellent although there was room for improvement in the area of
trade.
</P>
<P>
Hawke said he was also in Zimbabwe with some Australian
friends to prepare for the opening of a Shona Sculpture Gallery
in Melbourne later this year.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Guerrilla Launches Suicide Attack on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese Muslim guerrilla carried
out earlier this morning an apparent suicide attack on an Israeli
gunboat in the water opposite the south Lebanese port city of Sour
80 kilometers south of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian Amal Movement, which is headed by Lebanese
House Speaker Nabih Berri, claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, the moderate Shiite Muslim
organization said that one of its members launched around 5:00
a.m. (0200 GMT) an "operation of martyrdom targeting an Israeli
gunboat cruising in the water between Qleili to the north and the
Naqoura to the south."
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla "driving a small boat fully loaded with
explosives managed to approach the Israeli gunboat and blasted
himself, badly damaging the gunboat and killing and wounding all
the crew staff," the Amal statement added.
</P>
<P>
Radio Israel quoted an naval force spokesman as saying that
the Israeli maritime military foiled an attempt of bombing one of
its gunboats in the Mediterranean water some three kilometers
north of the Naqoura coast earlier this morning.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Israeli gunboat opened fire at a
small fishing boat loadful of explosives and driven by a Lebanese
resistance fighter, killing the militant and sinking the boat.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), the
U.N. peacekeeping force operating in south Lebanon, said that an
Israeli gunboat fired machineguns at a Lebanese boat in the water
south of Qleili.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the boat exploded in the gun fire, and
the only person aboard was killed.
</P>
<P>
Following the operation, Israeli forces imposed strict
blockade around the south Lebanese water and prevented any
Lebanese fishing boats from leaving their docks.
</P>
<P>
High tensions have shrouded south Lebanon, the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict, since the weekend,
after a series of clashes between Israeli occupation forces and
their client South Lebanese Army militia on the one side and
Lebanese guerrillas on the other.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also launched three air raids at suspected
guerrilla targets in south Lebanon and the Syrian-controlled
Western Beqaa in the last four days.
</P>
<P>
Nine Israeli soldiers were killed and more than 40 others
wounded in exchanges of fire with guerrillas in south Lebanon
since this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets ROK Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China hopes its relations with the
Republic of Korea (ROK) will continue to develop, Chinese Premier
Li Peng told visiting ROK Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha here today.
</P>
<P>
Extending welcome to Yoo Chong-ha who is making his first visit
to China as ROK Foreign Minister, Li said that this year is the
fifth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see that since the diplomatic relations were
established, both countries have, continuously, stuck to all
principles set when we forged the ties, and developed friendly
cooperation in various fields on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit," Li said.
</P>
<P>
This has served to advance a healthy bilateral relationship
along a good-neighborly and cooperative track, Li added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Yoo Chong-ha said bilateral relations have
scored remarkable progress in the past five years and the ROK
hopes to push the good-neighborly cooperative relations to a new
height in the wake of the fifth anniversary of the establishment
of the diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated China as its government will soon resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and expressed thanks for
being invited to attend the forthcoming power handover ceremony in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On the Korean Peninsular situation, Li Peng said China, as a
close neighbor, is concerned about the developments and changes on
the peninsular and hopes that peace and stability will be
maintained there.
</P>
<P>
Li noted China has always held that the north and south of the
peninsular will solve their problems through dialogue and China is
willing to continue to play a constructive role in keeping peace
and stability in the region.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indian Congress Party's Organizational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Congress Party's
organizational elections have run into serious trouble with
various Indian state units being riven with factional differences.
</P>
<P>
Demands are being made for Sonia Gandhi, widow of India's
former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, to become active in the
organization and take over the leadership.
</P>
<P>
The alleged manipulation in Congress organizational elections
in some state units appears to be boomeranging with Punjab Pradesh
Congress President Santokh Singh Randhawa quitting Sunday and
several prominent leaders from different state units hitting back
at the party leadership accusing partisan conduct of polls.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Election Commission's direction, all
political parties in the country should complete their
organizational elections by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party is one of the two parties asking for 15 days
more to complete its organizational election. The Congress Party
had time and again extended its election time due to differences
within the party.
</P>
<P>
Punjab Pradesh Congress chief Santokh Singh at a press
conference Sunday alleged bogus voting in over 10,000 primary
units and he appealed to Sonia Gandhi to take over party
leadership.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had brought this to the notice of party
President Sitaram Kesri and party General Secretary Nabi Azad, but
they had paid no heed to this "genuine grievance".
</P>
<P>
Even Kesri's home state Bihar appeared to be in crisis with two
known Kesri-baiters, Jagannath Mishra and S.S. Ahluwalia, asking
Kesri to immediately intervene in the polls because serious
irregularities were being committed. One million bogus members had
been enrolled after March 8, the last date for filing membership
form and fee.
</P>
<P>
In the background of the party differences, Sonia was gradually
becoming the focal point of all the "aggrieved" Congressmen.
</P>
<P>
While Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh and West
Bengal Youth Congress President Mamata Banerjee met with Sonia
last week and urged her to save the party by taking "active
participation" in the party's organizational affairs.
</P>
<P>
Another party senior leader A.R. Antulay categorically said
that he would withdraw from the contest if Sonia Gandhi became the
party president.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission has reset the deadline for
organizational elections for June 15. Elections for the Congress
president are slated for June 9.
</P>
<P>
As soon as Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991, the party had
asked Sonia to become its president, but she declined.
</P>
<P>
Since then she has spurned several offers and preferred to be
away from active politics. Her recent enrollment as the Congress
Party's primary member has inspired the rank and file of the
party, whose image has been seriously damaged due to corruption of
party officials and failure in the general election held in
April-May last year.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Leaves for Germany on Official Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
left here today for a visit to Germany to promote bilateral ties
and seek Bonn's counsel on breaking the Mideast peace deadlock,
the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, accompanied by a high-powered delegation including
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, is expected, during his two-day
visit, to hold talks with German President Roman Herzog and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl on means of rejuvenating the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Cairo-Bonn relations at the ministerial level are strong,
according to Egyptian ambassador to Germany, Mahmoud Mubarak,
referring to four meetings in six months between Moussa and his
German counterpart Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
However, reported misunderstanding arose between the two
countries because of the recent German abstention on a U.N. vote
on a draft resolution denouncing Israel's construction of a
settlement in Arab Jerusalem early this year.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, during his visit to Egypt early this month, cleared the
atmosphere by elaborating on the motives for the abstention and
emphasizing Germany's opposition to Israeli settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
In addition to talks on the peace process, the two sides will
also discuss means of boosting bilateral economic ties and
Egypt's bid for associateship with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been working for a partnership with the EU, but
disputes over its agricultural exports to Germany, Spain and
Italy have obstructed the deal.
</P>
<P>
Germany ranks the second after the U.S. in terms of Egyptian
imports, and Germans make up 11 percent of the total tourists
visiting Egypt every year.
</P>
<P>
Germany has contributed to the establishment of a plant to
manufacture buses and another to make Mercedes and BMWs, in
addition to their enormous investments in such areas as power,
oil and pharmaceutical industries.
</P>
<P>
It is the second largest donor country to Egypt, with an
annual contribution of nearly 200 million Deutsche Marks (more
than 118 million U.S. dollars), including 180 million Deutsche
Marks (about 106 million dollars) for development and 20 million
Deutsche Marks (11.7 million dollars) for technical cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Vice-President Arrives in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice-President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam arrived in Kuwait today on a Gulf tour which
has already taken him to Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara,
Khaddam is here to convey a letter to Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah from Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, a local
radio report said.
</P>
<P>
The letter is believed to deal with the deadlocked Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam is also scheduled to meet the Kuwaiti amir and Acting
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed
al-Jaber al-Sabah on the peace process which has been suspended
since Israel started the construction of a Jewish settlement in
its occupied East Jerusalem in March, in defiance of strong Arab
opposition and wide international criticism.
</P>
<P>
Syria is in a drive to drum up support for the Arab parties
in the peace process against the Israeli policy. As part of the
drive, Khaddam and Shara were in Qatar and Saudi Arabia Sunday
for similar talks.
</P>
<P>
In the Qatari capital of Doha, the Syrian official asked the
oil-rich Gulf state to delay its hosting the fourth Middle East
and North African economic conference, originally scheduled in
Doha in November.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Diamond Giant Re-opens Buying Office in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's biggest
diamond manufacturer De Beers's Central Selling Organization
(CSO) has re-opened its diamond buying office in Zaire, De Beers
announced today.
</P>
<P>
De Beers does not yet mine diamonds in Zaire, but the CSO has
marketed one-third of the country's production.
</P>
<P>
"We are asked to open the office in Mbuji-Mayi about two weeks
ago," spokesman Tom Tweedy said.
</P>
<P>
The move signals an apparent change of approach to the CSO by
Zaire's self-proclaimed President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's top aid Mwana Nanga Mawampanga said last month in
Lubumbashi, the second largest city in Zaire, that he was not
happy with De Beers' monopoly position in the diamond industry
and planned to renegotiate contracts with international mining
companies.
</P>
<P>
"We are relieved the situation in Zaire has come to a peaceful
end...We very much want to be a part of the country's future and
are anxious to establish formal cooperation as we had before,"
Tweedy said.
</P>
<P>
"The nature of Zairean production makes us confident that the
logic of the world diamond marketing situation will prevail, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Zaire produces six percent of world diamond output by value.
According to industry sources, Zaire's total official diamond
production is worth around 450 million U.S. Dollars a year.

<HEADLINE> Tree-Planting Helps South China City's Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A decade of afforestation is
reported to have contributed a great deal to the economic growth
of Jiangmen, in south China's Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
Jiangmen is the ancestral home of many overseas Chinese and was
recently listed as one of the top ten cities in China in terms of
economic and social development. This attributed in large part to
the city's tree-planting efforts which begun in 1985, according to
Gu Rixin, the city's party secretary.
</P>
<P>
"Afforestation helps control soil erosion and thus helps
agricultural production. In 1994, although the region was hit by
consecutive days of torrential rains, there was still a good
harvest because the forest greatly reduced the effects of the
floods," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said the afforestation has also helped clean the Tanjiang
River near Jiangmen. According to the Guangdong provincial
environmental protection departments, the Tanjiang River is one of
the cleanest rivers in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
"Without the good environment created largely by the
afforestation efforts, the overall economy in Jiangmen would not
have developed so fast, and local residents' standard of living
would be significantly affected," Gu said.
</P>
<P>
At present 85 percent of the land around Jiangmen has been
planted and the tree-coverage rate in the region has reached 43
percent, much higher than the national average.

compliance with rules of good neighborliness and to refrain from
military operations in Iraq, the Yemen News Agency reported today.

<P>
It quoted a Yemeni official source who asked not to be named as
saying that Yemen called on Turkey to resolve problems by
refraining from military escalation and direct coordination with
Iraq so that the interests of all the parties concerned can be
ensured.
</P>
<P>
Yemen was following with great concern the military activities
being carried out by Turkey in northern Iraq, the source said
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish move threatened the Iraqi territorial integrity and
caused great harm to property and lives of the Iraqi people, added
the source.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the source as saying that his country
reaffirms its rejection to the resort to force. And
Yemen hopes the Turkish government will end its military
activities in northern Iraq immediately, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops have entered northern Iraq since last Wednesday
to attack what Turkey called elements of Turkey's separatists of
the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).

<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The second East Asian Games was concluded
here on Monday with success as the athletes and officials from nine
participating countries and regions bade farewell with smiles in face.
</P>
<P>
South Korean prime minister Koh Kun declared the closing of the
East Asian Games this evening at the Kudok Stadium.
</P>
<P>
"The citizens of Pusan and all Koreans sincerely hope that the
second East Asian Games have promoted the Olympic movement, and will
help East Asia reinforce peace and unity," said Kim Un-yong, president
of the organizing committee of the second East Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that "the energy you have expended and the sweat that you
have shed here in Pusan will not fade away from our memory, and
friendship which have been forged in competition will also remain
forever in our memory."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the Olympic spirit which has built a brighter and
healthier life must be spread further to build a better and more
peaceful world," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
The host took the last gold medal in the soccer tournament for a
total of 45 gold medals to rank third behind China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
China retained its top spot with 62 golds against 47 for Japan,
while Kazakhstan who made its debut in the games, garnered 24 titles
from a bonanza of 187 events in 13 sports at the 10-day sports gala.
</P>
<P>
"The East Asian Games featured first-class tough competitions in
Asia, and our Chinese athletes had exploited the great opportunity to
whet their weapons for future international sports meets with the
Bangkok Asian Games and the Sydney Olympic Games in particular," said
Wu Shaozhang, chef de mission of the Chinese delegation.
</P>
<P>
Okai Yoshiro, chef de mission of the Japanese squad, said "we had
surpassed our goals of gold medals in both swimming and athletics
competitions and we extend our sincere gratitude to the organizing
committee, the Korean Olympic Committee and all the cooperative Pusan
citizens."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese swimmers boasted of the lion's share of 21 out of 31
gold medals from the swimming finals while their athletes took home 16
out of 43 golds from the track and field competitions.
</P>
<P>
Choi Hyun-yol, chef de mission of the South Korean delegation,
explained that the hosts failed to overtake Japan for the second
over-all place in the gold tally "because China did not send in
first-class swimmers in the games."
</P>
<P>
South Korea ranked third by a slim margin of two golds against
Japan that will play the host of the third edition in Osaka in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Chinese man gymnast Zhang Jinjing, individual fourth-placer in
Atlanta Olympic Games, became one of two quadruple champions at the

at the games who won two team finals apart from the men's 100m and
200m butterfly.

The Japanese also set the Asian record of 1:58.01 in the men's 200
meter butterfly, the lone record in the swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
Five world records were overwritten by four Chinese strongwomen of
Song Zhaomei, Yu Wenyu, Jiang Yinsu, Zou Feie and Chinese strongman
Wang Guohua.

LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic Committee
(IOC) will introduce this year a test for testosterone,
International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) spokesman Giorgio
Reineri said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new test will detect if a female athlete has taken the male
sex hormone testosterone.
</P>
<P>
At present athletes are suspended if their urine sample shows
an excessively high ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone. But
the current method does not show if the testosterone has been
introduced artificially.
</P>
<P>
Reineri added that the new test would show definitely if an
athlete had taken testosterone.
</P>
<P>
Reineri said the test could be ready in time for the World
Athletics Championships in Athens in August.

According to the amendments to the 1993 Press and Publication

of the papers tried to disrupt the national fabric and harm
Jordan's relations with Arab countries."
</P>
<P>
"We found ourselves committed to saving the country's
national fabric and (then) took the decision," the minister
added in the interview.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the board of the Jordan Press Association submitted
a resignation Sunday in protest of the amendments, saying that
they were brought into force by a temporary law in spite of the
existence of a Lower House still in office and "the spirit of the
law will abolish all press freedoms for journalists."
</P>
<P>
The amendments, the third temporary law introduced under the
currant government of Abdul Salam Majali, not only raise the
fines on violators, but give the court the right to suspend
publication of any paper found in violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
The law is largely understood to target the weekly tabloids,
which have long raised the ire of the government and some
segments of the society by their sensational and often
misleading reporting.
</P>
<P>
The amendments demand that weekly newspapers raise their
capital from about 21,186 dollars to 423,729 dollars and that
the dailies raise theirs from some 70,621 dollars to 847,458
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Justifying the capital requirements, Mutawi said in the
interview that "we heard that some papers have not paid their
staffs for months."
</P>
<P>
Editors of 12 weeklies expressed strong rejection of the
revised law, appealing to parliament, now in recess, to reject
the law and work for its cancellation.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Weekly Press Committee was prepared to file a
case at the higher Court of Justice if the government does not
act constitutionally on the issue, according to NBidal Mansour,
chief editor of Al Hadath (The Event) Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Now the government controls two of the three most important
Arabic dailies and the only English daily Jordan Times through
holding shares in concerned equity companies.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Clear Away Billboards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the largest industrial
and commercial center in China, will clear away some advertisement
boards that have gone uncontrolled on some major streets.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Municipal People's Congress said that it would
formulate regulations and laws to handle advertising boards that
are erected along sidewalks, as they have been in the way of
pedestrians, posed potential threats to traffic safety, and caused
"visual pollution,"
</P>
<P>
The miscellaneous boards have mainly been erected by government
departments which used their power to set up ad companies to make
money. Meanwhile, some enterprises have also been forced to
advertisement on streets, burdened with extra expenses.
</P>
<P>
So far, 26 lawmakers in the municipality have suggested the
local Administration for Industry and Commerce manage the ad
boards, and urged the municipal People's Congress to pass laws to
deal with the problem.

PARIS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The troops of Laurent-Desire Kabila, many of whom are
Rwandans, entered Kinshasa on Saturday without meeting any
resistance. They publicly executed about 100 men and took prisoner
thousands of government troops and suspects. South Africa has sent
its vice president to Zaire to verify the promises for democracy
made by Kabila, and France simply urged the organization of
elections.
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac achieved his visit in China by
diving last weekend into the vibrating urban atmosphere of
Shanghai, a city radically transformed by a few years of
modernization with hasty steps and reviving to its old status
which was equal to Paris, New York, or Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The troops of Laurent-Desire Kabila complete on Sunday the
job of putting Kinshasa under their total control after the
soldiers of Mobutu laid down their arms without any
fight. According to the Red Cross, 200 people, mostly soldiers and
looters, were killed during the weekend, most often as a result of
settling personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
-- Five public opinion polls published last Saturday showed
that the French center-right alliance and the leftist parties will
run shoulder to shoulder in the first round of legislative
elections. The polls, conducted by five different polling
institutions, showed that the center-right will win from 39
percent to 40.5 percent of the votes, while the left will win from
37.5 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
But all of them predicted that the center-right will finally
win from 40 to 130 more seats than the left after the second round
of the voting.

<HEADLINE> Chinese and French companies to jointly produce corn products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-French joint venture is
set to process 300,000 tons of corn annually when its first-phase
project is completed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A foundation laying ceremony was held recently in Songyuan city
in northeast China's Jilin Province to mark the beginning of the
construction of the project, which is jointly funded by Chinese
Jifa Group Company and French Eridania Beghin-Say S.A.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase project, requiring an investment of more than
1.4 billion yuan, will mainly produce glucose and maltose. It is
expected to yield a sales income of 1.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Jilin is a major grain production base in China, turning out
annually some 1.5 million tons of corn. The joint effort is
expected to ease the province's difficulty in grain sales,
transportation, and storage.
</P>
<P>
Jifa Group Company, the largest corn processor in Asia, has
total assets worth four billion yuan and is capable of processing
600,000 tons of corn annually. Ericania Beghin-Say S.A. is the

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Becomes China's Major Power Supplier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 19 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region has developed a total power generating capacity
of 6.2 million kw and is one of the country's largest power
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the region has become a major power supplier for
China's Northeast Power Grid, the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Power
Grid, and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
According to a local source, Inner Mongolia started supplying
power to Beijing in 1990. And by 1995, it had provided for Beijing
an annual power supply totaling 6.48 billion kwh, accounting for
one fourth of Beijing's total power consumption.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia now ranks first in the country in terms of
average per capita electricity output and the amount of power
supply to other localities.
</P>
<P>
The local source said that the region has rich resources for
developing its power industry, for it has five extra-large coal fields
with reserves totaling more than 100 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
Since the autonomous region practised systematic power reform
and pooled funds for power construction in 1986, the region's
power sector has been developing steadily. A large number of power
projects have been built since then.
</P>
<P>
The local source expects that by the year 2000, the region's
total installed power generating capacity and electricity output
will hit 15 million kw and 54.6 billion kwh respectively.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Region Getting More Migrant Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A phenomenon similar to that of the
building sites of Beijing or south China's booming areas where
waves of migrant workers come looking for jobs is taking place in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region where an
increasing number of migrant farmers are looking for work -- but
in the cotton fields.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of surplus labor from inland rural areas
are coming to Xinjiang during the region's cotton harvest
time. Some of the cotton pickers come in the fall and go back in
early spring, while others stay on as caretakers in cotton fields.
</P>
<P>
"Picking cotton or even growing cotton in Xinjiang is our best
choice," said 23-year-old Yang Kunlun, a migrant farmer from
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Yang and his wife went to Bachu County in the Tarim Basin in
southern Xinjiang last September and earned more than 4,000 yuan
picking cotton all autumn. The money was equal to Yang's entire
income for five years back home.
</P>
<P>
The couple took over the job of managing a four-ha plot of
cotton in February. According to their contract, the employer will
pay them 7,200 yuan by the end of August when the cotton picking
begins.
</P>
<P>
Some earlier arrivals are even more ambitious and have made
enough money and gained enough experience picking up cotton over
the past few years that they have begun to grow cotton all by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, Yu Bishuang and his wife came to Shache,
China's largest cotton producing county, also in the Tarim Basin,
where he worked at a brick kiln for four years. He planted about
two-thirds of a hectare of cotton on a contract deal in 1995, but
he didn't make any money because of his ignorance about cotton
growing.
</P>
<P>
But, practice makes perfect, and Yu got a contract on two ha of
land last year, and to his astonishment, made a profit of more
than 30,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"We've decided to expand our growing area bit by bit. If no
more land is available in this township, we will go to another
place," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is rich in land resources with a high degree of
mechanization of agriculture, and local township or village
officials are keen on teaching farmers how to grow cotton, his
wife explained.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region is China's largest cotton producer,
accounting for a quarter of the national output, and its cotton
production has become a major contributor to local economic
development and has lined farmers' pockets.
</P>
<P>
"Migrant farmers have made a great contribution to our cotton
growth. It's no easy job for them to leave their hometowns and
work with us," notes Ahmad Shamushak, head of Kalatale Township in
Aksu city in the western part of Xinjiang.

<HEADLINE> Report: Blacks, Hispanics Finish College at Lower Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A report by the American Council
on Education said blacks and whites aged between 25 and 29 had
almost the same rate of high school completion, about 87 percent,
in 1995. In the younger age group, 18 to 24, the gap was wider.
</P>
<P>
The report released Sunday said the gap may have closed because
of the greater number of black people finishing high school
requirements later in life through equivalency examinations. Ten
years earlier, blacks had an 81 percent graduation rate, compared
with 87 percent for whites.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the council's analysis of census data of 1995
showed that blacks and Hispanics finish college at a far lower
rate than whites, and the rate of enrollment increases is slowing.
</P>
<P>
Hispanics also fell behind whites and blacks in finishing high
school, with a rate of 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
The council, an umbrella group for colleges, universities and
educational associations, included the figures in its 15th annual
report on "Minorities in Higher Education."
</P>
<P>
Regarding college attainment, the report said that 26 percent
of whites aged 25 to 29 had finished at least four years of
college in 1995. For blacks, the rate was 15 percent. The
percentages were the highest recorded for both groups since
1975. The rate of almost 9 percent for Hispanics was lower than in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The report noted the lack of even a fifth-grade education in
1990 for large numbers of some groups.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Investment Area to Be Launched Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Investment Area
(AIA) is expected to be launched towards the end of next year to
facilitate investments into the ASEAN region under the ASEAN Free
Trade Area (AFTA), according to Malaysian Deputy Minister of
International Trade and Industry Kerk Choo Ting.
</P>
<P>
The AIA is aimed at enabling free flow of capital among ASEAN
member countries and facilitating access to technology and skilled
personnel and professionals in ASEAN besides calling for a larger
ASEAN private sector role in matters relating to investment
activities, Kerk said at a seminar on "The AFTA Challenge: Getting
SMIs Ready" in Shah Alam near here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the AIA would cover aspects relating to investment
promotion, facilitation and liberalization.
</P>
<P>
It has been agreed that ASEAN would undertake a coordinated
effort in promoting ASEAN as a regional investment location,
emphasizing the benefits to be gained by investors who take a
regional approach in investing in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the pursuit of a free and open investment regime, member
countries -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam -- would consider opening all
industries to ASEAN investors as well as to investors from outside
the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian official said the AIA, which would pursue a
liberalization approach, is likely to be less structured,
emphasizing unilateral actions by member countries and covering
both investments in the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing
sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme's
"Fast Track Program", existing tariffs above 20 percent would be
reduced to 0-5 percent by January 1, 2000, and those at 20 percent
and below, would be reduced to 0-5 percent by January 1, next
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the "Normal Track Program," tariffs above 20 percent
would be reduced in two stages: First, to 20 percent by January 1,
next year and subsequently to 0-5 percent by January 1, 2003; And
at the second stage, tariffs of 20 percent and below will be
reduced to 0-5 percent by January 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
In terms of intra-ASEAN trade value, the sectors which would
have an average ASEAN tariff of 0-5 percent by the year 2000 are
the machinery and electrical appliances, mineral products, base
metals and metal articles, textile and apparel and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors which would have an average ASEAN tariff of 0-5
percent by the year 2000 are plastics, pulp and paper, cement and
ceramics, gems, optical and musical instruments, antiques and
works of art, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Sectors with an average ASEAN tariff of above 5.0 percent are
prepared foodstuffs, wood, footwear, arms, and miscellaneous
articles," he added.
</P>
<P>
To assist the Small Medium Industries (SMIs) to prepare
themselves for the AFTA, the ASEAN Industrial Cooperation (AICO)
scheme was created in April last year and came into effect
November 1, last year, where cooperative efforts were being
undertaken in services, intellectual property rights, investment
and industrial cooperation, with tremendous response from the
member countries, Kerk said.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, aimed at promoting joint-manufacturing activities
between ASEAN-based companies, eliminates or reduces intra-ASEAN
tariffs by granting to qualified participating companies
immediately, zero or up to a maximum of 5.0 percent CEPT tariffs
for imports of approved AICO products, instead of the prevailing
CEPT rates which would reach the final range of 0-5 percent by the
year 2003.

<P>
FUZHOU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan has invested 850 million US
dollars in real terms in Zhangzhou city in its neighboring Fujian
province, forming the largest source of investment to the city.
</P>
<P>
The total investment coming through Taiwan almost equals to the

<HEADLINE> Israel Not to Escalate Lebanon's clashes: Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai indicated Sunday night that Israel has no intention to
escalate the tensions in south Lebanon, reported the state-run
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the remarks after vising a soldier wounded
during last Thursday's clashes north of the Israeli self-styled
security zone.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai declared that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had
not defined the Lebanese government standing army as enemy. He
was referring to an allegation that the gunmen of the Lebanese
guerrilla group were aided by Lebanese troops during the
fighting, in which three Israeli soldiers were killed and seven
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
However, Mordechai warned that the IDF will continue to
return fire on anyone who shoots at its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the head of the IDF Northern Command,
Maj.-Gen. Amiram Levine, said that it was the Lebanese army, not
Hezbollah, who fired anti-aircraft missiles at Israeli
helicopters during the fighting. He added that the Hezbollah
gunmen only had fired mortars and machine guns.
</P>
<P>
Levine told reporters that the IDF will continue to initiate
operations in north of the Israeli occupied "security zone,"
wherever and whenever necessary.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that all those who tried to hit the IDF would
themselves be hit, including the Lebanese Army.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, The Israel Air Force warplanes blasted Hezbollah
targets in southern parts of Lebanon's Bekaa Valley for the
third day running following Thursday's clashes.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Copper Reserves Rank Fifth in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's copper reserves rank fifth
in the world while its current production ranks seventh among all
the 11 world biggest copper producers, the Post newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Clive Newall, Director of a mining prospecting company in the
country, was quoted as saying that Zambia's production of
minerals has dropped due to lack of re-investment in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Investment environment in mining sector has become competitive
especially with favorable corporate tax and additional incentives
such as the zero rating of copper and cobalt sales for value
added tax purposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Newall said, however, the mining sector has started recording
positive strides following increased mineral prospecting
expenditure.

<HEADLINE> US Official: Oslo Peace Agreement Broken Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior United States official
has said that the 1993 peace deal reached at Oslo of Norway
between the PLO and Israel's former government has foundered.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a U.S.-Israeli Chamber of Commerce meeting late
Sunday night, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk said that
"the core bargain of Oslo, (according to which) Israel was
promised security and the Palestinians were promised
self-government, has broken down."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who also attended
the meeting, said in response that trust resides in keeping deals,
while he accused the Palestinians of violating the accords that
Israel observed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. National Security Adviser Samuel Berger brushed
off a Palestinian call for President Bill Clinton to make a
dramatic intervention in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Presidential involvement is happening every day," Berger said
on CNN, the U.S. Cable News Network. "And the parties themselves
have to be prepared to make the kinds of compromises, the kinds of
commitments, that would make a dramatic moment not only dramatic
but successful."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat sent
Clinton a letter Friday, declaring U.S. special envoy Dennis
Ross's latest mission a failure and asking the U.S. head of state
to intervene personally in Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli defense officials said Sunday
that plans to raze hundreds of illegally-built Palestinian homes
in the West Bank were being carried out, and it was not a part of
a new program to prevent Palestinians from creating facts on the
ground ahead of the resumption of final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"There are certainly hundreds of structures, not all of them
built this year, which are in the process of legal proceedings to
be demolished because they are illegally-built," said Shlomo Dror,
spokesman for the coordination of activities in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Israel demolished 140 homes last year and this
year 80 were destructed so far, while, He ruled out the
possibility of destroying another 500 by the end of the year, as
Israel Radio had reported.
</P>
<P>
Dror said the Palestinian homes planned for destruction were
usually considered a security risk since they are near military
bases, bypass roads, or Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
"There are illegal houses throughout the area under our
authority," said Peter Lerner, spokesman for the Israeli Civil
Administration in the West Bank, "but there is no new plan to
demolish 500 houses."
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that there were ongoing plans to demolish
"hundreds" of homes built without authorization and that these
plans were approved regularly by Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
All the homes were in the Israeli-controlled area C, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Arafat presented Ross a list of 1,300 families who
had received demolition orders, and Ross was reportedly surprised
at the size of the list and raised the matter later in his
meeting with Mordechai.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Protection of Cultivated Land (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China says that strict measures
must be taken to implement its basic state policy of "treasuring
and rationally using every inch of land, and earnestly protecting
cultivated land".
</P>
<P>
"Protecting cultivated land is safeguarding our lifeline," it
says in a document published by all the leading newspapers here
today.
</P>
<P>
This comes from a notice issued Sunday by the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee, and the State Council, the country's
highest governing body.
</P>
<P>
Indiscriminative use of cultivated land, illegal approval of
land use, and waste of land resources have been rampant in some
parts of the country over the past several years, the document
points out.
</P>
<P>
"The sharp decrease in cultivated land and loss of land assets
have seriously affected grain production, agricultural
development, the national economy, and social stability." it says.
</P>
<P>
Land management, especially the protection of cultivated land,
has a vital bearing on the whole situation of the country and the
country's generations to come, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, effective measures must be taken to check the trend
of imbalance between increasing population and heavy loss of
cultivated land, the seven-part document added.

<P>
Efforts must be made to intensify macro control of land
management, the notice said, adding that various provinces,
autonomous regions, and municipalities must increase the total
acreage of cultivated land and, at the same time, improve the
fertility of the soil.
</P>
<P>
The decrease and increase in the acreage of cultivated land
must reach a balance point, and to do so, provinces, autonomous
regions, and municipalities must co-ordinate their use of
cultivated land for other purposes with the reclamation of
cultivated land, it said. New land utilization plans must be drawn
up scientifically and old ones revised, and then they must be
strictly applied, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The use of cultivated land for construction projects must be
strictly controlled, and plots of land currently being used for
construction projects and waste land must be more effectively
used, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
While the agricultural structure is being readjusted, land not
under cultivation should be used better. Cultivated land is not to
be taken over for developing forestry, orchards, or fish ponds if
it is not needed for improving environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
Measures should be taken to improve the management of the land
use plans, and the governments all areas should follow the Basic
Farmland Protection Regulations, the notice said.

The management of collectively-owned land in rural areas must
be improved, the notice pointed out. There should be better plans
for village and town construction and for barren mountainsides and
idle land. Arable land that is left over from changes in villages
and townships should be reclaimed, it added.
</P>
<P>
Construction of residential areas in rural areas should follow
village and town construction plans. There is only one plot of
ground allowed for residence per family and the acreage must not
top the stipulated norm. Additional plots should be turned over to
collectives in accordance with the law, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
Cultivated land can not be left idle. Contracts for land rights
are no longer valid if a farmer is no longer engaged in
agricultural production or if he or she fails to carry out the
terms of the contract, it added.
</P>
<P>
There must be a change in funeral and interment practices, and
cremation is considered preferable, it said, adding that villages
in mountainous areas can set up a public cemetery, while those on
the plains can build a crematorium where funerary urns can be kept
in one place.
</P>
<P>
Tombs that occupy cultivated land or wooded areas should be
properly handled with, and efforts should be made to persuade
those families involved to move the tombs or to bury coffins
deeper down, it said.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises should protect and preserve cultivated
land, it added.
</P>
<P>
New materials should also be used for walls so that the
production of clay bricks can be limited, and the construction of
kilns on cultivated land is banned. Brick kilns that occupy
cultivated land must be moved for land reclamation, it said.
</P>
<P>
Except in the case of state requisition, collectively-owned
land use right is not allowed to be sold or used for commercial
development, or to be transferred or leased for non-agriculture
construction, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
Land use right of collectively-owned barren land can not be
auctioned and leased for non-agriculture development.

putting a one-year freeze on the use of cultivated land for
non-agricultural construction projects, and projects that call for
the use of cultivated land will have to get approval from the
State Council, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction for low-income families in urban areas and
state-approved projects can continue to use land in accordance
with the previous regulations, it said.
</P>
<P>
There must be strict controls on the scale of land use in urban
construction, especially in small and medium-sized cities. From
now on there will be a freeze on the practice of upgrading
counties to city status, it added.
</P>
<P>
Urban construction projects should make better use of land
potential by utilizing land that is not cultivated and by
improving land use efficiency, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Changes in city planning must get approval from the proper
authorities, it said, adding that in large cities, the amount of
land used for construction and the population growth must be put
under control by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The power for land management and land use rights can not be
delegated, it stressed.

profit from changing farmland into non-farmland will be turned

land.
</P>
<P>
Government at all levels, and financial and supervisory
departments should monitor and manage gains from land more
carefully to prevent the loss of land assets, it said.
</P>
<P>
The enforcement of land management must be increased, the
document said. Governments should do a thorough check on land that
has been used for construction projects and plots that have been
taken over for residential construction in rural areas since 1991,
it added. This check, which should be completed by the end of
October, should include the following:
</P>
<P>
-- Development zones unauthorized by the State Council or the
provincial government must be stopped and be used for
farming. Development zone projects that have been approved by the
authorities but have not been developed as planned will be subject
to penalties;
</P>
<P>
-- Land taken for commercial real estate projects and golf
courses should be dealt with;
</P>
<P>
-- A thorough check should be made on the transfer, leasing, or
mortgaging of land-use right. Illegal land speculation is to be
strongly penalized; and
</P>
<P>
-- The use of land occupied by township enterprises, villages,
or residential buildings in rural areas should be standardized.

The management of state-owned land assets should be improved,
the notice said. There should be stricter control on the random
transfer of land use right of cultivated land. Land use right of
cultivated or arable land, and of wooded areas is not to be
claimed for developing golf courses, classical-style parks,
recreation centers, luxury villas, or ancestral halls, temples, or
churches, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The sale of state-owned land right is to be done through a
system of public bidding to ensure fair play, the notice said. The
country should use a system that starts with the lowest land price
possible, and the price of state-owned land-use right for auction
should be set through scientific evaluation in accordance with
state policy, it added.
</P>
<P>
The sale of land use right of military zones, or key areas
under state protection or areas of national security, and projects
that involve large tracts of land for overseas investors must get
approval from the State Council, it said. Land-use right for an
entire island can not be sold to foreigners, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The country will also require businesses that have acquired
free land-use right from the state for non-agricultural projects
to pay for those right, it said.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises that have become corporations or have
issued shares must pay for land that was previously appropriated
by the state, after the price of the land has been established, it
said.
</P>
<P>
China will also standardize the practice of transferring land
use right and will penalize the illegal transfer of land by
speculation, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
Land-use right of state-owned land that is bought can not be
transferred if the land has not been developed or used in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the sale agreement, it
said, adding that illegal transfers will be penalized and any
profit made from it will be confiscated. The transfer of
state-owned land use right must be registered, and unregistered
transfers are considered illegal and will be penalized.

"very good" based on his talks with Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who recently concluded a four-day official visit to
China, said in a statement issued here by the Foreign Ministry
today that bilateral ties had considerable prospect of being
strengthened further through more cooperation in air services,
tourism, culture and education, trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
He described his visit as "extremely useful and successful"
during which he also called on Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the objective of his trip was to exchange views
with his counterpart on bilateral relations, get an update on
China's economic reform and explore the possibilities for more
economic and business ties and to promote further ASEAN-China
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries shared the view that it was very
important for China to succeed in its economic modernization.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia welcomed the considerable progress that China
had made in its economic reform and reiterated that such a
development would greatly contribute to peace and stability,
particularly in the region.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said he also renewed his Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's invitation to Li Peng to visit Malaysia while Malaysian
King Tuanku Ja'afar would visit China in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian foreign minister said that the second ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) informal summit would be
held here in December, for which Mahathir, in his capacity as the
chairman of the summit, would be extending the official invitation
to China, Japan and South Korea shortly.
</P>
<P>
In view of ASEAN's 30th anniversary this year, the informal
meeting is also expected to see for the first time the gathering
of the heads of state and government from the seven ASEAN
countries and the grouping's three prospective members --
Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar -- besides China, Japan and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed the summit would be able to provide further
impetus to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and
bring regional cooperation to greater heights.

<HEADLINE> Pacific Basin Economic Council Meeting Opens in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- About 600 local and foreign business
leaders gathered here today for the 30th International General
Meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC), which will
focus on issues reflecting changes in business climate in the
Pacific area.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening plenary session, Philippine President
Fidel Ramos praised the 20-member economic body for being a
pioneer in promoting economic and trade cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also lauded the group for creating a forum for "the active
exchange of views among businessmen to advise their governments
and international agencies on a wide spectrum of economic issues
and concerns affecting the region's development."
</P>
<P>
Ramos expressed the hope that the PBEC, with 30 years of
experience in bringing business and government together, will help
in building a new partnership between business and government for
the common future of the Asia-Pacific community.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the three-day annual meeting is "Pacific In
Transition: Adapting to a Changing Business Environment."
</P>
<P>
High on the meeting's agenda are issues pertinent to free trade
and investment, barriers to open banking and financial services,
relations between technology and business, and implications of
regional security and continued economic development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will give PBEC members a chance to evaluate and
analyze the results of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) leaders meeting in Manila last November and the World Trade
Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting in Geneva last December.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting will be WTO Director General Renato
Ruggiero, Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Hong Kong Chief Secretary Anson Chan.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1967, the PBEC is an association of business leaders
from over 1,200 companies in the Pacific. It aims to expand trade
and investment through open markets and encourage competitiveness
based on the capabilities of the individual companies.
</P>
<P>
The PBEC, the oldest business organization in the Pacific rim,
serves as a forum through which regional business leaders create
new business relationships and address emerging issues in the
Pacific and global economies.
</P>
<P>
The organization, an informal recommendatory body to the APEC,
also serves as a liaison between business leaders and government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Its member economies include Australia, Canada, Chile, China,
Colombia, Fiji, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, the Philippines, Russia,
Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United States and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador was accepted as the 20th PBEC member Sunday by the PBEC
Steering Committee, which usually meets before the international
general meeting and is empowered to endorse membership.

<HEADLINE> Growing of Cash Plants Helps Boost China's Local Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The growing of economic plants in
east China's Zhejiang province last year contributed 15 billion
yuan (some 1.8 billion US dollars) to the province's GDP, helping
four mountainous counties to get rid of poverty.
</P>
<P>
With nearly 60 percent of the population living in hilly areas,
the province is rich in forestry resources. According to Li Zemin,
governor of the province, making full use of the forestry
resources is an important step for the province to boost its
overall economy.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from great afforestation efforts over the years, the
development of bamboo products and other economic plants have
been largely enhanced," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the total bamboo planting area in Zhejiang has
reached 630,000 hectare, yielding 3.5 billion yuan (430 million US
dollars) worth of bamboo products yearly.
</P>
<P>
Last year the total foreign trade volume of forestry
products reached 550 million US dollars, nearly twice that of five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
In Ji'an county where as many as 100,000 farmers are involved
in bamboo planting, bamboo has come to be a pillar of the local
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The total yearly output of the bamboo industry in the county
has reached 1.1 billion yuan (130 million US dollars), earning
15.6 million US dollars in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
"Bamboo has played a main role in changing our county from a
poor one into a well-off one," said Xi Caixiang, head of the county,
"now every year as much as 400 million yuan (nearly 50 million US
dollars) of farmers' income in our county derives from the bamboo
industry."

JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has recognized
Laurent Kabila as the President of "the Democratic Republic of
the Congo", local daily the Citizen quoted Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki as saying today.
</P>
<P>

otherwise known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>

assembly be convened to draft a new constitution within two
months.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he was satisfied that the transitional government

<P>
"It is important during this transitional period that the
people should enjoy democratic rights and democratic freedom.
</P>
<P>
"The approach of the alliance to this question is indeed that.
It is itself an alliance of democratic forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, an active participant in the negotiations that led up
to Kabila's taking power, was the first foreign dignitary to see

<HEADLINE> Singapore Has Highest Number of Bankrupts in Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has the highest number
of bankrupts per million population in the region, despite a
decline in the numbers of new bankrupt cases within the last three
years, the Business Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that since picking up in 1993, the number of
people officially declared broke in the year has been falling,
from 1,413 in 1994 to 1,277 in 1995, to 1,252 last year.
</P>
<P>
Also noted in the report was the fact that changes to the
Bankruptcy Act in 1995 resulted in a big jump in the number of
discharged bankrupts to 1,926, from 554 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, Singapore had 13,696 undischarged
bankrupts, or 4,033 per million population. This compares with
second-ranking Malaysia's 2,877 per million population. Malaysia
had 57,161 bankrupts at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
In terms of new bankrupts, Australia tops the region with
17,324 in 1996, while Malaysia is a distant second with 6,139 new
cases last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the high numbers in Singapore, Malaysia and
Australia reflect the efficiency of the bankruptcy process. They
noted that bankruptcy proceedings in these three countries are
relatively inexpensive, swift and certain.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that an overwhelming number of bankrupts
in Singapore last year were salaried men in their prime of life.
Of the 1,254 new bankrupts in 1996, 88 percent were wage earners,
84 percent were male and 75 percent were aged 30-50.
</P>
<P>
The reasons people get into financial trouble include
overspending on their credit cards, defaulting as guarantors and
failure to pay car loans, the report said.

<HEADLINE> India to Seek More Time to Free Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- India is likely to seek seven to
ten years for freeing imports of certain sensitive items, mainly
agricultural products, at the balance of payments consultations
under the aegis of the World Trade Organization (WTO) scheduled
for early June in Geneva, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
India is due to submit its phase-out schedule this month. The
Commerce Ministry proposal envisages removal of restrictions in
two phases over five years. In the first phase, items allowed for
import under the special import list (SIL) can be made freely
importable and an equal number of restricted items can be moved
onto the SIL list. Dual use items can also be made freely
importable. In the second phase, the items that remain on the SIL
can be made freely importable.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous export-import policy of the country, the
restricted list consists of 2,500-2,800 items. While 59 items are
prohibited, roughly 650 are on the SIL list and 178 are canalized
items. On the basis of the harmonized code, it has been calculated
that around 70-72 percent of the items are either freely
importable or can be imported under SIL list. Almost 7,000 items
are on the free list.
</P>
<P>
India's major trading partners have been demanding that India
phase out all restrictions within two years.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Slams Government Over Local Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition accused
the government of failing to maintain security and order during
the first phase of local elections held in West Nepal on Saturday,
the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress (NC) party in a statement Sunday even
alleged that the government resorted to "state terrorism" to give
a ruling coalition partner an advantage in the elections, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Security personnel and election officers were mute observers in
almost all the cases when activists of different political parties
clashed each other at polling stations, the NC party claimed.
</P>
<P>
Most election-related incidents taking place Saturday were
between workers of the NC and the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), according to election officials.
</P>
<P>
The local elections at West Nepal's 146 villages and over 10
municipal wards have been postponed due to these clashes, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that two persons were killed Sunday in
separate incidents in two mid-western districts when police opened
fire to control unruly crowds who demanded early vote-counting or
started to loot ballot boxes.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of Saturday's local elections showed a
marginal lead by the opposition NC party while much of the ballots
were yet to be counted, newspapers here said.
</P>
<P>
The election results are expected to be officially announced
early next month after the second phase polls in Central and East
Nepal on May 26.
</P>
<P>
The NC party, which currently controls some two-thirds of all
the local administrations in the country, would likely lose
considerable shares to the CPN-UML, the biggest partner of Prime
Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand's three-party coalition, during
the on-going local elections, analysts here said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China has seen a fast growth in its
production of fiber-optic products and optical cable over the past
decade following a wide application and popularity of fiber-optic
telecommunications technology in the country.
</P>
<P>
The country made 600,000 km of fiber-optic products in 1996, meeting
only 60 percent its domestic market demands, and produced 400,000
km of optical cable in the same year, fully meeting domestic
market demands.
</P>
<P>
It has also exported 400,000 km of fiber-optic products since
1992 when Changfei Fiber-Optic, Optical Cable Co. Ltd based in
Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, and the United
States signed China's first contract for overseas marketing of
fiber-optic products.
</P>
<P>
Changfei Company is China's biggest professional fiber-optic
and optical cable manufacturer. It is jointly funded by the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Wuhan City Government,
and the Philips Company of the Netherlands at a cost of 500 million
yuan in 1988, with the Chinese side controlling 62.5 percent of the
stake.

<P>
A solemn ceremony was held for the advance party at 11:00

<HEADLINE> Drug Suspect Wants Quick Extradition to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Alleged drug kingpin Li Yun-chung,
who was arrested in Myanmar and sent back to Thailand last
Saturday, has requested quick passage to the United States to face
drug trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
Li, who had been arrested in Thailand last July and jumped bail
in February, fears that if he was sent back to prison, his life
would be in danger.
</P>
<P>
A federal court in New York indicted Li on charges of
masterminding the shipment of 486 kilograms of heroin to the
United States in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Li had put up a 5-million-baht guarantee on February 7, but
jumped bail and fled to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Police said Li paid 120 million baht (4.8 million US dollars)
to a middle-man to arrange for his freedom.
</P>
<P>
Li is afraid that if he stays in Thailand, even in prison, he
might be killed by those who had helped him, to stop him from
revealing the names of those who had helped him escape.
</P>
<P>
Somchai Udomwong, a deputy chief justice of the criminal court,
is being investigated by a judicial panel for his role in granting
bail for Li.
</P>
<P>
Li would go through legal procedures in criminal court before
he is handed over to the US authority for the extradition.

<HEADLINE> No Troop Pullout from Albania, Says Italian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
said today that he was not urging a pullout of the Italian-led
Multinational Protection Force (MPF) from Albania.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said this following press reports that Italy was in favor
of withdrawing the MPF if Albanian leaders did not resolve their
political stalemate.
</P>
<P>
"There was no threat of a pullout, just a serious observation,"
Prodi told reporters during a visit to the northern Italian city
of Modena today.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to indicate to Albanian leaders that the
international community is involved in an operation that demands a
response from the whole of Albanian society," said Prodi, adding
that "without such a response our job grows more difficult."
</P>
<P>
Albania's reconstruction cannot begin until all parties
accepted the need for compromise to arrive at an election law,
Prodi stressed.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino told reporters in Tirana
that he was seeking to avoid the fall of his government of
national unity because he was convinced there was no alternative.
</P>
<P>
If he were to resign, "We would be back to where we were on
March 9 and that means the brink of a civil war," said Fino.
</P>
<P>
He said his government was continuing to press for accord on an
electoral law so that elections could take place on June 29 as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Fino said he would like to see the MPF extend its role to cover
"election infrastructure, that is, guard polling stations."

<P>
TIANJIN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Residents of north China's port
city of Tianjin have become active traders at the local foreign
exchange market since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The city branch of the Bank of China reports that the number of
foreign exchange deals by individual investors rose 30 percent in
the middle of May of this year, a turnover that amounted to 56
percent of last year's total for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
The bank began its foreign exchange business in 1995, and
individuals are allowed to trade in US dollars, yen, marks, pound
sterling, and Hong Kong dollars. Last year, 80 percent of the
trade was quoted in dollars and yen, but mark, pound sterling, and
Hong Kong dollar deals have been on the rise this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here attribute the brisk trade in foreign exchange to
a significant increase in income in the city and to the growing
number of contacts between people here and overseas.
</P>
<P>
The analysts noted that a good record of stability in the
national foreign exchange market has also encouraged residents to
invest in hard currencies.

tourism.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay, who is also finance minister, has planned an "export

because of higher raw material and labor costs.
</P>

Last year, the country's exports registered a near-zero growth,
while export value in the first quarter of this year failed to
reach expected targets.
</P>
<P>
Measures will also be drawn up to attract more foreign tourists
to bring in more foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
Business sector has called on the government to bring back the
golden age of tourism, as seen in 1984, when Thailand launched its
successful promotion "visit Thailand year".
</P>
<P>
In that year, tourism was the county's top earner of foreign
exchange.
</P>

In 1996 Thailand received 7.2 million tourists, up 3.5 percent

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises, with investment from
other parts of the country and ministries of the central
government have provided 250,000 job opportunities in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey, about 10,000 enterprises, funded
by 29 provinces and municipalities outside Shanghai have
created 70,000 job opportunities for the local residents.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state ministries opened more than 300
companies in Shanghai offering 180,000 job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 85 percent of the companies, with
investment from outside Shanghai are doing businesses in service
sector, such as transportation, construction and decoration, real
estate, software development, wholesales and retails.
</P>
<P>
Many of the enterprises, run by the state ministries are large
industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The registered fund of the companies, run by outside municipal
cities and provinces has surpassed 15 billion yuan (about 1.8
billion US dollars), according to the survey sponsored by the
city's planning committee.
</P>
<P>
The registered fund of the companies, run by state ministries,
has reached 50 billion yuan (about six billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Sees Heavy Foreign Exchange Trading By Individuals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai residents are investing
heavily in the foreign exchange trading market. The foreign
currency turnover by individual investors surged 66.32 percent
over the first quarter last year, according to the Shanghai-based
Bank of Communications.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the two major factors behind the active
trading is the rapid growth of individual income and a wider range
of choices in making investments.
</P>
<P>
They said that some stock investors are channeling their money
from the stock market to the foreign currency market, in fear of the
mounting risks in stock investment because of high prices.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange transactions were first opened to individuals
in Shanghai in 1993. The local branches of Bank of China and Bank
of Communications are the only two institutions authorized to
offer such service.
</P>
<P>
The monthly growth of individual trading volume with the Bank
of Communications Shanghai branch then surged from the 28.11
percent to 105.45 percent during the first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the transactions during the first quarter were
conducted through telephones, since the bank opened telephone
trading service and extended service hours for such trading till
night earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said Shanghai people have displayed their wisdom
in taking advantage of the international change of exchange rates,
judging from the fact that most of the transactions took place in
wildly fluctuating foreign currencies for the first three months
this year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange transactions were first opened to individuals
in Shanghai in 1993. The local branch of the Bank of China is
another bank authorized to offer the service.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Goal for Developing Animal Husbandry Next Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- By the year 2000, an average Chinese
is expected to consume 53 kilograms of meat, 17 kilograms of eggs
and eight kilograms of dairy products a year, the Ministry of
Agriculture predicted here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has therefore worked out a plan for the
development of animal husbandry for the early next century, a
ministry official revealed.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, he said, the overall production of meat,
eggs, and dairy products across the country should respectively
reach 68 million, 22 million and 10 million tons at the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the production shall be further increased to
84, 25, and 21 million tons, which means that every Chinese citizen
can eat 60-kg meat, 18-kg eggs and 15-kg dairy products each year.
</P>
<P>
The state has also decided that the proportion of the animal
husbandry output value to the overall agricultural output value
should increase by one percentage point every year, to reach 35
percent by 2000 and around 50 percent by 2010, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (91-92) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (91-92) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Will Hong Kong be able to maintain and develop
relations with foreign countries on its own after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Hong Kong will become a special administrative region
of China when the Chinese government resumes its exercise of
sovereignty over the region. Hong Kong, therefore, will not be
permitted to maintain and develop diplomatic relations with
foreign countries and regions on its own.
</P>
<P>
This in no way means that the Hong Kong SAR cannot have
relations and exchanges with foreign countries. It means rather
that the Hong Kong SAR should maintain and develop relations with
foreign countries under specified conditions and circumstances
under the principle of safeguarding national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Hong Kong SAR may, using the name "Hong Kong,
China," maintain and develop relations, and conclude and implement
agreements, with foreign states and regions and relevant
international organizations in economic, trade, banking, shipping,
telecommunications, tourists, cultural, sports and other
appropriate fields.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will Hong Kong residents be able to visit foreign
countries and regions after 1997 by using passports of the Hong
Kong SAR?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Article 154 of the Basic Law states that the central
government will authorize the government of the Hong Kong SAR to
issue, in accordance with law, passports of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China to all
Chinese citizens who hold permanent identity cards of the Region,
and travel documents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of the People's Republic of China to all other persons
lawfully residing in the Region.
</P>
<P>
Such passports and documents are valid for all states and
regions and record the holder's right to return to the Region. The
goverment of the Hong Kong SAR may apply immigration controls on
entry into, stay in and departure from the Region by persons from
foreign states and regions.
</P>
<P>
Various countries and regions are eager to do business with
Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, and businesspeople from all
over the world would like to have the convenience of visiting Hong
Kong without having to obtain visas. With assistance and
authorization from the central government, the Hong Kong SAR
government may conclude agreements on not requiring visa with
foreign states or regions. This also provides great convenience
for Hong Kong people.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu to Clean Up Taihu Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- By 2010, Taihu Lake water will be
drinkable under a Jiangsu Province plan to clean up the lake,
today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
To fully carry out this "clean water" project, an investment of
6.76 billion yuan (814.8 million US dollars) is needed between
1996 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
Taihu is one of the country's three big freshwater lakes with
most of its basin in Jiangsu Province. More than two-thirds of the
lake is now saturated with pollutants.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country included the lake as a priority project
for pollution control for the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The effort will make the water reach State first-grade
standards by 2000, and between 2000 and 2010, 90 percent of the
sewage from cities and townships in its basin should be treated
and 30 percent of the dispersed waste water point sources in rural
areas should be treated.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, the province will order the 241 sources of pollution
near the lake to take measures to control their pollution or face
closure within time limits.
</P>
<P>
Cities and counties by the lake are required to set up 43
sewage treatment plants, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Experimental zones with eoncologically freindly projects will
be set up in most of the lake basin to cut the quantity of run-off
chemical fertilizers by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
And rivers flowing into the lake and the whole lake area will
be comprehensively tackled.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Wishes Speedy End of Zairian Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt expressed the hope today that
armed confrontation in Zaire will end following recent transfer of
power in the African Great Lake country, the Egyptian MENA news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that armed conflicts will come to an end after a
speedy entry of forces of the Alliance of the Democratic Forces
for the Liberations of Congo into Kinshasa and the proclamation of
a new government," a Egyptian foreign ministry official was quoted
by MENA as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Its people have made strongest efforts to realize the
aspirations of African peoples for progress and prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The source also referred to Zaire as the Democratic Republic of
Congo, the name Zairian rebels said they will return the country
to as it first achieved independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Laurent Kabila claimed victory Saturday in his
lightning assault across Zaire, while his fighters swept through
Kinshasa, the capital, virtually unopposed by government troops.
</P>
<P>
Kabila promised to name a transitional government within three
days and introduce a new constitution in 60 days. He has declared
himself president, but he set no date for elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zairian Embassy in Cairo has maintained an
attitude of silence and caution as regards the latest developments
in the country where more than 250 ethnic groups live together.
</P>
<P>
The ten diplomats and administrators at the embassy, under the
charge d'affaires, today declined to comment on developments after
Kabila assumed power in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The security forces guarding the embassy in Zamalek, a plush
living quarter in downtown Cairo, have not been strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Contacted by telephone, the Zairian charge d'affaires told MENA
that the embassy was "working normally" and would maintain its
function pending fresh instructions from the foreign ministry in
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
There are in Egypt more than 300 Zairian citizens including
those who were opposed to the deposed President Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Aides to Mobutu, who relinquished power Friday, either fled or
died at the hands of soldiers in Kinshasa, putting an end to a
nearly 32-year rule of Mobutu in the country of nearly 50 million
people.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Asks Iran to Prevent PKK Rebels from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today asked neighboring Iran
to prevent the rebels of the illegal Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
from sheltering in the country following the five-day Turkish
cross-border military operation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency this evening quoted
Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel as saying that the ministry
today summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires in Ankara and told
him that PKK militants, who escaped from their destroyed bases and
camps in northern Iraq, have fled to Iran to seek shelter.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirmed our request for preventing the PKK rebels
(from fleeing to Iran)," said Akbel.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey expected the Iranian security forces to
take preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
Many of the PKK guerrillas are fleeing toward the Iranian
border after being hit hard by Turkish security forces.
</P>
<P>
The agency also quoted sources from Turkey's General Staff as
saying that until 18:30 local time (15:30 GMT) today, the
Turkish government troops had killed 998 PKK rebels during the
Turkish military campaign, which was launched Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting is still continuing in northern Iraq, as the
Turkish government troops are stepping up attack on the PKK rebels
based in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military operation was launched to support the
Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), led by Massoud Barzani
who had conducted his own operation against the PKK just hours
before the Turkish incursion.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said that the operation in northern Iraq would
continue until the area was swept free of PKK, which has been
fighting a near 13-year-old separatist war for autonomy in eastern
and southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Greece Considers Changing System for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece is now seeking simplification
in election system for the country's head of state.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper To Vima (The Tribune) reported today, the
Simitis-led government proposed that the Greek constitution be
changed in order to enable the parliament to elect the head of
state by "simple majority without first being obliged to dissolve
and proclaim elections."
</P>
<P>
Under the current election system, which was introduced with
the new constitution in 1975, the president of Greece will be
elected only after three sessions are conducted in the parliament.
In the first two, a two-thirds majority or 200 votes is required
while in the third session the threshold is 180 votes.
</P>
<P>
If no candidate gathers the required number of votes, the
parliament will be dissolved and elections be proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
The resulting parliament requires a simple majority in the
first two votes, and a relative majority in the third to elect a
president.

<HEADLINE> Uneasy Calm Back to Kinshasa With Social Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Guo Ming)
</P>
<P>
BRAZZAVILLE, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Zaire's capital Kinshasa was
drawn back to uneasy calm as Laurent Kabila's forces grabbed
control of more areas, but social stability is a far away scene
since quite a number of former government troops went underground
with their guns.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources from the French embassy in Kinshasa said over
200 defeated government troops, whose demand to join Kabila's
forces was initially rejected, attempted to gather at a military
camp to form a military group to be better positioned in talks
with Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"They were members of the presidential guards" loyal to exiled
president Mobutu Sese Seko who had flew to Morocco as a
transition to an uncertain European destination, according to a
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many other soldiers from Zaire's former
regular army, the civilian guards as well as members of the
presidential guards, took to looting and other forms of crime and
offenses, causing concern over the future social stability in the
Zairean capital.
</P>
<P>
Worse, Kinshasa civilians, especially the frustrated youth who
had been struggling to get rid of poverty, also took part in the
large-scale looting on Saturday night, the first day of military
take-over by Kabila's troops.
</P>
<P>
"In Kinshasa you have so many rich people, and so many poor
people at the same time. Some people who took to the street to
loot just think there shouldn't be such a big difference," said a
resident in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"That means Kabila has a lot of things to do," said a Zaire
observer.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who has proclaimed himself president of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, will have to maintain the social order in the
country, not to say the devastated economy left over by the
Mobutu administration widely accused of corruption and
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Following the wide-scale looting last night, Kabila sent his
second dispatch of 900 troops to boost the control of Kinshasa,
raising the total number of "Kabila men in Kinshasa" to about
1,500.
</P>
<P>
"It is not easy to take good care of a newly-captured capital
of five million population with just 1,500 soldiers," said a
British officer based in the Congolese capital of Brazzaville,
opposite to Kinshasa just across the Zaire River.
</P>
<P>
The troops of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) have so far controlled all the
major military camps, the state radio and television stations,
the Presidential Palace, the prime minister's office, the
parliament, the post office, among other key buildings in
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"But vast areas of the capital are far away from actual
control," said a United States military officer in Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
Zaire's state tv and radio, already controlled by Kabila's
forces, today repeatedly broadcast an order from Kabila, saying
that any forms of crime including looting are strictly forbidden,
and looters would be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
Kabila also called on local residents in Kinshasa to remain
calm and carry on their normal business.
</P>
<P>
But observers said it really takes time for peace and
stability dawns upon Kinshasa, capital of Africa's third largest
country taken over in an amazing speed by Kabila's forces since
their uprising in October 1996.
