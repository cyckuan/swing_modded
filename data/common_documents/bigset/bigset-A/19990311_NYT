IT'S NO TIME FOR UCLA TO BACK DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ ``This year the Final Four, at least,'' the UCLA
basketball player said, ``and next year, the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were a quote from the 15th-ranked Bruins' press
conference Wednesday at the RCA Dome. In fact, that was freshman
JaRon Rush speaking in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of their NCAA Tournament opener today against
Detroit, the Bruins had nothing more brazen to say than this, from
sophomore Baron Davis: ``It's no time for babies. You've got to be
a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush, an integral part of the YOUNGEST TEAM IN SCHOOL HISTORY _
surely it bears emphasizing or why would head coach Steve Lavin
have mentioned it four times in a 15-minute session with reporters?
_ has backed off his earlier bravado.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the courage of one's convictions. ``We're just
trying to come out and play hard,'' he said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   That rustling sound you just heard was the 11 NCAA championship
banners shuddering.
</P>
<P>
   After 22 wins and a regular season ensconced in the top 20, the
Bruins, Lavin would have you believe, are in trouble. They're young
and wounded and going up against ``the most dangerous team in the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Detroit and Duke do sound sort of the same.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, more than patience and an extra pass or 10, what
the Bruins need to get by a very good Titans team is courage. We're
not talking about the kind of courage that pushes a player out the
door of his home for a school thousands of miles away or propels
him to stay on an airplane after a white-knuckle flight.
</P>
<P>
   The bravery of which we speak is only indirectly about hurling
one's body in the path of an opponent slashing into the paint or
diving for every loose ball or shaking off a throbbing big toe, an
ornery hip, an aching back, tender arches.
</P>
<P>
   The courage the Bruins have got to muster is all about boxing
out one's fears of failing, of falling short of the
banner-in-the-sky expectations that come with the jersey. It's
about swatting away every last excuse and absorbing Detroit's best
charge and getting knocked down but not out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, UCLA would be better equipped for battle if Ray Young
(bruised hip), Davis (bruised right toe) and Jerome Moiso
(tendinitis in his arches) were pain-free and Dan Gadzuric hadn't
been lost for the season with an injury to his knee.
</P>
<P>
   That said, neither injuries nor indisposition should factor into
today's final score. The Bruins ought to beat Detroit because they
are U-C-L-A and in this combat zone that's a badge of honor, to be
proudly worn and roundly defended.
</P>
<P>
   Excuses are the last thing you'd expect to be lobbed like
grenades by a program that won its last national championship just
four years ago, boasts the second-best overall winning percentage
in the NCAA Tournament behind Duke and has more NCAA appearances
(35) than the 34-year-old Lavin has had birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there Lavin sat on Wednesday, emphasizing UCLA's
inexperience and playing up its injuries. He spun things until it
got dizzying. Does he really expect us to believe it is a small
miracle the Bruins got even this far?
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point in the season,'' Lavin said with a straight face,
``I didn't even think we'd be in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did you know that the Bruins are the youngest team in
the history of the school?
</P>
<P>
   Detroit coach Perry Watson could tell Lavin a thing or two about
young teams. After all, one of his high school players, Jalen Rose,
was among the five freshmen who led Michigan to the NCAA title in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Inexperience doesn't have to be a team's undoing and neither do
injuries (see this year's Stanford squad). It does the players a
disservice to fashion either one into a crutch because then what's
to keep them from limping?
</P>
<P>
   Pride, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   UCLA senior Brandon Loyd has made one fewer NCAA Tournament
appearance than Detroit. You'd think the mere fact the Titans are
being widely hailed as the 12th seed most likely to succeed in this
year's tournament would have the blue-blood Bruins royally peeved.
</P>
<P>
   And yet on Wednesday the players seemed OK with being the
underdog. They sure didn't act like pit bulls who have been
provoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're the underdog, we play a whole lot better,'' Davis
said. ``People are writing us off now so we have something to
prove.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it, the Bruins' real crisis in a nutshell.
It's not injuries, it's not youth. It's that they are driven more
by other peoples' low expectations of them than their own lofty
intentions.

Razorbacks finally have right side up 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Never one to sit idle or silent during a crisis,
Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson felt the 1998-99 basketball season
slipping away from him.
</P>
<P>
   So he responded with a fiery pep talk to energize his team. When
that failed, Richardson opted for the unconventional route.
</P>
<P>
   He benched Pat Bradley, his leading scorer, for three games. He
sat down Kareem Reid, his playmaker and floor general, for five
games. He even abandoned his signature, ``40 minutes of hell''
pressure defense for nine games after a 30-point loss to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Anything, Richardson said, to get the attention of a young
Razorbacks' team that staggered into mid-February with eight losses
and faced consecutive games against the No. 6 and No. 2 teams in
The Associated Press rankings.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Reid said, even Arkansas players questioned their
pedigree as an NCAA Tournament participant. Then, the Hogs defeated
No. 6 Kentucky and No. 2 Auburn within a five-day stretch, creating
an about-face in the attitude of a team that has progressed, since
Feb. 20, from tournament bubble rider to No. 4 seed in the West
Region.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas (22-10) meets Siena (25-5) at approximately 2:15 p.m.
today at McNichols Sports Arena. Richardson said he is unsure what
to expect from a Razorbacks group that lists seven freshmen among
its top 14 scorers and has only three seniors on its roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matchups are really tough for us because this team doesn't
match up with anybody,'' said Richardson, whose top seven players
include no one taller than 6-foot-8 forward Derek Hood. ``A lot of
times, I'll have four guys out there who are 6-1 or 6-2. I call our
guys the PT boats because they're supposed to get in there, shoot,
and get out. I keep reminding them that a lot of things in small
packages blow up loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they blow up prematurely, creating self-inflicted
wounds. Witness the 87-57 loss to Oklahoma on Dec. 5, when the
Razorbacks suffered 17 turnovers and shot 39.3 percent from the
field. The contest convinced Richardson to put his pressure defense
in cold storage. It did not resurface for nine games, when the
Razorbacks used it to surprise Providence and hand the Friars the
most lopsided loss in school history, 118-79.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got eight freshmen ... and the type of defense I teach
is very difficult,'' Richardson said. ``Traps must come. But they
can happen anywhere. I tell them to `read and recover,' which is
very unorthodox. Early on, they didn't get it. So, we'd drop it and
come back to it, drop it and come back to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, I decided it was like handling a racehorse.
Eventually, you give it its head and turn it loose. By the end of
the year, we were doing a good job. Not an outstanding job, but a
good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough to record victories over Kentucky (74-70) and Auburn
(104-88) that set the stage for Arkansas to reach the final of last
week's Southeastern Conference tournament. Good enough that Reid,
who once wondered about his team's postseason destination,
considers the Razorbacks capable of a nice, long ride in the NCAA
field.
</P>
<P>
   His senior season, he said, has been salvaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so good or nice in the beginning. But it's been a
smooth ride lately,'' said Reid, who leads the team in assists
(160) and ranks third in scoring, at 10.2 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't always been consistent, but we've found a way to
get it done when it really mattered,'' said Bradley, who leads the
team in scoring (14.4 average) and owns the SEC record for career
3-pointers, with 361. ``I guess we play our best when our back's to
the wall. And we're definitely there now. You never know if your
next tournament game will be your last.''
</P>
<P>
   In a season filled with mixed results, Richardson figures the
only thing he can count on today is that his PT boats will sink
someone _ themselves or Siena _ with all guns blazing.

NFL MIGHT PLAY WAITING GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Greater Los Angeles may have to put its plans to regain a NFL
franchise on hold for a little while longer.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among NFL execs and owners for two months has been
that the league was headed back to Los Angeles, that next week's
annual league meetings in Phoenix would likely produce a vote to
put a 32nd franchise in L.A. by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The league's expansion committee will meet Sunday morning and is
expected to make a recommendation to the membership on expanding to
either Houston or Los Angeles. A simple majority of those 14 owners
is required for any recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   But sources close to ownership say there are enough factions
within the entire membership to render any recommendation moot. The
league requires 24 of 31 votes to approve any expansion decision,
and expansion is on Tuesday's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the league) will try to convey the impression that
they are doing something,'' said a source. ``But when everything is
done, you'll see things are no further along than they were before
the meetings began. If they do say they're coming back to L.A.,
there will be enough conditions to keep Houston's bid alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Several sources, speaking on background only, said the owners
are separated by a variety of issues:
</P>
<P>
   Several feel the league is rushing a decision on adding a 32nd
franchise. Another new team, the owners feel, will eventually cut
into each team's national TV revenue and further dilute the
product.
</P>
<P>
   The league expanded from 28 to 30 teams in 1995 and will add a
31st in Cleveland this fall as settlement over Art Modell moving
the Browns to Baltimore in 1996. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue
acknowledged last week that several owners dislike the formula for
stocking expansion teams, in particular the awarding of multiple
draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is some sentiment to do nothing,'' said one
source. ``And even if enough owners want to expand, there are
enough on either side (of the L.A. vs. Houston debate) to prevent a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Several owners are still not sold on either of the two groups
seeking an L.A. expansion team, Carson/Michael Ovitz and the New
Coliseum/Ed Roski/Eli Broad.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's latest financial presentation, said one source, was
``flimsy,'' featuring too much debt and not enough hard information
on equity involvement by other partners. And while the New Coliseum
bid has ``made a lot of progress,'' league execs have a problem
with the public money contribution and several owners are still
reticent to return to the original Coliseum site.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue has said any action to return to Los Angeles next week
would likely not specify a particular site or ownership group. It
would just establish an eventual return to L.A., with those
decisions determined at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, who hosted a visit to Carson by Tagliabue last week, said
he preferred a decision sooner than later, but understood the
league's decision-making process. New Coliseum spokesman John
Semcken said Roski and Broad would like a decision as much as
anyone, but understand the nature of the NFL's dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Houston businessman Robert McNair has been aggressively seeking
support among owners to keep his Houston bid alive after next
week's meetings. He recently broached league execs about expanding
to Houston (set ital) and (end ital) Los Angeles, and also sent
letters to several owners expressing an interest in buying their
teams if they were for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always been in favor of franchise stability,'' said
NFL spokesman Joe Browne Wednesday, adding that there's sentiment
to expand beyond 32 teams. ``McNair and Houston are still in the
running for the 32nd team. It's possible he's covering his bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be a clear recommendation by the committee,
either L.A. or Houston, but we may not get beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair has his supporters among the membership, most notably Bud
Adams, who moved the Oilers from Houston to Tennessee. Adams is a
member of expansion committee and said in October that several
fellow owners in the AFC Central will support Houston's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Semcken said this week that while he expects the league ``will
do something,'' he now believes Houston will still be an option
when the meetings end. Neither L.A. group has been asked to make
any additional presentation or even attend the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   There are indications that the league wants some of the men
behind the two L.A. bids to combine forces in returning the NFL to
the city. One source said the league likes the marketing potential
of Ovitz and the financial resources of Broad, and would be willing
to consider either site if the two were part of the same team.
</P>
<P>
   Broad came onto the Coliseum project late at the request of Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan after the NFL expressed concern about
Roski's resources. He has been an active participant in the
redevelopment of downtown Los Angeles, so he would be unlikely to
be part of any deal in Carson. Ovitz, meanwhile, might be unwilling
to give up top billing as the man who returned the NFL to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Where Roski, who has been the private party championing L.A.'s
cause for four years, sits in this suggested alliance remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Last and hardly least, there is always money to consider, and
each day a decision is delayed potentially increases the size of
the franchise fee for a 32nd team.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns' franchise fee was $476 million, but sources said
several owners -- Dallas' Jerry Jones, Tampa's Malcolm Glazer, new
Vikings owner Red McCombs and the Raiders' Al Davis -- felt the
league left at least $100 million on the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   All three groups seeking a franchise have been operating on the
assumption of a $500 million franchise fee. But the (set ital) very
low end (end ital), sources said, for a team in L.A. may be $650
million.
</P>
<P>
   When a price tag of $1 billion was mentioned to Tagliabue last
week, he did not shrug the number off.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion committee is made up of the members of the stadium
committee, chairman Jerry Richardson (Carolina), Wayne Huizenga
(Miami), David Modell (Baltimore), Mike McCaskey (Chicago), Wayne
Weaver (Jacksonville) and Bob Whitsitt (Seattle); and the finance
committee, chairman Bob Kraft (New England), Bud Adams (Tennessee),
Tom Benson (New Orleans), Bill Ford (Detroit), Glazer (Tampa Bay),
Jeff Lurie (Philadelphia) and Robert Tisch (New York Giants).

RICHARDSON HAILS COURT'S ELIGIBILITY RULING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Arkansas basketball coach Nolan Richardson smiled
broadly and borrowed from the words of Martin Luther King as he
hailed Monday's court ruling that stripped the NCAA of its
eligibility standards for freshmen athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free at last! Free at last!,'' Richardson said yesterday,
parroting King's famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech in 1963. ``I'm
the happiest man in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, long an opponent of using college entrance exam
scores as a means of determining freshman eligibility because he
considers the tests culturally biased, said he shared his joy with
fellow African-American coaches after learning that U.S. District
Judge Ronald Buckwalter nullified NCAA rules requiring a minimum
score of 820 on the SAT to compete as freshmen. In his ruling,
Buckwalter said the standardized tests violated federal civil
rights laws because they had an ``unjustified disparate impact
against African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning of the ruling, Richardson said he immediately
placed celebratory phone calls to Temple coach John Chaney and
former Georgetown coach John Thompson. Like Richardson, Chaney and
Thompson are black. Like Richardson, both spoke out against using
these exam scores to determine freshmen eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   But no coach became more of a lightning rod for the topic than
Richardson, who raised the issue at every news conference during
Arkansas' march to the 1994 NCAA championship and the championship
game of the 1995 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a victory for me, per se,'' Richardson said. ``But
it's gratifying ... the work and time we put in, trying to tell
people \Rthe NCAA\S was wrong has been vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public's perception of Nolan Richardson changed because of
this. At this time in '94, I was angry. But I had reason to be
angry. Now, Nolan's happy. ... Looking back on what I did, it was
worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officials have announced plans to appeal Buckwalter's
ruling.
LONG, HARD RIDE
</P>
<P>
   Siena guard Marcus Faison, who played his high school ball in El
Paso, has endured a long road to his first NCAA Tournament
appearance. And it has nothing to do with the Saints' needing 36
hours to travel from Albany, N.Y., to Denver for today's meeting
with Arkansas because of heavy snow in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Faison's father, Lamont, died less than a week after he enrolled
for his freshman year, in 1996-97. Lamont Faison, 38, suffered a
stroke brought on by a rare genetic ailment that riddles the body
with tumors. By the end of Faison's freshman season, Siena had lost
by 40 points in its conference tournament and school officials
fired the coach who recruited him, Bob Beyer.
</P>
<P>
   Incoming coach Paul Hewitt had to convince Faison to scrap plans
to transfer to another school. Two years later, the junior from El
Paso's Irvin High School has emerged as the leading scorer (14.6)
on a team making its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just getting to the NCAA Tournament is special in itself. But
after everything I've been through at Siena, that makes this even
sweeter,'' Faison said.
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Iowa point guard Dean Oliver, who leads the Hawkeyes in scoring
(11.9 points per game) and assists (4.6 per game), is doubtful for
today's game against Alabama-Birmingham because of a respiratory
infection that worsened yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico coach Dave Bliss said forward Kenny Thomas, who
missed two games in last week's Western Athletic Conference
tournament because of a groin injury, will play today against
Missouri.

ATTACKS PUSHING PIT BULLS TO L.A. SHELTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Horrified by the fatal mauling of a toddler in
South Central Los Angeles, pit bull owners are abandoning their
dogs in droves at animal shelters and rescue agencies, city
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're scared,'' said Jackie David, spokeswoman for the city
Department of Animal Services. ``People are turning the dogs in
because they have small children in their home. Leaving pit bulls
and small children alone can be deadly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 of the controversial dogs have been jettisoned by
their owners or turned in as strays to the city's six animal
shelters since a family's pit pull turned on an infant Saturday,
David said.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburban San Fernando Valley northwest of downtown, the
East Valley shelter has taken in up to 15 pit bulls per day since
Sunday, said Lt. Karen Knipscheer, a district manager for the
Animal Services department.
</P>
<P>
   And at the South Central Los Angeles shelter, employees came to
work one recent morning to find 10 dogs tied to the front gate and
left in a nearby parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   During a typical four-day span, the city receives 10 to 15 dogs
at all the shelters combined, David said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, these pets that suddenly no one wants waited for
their fate at the city shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Pleading for mercy with her sad, dark-brown eyes, an abandoned
14-month-old pit bull caged in the East Valley shelter seemed to
know she is running out of time. Like the scores of other dogs in
the city's care, she will be housed for eight to 11 days. If no one
adopts her, a veterinarian will slip a long syringe under her
caramel-brown coat and kill her with a lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Other dogs are fortunate enough to be left with private dog
rescue agencies, which hold the animals until someone adopts them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panic has set in,'' said Tia Torres, owner of Villalobos Pit
Bull Rescue in Agua Dulce in rural northern Los Angeles County who
works with Los Angeles officials to find homes for the abandoned
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said she has been swamped with calls from ``frantic'' pit
bull owners, hoping to get rid of their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have absolutely no more room for the dogs, but we're
offering free obedience training and phone consultations to owners
who are worried about their dog's temperament,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are watching the news and falling into a frenzy,''
Torres added. ``The analogy I use is that if we see on the news
that a particular race of person has committed a crime, we know not
to blame the race. But we don't do that with dogs. People are
blaming the breed, not the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Kennel Club, the term ``pit bull'' has
become a catch-all reference to several breeds of dogs, including
the American pit bull terrier, the American Staffordshire terrier
and the English bull terrier.
</P>
<P>
   The square-jawed, stocky breeds were created in the early 19th
century by trainers who appreciated the fierceness, jaw strength
and courage of bulldogs. Breeders began with the bulldog and mixed
some terrier blood to meet their height and weight expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Pit bulls typically demonstrate aggression toward other dogs,
unrelenting bravery, a high pain threshold and a willingness to
fight to the death. But experts and owners also say they are an
affectionate breed.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs usually stand about 19 inches tall and weigh 80 to 100
pounds, but can reach up to 150 pounds if fed incorrectly or
excessively, the American Kennel Club reports on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent rally in support of pit bulls in the Valley, 10
owners and lovers of the breed argued uneducated owners, not bad
dogs, should be blamed for the fatal mauling of a child in Compton
and a series of recent attacks in the San Fernando Valley community
of Granada Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Yet city officials stressed that pit bulls need ``special care''
from their owners. Without early obedience training, a correct diet
and a commanding, loving owner, the breed has been known to bully
owners and become overly aggressive, especially around playful
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you treat a dog with neglect and abuse there is no telling
how it will respond,'' David said. ``Dogs aren't meant to be
weapons. They're meant to be companion animals.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 rule is to spay or neuter pit bulls, animal experts
say. An unneutered pit bull is more than three times as likely to
attack than a neutered pit bull, city officials and rescuers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must be neutered. Testosterone can be an evil thing,''
Torres said. ``And just like a child, every dog needs structure and
a form of disciplining. As a parent with no structure and
discipline, you get an out-of-control kid who runs crazy on the
streets. It's the same thing with a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Capp, who saves pit bulls in Los Angeles and San Diego for
a national organization, Chaco Rescue, said she's terribly
distressed by the recent wave of abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you own a dog, you should have a good sense of that dog's
temperament and know enough not to get caught up in this,'' Capp
said. ``We don't recommend that anyone buy these dogs for
protection. And quite frankly, if you're the type of person who
would abandoned your dog to begin with, you shouldn't have a dog in
the first place.''

EDITORIAL: MRS DOLE LEAPS INTO THE GAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 12:
</P>
<P>
   A woman running for president of the United States is not a
breakthrough. Victoria Woodhull was a minor-party candidate before
women had the right to vote, and elected officials like Margaret
Chase Smith and Shirley Chisholm have made long-shot bids for the
nomination. But Elizabeth Dole is still making history as the first
woman to enter the presidential primary season as one of the
front-runners. Mrs. Dole took another step toward a full-fledged
candidacy for the Republican nomination on Wednesday when she
announced she had formed an exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party has long had a ``gender gap'' problem with
women voters, and Mrs. Dole is marketing herself as a gap-bridger
who can moderate the harsh, confrontational tone that women find
particularly disturbing in Republican policies and rhetoric. But
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is tilling that field too, with his
``compassionate conservatism,'' and polls have shown that it is the
message, not the gender of the candidate, that drives women's
votes.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge in evaluating Mrs. Dole's candidacy is not to cut
her too much slack simply because America has waited so long for a
woman to make a serious run for president. She deserves to be
judged in comparison with her opponents, not with an ideal. Mrs.
Dole would probably not be in her present position if she were not
the wife of Bob Dole. But then Bush might be just one of a pack of
appealing Republican governors if he were not the offspring of a
former president.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole has never run for office, except in the role of
supportive spouse. But Bush has no experience in Washington, except
in the role of first son. Mrs. Dole does have a solid resume as a
former Cabinet official, which makes an interesting contrast to
Bush's experience in state government. Is the public still tired of
Washington insiders, or is it looking for a president with
experience in making the federal government work?
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made it clear he does not intend to take any national
policy stands until the Texas state legislature ends its session in
late spring. That will be a problem for Mrs. Dole, who risks
looking insubstantial if she spends all that time campaigning on
generalities and trying to play it safe. The downside of all this
new positive politics is its occasionally gooey tone, and Mrs.
Dole, whose speeches tend in that direction anyway, needs to start
speaking frankly to the American people about her ideas on taxes,
education and hot-button issues like abortion and American-Chinese
relations.
</P>
<P>
   As a woman, she will have to put up with a kind of scrutiny that
male candidates are not bothered with. Critiques of her appearance,
her wardrobe and her style will go far beyond anything her male
opponents will have to endure. That is unfortunate but inevitable,
since she is taking the American public on a shakedown cruise,
acclimating it to what will inevitably become a long line of women
presidential candidates in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The women who are moving up the political ladder behind her may
be able to enter the competition on a more even basis because
Elizabeth Dole got the public used to the idea of seeing a woman
running for the White House. If that happens, her own candidacy
will be a success no matter who winds up as the Republican nominee
next year.

EDMONDS WILL TRY NO. 2 SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ He's not the typical No. 2 hitter you'd find
in the National League, the bunt-the-man-over,
take-a-pitch-so-the-baserunner-can-run type of guy. But Jim Edmonds
will hit second in the Angels' lineup this year, right after
leadoff man Darin Erstad and right before No. 3 man Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy likes hitting there,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``He scored 100-some-odd runs (115) last year. There will
always be situations (to bunt or take pitches), but we don't have a
prototypical leadoff hitter either. If Darin Erstad is on base a
lot, which I anticipate, I think Jim Edmonds will get a lot of
fastballs to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds has always said he prefers to hit in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   __ New look: Attention American League: Closer Troy Percival has
added a weapon to his repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Percival is working on a change-up this spring to go along with
his 95-mph fastball and his curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no better place to work on stuff than here,'' Collins
said. ``He worked on a change-up all winter, he worked on his
curveball all winter. The minute you get hitters not looking for
his fastball, the fastball becomes almost unhittable. This adds a
couple more weapons to his arsenal. It'll make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The good and bad: Three of the four innings Omar Olivares
pitched Wednesday for the Angels were perfect. It was the other
inning _ the third _ that seemed to irk Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares gave up a three-run double to the Giants' Barry Bonds
in the inning, but that's not what bothered Collins. With two out
and two on, Olivares walked Bill Mueller to get to Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing he's got to do if we're going to win is cut down
the bases on balls,'' Collins said. ``You can't walk Bill Mueller
to get to Barry Bonds. You cannot do that. Not when you've got
stuff as good as he (Olivares) has.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares seems to have an edge over Jarrod Washburn and Jason
Dickson in the battle for the No. 5 spot in the starting rotation,
but Collins won't admit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to rank them,'' he said. ``(Olivares) did a good
job for us last year, but one thing about the fifth spot _ you just
can't give away runs in any spot. Today was the perfect example.
You have to put that guy away.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On the mend: Shortstop Gary DiSarcina had his forearm X-rayed
Wednesday and it revealed the broken bone is healing. The
full-sized cast was removed and he was fitted with a short cast.
</P>
<P>
   He was given the OK to increase his activity but can't
participate in field work. He'll be re-examined in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   __ Moves: The Angels reduced the number of players in
major-league camp by 11 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Infielder Nelson Castro was optioned to Double-A Erie; pitchers
Ramon Ortiz and Mark Harriger and catcher Bret Hemphill were
assigned to Gene Autry Park for work purposes; and catcher Fausto
Tejero and pitchers Mike Bovee, Mike Butcher, Brian Cooper, Seth
Etherton, Lou Pote and Keith Troutman were returned to minor-league
camp.

YOU WANT 'EM TO READ, WRITE AND WIN, TOO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The NCAA places way too great a burden on college
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   You begin with the fact that for a kid even to get into college
today he actually has to have a high school diploma!
</P>
<P>
   No ifs, ands or buts.
</P>
<P>
   It's an NCAA rule.
</P>
<P>
   And a sheepskin only gets him in the front door. A freshman who
wants to score touchdowns or shoot buckets for the institution of
higher learning that recruited him also must demonstrate he can
read and write and is adequately prepared to do college-level work.
</P>
<P>
   Or that's how it was. This week a judge struck down the NCAA's
test-score requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 16 is out.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge's ruling stands, the 302 Division I schools will
decide which of their freshmen are eligible for sports and which
are not.
</P>
<P>
   I say if a young man wants to play for (fill in your NCAA
Tournament office pool pick) and can knock down the three-point
shot blindfolded, why on Earth should university administrators
concern themselves with peripheral issues like education?
</P>
<P>
   Why let academics hold him back?
</P>
<P>
   High school dropout?
</P>
<P>
   No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Give the young man a full scholarship and point him toward the
gym. It shouldn't matter whether a kid can find the ``x'' in
algebra if he can take his team to the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   Education?
</P>
<P>
   How about ``winning''.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not lose sight of what today's society ``really'' values.
</P>
<P>
   Is it fair to expect a 6-10 kid who can bring fans out of their
seats with a 360-degree reverse jam to concern himself with the
dual responsibilities of being a full-time student? If he's as good
as the coach says, the kid's probably going to leave school early
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This week the kid is earning big bucks for the university.
</P>
<P>
   He's ``focused'' on basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Why ask him to risk losing his concentration by making him read
Shakespeare?
</P>
<P>
   A free throw during March Madness can be worth millions. Isn't
that enough pressure on a student athlete without demanding he
finish writing an outline for a term paper and turn it in next
Monday?
</P>
<P>
   Filling the hoop, baby.
</P>
<P>
   That's what matters. That's what it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball is a full-time job. Ask Minnesota Coach Clem Haskins,
who was confronted Wednesday with allegations of academic fraud at
his school. ``All I'm trying to do is win a game,'' Haskins
replied. His Gophers open the NCAAs against Gonzaga. ``It's all I'm
concentrating on.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Minnesota (motto: ``HOMEWORK? IT'S A SLAM
DUNK!'') understands what the NCAA doesn't. Being a student ``and''
an athlete is unrealistic. A kid shouldn't have to do both.
</P>
<P>
   A former office manager at Minnesota said she did research
papers and exams over a five-year period for at least 20 men's
basketball players, including four now on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Gangelhoff told the ``St''.``'' ``Paul Pioneer Press'' that
different players turned in the same paper she wrote for different
classes. Gangelhoff said players would come to her home where they
either would sit next to her as she typed the course work or be in
an adjacent room.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a (homework) assignment and they had been to class,
we would talk about what happened in class and what they heard and
what they thought about the assignment,'' she said. ``Then they
would grab the remote and go watch TV, and I would type (the
assignment) up.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the research papers, we would rarely meet. They would just
give me the assignment and I would do it and then they would pick
it up. Sometimes I would read the papers to them and explain them
to them just in case they got asked in class about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine actually being singled out and questioned in class.
</P>
<P>
   What do you ``say''?
</P>
<P>
   It's just not fair to put a young man in that situation, not
when his mind is on Gonzaga. &QL;

LIONS' FREDRICKSON TO VISIT CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cardinals' search for an outside linebacker doesn't begin
and end with trying to re-sign Jamir Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent Rob Fredrickson, a first-round pick of the Oakland
Raiders in 1994, is scheduled to visit the Cardinals' Tempe
training facility today.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials said that Fredrickson's visit doesn't mean
their interest in re-signing Miller has diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrickson, who lives in Scottsdale in the off-season, is the
first free agent from another team to visit the Cardinals since the
free-agency period began on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   He is coming off his best statistical season: a career-high 86
tackles, 70 solo; 2{ sacks; and one interception for the Detroit
Lions in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions acquired him for a fourth-round draft pick in a trade
with the Raiders during the last off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrickson, who earned $1.3 million last year, has attracted
much interest in free agency. He already has visited the New York
Giants, Washington Redskins and New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cardinals strong safety Tommy Bennett, a restricted
free agent, returned from his visit to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers had discussions with Bennett's agent, Mitch
Frankel, but haven't decided whether to make him an offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals can match any offer for Bennett. But if they chose
not to match it, they would get no compensation.

EDITORIAL: PEACE AND POVERTY IN CENTRAL AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 12:
</P>
<P>
   The last time an American president went to Central America was
1982, when Ronald Reagan visited Honduras and Costa Rica. That year
was one of the bloodiest for El Salvador and for Guatemala, where a
truth commission recently labeled 1982 as a peak period for what it
termed the military's ``genocide'' of Mayan Indians in the civil
war. But Reagan praised the military leaders of both nations and
spent billions in lethal aid to their governments and the
Nicaraguan Contras.
</P>
<P>
   This week President Clinton is visiting a very different Central
America and carries a very different message. His trip is a belated
recognition of the region's progress and importance to the United
States. But Washington's support for wars in Central America 15
years ago is not being matched by its support for peace today.
</P>
<P>
   In El Salvador and Guatemala, United Nations-sponsored peace
agreements have brought former guerrillas into politics and
committed the governments to social reforms. Mayan Indians, the
marginalized majority in Guatemala, now serve in Parliament and as
local mayors. In El Salvador the party of the former guerrillas
lost this week's presidential elections but was able to campaign
freely. The Sandinistas in Nicaragua won the war but lost at the
ballot box, and stepped down in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicts are over, but Central America's warring nations
have essentially returned to the conditions of misery and
inequality that caused the wars to begin with. While El Salvador
has experienced steady economic growth, poverty in rural areas
remains unchanged. In Nicaragua, the poor are worse off than at its
war's end. Huge debts have kept the region from spending money to
fight poverty. Nicaragua, for example, pays 11 times more in debt
service than it spends on health care each year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the postwar governments' reforms _ new police or
judicial systems _have not solved the underlying problems that made
these bodies responsive mainly to the rich and powerful. Even the
local governments admit that free-market changes have so far mainly
served the urban wealthy and middle class. Last year the region
suffered its worst natural disaster of the century in Hurricane
Mitch, which will set back development in Honduras and Nicaragua
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Clinton's visit, important as it is, is a missed
opportunity. Clinton is doling out his celebrated compassion, but
little in the way of money. A billion dollars in post-hurricane aid
is being held up in Congress. The administration should allow the
quarter-million immigrants who fled the wars in Salvador and
Guatemala to stay in the United States. It must also forgive the
debt burdens that were already crippling the countries most
devastated by the hurricane, and try to persuade international
lending institutions to do the same. Washington spent billions of
dollars in the 1980s on wars in Central America. It should now
increase its commitment to supporting peace and prosperity.

3COM-MICROSOFT VENTURE TO DEVELOP PC PRODUCTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. and the 3Com Corp. Thursday intend to
announce an alliance to jointly develop products to connect
personal computers and computer peripherals within homes,
executives from the two companies said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind the venture is that consumers could save
money by sharing modems, printers, scanners and removable storage
devices like zip disks by linking PCs into in-home networks rather
than buy multiple peripherals to cover each computer in a home. The
technology would also ease the playing of head-to-head computer
games.
</P>
<P>
   The companies intend to make the products, which would be
co-branded by 3Com and Microsoft, available in two stages. This
summer big personal computer manufacturers would begin to include
the new product in machines for customers willing to pay extra for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Then this fall 3Com and Microsoft will begin to distribute
add-on products through retail channels, including stores and
Internet shops.
</P>
<P>
   The companies do not intend to announce specific PC partners
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   3Com and Microsoft said Wednesday night that they planned to
charge less than $100 a computer for the new networking product.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Eagan, director for business development at Microsoft's
hardware group, said the deal with 3Com was the first time
Microsoft had agreed to co-brand a networking product.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance between Microsoft, the No. 1 developer of PC
software, and 3Com, the maker of data networking equipment,
represents a bet that consumers are as eager to link PCs at high
speed in their homes as they are in connecting to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The cable television and local telephone industries are locked
in a battle to be the first to deliver widespread high speed
Internet access to United States customers.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from the companies said that while they would
consider expanding into cable modems and high-speed phone line
modems, the venture would initially focus on in-home networking
using phone lines.  &QL;

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Ryan Kealy, a man of few words, has become a man
of no words.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State quarterback has put a temporary embargo on
media interviews so he can focus on academics. Kealy's attitude is
part of an off-season maturation that includes trying to be a
better leader for the Sun Devils, his coaches say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's blossoming,'' quarterbacks coach John Pettas said. ``He's
now realizing it's his turn to step forward. He's taking more of an
active role than a passive one.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said, ``He doesn't want to be singled
out. He has done a lot in the off-season to benefit the team, and
I'm proud of him. He's in great shape. He's focusing on academics.
He wants to do what's best for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils, who begin the first of an NCAA-allowed 15 spring
practices today, hope to regroup after a disappointing 5-6 season.
Although Kealy's inconsistencies were only a small part of ASU's
problems, Snyder said the junior took the finish to heart and has
joined defensive players Erik Flowers, Eric Fields and Junior Ioane
as vocal off-season leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we've had meetings in the off-season about leadership,
there's been a lot of passion,'' Snyder said. ``Has it been the
whole team? No. But are we advanced from where we were a year ago?
Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership was a concern last season. Several players suggested
there was too much finger-pointing by other players, and some
veterans' work habits were questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Players have met several times in the off-season to discuss the
topic. Kealy, consciously or not, is integrating himself with the
rest of the team by lifting with the linemen and running with the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he has three priorities for the spring:
</P>
<P>
   See what kind of impact the five enrolled junior college
transfers and 14 former redshirts can make.
</P>
<P>
   Redefine practice habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the veterans of last year's club lost the ability or
knowledge of truly how to practice, and they became a little less
focused,'' Snyder said. ``We want this group to understand what a
hard practice is and make sure they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Develop leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to define what it is, who it is and what form does it
take,'' Snyder said. ``A lot of things have taken place over the
winter dealing with the players providing leadership the coaches
can't provide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils will spend part of the spring returning to
fundamentals. A missed tackle here and a bad pursuit there probably
equated to several losses last season.
</P>
<P>
   But Snyder said he will not dramatically alter his offensive and
defensive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of semi-prepared to go in and tear this thing
apart,'' Snyder said. ``But after we examined everything, it really
doesn't need that. It just needs a little tweaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The most tweaking will come in August, when the Sun Devils open
Camp Tontozona with 29 new players.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some story lines that could unfold: &QL; 
A new-look backfield &QL; 
Fullback Jeff Paulk's departure is significant. His blocking was
key to the success of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils will give redshirt freshman Jake Each a look
(redshirt freshman Darrel Turner is out with a hernia) but might
consider other options to join tailback J.R. Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility might feature Redmond with two tight ends such
as Todd Heap and Brian Jennings. Heap's receiving abilities will
allow for some offensive creativity. &QL; 
Player movement &QL; 
Several players will be at new positions in the spring because of
experimentation as well as necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Christon Rance, who started eight games at strong safety,
and sophomore Courtney Palmore, who played in 10 games as a backup
safety, will get looks at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Terrelle Smith, who began his ASU career on the defensive
line before moving to linebacker, will get a shot at fullback.
Smith was a high school All-America by several recruiting services.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils, who will be thin at offensive line during the
spring, also will do some shifting there.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Scott Peters, who earned freshman All-America honors his
first season, is expected to take over Grey Ruegamer's spot at
center. Snyder said he will move junior Victor Leyva to right
tackle and put senior Thomas Schmidt at right guard to compete with
sophomore Levi Jones, who has moved from the defensive line. &QL; 
Defensive changes? &QL; 
Two of the five junior college transfers who already have enrolled
_ Craig Koontz and Monte Franks _ are safeties and one, Adam Tanke,
is a linebacker. With the loss of free safety Mitchell Freedman and
the shuffling of several players, some new faces could make their
way into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secondary is absolutely a priority,'' Snyder said. ``If
you look at our recruiting, it pretty strongly states we need to
improve our defensive skills. The two new safeties have done a real
nice job of dove-tailing in (with the players), although they
haven't played a snap here yet.'' &QL; 
Health issues &QL; 
Don't expect to see starting cornerback Courtney Jackson practice
much, if at all, during the spring. He still has not recovered from
a hit during the regular-season finale against Arizona, an apparent
uncalled clip the Sun Devils privately are still seething about.
</P>
<P>
   How severe is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a medical person telling me he would have been
better off breaking his ankle,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Courtney Hysaw, who is still recovering from a severe
knee injury suffered at Camp Tontozona last year, won't be ready.
Running back J.R. Peroulis will be limited because of a lingering
knee injury. &QL;

NETS LOSE, BUT IS MARBURY ON WAY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Before the New Jersey Nets lost their fifth game
in a row Wednesday night, to the Indiana Pacers at Market Square
Arena, the team's officials were attempting to secure a deal that
would not only resurrect this lifeless season but also turn the
club into a league powerhouse in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In what would perhaps be the biggest trade of the season if
consummated, the Nets were trying to acquire Stephon Marbury, the
Minnesota Timberwolves' point guard who grew up in New York City.
The Nets offered Sam Cassell and a first-round draft pick, a league
official with knowledge of the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's about an 80 percent chance that it could happen,'' the
official said, hours before the Nets (3-15) were beaten, 93-82, by
the Indiana Pacers (13-5).
</P>
<P>
   The Nets are likely to trade the disgruntled forward Chris
Gatling to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for center Ervin Johnson
and the backup point guard Elliot Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's game was further evidence that the Nets need
to make changes as they lost for the 11th time in 12 contests.
Their faint playoff hopes are now gone. In the traditional 82-game
season, their unsightly record is the equivalent of being 5-25.
</P>
<P>
   Rik Smits (20 points) led a contingent of five Pacers who scored
in double figures. Chris Mullin followed with 17.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Gill scored 25 points to lead the Nets, who lowered
their league-worst shooting percentage by making just 35 percent of
their shots. Keith Van Horn added 22 points for New Jersey while
Jayson Williams scored 13 and grabbed a game-high 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   After playing Indiana tough in the first half, the Nets crumbled
slowly over the third and fourth quarters, being outscored by 44-36
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Coach John Calipari, whose job security seems to dwindle with
every defeat, started his ``big lineup'' for the first time this
season. In search of a cure for his club's horrible play, he
started Jim McIlvaine at center, along with Williams, Van Horn,
Gill and Kerry Kittles.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, playing point guard, responded best to the change, scoring
18 points in the first half. He headed into the contest on the
heels of a four-game slump in which he totaled only 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   With Gill hitting jumpers and posting up, the Nets rallied from
an 11-point first-quarter deficit to pull within 49-46 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana outscored the Nets by 19-9 over the first eight minutes
of the third quarter to take a commanding 68-55 lead that never
again dropped below double digits.
</P>
<P>
   With the league's trading deadline of Thursday at 6 p.m.
approaching, the Nets do not have long to inject some energy into
their insipid lineup. A more drastic move for the club would have
them sending Kittles to Minnesota for Marbury. But the Nets hope to
avoid parting with their third-year shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, off to a 12-6 start behind Marbury and Kevin Garnett,
is only entertaining a possible deal for Marbury because of his
refusal to sign a long-term deal with the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has offered him a contract extension worth $70.875
million over six years, the maximum amount allowable, but his
distaste for the state's climate and lifestyle has led him to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury plans to become a free agent after the season. Faced
with the probability of losing Marbury and getting nothing in
return, the Timberwolves, who lost All-Star forward Tom Gugliotta
as a free agent before this season, is looking for the best deal
available.
</P>
<P>
   While numerous teams would offer more than Cassell for Marbury,
who is averaging 18 points and 9.3 assists, league rules require
that players' salaries be within 15 percent of one another for a
trade to take place. With Marbury making $2.56 million and Cassell
$3 million, the deal is possible. Not many other top-notch players
make only about $3 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell is not on Marbury's level, but he averaged 19.6 points
and 8 assists last season, and he is arguably one of the top point
guards in the Eastern Conference. His missing 14 games this season
because of a sprained right ankle is one of the major reasons for
the Nets' decline.
</P>
<P>
   If the trade happens, the Nets will sign Marbury to a six-year,
$67.5 million contract extension, the maximum amount allowable,
before Saturday's deadline for extending the contracts of
third-year players. Though the Nets are floundering, Marbury would
perhaps choose to sign an extended deal with them because of his
desire to live near New York City and the club's strong nucleus of
Keith Van Horn, Jayson Williams and Kittles.

BOOK WILL HELP SKIPPERS AVOID MISFORTUNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The airline pilot is fortunate. Before allowed
into the cockpit of a 747, he or she will log many hours at the
controls of a flight simulator, being tested on a baffling array of
unlikely systems failures in all possible weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the case with the skipper of a pleasure craft, whose
first encounters with trouble will be of the real variety. And no
matter how many man-overboard drills have been performed, they will
not help to resolve a mainsail that can't be hoisted after the
engine goes poof, as the authors of ``What Now Skipper? Forty
Fiendish Challenges to Your Seamanship Skills'' (Sheridan House;
$16.50) point out.
</P>
<P>
   The title poses 40 dastardly scenarios cooked up by one of four
experts, provides a response by a different expert and takes a stab
at a ``correct'' action by the scenario's original author. An
example of a problem, followed by the book's solution: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pillar was visible off the starboard bow and perfectly
matched the description of the lighthouse in the piloting guide.
They had successfully crossed the channel for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep her heading south,'' the skipper's wife called out, her
face buried in a chart. The piloting guidebook advised giving the
point and its off-lying rocks a wide berth. Another promontory had
become visible. The feature matched those on the chart as well, but
one problem: Neither the features of the harbor, where they would
tie up for the night, nor of the town were visible; the low
afternoon sun made it impossible to identify any detail on the
coast.
</P>
<P>
   It would be high tide in half an hour and the guide noted that
the harbor entrance is unnavigable two hours after high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely we could motor slowly in, keeping a close eye on the
echo sounder,'' urged the wife, who had her heart set on a nice
dinner at a harborside cafe.
</P>
<P>
   The husband did not want to close the coast under these
circumstances but rather wanted to beat to windward to a larger,
better-marked harbor to the west. However, they would not get there
until first light the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the best move?
</P>
<P>
   The book's two experts who commented on the scenario agree with
the wife. The skipper is being overly cautious, they say. Harbor
markings are tough to pick out from five miles out, even more so
when looking into the sun. The skipper should listen to his wife
and edge in on his course, correcting for compass and tide. Says
one author: ``Close the land, navigating carefully and watching the
echo sounder, and all will be revealed.''

KIDD'S WEDDING PRESENT  
 NUPTIALS GIVE SUN SPOT ON U.S. TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's a safe bet that Detroit star Grant Hill is going
to get a nice wedding gift from Suns guard Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   Hill informed USA Basketball officials that he won't be able to
participate with the U.S. Men's Senior National Team this summer
that will try to qualify for the 2000 Olympics Games at Sydney,
Australia. Hill is getting married in July, and the tournament runs
July 14-25 in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kidd's ticket to the qualifying tournament, and if the
U.S. team finishes first or second _ and anything less than first
would be regarded as a monumental upset _ Kidd and Suns teammate
Tom Gugliotta will represent their country at the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to call his mom and find out where he's
registered,'' Kidd said. ``And it won't be Target.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta had been told earlier that he would be among the nine
NBA players selected for the team that will compete in Puerto Rico.
The 12-man team for Puerto Rico also will include three players
selected from the collegiate ranks, the Continental Basketball
Association or from Americans playing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd wasn't among the first nine, but the announcement was
delayed until Hill's replacement was selected. Three NBA players
will be added for the 2000 Games to the original nine, meaning Hill
could, and probably will, wind up on the squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to have the opportunity to represent my
country,'' Kidd said. ``It's a kid's dream and an ultimate goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta said Kidd's selection was ``obviously well deserved''
and Kidd's style of play will complement the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get to play with a player like Jason who can
literally dominate a game without scoring a point with rebounding,
passing . . . you love to play with guys like that,'' Gugliotta
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's play in the first month of the NBA season, which included
four triple-double games _ double figures in scoring, rebounds and
assists _ no doubt opened eyes at USA Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to do anything to get on the team,'' Kidd
said. ``They told me I was having a great season, maybe it was a
turning point. Maybe they saw I could hit a couple of jump shots.
That's the thing that's usually the negative. The game is not
totally about shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd is among three point guards chosen for the first nine.
Miami's Tim Hardaway and Seattle's Gary Payton are the other point
guards. Atlanta's Steve Smith and New York's Allan Houston are
shooting guards. Gugliotta, his former Minnesota teammate, Kevin
Garnett, and Seattle's Vin Baker are the forwards. And San
Antonio's Tim Duncan is the only center named.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jason would have been picked the first time around,
but he has similarities to Gary Payton, who they were building the
team around,'' Suns Coach Danny Ainge said. ``He's been fantastic
for us. He's one of the premier players in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Basketball is likely to add another small forward, a
shooting guard and another center. Shaquille O'Neal of the Los
Angeles Lakers, Hill and the Lakers' Kobe Bryant are likely
candidates for the remaining spots.

LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST NEW YORK CITY OVER CAR SEIZURES IN DRUNK
DRIVING CASES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Civil Liberties Union filed a class
action lawsuit Wednesday, asking a Manhattan state Supreme Court
justice to halt the Giuliani administration's new policy of seizing
the cars of people arrested for drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed on behalf of Pavel Grinberg, a 28-year-old
Staten Island man who the police said tested just over the legal
blood alcohol limit on the first night of the crackdown, is the
first to challenge the legality and constitutionality of the
policy. As of Wednesday afternoon, 79 cars had been seized in the
two-week-old initiative, which city officials are calling the
toughest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's filing was the first step in what is likely to be a
pitched legal battle that could drag on for months. The first
skirmish may occur Thursday morning when Justice Michael D.
Stallman is expected to hold a hearing in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan on the lawsuit's demand that Grinberg's car be
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will most likely draw interest from across the state
and the nation. Officials in Nassau and Suffolk Counties have
adopted similar car seizure policies, and Mayor Richard M. Daley of
Chicago has said he may try a similar approach.
</P>
<P>
   City officials predicted that the seizure initiative would
stand. ``We are extremely confident of the legal basis for this
initiative,'' said Daniel S. Connolly, a special counsel in the
city's Law Department. ``We will address all of the concerns
raised.''
</P>
<P>
   But Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, predicted that the policy would be struck down,
calling it ``unfair and excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The government should not be in the business of seizing
people's cars without the requisite legal authority,'' he said.
``And, even if authorized, it should not do so prior to trial and
conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit focuses only on those charged with drunken driving
for the first time, like Grinberg, a custodian at the New York
Public Library, and argues that taking away their cars is an
``excessive and grossly disproportionate punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the 4,970 people charged with drunken driving last
year in the city had never been charged with it before, court
records show.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, the civil liberties group argued that the new
city policy was unconstitutional because only the legislative
branch of the government _ in this case the New York state
Legislature _ can determine the punishment for a crime.
</P>
<P>
   It also argued that the seizures were illegal because state law
authorizes the taking of property used in the commission of
felonies, not misdemeanors. Offenders are charged with misdemeanor
drunken driving if they have no prior record. Repeat offenders are
charged with felony drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   Grinberg's 1988 Acura is his family's only car. The lawsuit says
his family is enduring ``great hardship'' as they struggle to get
around without a car in their neighborhoo.

LEE FINALLY SIGNS UP FOR YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Diamondbacks have all their roster players under
contract with the signing of first baseman  &UR; Travis Lee to a
one-year deal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola Jr. downplayed Lee's signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to be last, and it worked out he was last,''
Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   The club had until today to have Lee under contract. Financial
terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, one of the top National League rookies last season, hit
.269 and had 22 home runs and 72 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed Lee, who didn't play Wednesday against the
Oakland Athletics, never ceases to amaze Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travis could play shortstop,'' Showalter said. ``He was an
all-state quarterback right-handed. It's weird that he throws the
baseball left-handed.'' &QL; 
Hot bat &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Greg Colbrunn filled in at first for Lee and had four hits,
including three doubles, and four RBIs. He also made a couple of
nice plays defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn had only one hit in 10 previous at-bats this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel good coming in,'' Colbrunn said. ``I mean, it's
spring training. Some days, you're going to feel good. Some days,
you're going to feel bad.'' &QL; 
Seeing triple &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder  &UR; Luis Gonzalez, who had a triple in Wednesday's game,
is the father of 9-month-old triplets. He said his wife brings them
to the ballpark, but only one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll bring them up to the press box and see how these guys do
with them crawling all over their papers,'' Gonzalez said. &QL; 
Eager to play &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tony Womack, making the transition from second base to the
outfield, is ready to get back on the field after suffering a
broken bone in his right wrist when hit by a pitch in a game
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He is back on the field, working out, at least. Showalter said
that earlier in the week, despite wearing a cast on his right arm,
Womack was catching fly balls and taking short toss with his left
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Womack will be back this week, Showalter said,
``He'd like to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Womack won't likely be ready to play in a game for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't think the diagnosis was right at first,'' Showalter
said. ``He said, `It can't be right. It feels too good.' '' &QL; 
Short stops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks won their seventh straight game Wednesday,
collecting 21 hits in a 13-2 rout of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said he'll likely make two more player cuts either
today or Friday, likely in the pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder  &UR; Jason Conti, the organization's minor league
Player of the Year last summer, said he is enjoying seeing the
Valley this spring. Conti was raised in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``This beats the cold weather,'' he said. ``They're probably not
even playing baseball right now where I'm from.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Randy Johnson will take the mound today at Tucson Electric Park
against the Chicago Cubs and possibly  &UR; Sammy Sosa, if Sosa makes
the trip.

CHAMELEON MELDS INTO DIAMONDBACKS PLAN  
 FOX EASILY ADAPTS TO MANY POSITIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - Andy Fox is making the rounds. He fields grounders at
second. He grabs his first-basemen's mitt and takes throws. He goes
into the outfield for some flies.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate utility man again is ready to plug in at any
position _ well, maybe not pitcher _ for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Andy have a way of finding at-bats,'' Manager Buck
Showalter said. ``They find a way of getting into the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, listed as an infielder, started at six positions for
Arizona last season: second, first, third, and all three outfield
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, coming in, you've got to be ready to play every
position,'' Fox said. ``If something happens to somebody, there
aren't any big surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter wasn't surprised at how versatile the 6-foot-4,
left-handed-hitting Fox was last year when he played in 139 games
and had 502 plate appearances. He hit leadoff and third, at times,
and hit .277 with 21 doubles. He was second on the team with six
triples. He also had nine homers and drove in 44 runs and scored 67
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will have more competition with more versatility added to
the team.
</P>
<P>
   Backup first baseman Greg Colbrunn can also play outfield and
third base and, right now, is the third catcher in camp. Second
baseman Tony Womack is being turned into an outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   And there is Jay Bell, who moved from shortstop to second base
late last season for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest improvements I think in our club,
potentially, is some of our support players, guys who have
versatility,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   So where does Fox fit in? Try everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy will always fit in,'' Showalter said. ``He'll fit in on
any club until he decides to quit playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Fox is just trying to get over the flu that kept him
out for three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' he said. ``You don't ever want to miss any
time. Hopefully, I've got this stuff out of my system now. I'm just
glad it happened now instead of later.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who got married in the off-season, worked out Wednesday at
Municipal Stadium before the Diamondbacks played the Oakland
Athletics in a Cactus League game.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't expect his role to diminish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the competition,'' he said. ``With competition, you've
got to be ready every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself on the bench all the time. I'll have my
at-bats. I'll get my chances. If you hit, you're going to find
places to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox filled in so well that third baseman Matt Williams thought
Fox was the Diamondbacks' most valuable player last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he didn't do was pitch and catch,'' Williams said. ``A lot
of teams aren't blessed with a guy that valuable. He can fill in
anywhere, not only when there are injuries but when a guy needs a
day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not be a starting player, but there is no reason why he
can't be out there at least three days a week. He's willing and
able to play any position. He's a pretty valuable guy.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Travis Lee, whose locker sits next to Fox's,
appreciates not only Fox's work ethic and versatility but his
clubhouse manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taught me to clean up my locker,'' Lee said. ``I know how
to hang up my shorts and shirts now. He's a good guy to have
around.''

WEIGHT LOSS MAY HAVE COST WAITE  
 BACKUP GOALIE DROPS 22 POUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Coyotes backup goalie Jimmy Waite has lost 10 percent
of his body weight since the start of the season, which might have
led to his mid-season slump and caused the team to place him on
waivers for the purpose of reassigning him to Springfield in the
AHL.
</P>
<P>
   Waite, who was listed at 180 pounds entering last year's
playoffs, had bulked up to 202 when he reported for training camp
but has lost 22 pounds and weighed 180 when the Coyotes placed him
on waivers Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The weight loss wasn't lost on goaltending coach Benoit Allaire
and Coach Jim Schoenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bulked up in the summer and could afford to lose a little
bit,'' Schoenfeld said. ``But you can't be mentally or physically
sharp when you lose that much weight. It's something we addressed
for a month now with Jimmy and the training staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's about preparation and taking care of yourself. It's
a situation where you have to take your nourishment. If somebody
gained 20 pounds we would be all over them. You'll have to talk to
Jimmy, maybe he has a nervous disorder where he says he can't eat.
But he just weakens himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Waite confirmed he has lost weight, but thinks it's only part of
the wear and tear of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have,'' said Waite, who had not been claimed by another
NHL team through Wednesday evening. ``But I always lose weight
during the season. I don't have as much chance to work out with
weights during the season. I also tend to dehydrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he think the weight loss contributed to his ineffectiveness
of late?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Waite said. ``There were a few games when I
didn't feel as strong as normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Allaire said he talked to Waite after he lost 10 pounds, and
several more times about the importance of taking dietary
supplements and fluids to maintain his weight. Waite is often
nervous before games, and Allaire said he sometimes forgets to
ingest enough fluids during a game, which can effect his strength
as a game proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm trying to do right now,'' Waite said. ``I'm
trying to get my weight up, and I'm taking more vitamins.''
</P>
<P>
   Waite became dehydrated and required intravenous fluids after
winning his first start for the Coyotes last season, a 3-2 win at
San Jose on Nov. 13, 1997, after being obtained on waivers from
Chicago on Sept. 28, 1997. He hasn't had the problem since.
</P>
<P>
   Waite, 29, was the stingiest goalie in the NHL at this season's
start, bolting to a 6-0-2 record with a goals against average of
less than 2.00 per game. But he has not won since, posting an 0-5-2
record since his last win, a 4-2 victory over Montreal on Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   His save percentage has steadily dropped from 96 percent in
October and November, to 87.4 percent in December, to 86.7 in
January and finally to 82 percent during February, caused, in part,
by steadily decreasing appearances and missing some time with a
hand injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes reassigned him to Springfield for six games to work
on his game and confidence from Feb. 16 through March 1. He
returned March 2 against Detroit and gave up four goals on 10 shots
in a 7-2 loss that he said is the reason why he's being reassigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how fair it was,'' he said Monday. ``I mean, I
had just come back up from Springfield and I was thrown in right
away against one of the better teams in the league and we had
something like seven guys out. If I had won that game everything
would have been all right. I wouldn't be going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Waite, an unrestricted free agent at season's end, refused to
accept reassignment to Springfield, forcing the team to place him
on waivers, where he could be claimed first by other NHL teams. If
he clears waivers by noon (Phoenix time) today, he will remain
Coyotes' property and said he will accept the reassignment. &QL;

EDITORIAL: FAIRNESS FOR BLACK COLLEGE ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 12:
</P>
<P>
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association will need to devise
new eligibility requirements for student athletes that preserve
academic values without at the same time discriminating against
African-Americans. That is the practical meaning of District Judge
Ronald L. Buckwalter's ruling on Monday that the NCAA's system of
basing eligibility largely on standardized test scores is unfair to
blacks. The ruling does not mean that colleges should abandon their
worthwhile and necessary efforts to improve graduation rates among
athletes. It does mean finding fairer ways to measure academic
potential.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case, brought by four black student athletes who
were ruled ineligible to play sports in their freshman year because
of low admissions scores, was a rule known as Proposition 16.
Instituted by the NCAA in 1996, Proposition 16 tried to address
well-documented charges that the aggressive competition to enroll
athletic talent had created a universe of students who were badly
prepared for academic life and stood little chance of graduating.
</P>
<P>
   The rule requires a minimum score of 820 on the SAT's for
students with a 2.5 or higher grade point average in a ``core''
high school curriculum of 13 courses. A higher SAT score is
required of students with lower grades. The rule gives twice as
much weight to the SAT score as it does the grade point average.
</P>
<P>
   According to NCAA figures, 26.6 percent of the black students
who applied for eligibility in 1996 did not meet Proposition 16
standards, compared with 6.4 percent of white student athletes. The
main reason for their not meeting the standards was a failure to
achieve the minimum SAT score. The plaintiffs' lawyers also argued
that the test score was a flawed predictor of academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial piece of evidence, plucked from the NCAA's own data,
showed that student athletes who fell just below the 820 cutoff
point _ and were admitted but were denied athletic eligibility in
their freshman year _ wound up getting the same or even better
grades than those who barely met the 820 minimum. Those below the
line were mostly black, those above were mostly white.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs did not deny that efforts to raise entrance
standards for student athletes had led to a modest improvement in
graduation rates. But they argued that this improvement had been
achieved at the expense of denying eligibility, and in many cases
athletic scholarships, to a disproportionate percentage of blacks.
A supposedly neutral standard had in fact imposed an unfair burden
_ a ``disparate impact,'' in the judge's words _ on black student
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA, warning of chaos now that colleges have been left
without any guidance at all, says it will ask for a stay of the
ruling while it reviews Proposition 16 and seeks ways to change it.
It should not have to look far. Last year a special NCAA
subcommittee recommended alternatives to the present system,
including one that would base eligibility on an equally weighted
combination of high school grades and test scores.
</P>
<P>
   These recommendations should now be reconsidered. Given the
hotly competitive nature of college sports, it would be foolish to
return to a system where each school sets its own rules. Minimum
standards make sense for everyone, most of all the student athletes
who should be expected to value a degree as much as they do playing
time. But the standards should not deny black athletes a fair shot
at obtaining both.

HUSCROFT HAPPY WITH `PROMOTION'  
 DEFENSEMAN ADDS TOUGHNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Jamie Huscroft couldn't help but overhear the
conversation between the two men behind him on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran NHL defenseman had just been traded from the
Vancouver Canucks to the Coyotes, and on the flight to San Jose to
join his new team, his ears were burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know who these guys were, and they didn't know who I
was,'' Huscroft said, starting to smile. ``I was just sitting there
reading a book when they came on, and I wasn't eavesdropping on
them or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   So what did they say?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Huscroft said, ``I overheard one of them say, `Did you
hear some guy from the Canucks got promoted today?' And his buddy
goes, `Don't you mean he got traded?' And the guy says, `No, he got
promoted!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, just getting out of a Canucks sweater is a step up
in employment to disillusioned Vancouver fans. Little did the two
fellows know who was sitting directly in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just smiled,'' the mustachioed Huscroft said, ``but that was
definitely a slap in the face for Vancouver. The team is
struggling, yeah, but I'm a huge Vancouver fan. They've got a great
organization there, and (General Manager) Brian Burke is
first-class. I'd never say anything to hurt him in any way, shape
or form.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I kind of laughed a little bit and shook my head,
too, at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Huscroft, 32, won't have any problem trying to stick it to the
woeful Canucks tonight, however, when they visit the Coyotes
(31-23-10) at America West Arena. He wasn't particularly pleased
with the way Coach Marc Crawford viewed or utilized his abilities
after stepping behind the bench at the All-Star break to replace
the fired Mike Keenan.
</P>
<P>
   Huscroft said Crawford felt the Canucks (19-35-10 entering
Wednesday's game at Anaheim) were overloaded with toughness and
grit, so players like himself, a physical, 6-foot-2, 212-pound
wrecking ball, slowly got played out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happens when a new sheriff comes to town, but what
can you do?'' said Huscroft, who was made an on-again, off-again
healthy scratch by Crawford. ``I have total respect for his
decisions. He's the coach, not me.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop the nine-year NHL pro from seeking a trade,
however, which Burke granted Tuesday after he swung a deal with the
Coyotes' Bobby Smith for a conditional draft pick in this year's
draft. Getting a chance to play his brand of punishing hockey
against Crawford and the Canucks just three days afterward
undoubtably will give Huscroft an extra jump.
</P>
<P>
   He showed plenty of that in his Phoenix debut Tuesday night
against the Sharks, shoving, slamming and steamrolling several San
Jose players. He was so excited, he literally hurdled over the
bench on his way ``back'' from shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had a very spirited game,'' said Coyotes Coach
Jim Schoenfeld, who coached Huscroft for parts of two seasons with
the New Jersey Devils. ``He played his position well. He was
abrasive out there. It was pretty much everything we expected. It's
too bad some other guys weren't what we expected them to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks overwhelmed the Coyotes in the third period for a 4-2
victory, handing Phoenix its 10th loss in 12 games, further
loosening the team's grip on the No. 4 playoff spot in the Western
Conference. Suddenly, that punch line on the plane about being
``promoted'' from the Canucks doesn't seem so funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a way better team than them,'' Huscroft said of
the Sharks, who are trying to hang on to the eighth and final
playoff seed. ``I don't know if that's a little too premature to
say, but I felt we should have beat those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Huscroft might not have the hands of a scorer or the skating
maneuvers of a top-four defenseman, but he has the heart and the
hustle. He's a hockey player, plain and simple. What you see is
what you get. And it's what the Coyotes' desperately needed.
</P>
<P>
   He illustrated the point perfectly Tuesday night, when a slice
of post-game pizza slipped out of his hands and fell to the locker
room floor while he chatted with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He picked it up and took another bite. &QL;

OLD GUARD STANDS PROUD AT WEST SUBRE GIONAL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ They were there in the days when lapels were as wide as
the three-second lane, when players wore their hair long and
uniform trunks short, and before every true American began ponying
up $5 each March to enter the NCAA Basketball Tournament pool at
the office.
</P>
<P>
   Other than off-season golf tournaments and vacations sponsored
by shoe companies, there won't be many larger gatherings of
experienced, successful basketball coaches than there is this week
during the West Regional's first and second rounds at McNichols
Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's Norm Stewart, 63, is in his 38th season of college
coaching. Iowa's Tom Davis, 60, is in his 28th. Connecticut's Jim
Calhoun, 56, has 27 seasons of experience. New Mexico's Dave Bliss,
55, is in his 24th year, and Arkansas' Nolan Richardson, 57, is in
his 19th.
</P>
<P>
   That's a combined 136 seasons and an average season record of
20-10. Only one of the five, Richardson, has won a national
championship, but longevity should also count for something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you define (success),'' Stewart said.
``Surviving is one. Winning a national championship is another.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the five entered coaching with winning an NCAA title in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us from that era, we were trained as teachers,'' said
Davis, who is in his last season at Iowa. ``Most of us figured we
were going to be high school coaches. That's how I started out.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, Calhoun and Richardson started their careers coaching in
high school. Stewart spent a year playing pro basketball and
baseball before returning to Missouri, his alma mater, as an
assistant. Bliss worked for IBM and Proctor and Gamble after
graduating from Cornell and before returning there for his
master's.
</P>
<P>
   He was then drafted into the Army and became an assistant for
Bob Knight at West Point.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss and Stewart will renew their old rivalry today when
Missouri, the eighth seed, plays New Mexico, the ninth seed, at
5:50 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss, formerly at Oklahoma, coached against Stewart in the days
of the old Big Eight Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norm Stewart's been there since Moses came down,'' Bliss said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, the top seed, plays 16th-seeded Texas-San Antonio
in the final game of the day at 8:20 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas, the fourth seed, plays 13th-seeded Siena at 1:10 p.m.
But the most intriguing story of the day could come in the first
game, when fifth-seeded Iowa plays 12th-seeded Alabama-Birmingham
at 10:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly a year ago that Davis announced this would be his
last season at Iowa after Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby declined to
extend his contract.
</P>
<P>
   It placed Bowlsby, and Davis's critics, in an uncomfortable
situation. There is no classier coach than Davis. He's run a clean
program in his 13 seasons in Iowa City, and has won more games in a
shorter time span than any other Iowa coach. His Hawkeye teams have
won 20 games nine times and have earned 9 NCAA tournament bids.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a feeling that the Hawkeyes could do better. While
Davis has never lost a first-round game in the NCAA Tournament, he
hasn't won a Big Ten championship either.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 60, has handled the messy situation with dignity all year
long, deflecting questions about the end of a career that began at
a high school in Milledgeville, Ill. If he is growing sentimental
about his last season at Iowa, he's keeping it well hidden. At
Wednesday's press conference his most controversial comment was:
`It's not been the easiest conditions in which to work under.``
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Calhoun pulled Davis aside and told the Iowa coach
that he served as a role model for other coaches. ``The thing most
memorable to me is the way he handled it,`` Calhoun said. ``Not an
ounce of gloat or anything, except for coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and his players talk of staying in the moment and focusing
only on today's game against Alabama-Birmingham. It's not going to
be easy, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing for coach has been the greatest basketball experience
of my life,'' said guard Kent McCausland, a senior from Waterloo,
Iowa. ``It was more than wanting to be a Hawkeye growing up, it was
wanting to play for Coach Davis.''

WITH STOCKTON IN CORNER, GONZAGA PACKING PUNCH

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Gonzaga's most famous student was booted out of
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumor has it that Bing Crosby got kicked out for throwing a
piano off the third floor of a dormitory,'' Gonzaga guard Richie
Frahm said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that Bing Crosby, the crooner who made ``White Christmas''
the No. 1 best-selling record of all time.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't leave the Spokane, Wash., school in the mid-1930s with
any hard feelings. The Crosby House, an alumni center, is named for
him.
</P>
<P>
   The second-most famous Gonzaga student got teary-eyed and hoarse
as he sat in his hotel room in Portland and watched on TV the West
Coast Conference final between the Bulldogs and Santa Clara on
March 1. Gonzaga won, 91-66, at Santa Clara to advance to the NCAA
Tournament for only the second time in school history.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-seeded Bulldogs (25-6) meet seventh-seeded Minnesota
(17-10) in a West Regional first-round game this afternoon at
KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Utah Jazz guard John Stockton, a Gonzaga product, made sure he
was the first to call the players and congratulate them.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga guard Matt Santangelo said ``Mr. Stockton'' has been a
great friend of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Stockton?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't call him that to his face,'' Gonzaga guard Matt
Santangelo said. ``I call him John. But when I talk about him to
anyone else, it's Mr. Stockton. I just have a tremendous amount of
respect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga has gained a tremendous amount of respect around the
nation by winning 49 games the past two seasons, many at their home
court, the Kennel.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Bulldogs beat Washington and Washington State
of the Pac-10, the first time they've defeated both in the same
season in 55 years.
</P>
<P>
   They also led Kansas, ranked eighth in the country at the time,
for a half on the road before losing; beat Memphis and played at
Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we can play with anybody,'' Frahm said. ``I think
we're going to be an overachiever in the NCAA Tournament starting
with (today).''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs win because of their hot-shooting guards _ Frahm
(14.2 scoring average) and Santangelo (12.7).
</P>
<P>
   In the conference tournament title game, Gonzaga hit 18
three-point field goals, eight by Santangelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last two years, Mr. Stockton has taken me aside to
work out with him,'' said Santangelo, a 6-foot-1 junior from
Portland. ``It consists of basically a shooting routine and maybe
some one-on-one. The lessons I've learned after playing with him
are competitiveness, scrap, desire and the know-how to win. Those
are the things I've most tried to copy from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of the Bulldogs were highly recruited. Center Jeremy Eaton,
6-9, is known as much for his calf roping than he is for his
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   He could be the tallest team roper in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I do (in the summer) instead of working,'' Eaton
said. ``Most of the (ropers) call me, `Stretch.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga has done so well, it could lose its second-year coach,
Dan Monson, son of former Oregon Coach Don Monson.
</P>
<P>
   Monson, 38, is expected to be a candidate to replace Kevin
Eastman at Washington State. Eastman resigned under pressure
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach is going to be a hot commodity,'' Frahm said. ``It's
interesting to see what he does, where he goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Monson said he isn't thinking about going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for Kevin Eastman,'' Monson said. ``He's a good
coach. He does it the right way. My family went through the same
situation at Oregon, so I have compassion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any interest in any other job. I love it at
Gonzaga. My parents live there. I'm marrying a girl from there.
I've preached to the kids that team comes first. It would be
selfish of me to say that and to be worrying about other jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Monson and the Bulldogs enter the tournament loose. They ended
practice Wednesday with the coach hitting two half-court shots, one
on each end of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been on fire all year,'' Santangelo said. ``We (shoot
half-court shots) before every game. It doesn't surprise me that he
steps up before the big games.''

WILDCATS GIVE CREDIT TO `COACH O' FOR ONGOING SUC CESS 
</HEADLINE>

   MILWAUKEE _ Even the premier basketball programs like Duke,
Kentucky, UCLA and Kansas have slip-ups. Somewhere along the way a
subpar season that puts them either into the NIT or in front of a
television to watch the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   With more top players bolting for the pros early into their
college careers, maintaining continuity is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what's happened at Arizona, which this season
has extended the second-longest streak in NCAA Tournament history
to 15 consecutive appearances. Record-holder North Carolina made
the field for the 25th straight year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats (22-6, fourth seed in the Midwest Region) meet
Oklahoma (20-10, 13th seed) Friday afternoon at approximately 1
p.m. Arizona time.
</P>
<P>
   If the Wildcats were going to falter, this might have been the
year. They had to replace four starters who won the NCAA title two
years ago and won 30 games last year.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to astute judgment four years ago, the Wildcats held
their ground. It was then, a year before he signed Mike Bibby, that
UA Coach Lute Olson recruited Jason Terry. Olson wouldn't have
gotten a player like Terry if Bibby were already in the program.
But even after Bibby arrived, Terry stayed with the program,
content as sixth man while Bibby started at point guard for two
seasons before bailing for the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to dodge the bullet this year because of the
great play of these seniors,'' Olson said, referring not only to
Terry, a first-team All-American, but also all-conference center
A.J. Bramlett.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this UA team if freshmen Ruben Douglas and Traves Wilson
had manned the backcourt spots alone. Terry led the Pac-10 in
scoring, assists and steals and made critical shots time after time
in close games. In the process, he has claimed every national
player of the year award announced thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Olson handed the ball to Terry in October, and he's been in
nearly every minute of every game since. And Arizona's long
tournament streak lives another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's been a strength of this program it's been the
ability to get the pieces to fit,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no secret why we're in the tournament 15 years in a
row,'' said power forward Michael Wright, the Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year. ``It's Coach O. He teaches us how to play, and he gets us
to work hard at it. That's why there are no downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry said it goes beyond that, to Olson recognizing the impact
of guards on the college game, and placing an importance there in
recruiting. Terry said the family atmosphere that permeates the
program, in which Olson gives veteran players blackball authority
on prospective recruits, is equally important.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just got to credit Coach O and his recruiting style and
how the program is set up,'' Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives guards a lot of freedom. Guards dictate the style of
play you have. That's why he has had so many great guards in the
past and why he'll continue to have them.''
</P>
<P>
   The progression of guards began with Steve Kerr, followed by
Khalid Reeves, Damon Stoudamire, Bibby, and Terry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always prided ourselves here as being a teaching
staff,'' Olson said. ``It's not a case of us rolling the ball out
and screaming and hollering and not going about teaching things in
a normal progression. That's part of the reason we've had guys go
out of the program and do very well overseas or in the NBA because
they've been taught the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's working. With this 15th straight NCAA Tournament
appearance, Olson passes John Thompson, who stepped down this
season at Georgetown, for the second place all-time. Former North
Carolina Coach Dean Smith, who retired two years ago, holds the
record with 23 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, Olson likely will break another milestone record.
With 395 wins at Arizona, Olson is eight away from passing
legendary Fred Enke for coaching victories at the school. It took
Enke 29 years. Next year will be Olson's 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's the best coach in America,'' freshman Richard
Jefferson said. ``He's a great coach, he recruits great players, he
has great assistant coaches, and he's in a great place. That's why
he has a winning tradition. It's not rocket science. It's just a
matter of doing what he needs to to to be successful.'' &QL;

HERE'S A THEORY: BIG GUN, BIG BANG  
 50-CALIBER RIFLE RE VERBERATES WITH POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The .50-caliber rifle has been reborn, and that has
sparked some controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Big cartridge rifles have been around for a long time, spawned
by the British .55-caliber rifles that were used as anti-tank
weapons in the world wars.
</P>
<P>
   The .50-caliber variety was used in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Rock McMillan, president of the McMillan Brothers Rifle Co. in
north Phoenix, said the sporting use of the 50s began in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan also manufactures what generally are considered to be
the best fiberglass rifle stocks anywhere. The custom rifles
themselves aren't too shabby.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan said the development of effective muzzle breaks, which
redirect muzzle blast to the rear and thus lessen the recoil,
helped make the .50-caliber rifle ``more feasible,'' according to
McMillan, whose company makes 50s.
</P>
<P>
   The .50 is a huge gun. Target shooting models weigh somewhere
near 50 pounds. Some of the hunting varieties weigh around 32
pounds. A standard hunting rifle weighs about nine pounds, and you
know how heavy they get when carrying them long distances.
</P>
<P>
   This obviously isn't a firearm you carry too far.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1986, Rock's father, the company's founder, was
approached by the military to build a .50-caliber rifle. The
25-pound gun was to be used mainly as a sniper rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the same quarters with McMillan is Arizona Ammunition,
owned by Jim Schmidt of Phoenix. It's a small company that builds
custom shells for various guns. Sixty percent of its business,
according to Schmidt, is ammunition for 50-caliber rifles. In fact,
his is the largest producer of 50-caliber rifle ammunition in the
world. There are no main-line companies making the shells in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   The gun is controversial because it's big, it's loud, and it's
becoming more and more popular. It is banned at Ben Avery Schooting
Facility in north Phoenix until a new range can be built to
accommodate the gun safely.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt is an interesting man. He was a top official in Phoenix
bus transit. He also was involved with transportation in the
Atlanta Olympics and head of transportation for Woodstock. He'll do
the same this year for Woodstock '99.
</P>
<P>
   There are larger projectiles than the .50-caliber. The so-called
elephant guns, usually with side-by-side barrels, have the size but
not the speed of a 50.
</P>
<P>
   The 577 nitro develops 10,000 foot pounds of energy at the
muzzle. The 700 nitro, a larger gun, develops 8,900 foot pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The .50-caliber yields 13,000 foot pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the speed and weight of the .50-caliber round, it is
far less effected by wind, a major cause of inaccuracy at long
ranges.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes it an excellent long-range gun,'' Schmidt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt makes ammunition for the military, law enforcement
agencies, hunters and target shooters. He also sells shells to the
U.S. Department of Energy and a number of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a cheap game. Normal .50-caliber shells sell for $5
apiece. Specialty shells sell for more than twice that much.
</P>
<P>
   How far can the 50 shoot accurately? Buddy Clifton, who is a
three-time world champion with the 50, can hit a four-inch grouping
at 1,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Army is testing Schmidt's loads that will be
accurate at 2,000 yards. Imagine what kind of scope it will take to
shoot at that distance.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters using the 50 don't exactly walk around in the forest
carrying the gun. It's too heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the hunters are real serious trophy hunters,'' Schmidt
said. ``They'll lie in the woods in the same spot all day for a
really big elk. They're looking for animals they can't get close
to. Most of their shots are under 1,000 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said one customer bought ammunition to kill feral pigs
in Texas. The man was a rancher south of Corpus Christi, and the
pigs were eating all his cattle food.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they even saw the dust from his pickup, they'd take off,''
Schmidt said. ``He needed to shoot them at 800 to 1,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages Schmidt has in the market is that he has
several methods of coating bullets to perform better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a real leader in that,'' he said. ``We're also
constantly testing our ammunition in all kinds of guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers send them their guns, and Schmidt tests them with
various ammunition to see what works best.
</P>
<P>
   To allow a reporter to test various rifles, Schmidt took him to
a shooting range.
</P>
<P>
   The first gun was a 30-378 made by McMillan. This magnum gun was
developed in the 1950s by Weatherby. But it didn't perform well
until new propellants and bullets were developed, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were three 50s: a McMillan bench rest for
competition, a Barrett semiautomatic for tactical use (such as
shooting criminals or enemies at long range) and an L.A.R. Grizzly
used for hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The McMillan, because of its competition stock, weighs 45 pounds
and sells for $5,000. You almost need a cart to move it. The
Barrett weighs about 35 pounds and sells for at least $6,000. But
SWAT teams and military snipers like it a lot. The L.A.R., which
has its bolt clear at the back, weighs 32 pounds and sells for
about $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan, Barrett, L.A.R., Armalight, A-Mac and ROBAR all
recommend Schmidt's ammunition for their rifles.
</P>
<P>
   All four rifles used at the range were equipped with muzzle
breaks. With the 50s at least it's necessary to keep the shooter
from lying on his back after a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-378, which moves at about 3,000 feet per second with
factory loads, was upgraded to 3,613 fps with Schmidt's ammunition.
The recoil wasn't uncomfortable from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The target 50 is so heavy it doesn't kick badly at all. But as
the weight decreased in the other two, the recoil was heavier but
not particularly uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   But as the rifle discharges, the shooter can't keep the gun
stationary. It moves back and the shooter with it.
</P>
<P>
   The muzzle break sends gases from the barrel around the shooter,
so you better stand directly behind or the discharge will cause
your hair to stand up. One round blew the carpet off the adjacent
bench and broke Schmidt's wind gauge.
</P>
<P>
   Some other shooters ask why anyone would buy a 50. The best
answer: because they want one. It's an expensive gun and expensive
to shoot. But hotrods are expensive and boats a black hole to throw
money into. But their owners want them.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt recommends only two brand name scopes for 50s: The
Leopold 16, 24 or 32 power and the Nightforce variable in the 24 or
32 power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 50 will tear up any other scope,'' he said. ``The 50 has
similar vibrations to an air gun, and most scope makers warn you
that their scopes can't be used on an air gun.'' &QL;

STUMBLING SUNS CAN'T STOP CAVS

<P>
   PHOENIX - The Suns need to hang one of those welcoming signs at
America West Arena that says: ``Mi Casa es su Casa''.
</P>
<P>
   ``My house is your house.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns made another guest feel right at home Wednesday night,
and they were booed off the floor for a second straight home game
after falling to the Cleveland Cavaliers, 86-73.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not taking care of our home court,'' said Suns guard
Jason Kidd. ``And it would be even worse if we weren't playing the
way we are on the road. We have to figure out how to play at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   They could start by figuring out how to score at home. The 73
points represents the club's lowest offensive output ever in a home
game _ America West or Veterans Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Only a 68-point effort against the Kansas City Kings in 1981 was
more pathetic than what the Suns accomplished against the
Cavaliers, and that was on the road. The Suns broke their previous
home worse of 74 set _ surprise _ earlier this season against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns fell to 4-6 on their own floor.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't come out as flat as they did in an embarrassing
defeat to the Sacramento Kings in their last home game, but their
shots weren't falling and their patience wore thin as the game
progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter where we play, we've got to make shots,''
forward Danny Manning said. ``It's rough to lose at home. It's
frustrating to see th e way we shot the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns shot just 35.4 percent, making 29 of 82 shots. They
turned the ball over 13 times, but it seemed as if the total might
be twice that. They were outrebounded 42-39, the seventh game in a
row they've been outrebounded.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cavaliers came into the game at the bottom of every
rebounding category in the league. The Cavaliers also had 10 steals
and the Suns three.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the Suns are losing more often than the ball is
their followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't blame it on the crowd,'' Manning said. ``We get booed
on the road, too. We've just got to go out and make it better.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, nothing seems to have accomplished that.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Jason Kidd talked to the club after a loss to the Los
Angeles Lakers, and they responded for one game, beating Seattle.
General Manager Bryan Colangelo cut short a trip to Europe to
return to the Valley after hearing about the Sacramento debacle.
And club President Jerry Colangelo said he spoke with Coach Danny
Ainge and forward Tom Gugliotta within the past couple of days to
try to determine why the Suns are in such a malaise.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers emerged from an ugly first half leading, 45-38,
after the Suns went almost eight minutes without a field goal
during one second-quarter stretch. The Suns shot 39 percent, and
they only got 36 field-goal attempts against the Cavaliers'
plodding style. The Suns turned the ball over eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cleveland forward Shawn Kemp had 14 first-quarter
points against the starting front line of Tom Gugliotta, Luc
Longley and Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said the Suns didn't even have time to get double-team
help to Kemp before he scored on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Suns reserve Clifford Robinson came off the bench to get Kemp
under control, and he scored only four more points the rest of the
way. But the Suns never could hit the important shots, and again
struggled to execute offensively in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a pattern,'' Ainge said. ``And that pattern is,
when we're struggling with our shooting, we're struggling to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not making enoughs shots right now. And we had some
breakdowns defensively in the fourth quarter that there is no
excuse for. I don't know if our team is suffering from a lack of
confidence right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a difficult time making baskets. There is no excuse for
those type of mistakes down the stretch. We're not focused, and
that's my job, to make sure guys are concentrating. If they're not,
I have to put guys out there that will. And it's very
discouraging.'' &QL;

KILLER OF STUDENT TOOK PAINS TO CONCEAL CLUES, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kansas) (sw) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The killer of a 26-year-old graduate student in
Brooklyn on Monday night was careful to conceal clues to the fatal
stabbing, apparently going so far as to wrap the murder weapon in
plastic before plunging it into the woman's back, law enforcement
officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that
the handle of the six-inch, smooth-edged kitchen knife used to kill
the victim, Amy Watkins, had been wrapped in a white shopping bag
before the attack and that there were no fingerprints. No blood was
found on the sidewalk near the body, a law enforcement official
said, and the knife was driven through Ms. Watkins's heavy winter
coat and wedged deeply into her back, indicating a killer of some
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins was killed shortly before 10 p.m. less than two
blocks from her home, as she was walking from a subway station.
Neighbors on the block said on Tuesday that they heard two distinct
screams, the first one of fear, the second in apparent pain. Ms.
Watkins was found clutching the bag of groceries she had bought
from a store on Flatbush Avenue, near the subway station.
</P>
<P>
   With little physical evidence and no apparent eyewitnesses to
the killing, detectives have continued combing the Prospect Heights
neighborhood, asking for help from residents and interviewing Ms.
Watkins' friends and neighbors. Police Commissioner Howard Safir
said on Wednesday that 25 homicide detectives were working on the
case but had yet to come up with any suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some leads that we are following but we could
certainly use help from anyone who has information relative to this
crime,'' Safir said. He added that although the police believe the
motive was robbery, ``we're not ruling anyone out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins, clad in a black overcoat, black wool cap, purple
gloves and a black and gold silk scarf, was found with no money,
purse or identification, the police said. An investigator who spoke
on the condition of anonymity said the police were trying to
determine whether she might have been killed by the same suspect
who robbed a pedestrian at knifepoint in the area a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The knife punctured one of Ms. Watkins's lungs and her aorta,
said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner's
office. She was pronounced dead at 10:45 p.m. at Interfaith Medical
Center.

<P>
   Once each spring, the players dutifully march before the hordes
of still and video photographers on picture day. The results grace
the ever-expanding variety of trading cards, and are also the ones
pulled later in the season for newspapers, ``plays of the day'' on
TV, and lineups on stadium jumbo screens.
</P>
<P>
   The rookies are the first ones out of the dugout, giving the
veterans a few more minutes of beauty sleep before they saunter
before the cameras.

   The players sometimes clown around, pitchers posing with bats
and left-handers switching to the right side of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it's usually only the best and most accurate
shots that make it onto the shelves and into the shoe boxes of
kids' card collections.
</P>
<P>
   The days of the nickel pack of five cards _ and a piece of often
stale, crumbly bubble gum _ have been replaced with flashy ones
that routinely cost up to $2 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball trading cards now top $525 million in annual retail
sales. The cards not only are an important revenue stream for
baseball owners and players, they provide an essential advertising
link to new generations of fans, especially young boys.
</P>
<P>
   Today's cards feature thicker paper, foil-treated to resist
scratches and fading, bobbing heads and authenticating holograms,
just like credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   But no gum.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, some of the higher-end cards sport actual player
signatures, not just machine copies. And a few of the most
expensive cards even have minute pieces of jersey and bats _
actually used by the players _ embedded right in the card.
</P>
<P>
   Also gone are the patently faked poses and over-exposed flashes
of baseball yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cards have action shots on them,'' said Terry Melia, media
manager for Upper Deck Co. of Carlsbad, Calif., one of four trading
card companies officially licensed by Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Some players are photographed several times a year as they go
from team to team through trades or free-agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always trying to keep up with the players,'' said Melia,
a former editor of ``Trading Cards Magazine.'' ``With free agency,
these guys jump ship quick.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of each card depends on its condition, its scarcity,
the popularity of the player and that player's achievements.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a mint condition 1968 Topps rookie card for pitcher
Nolan Ryan had been valued at nearly $850. When Ryan was inducted
into the Baseball Hall of Fame this past year, the value of that
card soared overnight to more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although baseball cards remain the most popular of all sports
trading cards, the most valuable card is that of recently retired
basketball superstar Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   An Upper Deck, personally autographed, limited edition,
sequentially numbered, Michael Jordan card with a swatch of one of
his jerseys, actually worn by during a game, is valued at nearly
$12,000, Melia said.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball trading cards originally were found in packs of cigars
and cigarettes. They made their real breakthrough when the Topps
Co. of New York started packing cards with gum in the 1950s, said
Colin Hagen, director of trading cards, collectibles and
memorabilia for Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1980s, Topps was synonymous with trading cards. By
the late '80s and early '90s, six companies were licensed to sell
the cards.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, two companies _ Pinnacle and Donruss _ have,
well, folded their cards.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Upper Deck and Topps, the industry shakeout still leaves
Pacific Trading Cards Co. of Seattle and Fleer/SkyBox International
of Mount Laurel, N.J. But the number of cards is proliferating,
thanks to a continuous demand for new and different cards,
especially those that incorporate new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Upper Deck, the only company licensed in five sports (baseball,
basketball, football, hockey and motor sports) carries six classes
of baseball cards, Melia said, and may have as many as 20 sets of
different cards issued each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's literally thousands of slides per sport, some of them
(thousands) per player, here at an extensive library,'' Melia said.
</P>
<P>
   Even for a relatively obscure player, such as Eddie Zosky, a
utility infielder for the Milwaukee Brewers, nearly 70 trading
cards have been issued.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest collectors are the players themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one of each,'' said Zosky, who has played for half a
dozen clubs and minor-league teams in his 11-year career, including
a stint with the former Phoenix Firebirds. ``I have some kids at
home. When they get older, it will be a big thrill for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Zosky's favorite photo? A rookie-idol card shot when Zosky
played with the Toronto Blue Jays, in which he got to share the
limelight with the iron man of baseball, the Baltimore Orioles' Cal
Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Zosky said he's never had a trading card photo he's ashamed of.
In fact, he said, ``It's an honor.'' &QL;

CLINTON SAYS U.S. WRONG FOR ROLE IN GUATEMALAN WAR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY _ President Clinton expressed regret Wednesday
that the United States supported government military forces
responsible for killing an estimated 200,000 civilians during
Guatemala's 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Guatemala City's anthropology museum, the president
embraced the findings of the Historical Clarification Commission,
formed to investigate human rights abuses during that period, which
reported U.S. involvement with government security forces
implicated in ``acts of genocide'' against civilians, mostly
Mayans, during the brutal civil war that ended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ``support for military forces or intelligence units
which engaged in violence or widespread repression described in the
report was wrong,'' Clinton said. ``The United States must not
repeat that mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's statement, which aides declined to amplify or
characterize as an apology, came during the third day of a Central
American tour to reassure nations crippled by Hurricane Mitch of
U.S. plans to help with rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   As at earlier stops, Clinton promised ``justice and fairness''
for Central Americans seeking to migrate to the United States, but
he stood firm against illegal immigration, saying it ``undermines
the control of our borders.''
</P>
<P>
   When he reached Guatemala, participants in a roundtable
discussion on peace in the region called on him to address the
findings of the commission, also known as the ``truth commission.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission report, issued Feb. 25, contradicts years of
official U.S. denials that it trained and financed the Guatemalan
military.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. support for Guatemala's right-wing government and
military has been alleged for years, the nine-volume report
confirmed that the Central Intelligence Agency aided Guatemalan
forces and ``had a significant bearing on human rights violations
during the armed confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seek an apology _ Clinton apologized last year in
Rwanda for U.S. negligence in stopping genocide there _ Guatemalan
Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein Barillas urged the president to
offer Guatemalans ``an uplifting message.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the work of the commission, which was set up as
part of the 1996 peace accord, ``shows how far Guatemala has
traveled in overcoming that painful period.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to promise U.S. support for redevelopment programs in
communities hardest hit, in some cases destroyed, by the
Washington-backed Guatemalan military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must, and we will ... continue to support the peace and
reconciliation process in Guatemala,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The civil war broke out in 1960 between the rightist
military-controlled government and left-wing insurgents, who were
largely concentrated in regions populated mostly by Mayans.
Assuming that Mayans were sympathizing with guerillas, military
security forces burned villages and slaughtered inhabitants to cut
off supplies and deny shelter to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Newly declassified U.S. intelligence documents surfaced in
Washington on Wednesday that indicate the United States was
intimately involved in the equipping of those security forces and
that the CIA retained close ties to the Guatemalan army in the
1980s. The documents, obtained by the Washington Post, showed that
U.S. officials were aware of the killings at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The United States provided $1.5 million for the truth
commission, which was set up as part of the peace agreement
supervised by the United Nations. In addition, the United States
provided commission researchers access to more than 4,000
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Before flying to Guatemala, where he will participate in a
summit of Central American leaders Thursday, Clinton addressed the
Legislative Assembly in San Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Duch Martinez, president of the unicameral assembly, urged
Clinton to impress upon Congress that joblessness and the ravages
of Hurricane Mitch four months ago have forced many Salvadorans to
seek work in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez asked Clinton to push for ``a special migratory
status'' for Central Americans who have moved to the United States
seeking jobs ``so they can continue to support their families and
our economies.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was unmoved by the plea, saying that U.S. immigration
laws would be enforced. Illegal immigration, he said, ``punishes
hard-working people who play by the rules and who wait their turn
to come to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the president said he would ask Congress to
amend Cold War-era immigration laws so Salvadoran and Guatemalan
immigrants have equal chances of legally moving to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is considering a proposal to revise a 1997
law that granted outright amnesty to as many as 150,000
Nicaraguans, but requires Salvadorans and Guatemalans to prove
their hardship claims on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must enforce our laws, but we must do so with justice and
fairness,'' Clinton said. ``Our treatment of the people of Central
America should be based on their suffering, not who caused the
suffering. This is wrong, and we must change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Architects of the 1997 law, called the Nicaraguan Protection and
Central American Relief Act, considered Nicaraguans largely as
refugees from the left-wing Sandinista regime, while Salvadorans
and Guatemalans fled right-wing governments that were allied with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the democratically elected assembly in its main
chamber, or Blue Room, Clinton applauded Salvadorans for the
nation's political and economic transformation since a 1992 peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that U.S. exports to El Salvador and other Central
American countries have tripled since their civil wars of the 1980s
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, we learned that if Central America suffers, we
suffer, too,'' Clinton said. ``In the last 10 years, we have
learned how very much we benefit when Central America prospers in
peace.''

PEPPERDINE CRASHES OUT IN BOULDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ One by one, the Pepperdine basketball players
walked out of the locker room. After a few minutes, it was apparent
the last guy out would be Jelani Gardner. His college career was
over, sooner than he and the rest of the Waves wanted. Gardner
missed a potential winning shot in the closing seconds of the
Waves' 65-61 loss to host Colorado in the first round of the
National Invitation Tournament on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I failed,'' Gardner said. ``I guess that's just part of the
game. Wherever I play next, I'll take that last shot again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine finished 19-13. Colorado (18-14) advances to play
intrastate rival Colorado State in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Flash back to Feb. 28 in the semifinals of the West Coast
Conference Tournament. Gardner, a senior guard, takes a long
3-pointer that falls short with five seconds left and Pepperdine
goes on to lose to Santa Clara 58-54.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Gardner took a running 12-footer that banked off the
backboard and rolled off the side of the rim. The Buffaloes got the
rebound and held on to win for the seventh time in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would like to see (Gardner) hit one of those,'' Pepperdine
head coach Lorenzo Romar said. ``We have no problem with who took
the shot. His feet didn't allow him to come to a complete stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was just 2 of 12 from the field, including 0 for 6 on
3-point attempts, and finished with six points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bad way to go out, but I think I'll get the
message,'' said Gardner, a devout Christian. ``I believe everything
happens for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Gibbs, a sophomore forward who becomes the Waves' top
player with the graduation of Gardner, said he was disappointed the
careers of Gardner and senior Marc McDowell were over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel for them right now,'' said Gibbs, who scored 10 points
and grabbed 10 rebounds despite an infected right knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves lost despite holding the Buffaloes without a
3-pointer; Kenny Price made nine 3's himself in CU's last game, a
loss to Texas in the Big 12 Tournament. The last time Colorado
didn't make a 3-pointer in a game was in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado shot 51 percent for the game. In the contest's
first 10 minutes, the Buffaloes made many easy shots inside and in
transition. The Waves responded in the second half behind defensive
leader Tommie Prince, the WCC's Defender of the Year who held Price
to just four points.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Prince) is just phenomenal,'' Romar said. ``Ninety percent of
the time he has shut down the opposing team's top player.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the defensive pressure, Pepperdine held the Buffaloes
seven points under their season average.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves took a 61-60 lead with 1:40 seconds left on a basket
by Gibbs. The Buffaloes responded with a layup by Jamahl Mosley,
who was fouled on the play, to make it 62-61 with 1:27 remaining.
Mosley finished with a game-high 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves had a chance to take the lead with 20 seconds left,
but junior center Nick Sheppard fumbled the ball out of bounds as
he took a pass inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had a layup,'' Romar said. ``We wanted to get the
ball inside.''

TRADE RAISES MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 RICE CONTRACT STATUS (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A blockbuster trade for a team in the midst
of a nine-game winning streak? Even though four of those victories
are against the Clippers, it sounds like the type of move reserved
for the one of the NBA's knee-jerk franchises, like the Pistons,
Raptors or, yes, Hornets. Certainly not the Lakers, whose every
move seems to be thoughtfully calibrated. Or at least used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's trade that sent Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell to
Charlotte for Glen Rice, J.R. Reid and B.J. Armstrong was only the
latest example that the franchise is becoming the NBA's version of
the Fox-run Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency to win a title, combined with the on-again,
off-again tension between owner Jerry Buss and executive vice
president Jerry West, is creating transactions that seem better
suited for teams in need of a major overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is considered heresy to criticize any decision West
makes, and the acquisition of Dennis Rodman has been brilliant, the
five-player trade with Charlotte raises plenty of questions. Rice,
one of the best pure shooters around, isn't completely healthy and
has yet to play a game this season. He's been sidelined with an
injury in his shooting elbow, and those injuries are tricky to deal
with.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Rice is 100 percent, he has to jell with the rest of
the lineup, not exactly ideal circumstances for a team trying to
ready itself for a title run with 30-odd games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Reid is essentially a throw-in to make the deal work under the
salary cap. Armstrong seemed like a valuable addition, a veteran
with championship experience to spell Derek Harper. So what did the
Lakers do? They waived him a few hours after the trade.
</P>
<P>
   From West's perspective, the trade made sense because the Lakers
add an outside shooter (if healthy) and become instantly older.
That's right, older. Neither Buss nor West wanted to wait until
Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe Bryant reached 30 to win another title.
</P>
<P>
   In order to compete against Utah or Indiana, the Lakers needed
to add some veterans, according to the conventional wisdom. But
didn't Rodman already take care of that void?
</P>
<P>
   This trade not only alters the roster, it demolishes team
chemistry. If Rice plays small forward, what happens to Rick Fox?
He's demonstrated loyalty by signing one-year deals the past two
seasons, and is now about to be buried on the bench. That's too
bad, since Fox is one of the few good influences in the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Robert Horry, who will never see minutes at his
natural position of small forward and continue to play out of
position at power forward. He'll now split time with Travis Knight
and Reid. Oh yeah, and Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Lakers are making moves, one wonders if Rice will be
back if they don't win the title this year. The Lakers have an
option to re-sign him for the 1999-2000 season, but he's a free
agent after that season, and even though the NBA now has a salary
scale, Rice is represented by mega-agent David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   There's another reason to dislike the trade. Falk is generally
detested by most NBA teams, and even though he's been diminished by
the current labor agreement, don't think he won't pester West about
trading for or signing some of his other clients, and use Rice as a
bargaining chip to do it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of nuisance Washington and Miami have dealt
with, but not the Lakers. But the way the revolving door keeps
spinning, the Lakers are resembling those teams more every day.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
``Twenty-two hours, Bryce!''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shout came across the court after the Rockets' practice
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-two hours!''
</P>
<P>
   Bryce Drew's face lit up. He didn't have to ask what would
happen in less than one day. All he really needed was a television
with a broadcast of Valparaiso in the first round of the NCAA
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets today will be completing their game-day shootaround
during the start of Valpo's first Tournament game since Drew became
an NBA rookie. But part of his heart remains behind. And when work
for the morning is over, Drew will waste no time in getting away
from Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   And though perhaps no Rockets player is as recognized as an NCAA
Tournament hero as Drew _ ``an icon,'' teammates Matt Maloney and
Brent Price called him _ each seemed as eager to see his alma mater
in the Big Dance.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about their own Tournament experiences, a few Rockets will
offer personal reflections. But most talk about glory days
hesitantly. Michael Dickerson, a member of Arizona's national
championship team in 1997, said he almost never thinks about the
title run.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Dickerson about Arizona this season, or Cuttino Mobley
about Rhode Island, Charles Barkley about Auburn or Pig Miller
about Michigan State, and eyes turn bright, predictions are made
and challenges are issued across the locker room. Being a college
fan is irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said he would join Auburn, the No. 1 seed in the South
Regional, at the Final Four in St. Petersburg, Fla., even if it
meant missing a Rockets game. Hearing this, Miller said he expects
his Spartans, the top seed in the Midwest, to be there and would do
anything he could _ perhaps short of missing a game _ to see them
chase a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most fun time of the year for basketball, in my
opinion,'' said Price, who played in two NCAA Tournaments with
South Carolina and Oklahoma. ``I think it's your best basketball.
Every game counts; every team is hyped. The excitement, the
upsets.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley will say little about leading Rhode Island within a game
of last year's Final Four, a run that included wins over No. 1
Kansas and Drew's Valpo team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice,'' the usually expansive Mobley said. ``If I sit
around and think about it, it's all right, but right now, I haven't
been able to think about it too much. The NBA is so busy.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Mobley considered the possibility of Rhode Island's
playing Arizona in the second round, the volume burst out of him
and toward Dickerson's quiet corner of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhode Island's going to be whipping them,'' Mobley shouted in
Dickerson's direction. ``Michael and I are going to watch that
together, and Lamar (Odom, the Rhode Island star) is going to be
whipping them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be fun. I'm not going to watch the first round,
because I don't want to jinx them. After that, it's going to be
fun. I'm happy they got in it, and I'm looking forward to watching
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Dickerson, he smiled happily at the mention of this
year's Wildcats and their chance for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy they got in, and I want (Arizona guard) Jason Terry
to do well,'' Dickerson said.
</P>
<P>
   And for Mobley's benefit, if not with his amplification,
Dickerson said, ``J.T.'s going to take care of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite not having enjoyed the same sort of Tournament success
personally, Miller had similar predictions for his school. Though
Mobley's Rams and Dickerson's Wildcats are in the Midwest with
Michigan State, Miller said the Spartans should face Duke in the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were put in the toughest bracket, but that's all right,''
Miller said. ``I like our chances. I'd love them to show everybody
how they're capable of playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The furthest we got when I was there was the (second round).
We were going to try to win it or at least see how far we could go.
It was tough (losing so early). But that won't happen this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, however, said he was not hoping to replace a lost
opportunity vicariously with a Spartans run this season. Barkley,
whose Auburn team lost in the first round in his lone Tournament
experience, said that also has nothing to do with his interest in
this season's Big Dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good time, but it wasn't a big deal like it is now,''
Barkley said. ``It wasn't March Madness back then. But everybody
wanted to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just support my alma mater. I support my school in whatever
it does.''
</P>
<P>
   If players are not interested in reliving past glory, or making
up for a lost opportunity, they can relate to the experiences to
come better than most. Forward Rodrick Rhodes went to the
Tournament three times with Kentucky and once with Southern
California and seemed to prefer the feeling that came with USC's
breakthrough to Kentucky's expected success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went for three years with Kentucky, and one year we only
went to the Sweet 16 and that was a bad year,'' Rhodes said. ``I
never really knew the madness of March Madness until I went to 'SC.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Kentucky (which has since won two national championships),
we just didn't know if we were a No. 1 or No. 2 seed. At 'SC, we
were a bubble team when we made it. It was total madness. I know
how the teams that were on the bubble and got in are feeling right
now. We knew we were going to make it at Kentucky. Getting in was a
big deal at 'SC.''
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon, who led Houston to the Final Four three times,
also thinks of the pressure of expectations that he said became
similar to NBA pressures. He did not, however, lament that burden
or the title that so narrowly eluded him.

<P>
   ``Those are the best, or some of the best, times,'' Olajuwon
said. ``Then, all I knew was the Final Four. It became like normal.
There was a lot of pressure. We have created the idea of the Final
Four and the NCAA championship, and the prospects for players with
the NBA with pro scouts. That was pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, the start of another Tournament could not help but
remind at least one last time of the previous one. Drew's
last-second 3-pointer lifted Valpo past Mississippi and made him a
symbol of the Tournament's ability to surprise and inspire, a story
made that much more complete when he celebrated in a hug with his
father Homer Drew, the Valparaiso coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great moment, not only for the school to make it to
the Sweet 16 but with my family,'' Drew said. ``March will always
be a blessed month to have in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But his time as an ``NCAA icon,'' Drew said, is almost over, and
he almost seemed to relish the idea of another great moment coming,
maybe even within 22 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am (an icon) for one more day,'' he said. ``Then someone
else will hit that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 2{ weeks, Dickerson said from experience, ``Someone will
feel just great. It will be like a dream.''

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Lake Show is dead. Long live the New
Millennium Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   A slow, sometimes painful retooling of one of the NBA's most
talented teams was completed Wednesday, when the Lakers traded
veterans Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell to Charlotte for forwards
Glen Rice and J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   The long-rumored swap took place after weeks of deliberation
within the walls of the Forum, and only after Rice's surgically
repaired right elbow passed muster three days ago. Now, with one of
the NBA's best pure shooters joining an already-potent lineup, the
Lakers believe they are primed for a run at their first
championship since the 1980s Showtime era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have the best center in the league (Shaquille
O'Neal), we probably have the best rebounder in the league, in
Dennis Rodman, and maybe we'll have the best shooter and one of the
best small forwards (Rice),'' said Lakers executive vice president
Jerry West. ``We do think we have an attractive team, a team that
can compete in a playoff series against anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't necessarily the case before the trade, despite an
impressive eight-game winning streak, West said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You people look at wins like we're really playing well. I
don't necessarily (think so), nor do our coaches. . . . We've been
winning basketball games. To say they've been impressive, I would
say no,'' he said. Rice also filled a need. ``The bottom line is we
just didn't feel we had anyone here who could make shots on a
consistent basis, particularly when the game was on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade, which comes on the heels of the Rodman signing, cuts
the last significant ties to the post-Showtime, Del Harris-coached
``Lake Show'' era. Harris was fired two weeks ago, Nick Van Exel
was traded last June, and now Jones and Campbell, both Lakers draft
picks in the early 1990s, are gone. No Laker on the roster has been
here longer than three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lake Show has been buried, I guess,'' said Rick Fox.
``It's a totally different era, with new coaching . . . new
players. Hope we get new results, that'd be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate future could be bright. Rice has been one of the
NBA's top 3-point shooters, averaging 44 percent accuracy the last
three seasons and 20.8 points per game for his career. The only
concern was his surgically repaired elbow. Lakers scouts watched
him shoot Monday, and ``they called back with glowing reports,''
West said. ``He's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice and Reid will arrive today and could play Friday night
against Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte had been ready to deal for weeks, but the Lakers were
hesitant to trade Jones, a fan favorite and one of the best
defenders in the league. They had been trying to unload Campbell
and his $7 million-a-year salary for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very, very difficult decision, an agonizing
decision,'' West said. ``We wrestled with it for a long time. I
don't think we've ever had anything as difficult to do as this.''
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Armstrong was also obtained in the trade for salary cap
purposes, but was immediately waived. The Lakers also waived Corie
Blount and activated rookie forward Ruben Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Just another emotional day in an already tumultuous season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a day full of ups and downs,'' coach Kurt Rambis said.
``It was really tough to talk to Eddie and to Elden. . . . It's
tough to let those guys go. They were friends. It really hurt. But
I believe they are going to a situation where they are going to
prosper.''
</P>
<P>
   Few players had talked to Jones, who couldn't be reached for
comment. Jones issued a statement through his attorney, expressing
his ``gratitude and appreciation'' to fans and teammates. ``I am
thankful and relieved that there is now closure,'' said Jones, who
had been noticeably bothered by the trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a former starter relegated to backup minutes the last
two seasons, gets a new start in Charlotte, where he'll be the
starting center.
</P>
<P>
   With 30 games left, the Lakers make their own fresh start,
trying to again adjust to a reshuffled lineup that has seen four of
five starters change since last May. Kobe Bryant will shift to
shooting guard to accommodate Rice at small forward, while Reid
will compete with Travis Knight and Rodman for minutes. Rick Fox
and Robert Horry will fight for time behind Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sit around and moan over losing friends and
players,'' Derek Harper said. ``We have to get back to business
when those guys get here. We have to find a way to welcome those
guys and make this trade work, because it's a done deal now.''

CLIPPERS ARE IN THE BOOKS _ 0-17
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ On the same day the Lakers made a
blockbuster trade, the Clippers made little more than bitter
history.
</P>
<P>
   By bowing 94-75 Wednesday night in front of 17,505 at the Forum,
the Bad Dream Team tied the 1988 Miami Heat's NBA record for
consecutive losses (17) to open a season . . . locked out or
otherwise. The Clippers will go for sole possession of this coveted
space on record row tonight when the Sacramento Kings visit the
Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, winning for the ninth straight time since that
teeth-gnashing 0-for-3 road trip, were a few hours removed from
mailing popular guard Eddie Jones and misunderstood backup center
Elden Campbell to Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an interesting team to watch from that standpoint
(changes),'' Lakers forward Rick Fox said. `` `As The Lakers Turn,'
I guess. It's like a soap opera. Let's hope for a happy ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, let's. Wednesday's opening was hideous.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers coughed up the ball 16 times in the opening half,
allowing the Clippers _ whose tired rope-a-dope strategy threatened
to work for the first time since last April _ to achieve a lead of
nine points in the first quarter, and an unsettling margin of 10 in
the second.
</P>
<P>
   Each Clippers salvo provoked a sarcastic chant of ``Eddie!
Eddie!'' and so on, but rookie Lakers coach Kurt Rambis
demonstrated timely courtside savvy, countering the first chorus by
sending fan darling Dennis Rodman into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who trailed 35-34 at intermission, were
unseasonably cold (even by their standards), nailing an icy 22.9
percent of their field-goal attempts in the first half. The Lakers
shot a blistering 29 percent _ 17 percent when Shaquille O'Neal's
sizzling 6-of-13 effort is subtracted.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal bullied the Clippers' three-headed center _ Lorenzen
Wright, Michael Olowokandi and Keith Closs _ into an evenly
distributed nine first-half fouls. He also kept the game close by
missing five of the resulting nine free-throw attempts. O'Neal
finished the half with 16 points; backup Sean Rooks was his
most-prolific teammate, pitching in five. Kobe Bryant managed two
early turnovers, three quick fouls and was scoreless in a
six-minute cameo.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who provided six rebounds in the first half, added some
theater for the histrionically starved Forum crowd at 7:35 of the
third quarter. While sitting on the floor in front of the Lakers
bench, he was assessed his second technical foul _ and an ejection
_ by referee Joe Crawford. As he was cheered to the escape tunnel,
Rodman peeled off his jersey, then lobbed it into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Clippers _ for two nights in a row _ refused to
wave the white flag. Forward Lamond Murray, who's been in a
colossal slump, started burying 3-pointers. His bomb from the right
wing put the visitors up 52-47 with 6:12 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers countered when Robert Horry's lob for O'Neal went
through the hoop for an excuse-me 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who have been doing just enough to lose, took it
from there.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: The Clippers, who almost brought Glen Rice to L.A. in
a deal for Danny Manning a few years ago, didn't make any trades
Wednesday. They did bring Michael Olowokandi (ankle) and Pooh
Richardson (ankle) off the injured list, replacing them with point
guard Sherman Douglas (groin) and rookie forward Brian Skinner
(knee). . . . Jones' spot in the starting lineup was taken by
Horry, who played small forward while Bryant returned to the
backcourt.

MORE DATA TO BE SOUGHT ON HOME CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Medicare officials said on Wednesday night that
they had instructed home health agencies to start collecting
detailed information on the medical conditions and living
arrangements of millions of elderly and disabled people who receive
home health care services financed by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher H. Peacock, a spokesman for the Federal Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, said the data were
needed to ``make sure patients get quality care'' and to develop a
new method of paying home health agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy advocates have expressed concern that the
government might intrude on the privacy of Medicare beneficiaries
by collecting and analyzing such personal data.
</P>
<P>
   But Peacock said the health care financing agency already
received huge amounts of sensitive information about beneficiaries,
including hundreds of thousands of claims filed each year by
doctors, hospitals and medical laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare already has confidential information about
beneficiaries,'' he said. ``The key is to make sure you safeguard
it. And Medicare does.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the change, reported on Thursday in The Washington Post,
home health agencies will be required to collect a standard set of
data on each Medicare patient they serve. The data will be used to
measure the results of the care and treatment provided to
home-bound patients.
</P>
<P>
   The government will also use the data to measure and improve how
home health agencies care for patients, Peacock said. Home health
agencies will send the data to state officials, who will compile
the information and send it to the federal government, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Providers of home care typically charge Medicare separately for
each home visit. Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the
government is supposed to develop a new method of reimbursement,
perhaps by paying a fixed amount for several months of care.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they assumed that Medicare would pay home
health agencies more for sicker patients, so the Government would
need detailed information about each patient's condition.

HENRY BLASTS PAPPAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Players come, players go. Years pass. And one
of the constant themes in the Red Sox clubhouse is questionable
treatment by team physician and limited partner Arthur Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   This column has been written before. When second baseman Marty
Barrett sued the Red Sox in 1992, claiming Pappas misdiagnosed his
wounded knee, it was argued that the Sox should no longer have a
limited partner who doubles as team physician.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation never changed and now we have another ex-Sox
crying foul _ plus one or two players in the present clubhouse with
curious tales of misdiagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   From Peoria, Ariz., former Sox lefthander Butch Henry has hurled
some bombs onto the doorstep of the good doctor. Speaking with Bob
Finnigan of the Seattle Times, Henry, who pitched for the Red Sox
last year, unloaded on Boston's conflicted physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't go back to the Red Sox,'' Henry said. ``I'm
easygoing, and I get along with everyone. But I couldn't have
looked at those people without thinking they had tried to mess with
my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry claims Pappas last year told him he could pitch despite
having a tear in the anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee.
Henry didn't pitch in 1996 because of tendon-replacement surgery on
his left elbow. Pitching for the Sox during spring training last
year, he strained his left hamstring on a baserunning play. Henry
opened the season on the disabled list, then injured his left knee
on his second start and subsequently got into a disagreement with
Pappas and Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas gave Henry an MRI and an arthroscopic examination,
according to the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically said, `You have a partial tear of the ACL and we
think you can pitch on it,' '' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry said one of the Sox trainers advised him to have surgery
on the knee. Henry also said another Sox physician ``told me I had
a 90 percent tear, that I had only 5 to 10 percent left, and that I
was risking my career if I went out and pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Henry, he then met with Duquette, Pappas, and
assistant GM Mike Port and told them he decided to have surgery. He
said Duquette asked him to try pitching, but Henry refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his own way, Dan Duquette is one of the best baseball men
around,'' Henry said. ``But he isn't much of a people person. The
way he treats people leaves a lot to be desired. Dealing with him,
if the way he dealt with me is any indication, is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they held off on the surgery and made me questionable for
this spring, with my career in doubt, then he could offer me a
minor league contract at next to nothing, which he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be fair, Dan had taken care of me when I had injured my
elbow in 1995, signing me for 1996 when I couldn't pitch. But on
the knee, he hung me out to dry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe attempted to get responses from Duquette and Pappas
Wednesday night, but team publicist Kevin Shea said, ``I'm not
going to call them late at night on something like this. Dr. Pappas
always treats his patients as people first. And Butch Henry wanted
to come back to pitch for us this year, but he wanted a lot of
money. It sounds like sour grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry was paid $1 million by the Red Sox in 1998 and pitched a
total of nine innings in two games. The Sox did not re-sign him for
1999, and the club can certainly say it paid Henry well for his
services. It's also easy to cite sour grapes with a disgruntled
ex-player.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Barrett? He sued the team and Pappas, claiming
his career was cut short because of misdiagnosis and a US District
Court jury awarded him $1.7 million. More recently, Sox youngsters
Brian Rose and Lou Merloni as well as veteran Reggie Jefferson had
difficulty navigating the waters in the Sox' murky medical ward.
</P>
<P>
   Highly-touted rookie Rose made only eight starts last year
because of a bone spur and fracture in his pitching elbow. Rose
hurt his elbow early last season, but the severity of his injury
went undetected by the ballclub. Duquette questioned his
willingness to pitch with pain until Rose finally went to get a
second opinion. Noted orthopedist James Andrews discovered Rose had
a stress fracture and bone spur that was tugging on the ligament in
his elbow every time he threw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know me,'' said Rose, ``and when I'm facing the same guys I
faced the year before and they're telling me I don't look the same,
I knew it had to be one of two things: My mechanics were really
messed up, or there was something wrong with me. And my mechanics
have always been good.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Merloni, a fan favorite, hurt himself running into a
tarp in Yankee Stadium last summer. Pappas initially diagnosed the
injury as inflammation in the knee, then a deep bone bruise. But it
never got better, and it wasn't until several frustrating weeks
later that Merloni found out he had a stress fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's back injury was originally diagnosed as a strain
last summer and it wasn't until weeks later, when Jefferson visited
back specialist Robert Watkins, that a stress fracture was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas is a genial fellow and for years pitchers on other teams
have sought his opinion for shoulder problems. He is highly
respected in the medical community and one couldn't expect to meet
a nicer man. But his dual role is a blatant conflict and the Sox
put their legal butts on the line every time he treats an injured
player. Pappas has a fiduciary responsibility that is in direct
conflict with his Hippocratic oath. And as long as the situation
exists, there are very likely to be more Butch Henrys tossing
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason a lot of players have a clause in their
contracts specifying no trades to Boston,'' said Henry. ``The Sox
are notorious for having differences of opinion with injured
players.''

   OLY-SALT-LAKE (Salt Lake City) _ Salt Lake City's long effort to
join the Olympic fraternity _ sometimes brazen, sometimes comic,
and all the while relying on inside information provided by other
Olympic cities _ comes to detailed life in hundreds of pages of
internal bid committee documents and in interviews with numerous
committee staff workers and volunteers. By Kirk Johnson.

   BBO-ANDERSON-COLUMN (New York) _ Sports of The Times column:
Before he was to throw out the first ball at Old-Timer's Day at
Yankee Stadium last July, silver-haired Joe DiMaggio suddenly
arrived in the shadowy corridor behind the Yankee dugout. He was
wearing what he often wore: a blue blazer over a white shirt with a
burgundy tie, sharply creased gray slacks and shiny black shoes.
``You look great,'' I told him. ``You can't see how I feel,'' he
said, smiling. By Dave Anderson.

<P>
   BBA-RHODEN-COLUMN (New York) _ Sports of The Times column on the
fragility of greatness, stemming from the announcement by the
Yankees that Manager Joe Torre has prostate cancer. The
announcement was made just hours before Darryl Strawberry,
currently battling colon cancer, was set to play his first spring
training game of 1999. By William C. Rhoden.

   CIR-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ By making possible engineering
feats that would have been impracticable in the past, computers are
ratcheting up the wow factor in architecture, that feeling of utter
astonishment in those who behold buildings whose forms defy

itself. By David W. Dunlap.

   EMERGING-ARCHITECTS (Undated) _ Eight architectural firms were
selected this year as ``emerging voices'' of 1999 by the
Architectural League of New York, a nonprofit organization that has
sponsored public programs in architecture since 1881. But rising
stars need more than a winning way with a T-square _ or a
state-of-the-art CAD program _ to make a name for themselves. The
simplest projects require a fanatical commitment and Job-like
patience. This year's winners offer a telling glimpse of the state
of architecture _ a mirror of how it is being built today and a
window onto the world of the next century. By Julie V. Iovine.

   FALLINGWATER (Bear Run, Pa.) _ Fallingwater, Frank Lloyd
Wright's 1936 masterpiece, acknowledged by architects to be the
most significant American building, appears to be falling down.
When this weekend house slung over a waterfall opened here last
week for its annual season of public tours, visitors were treated
to the sight of a bathtub-sized hole in the middle of the living
room floor. The house, a series of intersecting concrete trays,
has, in fact, been sagging; one corner, hanging over the falls, is
more than seven inches lower than it should be. The problem, which
threatened to bring Fallingwater crashing into the rocks below, has
led to a top-to-bottom analysis of the building's structure. By
Fred Bernstein.

   PIPHER-PROFILE (Lincoln, Neb.) _ Mary Pipher, the psychologist
whose book about adolescent girls, ``Reviving Ophelia,'' was a
phenomenal best seller, was walking on the prairie near her home at
sunset, showing off the quiet beauty of winter in Nebraska. She
walks here with her women's writers' group on weekends, she says,
and it is where she likes to celebrate New Year's Day. She walked
on the prairie a lot during the 11 months her mother lay dying in a
hospital in Kansas five years ago. This is the landscape,
undramatic and Midwestern, that has shaped her life and thinking,
and landscape is the metaphor she uses to explore aging in her new
book, ``Another Country: The Emotional Terrain of Our Elders,''
which will be published next week. As in ``Reviving Ophelia'' which
is as much a social critique as it is a psychological treatise, Dr.
Pipher, 51, views aging through the lens of the anthropologist she
set out to be in college. A profile of the writer by Sara Rimer.

   NY-OLD-SIGNS (New York) _ You can't miss it. At the corner of
Greene and West Houston Streets, a new billboard for G-Shock
watches partially obscures an early 20th-century sign for the
United Thread Company. A giant wristwatch, splayed across both
advertising panels, appears to be attached to the building by
trompe l'oeil nails. But is the old sign really old? Or is it new,
too? Such questions crop up often these days, as New York's
construction boom alternately exposes and covers old signs:
advertisements for carriage rentals and patent medicines painted on
brick walls previously hidden by buildings. They appear suddenly,
flashes of the past, when a building is razed. By Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   HOPPEN-DESIGN (Undated) _ Lionized in Britain but largely
unknown here, Kelly Hoppen has seen the future, and it is beige,
accented with sorbet-sweet shots of aubergine, blackberry and
lilac. The future is also sculptured with concealed, expensively
calibrated light. By Mitchell Owens.

   NY-SEX-MUSEUM (New York) _ When was the last time you loved a
building and it loved you back? This month, the Museum of Sex, or
Mosex, begins sweeping the floor of its new temporary home at 233
Fifth Avenue (27th Street), beneath the shadow of the Empire State
Building, in anticipation of renovations that will deliver a new
facade, 12,000 square feet of exhibition galleries and offices, a
retail shop and a cafe by the end of the year. Mosex _ at the other
end of the block from Le Trapeze, a towels-only night club _ is an
adult museum, the first in the United States to be devoted to ``sex
and culture everywhere,'' said Alison Maddex, 32, its director.
``It's going to be the Smithsonian of sex,'' she added. By William
L. Hamilton.

British theater so far this year? Which has garnered the most
column inches in the press, the most hours on television, and by
far the most enthusiastic reviews?
</P>
<P>
   No, the answer is not some striking drama at the National or a
searing satire at the Royal Court. It has been a defiantly
undemonstrative, unpretentiously devastating piece called ``The
Color of Justice'' that opened in January in the little Tricycle
Theater in the unfashionable North London area of Kilburn and went
on to replace a revival of ``Annie'' at a 1,500-seat theater in the
West End, where it ended its run Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a startling phenomenon, given that the subject was
the murder of a quiet teen-ager in an obscure corner of Southeast
London way back in 1993, and yet it isn't an altogether surprising
one. Nothing in 1999 has kept British reporters, pundits and
editorial writers busier than a long-awaited, much-leaked and now
officially published report into the aftermath of the killing of an
18-year-old whose only known offense was to have been born black.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the impact in the United States of the recent
conviction of a white racist in the Texas dragging case, and of the
shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant early last month by
police officers in the Bronx. That will give you some idea of the
soul-searching that the Lawrence case, as it has become known, has
continued to provoke _ not least in that 2,500-year-old forum for
public inquiry, the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lawrence, by all accounts a promising student and
good-natured young man, was waiting for a bus in suburban Eltham in
April 1993 when one or more members of a group of white youths
stabbed him to death after using a racial epithet, a witness said.
</P>
<P>
   The case against the prime suspects has never been officially
prosecuted, though they were tried and acquitted when lawyers
acting for Stephen's parents instituted what is known in Britain as
a private prosecution against them. The case subsequently collapsed
because the trial judge thought the evidence inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   But the victim's parents always refused to let go. They prompted
an outcry against racial violence loud enough to reach the ears of
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, who met with them when he
visited London. The couple embarrassed the police into holding what
is now agreed to have been a totally unsatisfactory inquiry into
its own handling of the case. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  And when the Labor Party took office in 1997, the issue was
still sufficiently alive for the incoming Home Secretary to order a
new, fully public inquiry under an eminent judge, Sir William
Macpherson.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered his report late last month, and it was even more
unsettling than the commentators prophesied. The London police
stood accused of botching and bungling the murder investigation not
only because of incompetence but because of ``institutionalized
racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the government accepts Sir William's more radical
recommendations _ that racist language in private places become a
crime; that victims themselves should decide what offenses are and
are not racially motivated; that individuals acquitted of one crime
may sometimes be retried for the same one _ it has already
announced it will toughen Britain's anti-racism laws and act to
cleanse the police.
</P>
<P>
   Why such public and parliamentary outrage? That, ``The Color of
Justice'' made clear along its trip from Kilburn to the Theater
Royal in the East London district of Stratford, in a showing on the
BBC, and at the Victoria Palace in the West End.
</P>
<P>
   The play consists of extracts of evidence given to the
Macpherson inquiry and edited by the journalist and dramatist
Richard Norton-Taylor. In performance, it seemed as fresh as the
O.J. Simpson trial and yet as old in its implications as Aeschylus'
``Oresteia.'' As more than one critic suggested, the play vitally
concerns the health not just of society's custodians but of society
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Tricycle has long reflected the special nature of Kilburn,
which is sometimes thought to be the most culturally mixed urban
area in Europe. It has given world or British premieres to plays by
black writers _ including Mustapha Matura's ``Playboy of the West
Indies,'' the work of the American August Wilson and several
imports from the Market Theater in Johannesburg _ and to many works
by Irish writers. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The theater also has plenty of experience in documentary
drama. Recently, it staged extracts from the Nuremberg trials, from
hearings at the Hague into war crimes in Bosnia, and from an
official inquiry into British arms exports to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Nicolas Kent's production of ``The Color of Justice,'' as in
those pieces, everything was so matter-of-fact that you felt you
were not in a place of entertainment but the gallery Sir William
reserved for the public. The lawyers sat in gray pews in front of
boxed files and video screens. People wandered in, whispered,
dropped pens, chewed nibs, yawned, wandered out. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The downbeat tone extended to the witnesses. Actors who didn't
look at all like actors described in bald, banal yet riveting words
the investigation Sir William has now condemned so unequivocally.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by the Lawrences' silkily menacing counsel, Jeremy
Clyde's Michael Mansfield, and the other attorneys, the witnesses
confronted question after question. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Did the police who originally arrived on the scene assume
Stephen was a hoodlum himself? Why didn't they give him first aid
or instantly start a proper hue and cry? Why weren't the suspects
arrested far earlier than they were? Why did camera surveillance
begin just too late to record one of them taking a trash bag
crammed with clothes from his house? Why have so many police notes
disappeared? How much did it matter that one investigating officer
had a decidedly unprofessional relationship with a drug baron who
was also a suspect's father?
</P>
<P>
   Norton-Taylor did not alter a single word of the inquiry's
transcript and added nothing of his own; however he did cut the
11,000 pages of evidence to a 100-page script. The audience heard
endless quibbles about what is and isn't a racial attack, as well
as a junior officer earnestly claiming to ``understand black
people'' because she was raised in Africa. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  A very senior policeman offered a fulsome apology to the
Lawrences for his force's failures and, using a word the inquiry
had already deemed inappropriate, went on to justify the
disproportionately frequent arrest of blacks because ``colored
people'' tend to live in high-crime areas.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were subpoenaed by the inquiry, but only one was
seen in the play. He failed to remember being shown a police
surveillance video in which his brother and their friends violently
brandish knives and speak in obscene terms of their desire to
dismember blacks. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The good samaritan, whose wife cradled the dying student,
whispering ``you are loved'' into his ear, admitted he initially
wondered if the boy was a mugger faking a collapse. After the
murder, he washed his bloodstained hands and poured the water on a
rosebush in his garden, ``So in a way, I suppose, he is kind of
living on a bit.'' It is impossible not to feel that in other,
subtler yet more substantial ways, Stephen really is.
</P>
<P>
   Is it crazy to claim that, when they gathered to see a jury of
Athenians decide how much responsibility Orestes had for his
mother's death, Aeschylus' audiences were in a parallel predicament
to those at ``The Color of Justice''? &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  It is not merely that effective drama has often been forensic
in content and style and has concerned itself with trying to root
out difficult truths. It is that an effective theater should
regularly address us as citizens and ask us whether or not our
community is just or unjust.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of ``The Color of Justice,'' Michael Culver's
self-effacing, punctilious Macpherson echoed what the real Sir
William did at the end of the first inquiry. He asked everyone to
stand silently in memory of Stephen. For once we all felt
implicated in something that was, yes, a play, but also a
significant civic happening.

A 12-BLOCK GLIMMER OF HOPE FOR NEW YORK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Architecture or real estate, what's it going to be?
Does New York have room for both? These are the basic questions
raised by the Canadian Center for Architecture's competition to
redesign an important piece of land on the west side of midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And these questions open up other questions in turn. Why must
New York invest so much money, time and energy in the vain pretense
that architecture and real estate are the same thing? Wouldn't it
be cheaper, not to mention more culturally invigorating, just to
put New York back on the map as a center of architectural thought?
</P>
<P>
   Conceived by Phyllis Lambert, founding director of the Canadian
Center, a powerhouse of architectural culture in Montreal, the West
Side project is the first in a series of competitions to be held
every three years. Each of these, officially called the IFCCA.
Prize Competition for the Design of Cities, will address the modern
needs of a different city around the world. The winner will receive
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The overall aim of the program is to stimulate new ways of
thinking about the design and planning of cities for the 21st
century. In New York, the goal is to set a high architectural
standard for an area that seems destined for major commercial
development in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The last three decades have been a golden age for architectural
preservation in New York, and the importance of this should not be
underestimated. It's pleasing that the city is approaching the
millennium with an extraordinary appreciation for the history it
has passed through to get there. But this has not been an era of
opportunity for architects, in Gio Ponti's words, ``to interpret
the life of the inhabitants, transforming it into an expression of
civilization and culture.'' This competition offers an opportunity
to interpret life on the threshold the city is now crossing.
</P>
<P>
   The site is a 12-block corridor that stretches from Eighth
Avenue to the Hudson River. It is bounded on its southern edge by
30th Street, on the north by 34th. It's the sort of area that is
often described as urban wasteland: a tangle of railyards, storage
depots, tunnel entrances and highway overpasses.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact the finalists will have a hard time matching the
robust appeal of this infrastructural display. Ringed along its
western edges by parking lots, car repair shops and brick
industrial lofts, the area is a frayed remnant of industrial New
York, part of the city's vibrant cultural mix that now seems all
the more precious as working class Manhattan fades ever further
into memory.
</P>
<P>
   There is a glamour to the unglamorous that the bright stars of
contemporary architecture have mostly failed to reckon with, though
anyone seeking the key to Frank Gehry's success will find it in his
fascination with this paradox.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, developers have shunned the area as commercially
unviable. But city officials, including Joseph B. Rose, chairman of
the City Planning Commission and a member of the competition jury,
regard this as a major development corridor.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani affirmed Rose's vision when
he introduced a proposal to build a sports stadium in this
corridor, along with a relocated Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The site also includes the James Farley Building, now home of
the General Post Office but soon to house a new Penn Station,
designed by Skidmore Owings &AMP; Merrill, along with the Manhattan
terminal for a new rail link to Kennedy International Airport. This
design, in turn, will clear the present Garden site for eventual
redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   With projects like these in the works, along with the strip's
proximity to the existing Javits Convention Center, it is hard to
imagine a better site for demonstrating that despite their
considerable differences, architects and real estate developers
share a common stake in the future of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The competition finalists were chosen from more than 150
submissions from around the world. Cedric Price of Great Britain is
the elder statesman of the group. In fact, Price has exuded a
statesmanly aura since the outset of his career, in the early 60s,
when he functioned as a guru to the British megastructure movement
and mentored that movement's pop offshoot, the Archigram group.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for the Fun Palace, an unbuilt project of 1962, Price
remains a keeper of the 60s flames of change, merriment, social
engagement and provocation. A few years ago, he distinguished
himself at a hearing before a British preservation group that was
considering granting landmark status to one of his few built works.
Price showed up and vigorously opposed the honor.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Eisenman of New York is the Gertrude Stein of contemporary
architecture. That's not meant as a put-down. It simply implies
that (unlike, say, Stein's contemporary, Virginia Woolf) Eisenman
shrinks from fully inhabiting his medium. Possibly he would not
take this as a criticism. He spent a large chunk of his career
steeping himself in the theories of Jacques Derrida and other
post-structuralist philosophers, theorists who promulgated such
antihumanist concepts as the ``death of the author.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a result of their influence, Eisenman has often
claimed that his architecture is produced without design. The
conceit is that his forms are shaped by topography, historical
memory and other forces latent in the urban landscape. This
approach could result in a design sensitively attuned to the site's
existing infrastructural tangle.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could produce a plan as monotonous, in its geometrically
assertive way, as the barren concrete plazas that commercial
developers typically use to hide the city's untidy innards.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that Eisenman's experimental work _ like the
Aronoff Center for the Arts at the University of Cincinnati _ has
opened the door for some of the most talented architects in the
emerging generation. Thom Mayne belongs to the tradition of Richard
Neutra, Charles and Ray Eames, and Rudolf Schindler _ architects
who resisted the image of Southern California as the promised land
of kitsch and established it as a testing ground for rigorous
experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayne's elegantly aggressive designs have little in common
with the open, spare spaces of his predecessors. Instead, his
angular, fragmented designs represent the anxiety lurking in the
shadows of the bright California sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Mayne, whose public projects already include the Comprehensive
Cancer Treatment Center and Cedars Mount Sinai Hospital in Los
Angeles, is at a moment of professional transition from residential
and commercial work to a series of public schools in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ben van Burkel, based in Amsterdam, belongs to a generation
younger than Rem Koolhaas, and it is salutary to see an architect
absorbing information from his seniors instead of trying to bump
them off. Van Berkel is not a 60s person. Yet he has inherited
Koolhaas' ambivalence toward architecture as an expression of
corporate power. His theoretical approach is drier than that of
Koolhaas, but his forms, like the Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam, are
just as juicy: fluid, fragmented, enraptured with urban surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Reiser and Nanako Umemoto are two of a group of young
architects who have come to be known as the blobmeisters. They have
grown up with the development of advanced computer programs that
enable them to model infinitely varied, three-dimensional
geometries, like their design for the Yokohama Port Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Though virtually all architectural firms now rely heavily on the
computer, blobsters like Greg Lynn and Kevi Sottma of the Ocean
Group, and Reiser and Ms. Umemoto make designs that create the
impression of an endless tumble through cyberspace. These designers
are intoxicated by the freedom the computer allows them, much as
the early modernists were thrilled by the open spaces allowed by
industrial construction techniques. Those looking to ride today's
wave of tomorrow could do worse than check out this beach.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists span three generations but have much in common.
All have wrestled with the tension between the design of individual
buildings and the planning of the larger city. All have designed
buildings during a period when city planning, particularly in the
United States, has fallen into general collapse.
</P>
<P>
   All have dealt in intelligent ways with architecture as a medium
for focusing relationships outside the building, not just creating
stand-alone, free-floating objects in space. Not least, the designs
of all five finalists have trendy sex appeal. If architects have
learned one thing in this century, it is that creating a sense of
place is contingent on creating a sense of time. If they have
learned a second thing, it is that this construction can take
multiple forms.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists met last week to tour the site and have until June
to produce their plans. The winner will be chosen in mid-June, and
an exhibition of all five proposals will be held in the Waiting
Room at Grand Central Terminal toward the end of the summer. This
is a fine choice of venue, not only because it guarantees wide
public exposure but also because the great Beaux Arts station is
our supreme example of rendering transportation infrastructure into
architecture on the grand scale.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of the jury is as important as the list of
finalists. In addition to Ms. Lambert, it includes four
distinguished architects: Gehry, Arata Isozaki, Elizabeth Diller
and Rafael Moneo. Gary Hack, a city planner and dean of the
Graduate School of Fine Arts, University of Pennyslvania, and Ralph
Lerner, dean of the graduate school of architecture at Princeton
University, come to the jury bearing weighty academic credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But if this project stands a chance of making an impact on New
York, that is because the jury also includes the two public
officials who rule over this site.
</P>
<P>
   Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development
Corp., wields thumbs up-thumbs down power over the ultimate
disposition of the site. It is controlled by the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, a state agency. Any plans for building
there are ultimately subject to Gargano's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Rose is part of an administration that has covered itself with
glory in reversing New York's fortunes as a negative magnet but has
yet to attract enough innovative projects to make the city an
architectural center.
</P>
<P>
   Rose may be the competition's key juror. He is a public official
who cares about architecture but is also a pragmatist. He holds
office in a city that has all but eliminated architecture from the
public realm and compelled the city's architects to work in foreign
cities or on paper.
</P>
<P>
   His presence on the jury does not guarantee that the winning
plan will be realized. But he has indicated that he would like the
competition to result in something more than another flurry of
paper fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   New York is a developers' town. That's not going to change, nor
should we want it to. Development is part of the fuel that keeps
this city on the move. What we expect, however, is some correlation
between quantity and quality, between booms and busts in the real
estate market and the quality of the city's architecture.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no such correlation for more than 30 years, when
architects of the caliber of Frank Lloyd Wright, Mies van der Rohe,
Marcel Breuer, Eero Saarinen, Gordon Bunshaft and Kevin Roche were
creating some of their best work here.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Lambert became part of that cycle when she persuaded her
father, Samuel Bronfman, to hire Mies and Philip Johnson to design
the Seagram Building. She has stepped back into the picture as a
kind of Cultural Improvement District. She is challenging the
tyranny of the misdirected relativism that has allowed New York's
architecture to devolve toward new lows of mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Since architecture is a public art, it might seem vital that the
public weigh in on major public projects. But this does not negate
the difference between opinions and informed opinions. Harold
Bloom, in his ``Western Canon,'' calls upon Hazlitt to remind us
that ``the principle of universal suffrage is by no means
applicable to matters of taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Taste is subjective, and informed opinion can be wrong. Still,
the juried competition, when organized with intelligence and
integrity, is the best system we have for insuring that commercial
values are not confused with cultural ones.
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal city, there would be a consensus of taste among
public, developers, architects and critics. Or better yet,
conflicts would be aired at a high level of debate. But compared
with Paris, Barcelona, Dublin, and other cities, New York has
failed to stimulate consensus or debate. Of course, it is possible
for architecture and real estate to coexist. But the best way to
increase the likelihood of that is to remain aware of the
difference between them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Four years ago, the Seattle Repertory Theater presented
the world premiere of ``Jolson Sings Again,'' a play about
informing during the McCarthy era in Hollywood and its toll on
individual lives. Arthur Laurents, the dramatist, director and
screenwriter who wrote the play, knew and worked with two major
artists who informed: the choreographer and director Jerome Robbins
and the stage and film director Elia Kazan. Laurents is the author
of the books for the landmark Broadway musicals ``West Side Story''
and ``Gypsy'' and screenplays for a number of films, including
``The Way We Were'' and ``The Turning Point.''
</P>
<P>
   In February 1995, during the first run of ``Jolson Sings
Again,'' Laurents met Frank Rich, an Op-Ed columnist for The New
York Times, when Rich interviewed him on the stage of the Seattle
Rep about his play.
</P>
<P>
   Laurents subsequently reworked the play, which is now being
presented at the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, N.J.,
through March 28. Directed by the theater's artistic chief, David
Saint, the four-member cast includes Betsy Aidem, Jonathan Hadary,
Robert Petkoff and Armand Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   As rehearsals began for the revised version, Rich and Laurents
met once more to talk about ``Jolson Sings Again,'' which describes
what happens among four friends when one of them informs, and about
several of the real-life models on which the characters are based.
Here are excerpts from the conversation.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRANK RICH. ``Jolson Sings Again'' happens to be extraordinarily
timely. This is a moment when people are talking about the
blacklist, when they have revisited Jerome Robbins' history during
the McCarthy period as a consequence of his death last summer and,
of course, when controversy surrounds the recent decision by the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to grant the director
Elia Kazan an honorary Oscar. Yet you conceived this play when _
way before these events.
</P>
<P>
   ARTHUR LAURENTS. In 1992.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. What prompted you to write it then?
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. Because I had written ``The Way We Were'' (1973),
which deals with the same thing, and a lot of what I wanted to say
was cut, including the whole climax of the picture, where the
political story and the love story came together. What was terribly
disheartening to me was not only did nobody notice, nobody cared.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. So you wanted to revisit it?
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. There was another reason. I was like Julian, the
character in ``Jolson Sings Again.'' I was very black and white. He
says in the play: there were good guys and bad guys. My own life
made me realize it wasn't that simple. I worked with Jerry Robbins
twice, knowing he was an informer.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. You worked with him on ``West Side Story'' and ``Gypsy.''
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. Yes. And then in the 60s, I did a screenplay for
Kazan. He had written a novel called ``The Arrangement'' and asked
me to write the screenplay. I was flattered, because I thought then
and still think that Kazan was the best theater director in my
lifetime, just wonderful. He was producing and directing the
picture. So I said, ``Why aren't you writing the screenplay?'' He
said, ``Because I want another eye.'' That made sense. He gave me
carte blanche: do whatever you want; give him 30 pages at a time.
Which I did. He said, ``Brilliant.'' And when I finished the whole
script, he gave me (italics)his(end italics) script. Which to me
says informers don't stop at informing.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Let's talk about ``Jolson Sings Again,'' which is mainly
set from 1947 to 1952 in Hollywood. Explain the title.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. The title came from a fact: Larry Parks, who was the
first person to testify before the House Un-American Activities
Committee, had played Al Jolson in a movie. When he testified, he
became an informer. And the newsboys on Hollywood Boulevard sang
out, ``Jolson sings again! Jolson sings again!'' To me, it
epitomized the whole period.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. In this play, there is a character named Andreas, who is a
director and an informer. But he couldn't be Kazan because Kazan is
referred to elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. There's another reason: Kazan and others said they
were doing it to save America from communism. Andreas ridicules
that.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Your first hit, ``Home of the Brave,'' about
anti-Semitism, opened on Broadway in 1946 right after the war and
was made into a movie__
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. About a Negro.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. It's one of the bitterly amusing moments in ``Jolson Sings
Again,'' when the audience learns how cavalierly a Hollywood studio
executive can change a writer's intent.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. That passage is absolutely true. I said to Stanley
Kramer, ``Why have you turned the Jew into a Negro?'' He said,
``Because Jews have been done.''
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Because of ``Gentleman's Agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. I said ``Gentleman's Agreement,'' he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. What were your own experiences during the McCarthy period?
You were not blacklisted__
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. Yes, I was blacklisted. I was not a member of the
party. You didn't have to be.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. This was after you wrote ``Rope'' for Hitchcock?
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. Yes, and I wasn't mad about being in movies anyway. So
I came back to New York for a play that flopped.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. What was the period that you were blacklisted?
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. The late 40s till the middle of the 50s. When I came
back to this country, (the agent) Swifty Lazar said, ``You have to
sign a piece of paper.'' I said, ``You didn't tell me that. What am
I supposed to write?'' He said, ``Anything you want.'' So I wrote,
literally, ``I am not now, nor have I ever been a member of the
Shoeshine Boys Union. Arthur Laurents.'' They took it. They had
something in writing. They didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. During the period that you were blacklisted, how did you
make a living? Did you write screenplays under a pseudonym?
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. No, I went to Paris. People today don't realize how
cheap it was. I was young and it was marvelous. It's a terrible
thing to say about the blacklist, but that's the reason I got
there.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. So when you came back and it was really over, you were
always mainly a theater man__
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. I came back in 1953 for ``The Time of the Cuckoo,''
which may be revived by Lincoln Center Theater this fall.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Did you have any dealings with Kazan during the blacklist
period?
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. I only knew him peripherally until ``The
Arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Explain how the blacklist played out on Broadway as
opposed to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. There was absolutely no blacklist in the theater. When
Jerry Robbins was called, he was choreographing ``The King and I,''
which was going to Broadway. They were still out of town. He went
to the producers and they said, ``Do whatever you want.'' The
difference to me was that Broadway producers were individuals, not
corporate producers.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. So someone like Zero Mostel, for instance, who was totally
blacklisted in movies and television, continued to work in the
theater. As for informers, in your play you draw a distinction
between Odets and Kazan.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. They informed about the same time. Clifford Odets _
this is my guess _ informed because he thought he was finished. He
was nothing in Hollywood. He had been unsuccessful. When you're
unsuccessful, you're a rat fink, whether you finked or not.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. The biggest crime in Hollywood is to be a failure. What
was it like to work with Robbins? When you worked with him on
``West Side Story'' that would have been '57. So all these wounds
were very fresh.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. Jerry Robbins and I were very, very close friends
earlier than that. There's a line in ``Jolson Sings Again'' that is
a quote from him. He said to me, ``I won't know for years from now
whether I did the right thing.'' And I said to him, ``I can tell
you now, you didn't.'' And he cried. But I couldn't turn my back.
He was my friend. What I found out later, as it says in the play,
was, ``You're not evil because you informed; you informed because
you're evil.'' The friendship ended pretty much with ``West Side
Story.'' When you do something like that, in this case I believe
for career, then you think, ``Well, what the hell.'' You've killed
one person. Now you may as well get the Uzi out and mow them down.
You don't care anymore. You have shut yourself off.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Yet people who were very vocal about the blacklist, for
instance Zero Mostel, worked with him as late as the mid-60s.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. You know the story. Someone said: ``Jerry Robbins is
directing. Would you work with him?'' And Zero said, ``Well, I
don't have to have lunch with him.'' That registered with me. Then
somebody said to me, ``But don't you think that's a cop-out?'' And
that's when I began thinking, ``Who is pristine? Aren't you cutting
your nose off not to work with him because you disapprove of what
he did?'' I worked with Jerry. Zero worked with Jerry, lunch or
not. Jerry was brilliant, there's no question about it.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. There are plenty of examples of people we consider to have
been important artists who were not wonderful people, whether it be
Frank Sinatra or Leni Riefenstahl__
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. Or Ezra Pound. Or T.S. Eliot.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Exactly. So you're saying it is possible, particularly in
a collaborative art form like the theater or the movies, to make
that distinction and go about your business.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. We're talking about famous people, about the arts and
big decisions like McCarthyism and the Hollywood witch hunt. But it
comes down to a daily decision. I think people face or commit
betrayal almost every day in their lives, in one form or another.
And what you have to do is decide what is the line you will or
won't cross. The issue that comes up in ``Jolson Sings Again'' is
very personal to me; it's about friendship, love and betrayal. It's
one thing to work with people like that. Can you really be a
friend? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. One reason you wrote the play was because you realized you
couldn't just say some people were morally reprehensible and some
were on the side of the angels. What are the events in your life
that made the gray start to appear?
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. Despite everything, there were parts of Jerry I felt
affection for, but the other thing, that deep character flaw that
enabled him to inform, always kept cropping up.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Yet you retained a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. When he did ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' for a very
complicated reason I won't go into, he had to come to me. It had to
do with royalties on the ``West Side Story'' section. It must have
killed him to come to me. But he did. He walked into my house on
the beach _ he hadn't been there in 20 years _ and he said, ``It
hasn't really changed, has it?'' I said, ``No.'' And he said, ``Am
I still in the cigar box?'' Years before, I had a wall in my study
of photographs I took of people I cared about. If they fell from
favor I put them in the cigar box. So I said, ``No, Jerry, the
cigar box is long gone.''
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Reading ``Jolson Sings Again'' in the new version,
everything the informer character, Andreas, does is so slippery.
How he negotiated his way out of the draft in the war; his
extramarital affairs and, finally, his informing. They seem of a
piece. Over the last year in American politics, there have been
many analogies made, not all of them accurate, between McCarthyism
and the sexual witch hunt now. I also think there is something
almost Clintonesque about this character who is an informer. The
qualities that make him slippery make you wonder if someone like
Bill Clinton might have been__
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. When you see it in performance, Andreas has enormous
charm.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. While the standard analogy has been to liken Kenneth Starr
to Joseph McCarthy, there is also a case to be made that Starr's
antagonist, Clinton, in some ways has this kind of shifting moral
center, if there is a moral center, that recalls informers.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. In the case of the character in the play, I don't
think he has a shifting moral center. I think he is an honest
deceiver. He has the virtue of believing it when he does it. I
think they all do, up to a point. You read Kazan's autobiography;
so many times he says he would do it again. While Jerry absolutely
ignored the subject.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Which would lead you to think perhaps he was embarrassed
about it.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. No. I think _ again, it goes back to Clinton _ I think
they can compartmentalize very well.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Is it possible to compartmentalize in terms of Kazan, who
is receiving this honorary Oscar?
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. My objection is: he has gotten two Oscars for his
work, but you don't honor the man. Not a man who has destroyed
lives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Let me play devil's advocate. This isn't the Nobel Prize.
It isn't even the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. It is an Oscar,
which is frequently bestowed on people in Hollywood who have
destroyed lots of lives.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. I think Kazan's motive is what is so awful. He
couldn't have worked in movies unless he testified.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. He's not the only one who had that motive, needless to
say. It still seems to me that this award, unless I'm
misunderstanding it, really isn't honoring him as a human being,
it's honoring his career.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. I think it's honoring him because the American Film
Institute wouldn't. He's 89, let's give him an award. And if you
want to know what I really think, I don't care who gets the Oscar
for anything.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. That's what I'm getting at. How does his receiving this
essentially valedictory award wipe out what he did in terms of
naming names?
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. It says it was OK, we can forget about it now.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Let me argue the opposite for a moment. Every day since
the academy announced they were going to do this (at the Oscars
ceremonies next Sunday), there have been stories in the press
pointing out exactly what he did do. This is vividly bringing to
life what naming names meant, much as your play does. It brings
back a history that had been increasingly shrouded in memory since
the end of the Cold War. Everyone is talking about the McCarthy
period again. So can't you have Kazan receive a Hollywood award
that is essentially trivial, at the same time that there are going
to be very spirited protests and a huge public debate about
informing? I don't understand how the academy, simply by giving
this award, is invested with so much power that it can wipe out a
vivid, very well-documented historical record.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. But Kazan can think, ``They honored me. I did the
right thing.'' There is no one in the world who if you give them an
Oscar doesn't believe it's good. No matter what they say about it
before. I don't have much respect for any award, even the Nobel
Prize. They gave it to Pearl Buck.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. I agree.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. But that's the attitude that says: ``What difference
does it make after all? He's 89 years old. He made some good
pictures. Why make such a fuss?'' I do not want him honored as a
person for something he did that was despicable.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. Do you feel that the atmosphere in the country over the
last year has had any resemblance to the McCarthy period? Or is
that notion thrown around too loosely?
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. Too casually. During that period you were really
frightened. Even when I came back from Europe and had a successful
play _ ``The Time of the Cuckoo'' _ I realized it vividly when
somebody asked me to sign something and I hesitated. The fact that
I hesitated appalled me, and I knew why. I was afraid. That fear
does not exist now. Even if they point a finger and say you're a
liberal.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. It's not going to affect your livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. It's not going to take away a job.
</P>
<P>
   RICH. You're working with young people on this play _ a young
director, young actors _ with a company that I suspect has a
younger audience than Broadway's. For those too young to remember
the McCarthy period, the fight over Kazan may seem hopelessly
arcane. Both for those involved with the production itself and the
audience, what do you hope another generation will take away from
your play?
</P>
<P>
   LAURENTS. I hope they will be moved. And I hope they will
realize that in your own life, you have to decide what lines you
will cross or won't cross. It has nothing to do with anything as
grandiose as McCarthy and informing. There are everyday betrayals.
The competition for success makes people do terrible things to one
another. I hope this play makes them conscious of that. &QL;

<P>
   (italics)In the play ``Jolson Sings Again'' by Arthur Laurents,
the character Andreas, a director, explains why he informed. Here
are excerpts from the scene, set in 1951.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I named names. You have to name names. To prove you are a loyal
American, you have to repent and eat crow. You have to inform.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to follow the ex-party line and say I informed to
save the country from Russia and atomic war. That's rationalizing.
How does it justify becoming an informer? My ex-comrades confess
the sins of the American Communist Party at the drop of a
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   I can claim a legitimate beef. I got my cancer because 15 years
ago I was a member of a legal political party for one lousy year!
Most of which I spent arguing against the discipline! And when I
left, I was angrier than any of my fellow performers in the
congressional circus.
</P>
<P>
   But does that justify becoming an informer? They holler there
are card-carrying members sneaking subversive propaganda into the
movies. What movies? How? Are they insane? Even if they believe it,
does that justify naming the names of your friends and co-workers?
</P>
<P>
   There is no political justification for being an informer.
However, I did it. They had all been named before and couldn't be
hurt by me. Still, I named them. I informed. Why.
</P>
<P>
   Have you never wanted something so badly that you threw shame
out the window? That's what I did. Making films is everything to
me. It's my center, my identity, my reason for being. I don't claim
that's a justification. It's my explanation.

   (italics)Chili Palmer is up to his old tricks again in Elmore
Leonard's new novel, ``Be Cool'' (Delacorte Press, 1999). In the
prequel, ``Get Shorty'' (made into a hit movie starring John
Travolta), Chili, a small-time loan shark from Brooklyn, becomes a
Hollywood producer. ``Be Cool'' opens with Chili working on an idea
for a new movie. His last film, ``Get Lost,'' was a flop, and Chili
thinks he has found a character with potential. She is a young
woman named Linda Moon who works for a dating service and sings
with a rock band. Chili's way of developing a script is to create a
real situation and then see what happens. He takes over Linda
Moon's career, and along the way to making her a rock star he
encounters a cast of colorful characters, from Russian mobsters to
gangster rappers to record industry executives. In an interview
conducted by Fletcher Roberts, the pop-music editor of Arts and
Leisure, Leonard, 73, discussed his interest in pop music and its
role in the novel. Here are excerpts from that conversation.(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FLETCHER ROBERTS. Martin Amis says you have perfect pitch. In
the opening scene of the book a character describes a band called
Road Kill to Chili: ``It used to be a hair band. Now they do
post-metal funk with a ska kick.'' Whether you're talking about
Alanis Morissette or Dick Dale and surf music, you really seem to
know pop music. How did you immerse yourself in that world?
</P>
<P>
   ELMORE LEONARD. The first thing my researcher, Greg Sutter, and
I did was visit the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. Then
on to Los Angeles to talk to record company executives like Guy
Oseary of Maverick, Madonna's label, and record producers like Rick
Rubin and Don Was. We sat in on Don and Richie Sambora fine-tuning
Richie's latest CD. We spoke to artists' managers, the artists
themselves, like Aerosmith and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. We spent
a whole day with record promoters. For two hours straight I
listened to a promoter talking on the phone to his guys in the
field and radio stations' program directors.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTS. Was that conversation the basis for the scene with the
fast-talking executive Nick Carr in the book?
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD. It's not near verbatim, but it's close. It's the
essence of what I heard, the sound of that kind of hip talk.
``You're my man, bro.'' ``Give me some spins.'' So talking to
people in the business, I got everything I thought I'd need. The
reference to post-metal with a ska kick I might not have heard
quite that way, but it sounded familiar and made enough sense to
me.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTS. Was this a new world for you? I mean, had you ever
heard of ska before?
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD. Well, I certainly knew about reggae. I referred to it
in a book I wrote in the late 70s or early 80s, and ska I related
to reggae: that Jamaican kind of a syncopated beat. I heard all
kinds of rock-and-roll at home when my five kids were growing up.
(They range in age from 33 to 48.) And I was fascinated by the
music in the film of Woodstock. Joe Cocker has been a favorite of
mine ever since. I like Steely Dan a lot, some of Led Zeppelin,
especially their song called ``Black Dog.'' I've always been aware
of Aerosmith and liked their music. I got to meet them in the fall
of '97 when they were in Detroit, and I asked them if they would
like to be in the book. They said sure, so I made up a scene in
which the band in the book opens for them at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   I watched a lot of MTV and VH1 preparing ``Be Cool.'' I was
especially interested in Alanis Morissette, Gwen Stefani of No
Doubt and Shirley Manson of Garbage and read pieces about them in
Interview, Vibe, Rolling Stone, thinking I might model Linda Moon
after one of them, though it didn't work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   I've always been interested in pop music, all the way back to
the 30s when I was a kid and liked the vocalist Mildred Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTS. So you've been a music fan for a long time?
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD. When I was in high school in the early 40s, I used to
go to the Paradise Theater in downtown Detroit to hear Basie, Earl
(Fatha) Hine, Jimmy Lunceford, Andy Kirk and His Clouds of Joy with
Mary Lou Williams on piano.
</P>
<P>
   I was in the Navy during the war. We got back from the Pacific
in January 1946, tied up at Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay,
and I headed straight for Oakland, where Stan Kenton was playing
that night. I remember standing in front of the stage, looking up
at June Christy singing ``Buzz Me Baby.'' Another favorite of mine
was Anita O'Day _ Anita and Roy Eldridge doing ``Let Me Off
Uptown.'' My all-time favorite is Count Basie.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTS. How does the pop music of today compare with that of
your youth?
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD. I like a lot of it, but it doesn't inspire me the way
jazz does. I can remember watching Dizzy Gillespie on stage and
wanting to go home and write. Readers have even mentioned feeling a
definite jazz influence in my writing. I don't listen to music when
I write, but I think I could play the Modern Jazz Quartet in the
background or Ahmad Jamal, definitely Dave Brubeck's ``Take Five.''
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTS. Did that make it difficult for you to get into
rock-and-roll?
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD. No. Because I don't have to be inspired to appreciate
the power of rock, that force coming at you. And I never wore
earplugs. But my vibes are more closely associated with jazz: a
structured sound you do variations on, improvising, the artist's
personality coming through.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTS. What prompted you to use the music industry as a
setting for ``Be Cool''?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD. At the premiere of ``Get Shorty,'' an MGM executive
asked if I thought I could write a sequel. I said, ``I don't know
why not.'' But I was already thinking of ``Out of Sight'' and then
wrote ``Cuba Libre'' as a change of pace, to get out of the hip
world for a time. It was my publisher who suggested the music
industry, and it sounded like a good idea. The premise: Chili
Palmer learns about the business as he puts together an idea for a
movie, casting the kinds of people he meets along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTS. So Chili Palmer creates scripts the same way you write
novels?
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD. Exactly. I get to know the characters intimately and
let them guide the action, making it up as I go along. I make the
point of Chili not wanting to do a sequel as a challenge to me _ to
try to make ``Be Cool'' a better story than ``Get Shorty.''
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTS. One of the central characters in ``Be Cool'' is named
Linda Moon. You have a character of the same name in your novel
``Glitz.'' Both are singers. What's the connection?
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD. The only connection is that I like the name. And I
wanted to use it again. I knew I couldn't use the original Linda
Moon because Lorimar owns her as far as movies are concerned. So I
have the original Linda Moon give this Linda her name because this
one loves the name and the original says, ``Well, go ahead and take
it. I'm not using it anymore. I'm married to a cop.''
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTS. I believe the music referred to in the book, played by
Linda Moon's band, comes from a band called the Stone Coyotes?
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD. Yes, four songs are from the Stone Coyotes repertory
and a new one, ``Odessa,'' Barbara Keith of the Coyotes wrote
especially for the book. After all the time listening to CDs and
watching MTV, one night I saw the Stone Coyotes at the Troubadour
in L.A. and knew right away this was the music I wanted for the
book: rock with country overtones, a twang, as played by a band
from Odessa, Texas A critic had described the Coyotes' music as
``AC/DC meets Patsy Cline,'' and that, I realized, was exactly what
I wanted. So I asked if I could use their music, described how I
would do it and gave them a couple of my books. Barbara's husband,
Doug Tibbles, the drummer, read one and said to her, ``He's for
real.'' And that was it.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTS. Now you're touring with the Stone Coyotes?
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD. Not really. We got together at the Mint in L.A., the
Mercury Lounge in New York and Mama Kin in Boston while I was on a
promotional tour for ``Be Cool.'' I read a passage from the book
that referred to the music, stepped aside and the band kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTS. What's this about you wanting to be a rock star for a
day.
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD. I would, for about 48 hours. I'd want to do two
concerts. I can't sing, so I'd be Joe Perry. What fascinates me is
the crowd reaction. I saw Iggy Pop a couple of times, and I asked
him, ``What's it like when everybody's waving their arms in the air
and they're lighting lighters and they're climbing up on the
stage?'' He said: ``Oh man, it's great. I'd like to just kind of
hover over them and watch. You know, just look down at them.'' His
wife was standing there, a Japanese woman, and I asked him, ``How'd
you meet your wife?' And he said, ``Well, we were playing in Tokyo
and I saw her in the audience so I dove out there and got her
number.''
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTS. You're a well-known writer. You must have lots of fans.
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD. I do, but I don't have groupies. If I did, though, at
my age, they would be perfectly safe. I hear from English
instructors who use my books in their English Lit courses. And I
hear from convicts who want to know if I've ever done time. One
told me he's gotten some of the hard-core readers to try me and
that I'm gaining in popularity with the heroin users but haven't
made it yet with the crack and cocaine crowd because they're
younger and less educated.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERTS. You've said that you wrote ``Be Cool'' to be a movie.
Do you think Travolta will play Chili again?
</P>
<P>
   LEONARD. I think he'd be nuts if he doesn't. He (italics)is(end
italics) Chili Palmer. I was trying to find out if he's read the
book, bugging my agent who finally said, ``Why don't you call and
ask him?'' It took a couple of days to locate him. I called and he
was out on a boat and couldn't be reached. But he returned my call
a few days later. And I asked him if he had read the book, and he
said, ``No, I'm not reading anything.'' He said: ``I'm tired. I
just finished `Civil Action.' But I'll get to it. Don't worry.'' He
said, ``Oh, by the way, I just bought a 707.'' And I said: ``Oh,
yeah? You did?'' So after I got off the phone my wife said: ``What
were you talking about? All you said to him was `Yeah?' `Wow.''' I
said, ``Well, what do you say to a guy who tells you he's just
bought an airliner with a bedroom in it, you know?'' Yeah, I wanted
to talk about ``Be Cool,'' but we talked about 707s.

AFFORDABLE HOCKNEY, PLAYING THE PROMOTER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ If you have ever dreamed of owning a David Hockney but
haven't had $20,000 (or considerably more) to spend on a drawing,
oil painting or lithograph, Christie's South Kensington has come
along with the largest-ever sale of Hockney posters, to be held
here on March 25.
</P>
<P>
   And although one might argue that posters are not in the same
league as paintings and lithographs, the collection testifies to
precisely that dazzling breadth and wit that have made Hockney, now
61, one of the most popular and admired of contemporary artists.
</P>
<P>
   The collection belongs to Brian Baggott, 56, a onetime British
Airways employee who first met Hockney some 30 years ago and has
been collecting his posters (as well as silk screens) since the
early 70s. Working in group sales for the airline made it easy for
him to travel. ``I wrote to every gallery ever mentioned in the
back of a Hockney catalog to see if they'd done a poster,'' Baggott
explained from his south London home. And before long, he said of
his keen pursuit, ``it had become a bit of an obsession, rather
like schoolboys with stamps.''
</P>
<P>
   What exactly is a Hockney poster? The answer is as varied as the
artist's own output. Most of the 206 posters that make up the 132
lots for sale were produced by a gallery or institution or magazine
and use a Hockney image to promote an event or exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   But there are others, though many fewer of them, that were
specifically designed and overseen by Hockney himself, often with
tongue in cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 111, for example, is a poster for a Hockney show at the
Whitechapel Art Gallery in London in 1970 that features one image
in which Hockney has amusingly drawn himself. Some posters present
a detail of a much larger canvas; for example, the art chosen for
posters pertaining to Tivoli Gardens and the Strauss opera ``Die
Frau Ohne Schatten'' consists, in effect, of enlarged details from
pre-existing paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Others bear images unique to the poster _ like the geometric
faces announcing the 1976 edition of the Spoleto festival in Italy
_) and therefore to Hockney's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's every combination you can possibly think of,'' Baggott
said. ``That's very David; he likes to keep everybody on the hop.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it seems wasteful to purchase a Hockney poster, which
tends to be a reproduction, when his original works come up
frequently for auction. Indeed, at its 20th-century art auction on
March 26, Christie's has included a 1985 Hockney lithograph and
collage, ``An Image of Gregory,'' with a top estimate of $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the posters are estimated to sell for much more than
$1,000, and the prices are usually for lots of two or three items,
although a few posters are for sale on their own. (Ninety percent
of the lots, Baggott said, include at least one signed poster.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a way of buying a David Hockney affordably,'' said
Nicolette White, a 19th- and 20th-century poster specialist at
Christie's. ``OK, it's not the original, but there are only a
certain amount of them produced, and you've got David's signature
for a fraction of the price you would pay for an original work of
art.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall value of the sale has been estimated at $90,000 to
$100,000, although, Ms. White said, that figure is ``obviously
quite modest.'' And while it's the posters with signatures _ a few
with a scribbled ``for Brian,'' naming Baggott directly _ that will
command the higher prices, others are of note either because of
their scarcity or because of their images.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 131, for instance, contains Hockney's signed poster for a
1972 West End production of ``The Threepenny Opera,'' starring
Vanessa Redgrave, that is unusual because Hockney didn't in fact
design the show. More customary are posters for opera and ballet
productions that Hockney also designed, whether ``Turandot'' in
Chicago, ``Tristan und Isolde'' in Los Angeles, the triple bill
known as ``Parade'' in New York or ``The Rake's Progress'' in
Glyndebourne, England.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pricier items for sale, with a top estimate of some
$1,300, is a rare poster announcing Hockney's 1966 Royal Court
Theater production of the absurdist play ``Ubu Roi,'' by Alfred
Jarry; only one other known copy of that poster exists.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of Hockney will find all the familiar images on view,
from a favorite model like Celia Birtwell, the fabric designer, to
his beloved dachsund, Stanley, as well as the languid young men who
have figured prominently in Hockney's depiction of life in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the 1988 Tate Gallery retrospective of his work, Hockney
came up with a poster that shows his 1987 canvas ``Little Stanley
Sleeping,'' now framed and nailed to a wall: the result is a droll
play on an extant painting. The Paris Review and the Young
Playwrights Festival Off Broadway are just two entities to make use
of Hockney images for posters.
</P>
<P>
   How does the artist himself feel about having posters expand the
audience for his work? In his 1993 autobiography, ``That's The Way
I See It,'' Hockney wrote: ``The poster can be a marvelous
reproduction, better than anything in a book, and if you print them
well and take the photographs of the paintings well, the posters
are worth keeping, people might like them; they can pin them on a
wall.''

TCU outlasts Kansas State in NIT first round 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ Delays usually send TCU coach Billy Tubbs into
a tizzy.
</P>
<P>
   He despises waiting.
</P>
<P>
   So when mechanical problems delayed TCU's departure from
Dallas/Fort Worth Airport to Kansas City, Mo., thus delaying TCU's
arrival in Manhattan until 2 1/2 hours before last night's game,
Horned Frogs players were expecting a Tubbs' tantrum.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tubbs leaned back, relaxed and watched as TCU defeated
Kansas State, 72-71, in the first round of the National Invitation
Tournament last night at Bramlage Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handled that pretty well, considering'' said Frogs
preseason all-American Lee Nailon, his game-high 22 points also
helping Tubbs' mood considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to use it as a positive,'' Tubbs said of TCU's travel
troubles. ``Hey, we didn't have to sit around and wait all day.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU jumped off a bus in Manhattan, taped and stretched and then
promptly jumped back on to go play.
</P>
<P>
   A long day had a chance to get even longer for Frogs players
when Wildcats guard Chris Griffin launched a wild, game-tying
attempt from a ways away with a couple of seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's shot sailed wide, though, and a tip-in by Tony Kitt,
while good, was a point too little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there was a little over three seconds left on the
clock,'' Griffin explained later. ``When Manny \RDies\S got the
rebound, he surveyed the court before he gave the ball to me. I
figured there was only one second left. I wasn't aware that they
had put time back on the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU (20-10) had grabbed its biggest lead of the game, 65-53,
with 7:57 remaining. Kansas State (20-13), however, refused to go
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats sneaked within sniffing distance a couple of times,
including 72-69 with 5.6 seconds remaining. Kansas State fouled
before the ball was inbounded, but two seconds had ticked off the
clock. The time was put back on before TCU missed the front end of
a one-and-one, giving K-State five seconds and one more chance. But
TCU played just good enough, just long enough to get to play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to play our way to New York,'' Tubbs said of
the NIT finals March 23-25 in Madison Square Garden. ``I wouldn't
mind having a game at home, though.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU next faces Nebraska in the second round of the NIT either
Monday or Tuesday at a site and time yet to be determined. The
Cornhuskers defeated Nevada-Las Vegas, 68-55, last night.
</P>
<P>
   Frogs players seemed to seal their second-round berth during a
spurt midway through second-half play. It wasn't one thing, really,
just a number of things happening at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Frogs guard Ryan Carroll nailed a couple of critical 3-pointers
to finish with 16 points. Kansas State's Shawn Rhodes was whistled
for an intentional foul that allowed TCU to take a double-digit
lead with 8:59 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The size diminished considerably, but the lead never evaporated
for the Frogs despite their playing most of the second half without
Marquise Gainous. He was whistled for his fourth foul with 18:56
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The game, like the day, didn't start off well for TCU.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs were plagued by poor shooting early and trailed by as
many as nine points. They trailed 22-13 with 10:22 remaining in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   TCU went on an 18-2 run over the next 6:05, grabbing its first
lead of the game. The run was sparked by Nailon, who scored eight
of TCU's 13 points during the run. He credited the change to Tubbs'
decision to switch up so he was playing more facing the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to play a lot freer,'' Nailon said of the switch.
``Coach didn't let me do that a lot this season. He kind of pulled
it out of his hat tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Nailon had started slowly, missing eight of his first 10 shots
from the field. It was a sluggish shooting night for both squads.
The Wildcats shot 42 percent from the field and were 3-for-23 on
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their zone made us shoot from the perimeter, and we just
couldn't make those shots,'' Wildcats coach Tom Asbury said.
``Great looks, wide-open shots, just wouldn't fall in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs weren't much better. They shot 43 percent, but were
7-of-23 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Just another little delay before they finally got on track.

JUST SQUEAK YOUR HIGHTOPS THREE TIMES...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ This was about heart and wizards and
redemption, and TCU found some of all these things in Wednesday
night's 72-71 victory over Kansas State in the opening round of the
NIT.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough yet, mind you, but some.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs came to the Land of Oz as enigmatic as any team Billy
Tubbs has ever coached, disheartened by a first-round loss in the
Western Athletic Conference tournament last week in Las Vegas and
rightfully snubbed by the NCAA's 64-team tournament.
</P>
<P>
   This was a team that started the season ranked 24th in the
nation and found itself in the middle of a Kansas wheat field after
a late-season collapse that left Tubbs, who never met a notebook he
couldn't fill up, almost speechless with frustration.
</P>
<P>
   This was definitely about pride. The Frogs would not have been
able to look themselves in the mirror if they'd come here and lost
to the gritty but less-talented Wildcats, who end their season at
20-13.
</P>
<P>
   This was about starting fresh in a place nicknamed ``The Little
Apple'' with every intention of taking it all the way to ``The Big
Apple'' for the National Invitation Tournament final four.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky's the limit,'' said center Lee Nailon, who fueled the
Frogs' victory with 22 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. Wasn't that what we were saying when this season began in
November?
</P>
<P>
   Nailon actually showed a flash or two of on-court leadership,
scowling at teammates for mistakes real or imagined, patting them
on the rump or offering words of encouragement for good plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach has been stressing that I need to do that more, stay
more focused and pick up the other guys, too,'' said Nailon, who
was more productive last night when he abandoned his patented
low-post moves and played facing the basket. He even stepped
outside and hit two key 3-point jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   If that seemed strange, imagine a Tubbs-coached team that never
_ I repeat, ``never'' _ pressed during the entire game and spent
much of it playing a 1-3-1 zone, inviting the 'Cats to bomb away
from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State responded by hitting three of 23 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their zone made us shoot from the perimeter, and we just
couldn't make those shots,'' Kansas State coach Tom Asbury said.
``Great looks, wide open shots, just wouldn't fall in.''
</P>
<P>
   So we have Nailon hitting 3-pointers and the Frogs abandoning
their trademark press. Want yet another
you're-not-going-to-believe-this observation?
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs never left his seat in anger, never yelled at the refs,
never seemed to break a sweat, much to the disappointment of a
small but vocal KSU crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the best officiated game I've seen all
season,'' Tubbs sniffed calmly after the victory.
</P>
<P>
   And here we were, expecting Billy to at least go off about the
Frogs' travel arrangements and problems getting here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   TCU made an economic decision not to charter a flight (an
$18,000 difference in cost), so the Frogs, after a 2 1/2-hour delay
at D/FW Airport because of mechanical problems, eventually flew to
Kansas City, Mo., then made the two-hour drive by bus, not arriving
at Bramlage Coliseum until 2 1/2 hours before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather walk in and play than sit around all day anyway,''
Tubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon fueled an 18-2 run that gave TCU a 38-33 halftime lead
after the Frogs trailed by up to nine in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Wildcats could get in the second half was the
final score on a tip-in at the buzzer by Tony Kitt off a badly
missed 3-point prayer by Chris Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, we kind of got control of the game,''
Tubbs said, ``but we could never get in a comfort zone because of
their rebounding. They got a lot of baskets on put backs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, one of the best rebounding and defensive teams in
the Big 12, dominated the boards, 49-34.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were a great rebounding team,'' Tubbs said, ``we'd be
playing in the `other' tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is how far they can get in this one and that
may be as much a product of want-to as anything else. The Frogs are
like a stakes horse dropping down in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys seemed to find out that the game is fun again last
week during practice,'' Tubbs said. ``I've never accused our
players of quitting, and we've never come in and said we lost a
game because we didn't care enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, we may be too nice. We could probably stand to be
a little more nasty sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   They can be as nasty as they want to be in next week's
second-round game against Nebraska, probably in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the guys stay fired up,'' Nailon said, ``we can go all the
way to Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Manhattan is where the Frogs' new season began
Wednesday night. The other Manhattan is where they'd like for it to
end.

`STAR WARS' PREQUEL TO ARRIVE TWO DAYS EARLY, LUCAS PROMISES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The world will get its latest ``Star Wars'' fix two
days early, director George Lucas announced late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,'' the most
anticipated movie in decades, will open on May 19 rather than May
21, Lucas told the ShoWest convention of the nation's theater
owners in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work on the film has been going extremely well,'' Lucas said
in explaining the decision to move up the opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be able to release it on Wednesday, May 19, in
hopes that we can give the fans a head start and families can see
it on the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said he loves the new film and was encouraged by the
reaction of his close friend, director Steven Spielberg, after
seeing the completed film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to see it again,'' Spielberg reportedly told
Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   The film, a ``prequel'' to the familiar ``Star Wars'' trilogy,
goes back in time to explain how Luke Skywalker's father, Anakin
Skywalker, became the evil Darth Vader. Lucas is planning to
release ``Episode II'' in 2002 and ``Episode III'' in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe ``Episode I'' can break the box-office
records set last year by James Cameron's ``Titanic'' for domestic
gross of $600 million and worldwide gross of $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Lucas' announcement, 20th Century Fox, which has
distributed all the ``Star Wars'' movies, screened the second
two-minute trailer for the eagerly anticipated film.
</P>
<P>
   The clip, expected to debut in theaters Friday, opens with enemy
troops massing to attack as Natalie Portman, playing Queen Amidala,
Luke Skywalker's future mother, declares, ``I will not condone a
cause of action that will lead to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the remainder contains clips of the science fiction
series' trademark outer space battles along with light saber duels
involving Jedi Knights played by Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement also includes brief shots of robots R2-D2 and
C-3PO, Jedi master Yoda and arch-villan Jabba the Hutt.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer ends with the words, ``The saga begins May 19.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who created all the ``Star Wars'' movies and directed the
original 1977 film, also announced that the prequel will be
screened on June 18 with digital projectors at four undisclosed
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, he disclosed that he expects to film all of
``Episode II'' with digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Long a strong proponent of using leading-edge technology to
improve moviemaking, Lucas said, ``I can't think of a better time
to be in the motion picture business.''

<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Republican Elizabeth Hanford Dole came a step closer to
breaking the all-male hold on presidential politics Wednesday,
saying she will mount a ``people-to-people'' effort to explore a
run for the nation's highest office.
<P>
   ``What does a woman like me have to offer the country?'' asked
Dole, in announcing the formation of her exploratory committee at a
rally in Des Moines, Iowa. ``I'm not a politician and, frankly,
today I think that may be a plus.'' Bob Dole, her husband and the
GOP's 1996 presidential nominee, did not attend the event, where
she took the mike and wandered through the crowd with an energetic
address.
</P>
<P>
   With the California March 2000 primary just a year away, the
announcement by Dole _ who hit just about every hamlet and high
tech haven statewide while stumping for her husband in 1996 _ set
off a new round of political tremors in California.
</P>
<P>
   Political insiders say the nation's most populous state could be
a place where she has a big impact _ but faces more than a few
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is truly a historic opportunity for the country _ and more
important for the Republican Party,'' said GOP consultant Leslie
Goodman, also a friend to Texas governor and GOP front-runner
George W. Bush. ``The Dole candidacy is a signal to voters across
the country that Republicans are not taking women for granted. ...
and it's an opportunity to demonstrate the depth and breadth of the
GOP.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's decision could also have state aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly increases the chances that (Democratic U.S.
Senator) Dianne Feinstein will be vice presidential nominee,'' said
East Bay GOP campaign adviser and party activist Larry Molton.
``There will be tremendous pressure on Al Gore to keep up with the
Republicans ... and the better Elizabeth Dole does, the more
pressure there will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's announcement comes the same week Bush formed his own
exploratory committee. But Bush has already done considerable work
in California, and Bush operatives were in Sacramento Wednesday
mining more support.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the wild card,'' said one veteran GOP insider of Dole.
``Nobody really knows who she is _ or how she'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   And state Democrats were already downplaying Dole's importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Oprah is retiring, she's got it hands down,'' said
California Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres. But ``we don't
need a television talk show host to be president. We need someone
with experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the possible candidacy of Dole _ the former secretary of
labor and secretary of transportation, and past president of the
American Red Cross _ is already historic. She is ``the first female
national political figure to emerge on her own professional and
political credentials,'' said GOP analyst Dan Schnur.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's strength and resume give her the status as a strong
``national political player'' that eluded two Democratic aspirants
for high office _ Pat Schroeder, who made a short-lived run for
president in 1988, and Geraldine Ferraro, a vice presidential
nominee on the Democratic ticket in 1984, he said.
</P>
<P>
   She also has proved her strength on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not, in 1996, see a better campaigner than Elizabeth
Dole,'' said former state GOP Chairman John Herrington, a longtime
friend of Dole's. ``She's smart and organized, and she comes across
as a very caring person _ not a hard-liner on any one issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Carroll, a Republican activist from Modesto, said Dole's
1996 campaigns on behalf of her husband were nothing short of
``phenomenal.'' She recalled how Dole spoke from the back of an old
train caboose in the middle of a feed lot to a tough crowd of
Central Valley farmers in 1996. ``It was over 100 degrees, hot and
sticky, and she looked cool as a breeze,'' said Carroll. ``I hope
she'll be able to win back a lot of those Republican women who
deserted the party or didn't vote at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a great following here, and she created it ... in the
campaign she did for Bob,'' said Los Angeles attorney Ken
Khachigian, the veteran GOP strategist who ran Bob Dole's 1996
California campaign. ``For the more conservative women, she has a
fairly conservative philosophy. And for moderates to liberals, she
has been a pioneer and pacesetter in issues that deal with women in
the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dole faces new challenges in her quest for the
presidency,particularly in California.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, experts say:
</P>
<P>
   -- Defining the issues: Dole _ lacking a legislative record _
hasn't yet ``put meat on the bones'' and noted her stance on issues
like education, environment, trade and abortion, Khachigian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her biggest challenge is going to be to fill in the policy
blanks, without sacrificing her potential support,'' said Schnur.
</P>
<P>
   -- Raising money: ``Dole has access to Bob Dole's contributors,
who are substantial. She will attract a lot of new money with
people wanting to cover bets,'' said Herrington. ``They want a good
Republican woman like her to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a lot of work to do to prove that ``she has the
table stakes to go,'' said Khachigian.
</P>
<P>
   -- Abortion: Dole is strongly anti-abortion, but Carroll said
her warm, engaging style will help her ``make the party more
inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, does she believe in litmus tests?'' asked
Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   -- No elected office: ``In order to succeed, you have to have a
clear rationale for your candidacy and a clear vision of where you
want to take the country,'' said Goodman. ``The question is: Is
Elizabeth Dole the person who can outline that vision, having never
held elective office before?''
</P>
<P>
   -- Her husband's role: How often does Dole campaign in
California here  &LR; with her husband _ who got just 39 percent of the
1996 vote, compared to 51 percent for President Clinton? Bob Dole
is currently featured seen  &LR; in a nationwide in  &LR; TV ad, in which he
talks about erectile dysfunction and endorses the impotence drug
Viagra. If Elizabeth Dole becomes the subject of ribbing _ or the
dreaded ``Top Ten'' list of late night talk show host David
Letterman _ it could affect her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard for him (Bob Dole) to be a public
spokesman for a commercial product and a campaign surrogate at the
same time,'' said Khachigian.
</P>
<P>
   Said Schnur: ``Better those jokes, than the ones about Hillary
Clinton.''

 PHYSICIST WINS $1.24 MILLION RELIGION PRIZE  &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ian Barbour, a physicist who has spent a career fostering
dialogue between scientists and people of faith, won the $1.24
million Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour, 75, announced that he would give $1 million of his
windfall to the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences, an
institute in Berkeley, Calif., that is part of the Graduate
Theological Union, a consortium of seminaries in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Randolph, program director at the center, called
Barbour, a theologian and a nuclear physicist at Carleton College
in Northfield, Minn., ``a pioneer in the dialogue of religion and
science.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel unmitigated joy and happiness that Ian has been
recognized in this way,'' said Randolph. ``We intend to use the
money to continue the work that he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize, awarded by an independent jury, was the latest gift
of Sir John M. Templeton, a Presbyterian layman and founder of
several successful investment funds. Previous winners of the award
_ the world's largest annual prize for achievement in any field _
include Mother Teresa, the Rev. Billy Graham and prison evangelist
and Watergate figure Charles Colson.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time the Center for Theology and the
Natural Sciences has benefited from Templeton's largesse.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Randolph said, the Templeton Foundation granted the
center $13 million to help professors and universities around the
world begin interdisciplinary courses in the study of science and
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of money going into this area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph said Barbour was the second J.K. Russell Research
Fellow at the center, just two years after its founding in 1981,
and has attended several conferences sponsored by the Berkeley
think thank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Barbour published ``Issues in Science and Religion,''
an early work in this increasingly popular _ and well-funded _
arena. His recent works include two books published by
HarperSanFrancisco, ``Ethics in an Age of Technology'' and
``Religion and Science: Historical and Contemporary Issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to think science has all the answers, because it's a
very powerful tool,'' Barbour said Wednesday. But scientists must
keep lines of communication open to the religious community, he
said, to help answer today's ethical and spiritual questions.
</P>
<P>
   John Cobb, a professor of theology at Claremont College in
Southern California, said Barbour deserved the prize. ``No
contemporary has made a more original, deep and lasting
contribution toward the needed integration of scientific and
religious knowledge and values,'' Cobb said.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph said Barbour, a member of the United Church of Christ
and a graduate of Yale Divinity School and the University of
Chicago, has helped foster understanding between ``those opposed to
technology and those who see salvation in technology.''

WHAT YOU WON'T SEE AT THIS YEAR'S OSCARS 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides of actor Tom Hanks in scenes from ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    When the 1 billion viewers in more than 90 countries tune in the
71st annual Academy Awards Ceremony on March 2l, they'll argue over
the same old stuff:
 &HT;    Can Tom Hanks' heroic officer in ``Saving Private Ryan'' go the
distance despite back-to-back Oscars in recent years? Will the best
actress be Australian Cate Blanchette playing a British queen in
``Elizabeth,'' or American Gwyneth Paltrow playing a British
gentlewoman in ``Shakespeare in Love''?
 &HT;    We'll see the usual parade of overdressed actresses and
over-choreographed dance numbers. But there's plenty we won't see:
Oscar taboos and precautions that go on behind the scenes. After
more than 25 years of covering the big night, I can list 10 things
you can bet you won't view when you tune in this year:
 &HT;    1. Demonstrations: At the slightest hint of disturbance in the
hall, producer Gilbert Cates and director Louis J. Horvitz will
order a cut to commercial or taped film clips. A ``silent
demonstration'' is being threatened by some guests who disapprove
of an honorary Oscar for Elia Kazan, who cooperated in 1951 with
the House Committee on Un-American Activites. If the demonstration
does occur, expect the show to go on with the cameras focused
determinedly elsewhere.
 &HT;    2. Empty Seats: During the long night many in the audience will
leave their assigned seats to present or accept awards. No sooner
does one of them spring to his feet than a 'sitter' jumps into the
empty spot. This is, after all, the hottest ticket in town and it
wouldn't do for it to look anything but jammed.
 &HT;    3. Freeway Gridlock: For the first time they've changed Oscar
night to Sunday. There will of course be some tight traffic outside
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion as limousines line up to unload the
glitterati.
 &HT;    4. Endless Verbiage: Cates and Horvitz will give the order to
``kill the mike'' of those who drone too long or make political
speeches when they should be thanking their mothers. (Mothers can
be thanked effusively provided it's done in 30 seconds or less.)
 &HT;    5. The War Chest: You won't hear a word about the $30 million
spent on newspaper ads and gifts by studios and producers lobbying
Academy members' votes. (The Los Angeles Times says Miramax alone
has spent in the $15-million range to tout ``Shakespeare in Love''
and ``Life is Beautiful.'') Everyone knows an Oscar can add
millions to a movie's box office take.
 &HT;    6. The Booty: Stashed at home, each of the 5,000 voting members
has a video cassette library of virtually every movie in the
contest. Behind the scenes are gift baskets for the presenters,
with perfume, champagne, and (in past years) $1,000-wristwatches,
leather goods and other trinkets from Rodeo Drive.
 &HT;    7. Security Guards: They'll be wearing tuxedo jackets like the
guests, but the guards' will have wires projecting from the back of
the collar. The radio-equipped team will occupy approximately 30
seats on two levels of the auditorium and outside the doors. In
addition is a contingent of 500 local cops_beefed up by Pinkertson
guards_under the direction of Jerry Moon, the former Los Angeles
policeman who has been keeping Oscar buttoned down for 20 years.
 &HT;    8. The Media: Most of the 1,000 reporters covering the event
(almost a third are foreign) are confined ``backstage'' and
interview the winners as they are paraded from one room to another.
But you won't see a press conference in which the losers lament
that the best man didn't win, the voting was rigged or the best
actress slept her way to the top. Instead they'll show up at
Miramax's Oscar bash or the Governors' Ball.
 &HT;    9) The Flacks: Call them press agents, handlers, publicity
types, hand holders: They outnumber the stars 2-1. They try to stay
in the background and make sure their clients display their best
side to the camera. Many of them have spent months devising Oscar
campaigns for their celebrity clients, and if they look more tense
than usual (and these are not the most laid-back people at the best
of times,) it's because if their client doesn't win they may get
fired.
 &HT;    10: Offensive Film: Clips with excessive nudity, racy or foul
language will not have made it past Susan Futterman, ABC's
standards and practices censor. One year she killed a clip of an
actress displaying three breasts from a scene in the sci-fi film
``Total Recall.'' ``Sorry,'' she said, ``that will have to go. I
can't even show women with two breasts.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Myopic GOP just might stimulate Gore
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, March 14, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Ronald Reagan was the Teflon president, then Bill Clinton is
the Velcro president _ everything sticks to him, not that he
doesn't deserve much of it.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican effort to attach blame to the Clinton White
House for an appalling breakdown in security during the Reagan and
Bush administrations is so off-base as to be laughable.
</P>
<P>
   This is one that won't cling to Clinton, and might just help Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss) had the audacity last week, after
allegations arose that the theft of nuclear secrets by China took
place during the Reagan/Bush years, to say he was not going to
dwell so much on the past, but wants to know what's being done
about correcting the problem.
</P>
<P>
   I would not expect much else from Lott. Why dwell on the past
when the past doesn't look good for the Republicans?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, GOPartisans are demanding to know why the alleged mole
managed to hang on to his job for nearly three (Clinton) years
while under investigation. It's a good question, but first I'd like
the primary question answered: How did a nuclear scientist manage
to pass secrets to the Communist Chinese for all those Reagan/Bush
years without being detected?
</P>
<P>
   I have another question that still has not been answered: How
did Reagan and Bush get away with their hear-no-evil, see-no-evil
roles in the Iran-Contra affair?
</P>
<P>
   And where was the deadly response from superpatriot Reagan after
terrorists blew up the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983 _
killing 241 troops?
</P>
<P>
   Also, if we knew in advance that Bush would let Saddam Hussein
live to fight another day after Operation Desert Storm, would we
still have agreed to his boisterous buildup and attack?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, anyone can play partisan politics, but when does it
reach absurdity?
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans to try to paint Clinton with responsibility
for this severe breach in U.S. security is stepping beyond the
line. To the good of Democrats, it can be an issue that might bring
Gore out of his self-inflicted obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Gore has jumped into the fight in a TV interview,
taking the reins away from Clinton by arguing back that this
administration inherited the Chinese nuclear mess from previous
administrations, namely Reagan's and Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   If there's something the Republicans don't want to do, it's to
wake up Al Gore. Already they've incurred national animosity over
the obstinate and bellicose way they handled the Clinton-Lewinsky
scandal; now they're intent on giving the Democrats another issue.
</P>
<P>
   To keep beating on Clinton is to beat a dead horse. While his
numbers may be high, he is still held in low-esteem by this nation
for his Monica dishonor. As a world leader, his prestige has
slumped, evidenced this past week by little Guatemala and El
Salvador telling him to take a hike over a joint resolution he
thought had been pre-approved.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential hopefuls don't need a fighting Al Gore on the
stump. Studies show that Gore ranks high in everything but emotion.
If he gets that, then George W. Bush and the other GOP contenders
will have a tougher opponent.
</P>
<P>
   (An earlier image of Gore and the younger Bush engaging in
debates carried with it the same prospect of watching two guys
fish.)
</P>
<P>
   It is time the Republicans ended their partisan siege. Trying to
paint over Reagan and Bush fiascos by smearing Clinton covers
nothing; it is transparent.
</P>
<P>
   There's enough blame to go around for quite a few of our present
and past presidents, Democrats and Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   Each, however, has his own mailbox _ self-addressed.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Gun control vs. lawsuit control
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If General Motors has a lick of sense, it will rush Congressman
Bob Barr onto its board. Just think: no more pesky lawsuits. A free
ticket through the courts. Trial lawyers, defendants, judgments,
damages _ all gone.
</P>
<P>
   Barr is the Georgia Republican who was booming impeachment long
before anyone had dug up even an excuse for that, apparently on the
general principle that, well, there's Bill Clinton and there's the
Constitution's impeachment option, so what are we waiting for?
</P>
<P>
   The hustle brought Barr, if not fame, at least notoriety and a
meteoric rise through the TV talk shows from after-hours gigs on
obscure cable channels to the glory of prime time network
interviews. But with impeachment a flop, how long can a poor fellow
survive on nothing better than speaking invitations from
organizations with political charters drawn up by guys who had
stared at the moon too long?
</P>
<P>
   Barr has soldiered into the breach in his own career with
federal legislation that, if passed, would forbid cities and states
to sue firearms manufacturers. As chance would have it, Barr is a
member of the National Rifle Association's board, which has been in
one of its patented swivets over lawsuits against the industry
filed by five cities.
</P>
<P>
   As it does in any attempt to contain the domestic arms race, the
NRA sees the suits as the first step in a plot to disarm American
yeomanry and submit the citizens to a tyranny of Nazis, Commies or
humanists. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Give Barr this: Most of us would agree that we've become a far
too litigious society and fear that some day the nation will come
to a complete stop because, as it turns out, everyone of us is in
court. And some of the lawsuits against the industry do seem a bit
of a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But so what? Mistaken, even goofy or malicious lawsuits are
filed all the time, and the courts have plenty of ways, and lot of
experience in using those ways, to dispose of them. There's no
stampede by other cities to follow the five that are testing these
legal waters. If the suits prove meritless, they will fail and that
will be the end of that.
</P>
<P>
   If, as Barr, the NRA and the manufacturers all say, these are
frivolous filings, what better, what more definitive, way to show
that than to have them publicly miscarry, rather than using
legislation of dubious constitutionality to prevent any ventilation
of the marketing and safety issues raised by the suits?
</P>
<P>
   Firearms policies are best set through the reconciling
negotiations of political give and take, but the gun lobby has used
its money and scare tactics effectively to prevent ordinary
political dialogue. The current, small bustle of lawsuits
represents less the core attack on firearms that the panicky
industry and lobby fear than a desperate resort to the courts in an
attempt to put legitimate public-safety concerns into play.
</P>
<P>
   The real message of Barr's legislation is that the gun lobby,
for all its contrary boasting, worries that the suing cities just
may have a legal point or two.

 BY SUZANNE LEIGH  
 c.1999 Medical Tribune News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``Shirley'' was 16, she delivered her son after a long,
savagely painful labor, concluding in a caesarean section. Haunted
by memories of a labor punctuated by an arsenal of surgical
devices, Shirley's anxiety manifested itself as post-traumatic
stress disorder. Thirteen years later Shirley is working as an
office manager for a Boston computer company and married. She is
also _ to her horror and delight _ pregnant with her second child.
But this time Shirley wants to feel in control of her own labor.
</P>
<P>
   Expectant mothers like Shirley are candidates for a program at
Boston Medical Center that recognizes that women who do not feel in
control of their labor are more prone to anxiety and a high level
of pain, and are also more likely to require intervention such as
forceps and C-section.
</P>
<P>
   More radically, perhaps, the program also recognizes that a
woman's husband or partner is not always the best source of support
during labor and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The program involves pairing an expectant mother with a ``birth
sister,'' a woman who provides advice and support during labor and
in the first few months after delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Birth sisters are more commonly known as doulas, a Greek word
sometimes translated as ``servant'' or ``slave.'' It's a name the
center prefers not to use.
</P>
<P>
   The program was started last fall thanks in part to a grant from
the March of Dimes, the voluntary health agency aimed at improving
the health of babies, which is based in White Plains, N.Y. So far,
the program has recruited 57 women to become birth sisters after
completing a 50-hour training course covering the basics in labor,
delivery, relaxation techniques and breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Walker is a nurse-midwife at the center whose job
includes referring women to the program. Birth sisters, she says,
are a godsend in an era when the realities of healthcare mean that
midwives can no longer provide ongoing care to women in labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a woman in labor is very anxious, her uterus stops
contracting and the birth becomes more painful. Having someone
there to assure her she is doing well and the pain will subside has
been shown to reduce the odds of C-section and forceps delivery as
well as decrease the need for oxytocin [a drug given to make the
uterus contract more forcefully] and epidural [anesthesia to block
pain],'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Having a less stressful, less painful birth experience is not
only advantageous to the new mother, according to Walker, it also
provides lasting benefits to the infant.
</P>
<P>
   ``These mothers are more likely to bond with their babies and
have less problems breast-feeding. Breast-fed babies receive
protection against anything from diarrhea to middle-ear
infections,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is not opposed to a woman's husband or partner being in
the delivery room but believes that a birth sister can provide
unique assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about providing empathetic support. Traditionally women
have always supported women during labor and delivery. There comes
a time during the procedure when the father takes a step back, and
this is usually when the birth sister jumps in and plays a primary
role in taking care of the mother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker hopes that HMOs will recognize the financial benefits of
birth sisters and cover their costs. The Boston Medical Center's
program costs about $400 per pregnancy and covers two pre-labor
consultations and about eight hours of post-partum care.
</P>
<P>
   Studies reinforce Walker's assertion that women whose labors are
assisted by a doula, or birth sister, are likely to have better
birth experiences. This is especially the case with younger,
socially disadvantaged women, where a number of studies have
demonstrated a significant drop in the incidence of C-section,
forceps delivery and use of oxytocin, painkillers and anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   (EDITORS: THE STORY MAY END HERE, OR YOU MAY INCLUDE THE
FOLLOWING OPTIONAL MATERIAL.)
</P>
<P>
   Older, better-educated women also reap the rewards of having
doula-assisted labors, but the differences may not be so striking.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in the current issue of Obstetrics &AMP;
Gynecology, the effects of hospital-based doulas were evaluated
among 478 pregnant patients in a private hospital. The mean age of
the mothers was 29 and more than half were college graduates.
Approximately one-half of the women were assigned to a
doula-assisted program and the remainder received standard care
with their labor and deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Lead researcher Nancy P. Gordon from the Kaiser Permanente
Medical Center in Oakland, Calif., and colleagues found that 54
percent of the mothers who had had doula-assisted labors had
received an epidural. Among women who did not have a doula, the
rate was 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers asked the new mothers how they rated their
birth experience, 82 percent of those with doula-assisted labors
said it was good, compared with 67 percent with non-doula-assisted
labors. No significant differences were found between the two
groups' incidence of C-section, forceps delivery, use of oxytocin,
breast-feeding and post-partum depression.
</P>
<P>
   But less notable advantages should not mean that doulas should
be reserved for socially disadvantaged women, according to Dr. Alan
S. Cadesky, a family physician at the department of family medicine
at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Cadesky is an advocate of doulas, as well as being the husband
of one. His youngest child was born with the two older siblings
present together with a doula who supported them during their
mother's labor.
</P>
<P>
   Cadesky said he recommends doulas in all cases. ``There are no
side-effects with having doulas present,'' he said, adding that
they bring ``a positive energy'' to the delivery room, which
facilitates labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doulas are not there to supplant the role of anyone else or to
lobby for medication. They are there to support the couple and that
can only be a good thing,'' he said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: SHOULD A VALET BE A HERO?
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Mar. 14.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The senator pumped my hand and wished me luck. ``I
know you'll do the right thing,'' he said, looking me in the eye.
In this case, the ``right thing'' meant keeping mum about my life
and times as his top aide.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years I spent on Capitol Hill, before going back to
journalism, I learned more lore about the inner workings of the
Senate and the White House than I could ever hope to glean in a
lifetime of reporting. The president's national security adviser
(''everyone calls me Henry'') gladly gave me his personal phone
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly 30 years since I walked through the
``revolving door'' that divides media and politics _ the same door
that columnist Pat Buchanan recently turned as he began his third
run for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Working for a powerful pol can stir some strong emotions,
particularly if you're young and ambitious. The pink message slips
mount to impossible levels, forcing you to constantly choose whose
calls to return.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the perks. At the Kennedy Center, you sit in
the best seats _ for free. You ride in a limo to the flight line,
bypassing the ``civilians'' awaiting their boarding passes back at
the airport terminal.
</P>
<P>
   But then, sooner or later, it's time to go. And then you must
decide what to say about what you know.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti made such a choice when he left the White House in
1966 to become president of the Motion Picture Association of
America. Ever since the day John F. Kennedy was shot, and Lyndon B.
Johnson asked Valenti to leave his Houston ad agency to join the
inner circle, Valenti's code has been one of silence.
</P>
<P>
   While a staffer, Valenti was widely ridiculed for his fierce
loyalty. Once Valenti told an audience of advertising executives
that ``I sleep each night a little better, a little more
confidently, because Lyndon Johnson is my president.'' In the
Washington Post, Herblock lampooned him as a slave whose overseer
(LBJ) whipped him, ordering him to sleep better.
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos made such a choice, too, when he left the
White House in 1996 to become a commentator and a college
professor. After pocketing a huge advance, he wrote a tell-all
memoir about Bill Clinton that makes Clinton sorry he hired him. In
plugging his book, Stephanopoulos concludes that his former boss
isn't ``fit enough to be elected'' president.
</P>
<P>
   The book's ``All Too Human'' title refers to Clinton. But it
could just as easily refer to the author. Unlike Valenti,
Stephanopoulos soon had trouble sleeping as a staffer. He consulted
a psychiatrist, who prescribed Zoloft, an antidepressant that he
kept taking until after he had moved to a less pressured life in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   My own choice was to say nothing about what I'd heard and seen
while working for Republican Sen. Charles Percy of Illinois. In the
ensuing decade, until he left the Senate, Percy and I remained on
good terms. But never once did he feed me even a crumb of news.
</P>
<P>
   Having both dealt with flawed leaders, Valenti and
Stephanopoulos no doubt both buy into the adage that no man is a
hero to his valet. The real question is, how are valets to behave
when they leave service?

   Meet 15-year-old Alexis Neuhaus, online stock-trader. Every day,
Neuhaus, who lives in Washington, D.C., wakes up, boots up his
Pentium 200 computer and logs on to his preferred online broker,
Datek. But shhhh. Neuhaus's high school teachers don't know that he
checks stock prices from a computer lab between classes.
</P>
<P>
   Neuhaus is one of millions of small investors who are trading
stocks on the Internet. About 40 percent of all stock trades made
by individual investors are performed online, according to Gomez
Advisors, a firm based in Concord, Mass., that evaluates online
brokers. Two years ago, only a quarter of those trades were made
online.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big draws is that online trading is relatively cheap.
Trades online run from $5 to $30 _ less than half of what a typical
stockbroker charged before the advent of the Internet. Since then,
most have lowered their prices.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is that online traders do not have to listen
to pesky brokers advising them about what might be a good bet.
These web traders like to fly solo, for better for worse.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how it works: You get a computer, some spare cash and an
online account. Do some research on stocks _ or don't _ and your
trading days have begun. No fee for signup. Just a small commission
for each trade.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of this new method say that the anarchistic nature
of online trading is dangerous for novices. Too many investors are
thinking short-term, they say, instead of investing for the
long-haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely risks,'' said Neuhaus, who is bullish on
the software giant Oracle Corporation. ``But I'm limited right now
because of my relatively low amount of capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Gerlach, who runs a website _ www.investorama.com _ that
gives advice to online investors, said that many armchair traders
needed to slow down. ``The process doesn't change just because you
can enter orders on your computer over the Internet as opposed to
calling up a broker or walking into his office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlach, who wrote ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Online
Investing'' last year, said that some people were drawn to online
trading because of the recent media hype and advertising exposure,
and because they could remain virtually anonymous. If you fail, no
one needs to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people figure that it's a way to not talk to anybody or
be embarrassed if they make mistakes,'' Gerlach said. ``A lot of
people would never walk into a broker's office, because they would
feel too intimidated by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Edwards, a homemaker in Chester, Penn., recently began
trading stocks online, and she said that she was comfortable doing
so. ``Trading online gives us the confidence to trade without being
pressured'' by stockbrokers, said Edwards, 48, who recently started
a trading club with nine other women in Chester.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards dismisses critics who say that online trading resembles
gambling. ``We're pretty close to Atlantic City,'' said Edwards,
who maintains that she researches each stock before she makes her
move. ``If we wanted to gamble, we'd go there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gennady Ladyzhinsky, a New York Police Department officer,
disagrees. As Ladyzhinsky works his street beat on the Lower East
Side of Manhattan, he does not only talk about nabbing the bad
guys. He talks stocks _ and about trading them online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very addictive,'' said Ladyzhinsky, who began trading
online when a bank he had money in launched a public offering.
After a successful spin with the stock, he caught the bug. ``It's
like gambling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some quarters, the line between trading and gambling is
getting pretty thin. Take for example the increasingly popular
so-called fantasy, or play-money trading. Last month, E*Trade ran a
celebrity stock challenge, where online users played against Tom
Hanks and Meg Ryan from the movie ``You've Got Mail'' for pretend
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Both actors chose a fantasy portfolio of six stocks, and online
users went head-to-head with them. Over the period of one month,
Hanks _ whose portfolio included Yahoo! and America Online _ earned
more than $25,000, while Ryan earned $4,278, in fantasy money.
</P>
<P>
   While this all sounds like fun and games, Alan Alper, an analyst
with Gomez Advisors in Concord, Mass., worries that some investors
do not realize the financial risks associated with online trading.
Still, he concedes the method has made the stock market more
accessible. ``Almost anybody can be trading now,'' he said, ``and
that's probably a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers bear this out. In the last year, the number of
investors trading online jumped to 6.8 million from 4.1 million,
according to Gomez Advisors. In the coming year, that number is
expected to surge to more than 10 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But not all online brokerage services are created equal. Alper
recommends that consumers check out the differences between brokers
before signing up. In a recent evaluation, Gomez rated the popular
E*Trade service the highest overall. But when breaking down the
evaluation into categories, FarSight was judged the easiest service
to use, and DLJ Direct was rated the service most suited for
serious investors.
</P>
<P>
   Some naysayers predict outright doom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really about online speculating, not online
investing,'' said Paul Merriman, of Paul Merriman and Associates in
Seattle, who oversees mutual funds. ``And for people who wish to
speculate, online trading is nirvana.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Merriman says only the patient few will end up
profiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people will do poorly,'' he said, ``because most
decisions will be made on emotions. Any time you allow emotions to
become part of the decision-making process, you're at high risk.''
</P>
<P>
   So people like teenage trader Alexis Neuhaus might want to take
note. As Merriman put it, ``With computer trades, all of a sudden
you think you're more powerful than you really are.''

OWNER OF SINATRA SHRINE DOES IT HIS WAY

   NEW YORK _ Anthony Marinaro swears he is the illegitimate son of
Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   He has no proof, but he does have Sinatra's swagger. He has
Sinatra's swing. And he has Sinatra's stuff. Lots and lots of
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bunch of junk, you know that?'' Marinaro said as he
surveyed the crowded walls of his Brooklyn
coffee-shop-cum-Sinatra-shrine. ``I'm a completist. I've got to
have it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinaro's coffee shop, Sinatra's Coo Coo Nest Caffe, is the
kind of establishment that probably wouldn't make it anywhere but
New York, New York. It's small, with just five tables. It's dingy,
with sporadic overhead lighting. It's hidden on the second floor of
a quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. And Marinaro, 36, has made only the
slightest accommodation for customers seeking solid food to go with
their coffee. Hostess cupcakes and small bags of potato chips are
available upon request.
</P>
<P>
   The Coo Coo Nest's only real attractions are the Sinatra
memorabilia, a creaky old jukebox, and Marinaro himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one believes me when I say I'm Frank Sinatra's son. But how
else do you explain this?'' he said as he dropped a quarter in the
jukebox and belted out an on-the-spot rendition of, ``Available,''
an obscure Sinatra ballad.
</P>
<P>
   A large brown-eyed man with a slight paunch, Marinaro's
mannerisms and lyrical command of the song invoke a vision of the
slight, blue-eyed pop icon.
</P>
<P>
   Marinaro even dresses the part on some nights, with a vintage
suit and vagabond shoes that could have been plucked right out of
the Chairman's closet from his Rat Pack days.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the cafe are lined with dozens of framed photos of
Sinatra at every stage in his career. A picture of Ol' Blue Eyes in
a sailor suit with Gene Kelly. One with fellow Rat Packers in front
of the now demolished Sands Hotel. And then there's a fuzzy
photocopy of a picture of Marinaro and Sinatra singing a duet. The
Xerox job looks a little suspicious. But side-by-side, there is a
slight facial resemblance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they're cousins,'' allowed Nancy Sizemore, a
neighborhood resident who is more likely to be found in the bar
next door. In this little corner of Brooklyn, everyone feels like
they own a little bit of Frank Sinatra, Sizemore said.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra was born across the river, in Hoboken, N.J. He did not
make it over to Brooklyn much when he was growing up. But once he
had reached the top of the heap, Sinatra would order two sausage
pizzas from Grimaldi's, located just a mile up the road from the
Coo Coo Nest, whenever he was visiting the city that never sleeps.
Sinatra's presence is everywhere on that mile between the two
establishments. Many of the shops in Brooklyn's Little Italy have a
framed photo of the famous crooner on the wall behind the cash
register, and his voice occasionally floats out on the sidewalk
from open windows. Almost a year after Sinatra's death, people
still come to the neighborhood from all over to worship at
Marinaro's shrine to one of the most popular entertainers ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they hear about the place,'' Marinaro said.
``We're a long way from any other stop on your standard New York
City tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of them catch the fact that ``Coo Coo'' is a reference to a
lyric in the Sinatra standard ``The Lady Is a Tramp.'' But fewer
still can swallow Marinaro's claim to the Sinatra throne. It might
be because Marinaro can't really back up the assertion. He says
that he learned of his heritage 10 years ago when his mother
confessed to him that he was adopted as part of a top secret
cover-up. The story is contrary to his birth certificate, and
Marinaro's mother has died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable that people doubt me, of course,''
Marinaro said. ``There's so many people in the world out to lie to
you, so why should they believe me, right?''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, those who come to the Coo Coo Nest have
apparently decided that it does not matter. The Chairman went to
the great boardroom in the sky last May, and someone has to take
his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were happier back in the days when Sinatra was at his
peak,'' Marinaro said. ``Everyone thinks those days are gone.
They're not gone. They're still happening in this little room.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Frank Sinatra's not gone either. He's sitting right
here.''

NANNIES: BEYOND MARY POPPINS

   NEW YORK _ Three-year-old Miko Zalas, a chubby boy with curly
brown hair and big brown eyes looked up from his stroller and
smiled shyly at Grace Fuller, his 53-year-old Caribbean nanny.
``Come on Miko, sing along, A Deo Deo,'' she said. He hid his face
in the collar of his red snowsuit, but soon joined her in his
favorite tune, ``Banana Boat'' a Caribbean lullaby Grace sings to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Lipman, 7, goes to school on the Upper West Side but he
already favors Indian food over macaroni and cheese. ``He wants me
to make chicken curry and rice every night,'' said Jessie Desouza,
his 46-year-old Indian nanny.
</P>
<P>
   Friends tell Nigel Wingate's parents that their 8-year-old boy
speaks with
</P>
<P>
   ``an interesting accent.'' He calls his aunt ``ta ta'' which is
the Mexican word for ``aunt.'' Since he was born, Nigel has had
three nannies from three countries; one was from the West Indies,
one from Mexico and the last is Caribbean. These children, like
many in metropolitan cities, spend eight to 10 hours a day with
women from other countries and cultures. According to the records
of The International Nanny Association, an organization based in
Minneapolis that has members nationwide, the majority of nannies in
big cities like New York, Los Angeles and Miami come from other
countries. ``This is a big-city trend,'' Mary O'Conner, the
president of the association, said in a recent telephone interview.
``Around the Midwest and the Northwest they are a rare bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   In large fast-paced cities, affluent parents work long hours
outside the home, mothers return to work sooner after childbirth
and finding a satisfactory child-care arrangement within the family
is difficult. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly
one million children in the United States are being cared for by
child-care workers and child-care employment will increase faster
than the average of all occupations through the year 2006. In a
city like New York, which brims with people of all cultures,
growing up with diversity at home can be a good thing, said Henry's
mom, Janet Sabel, a lawyer who works full time and relies on Jessie
Desouza, the Indian nanny, to care for her two children. ``Being
with someone from a different country broadens my children's
perspectives on things, it opens their minds,'' Sabel added.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffery Garde, who has a doctorate in child psychology, says
that children who are exposed to cultural diversity in early stages
of life can adapt better to society and get along better with
people but there is an underlying risk. ``When, from a very early
age, a child is used to being served and praised by a person of
color and ethnicity, there is the danger that as an adult, he may
always feel superior to people of that race,'' he said. Dr. Garde
gave the example of his 5-year-old son, who has a Mexican nanny.
When the nanny asked his son to pick up his toys, his son told her
it was none of her business. ``It is clear that in his mind he
knows being a nanny she has to put up with his behavior,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Wingate, president of Best Domestic Agency, which is one
of the area's largest nanny agencies, said that up until recently
many American women never considered being a nanny as a career
option and this left the field open to an increasing number of
ethnic nannies. Among the 355 nannies placed through his agency, he
says 52 percent are from the Caribbean, 23 percent are classified
as ``Hispanic'' and the remaining are a mixture of Africans, Asians
and whites.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Fuller, Miko's nanny from the Caribbean, came to the
United States nine years ago and has worked as a nanny ever since.
She thinks a lot of American families prefer West Indian women
because child rearing is communal there. Families often have as
many as seven or eight children, with considerable age gaps, and it
is common to have the elder ones take care of the youngsters. That
gives the girls experience in caring for children. However, she
acknowledges that raising a child in America is different. ``I am
always aware of the differences and try to keep things in Miko's
own culture,'' she said. ``I don't want to influence him too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Ivy, who holds a doctorate in psychology, said because
children chose parents as role models from a young age, their view
toward race is directly influenced by the parents' interaction with
the nanny. A child will form a bond with the nanny's culture when
the parents have a close relationship with the woman. But if the
parents treat the nanny in a subservient way, Ivy said, that child
is more likely to carry that through his adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in the playgrounds of Riverside Park, the little
children lovingly follow their nannies around. Five-year-old Emma
pulled her Indian nanny's hand and says, ``Cholo'' in Hindi,
meaning, ``Let's go.'' Jessie, the nanny, beamed. Eunise Lee sat on
the bench next to Jessie and pushed the stroller back and forth.
The 3-month-old twin boys in her care had fallen asleep under the
winter sun. ``I wonder if when they grow up they will go to the
Islands and say I want to see how my nanny lived and what her
country was like,'' Lee said.

NUDE MODELING: MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By SANDRA YIN  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She stands with one hand on a hip. An elbow juts. The
other hand touches the top of her head. She is nude from the waist
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you think you can hold this for 15 minutes?'' asked Gideon
Rubin, 25, a senior at the School for Visual Arts in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said the model, Marion Berg, 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You forgot to turn on the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, the heater buzzes on.
</P>
<P>
   Like Berg, Madonna posed in the buff. As long as artists need to
recreate the human body through drawing, painting or sculpture,
they will need nude models.
</P>
<P>
   Most models claim they don't do it just for the money. At hourly
rates that hover around $10, they could earn more waiting tables.
</P>
<P>
   There are perks though. Modeling is a chance to express
yourself. It can lead to other relationships, both professional and
personal. Sometimes through art, the model gains immortality.
</P>
<P>
   Most models say they do not feel naked when posing nude. They
get over any self-consciousness fast, they say. ``You become
essentially a bowl of fruit,'' said Laura Shrewsbury, 29, another
model. ``You're just a mass of light and shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   While some models find posing nude titillating or even erotic,
others, like Shrewsbury, don't. ``If I wanted to get naked, I would
be a stripper and earn a helluva lot more money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Modeling can hurt. The body was not designed to be locked into
three-hour poses, with five minute breaks every 20 minutes. Some of
the more contorted poses are hard to hold for even a minute as
sketchers try to catch a slice of action. Those models that seem
happiest have backgrounds in dance, theater or art. They understand
their muscles and know how much their bodies can stand.
</P>
<P>
   For some figure classes, professors request specific poses. But
for others, models are more than a bowl of fruit. They often draw
on their knowledge of famous poses in art history, yoga, sports,
dance and theater to create new positions.
</P>
<P>
   Figure modeling, said Magnolia Santibanez, 29, is about giving
and emotions. The more she gives, putting her feelings into a pose,
the more comes back, she says. Modeling is a way of losing yourself
in something larger. You're not giving yourself, she said. ``You're
giving God, channeled through your body,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   In a city like New York, where getting to know other people can
be difficult, modeling can provide a real relationship. Santibanez,
an actress, said she was particularly pleased when a student
captured her thoughts through an expression or gesture. It confirms
what she projected _ someone else received and understood, she
said, adding the feedback is more precise than she could ever hope
for in theater.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, a theater director and teacher in New York City, says she
has become addicted to modeling because she likes the human
contact. Six months ago, the Paris native quit a job as an
executive assistant at a venture capital firm because she felt
``dead'' there. By contrast, making art is life-enhancing. When
someone draws her arm, she feels touched, although the touching was
pencil to paper or brush to canvas.
</P>
<P>
   There are perks. Some art schools offer free classes to models.
The students' use of color and texture in their art, as well as
what they wear, has inspired clothing designs for Shrewsbury's
4-year-old label, Underbelly, which offers sizes up to XL in what
she describes as ``Gothic, Glam, fetish, and cyberpunk.'' She has
also employed models from the School of Visual Arts for clothing
catalog shoots.
</P>
<P>
   For some, modeling is a way to live forever. ``When someone does
a painting and they don't throw it out, you're immortalized,'' said
Norma Jean Clark, 30, an actress.
</P>
<P>
   Clark considers those she meets at the art school as family. The
head of the model registry, Paolo Tanan, is like a brother. Another
model, an older woman, she considers a mother. She met her
boyfriend, an art teacher, through the school too: he hired her to
pose for his students. Clark collects paintings and drawings from
artists she knows. ``Maybe I'll retire on them if I don't make it
big as an actress,'' she says.

ACTIVISTS SAY 'NEIGH' TO CARRIAGE HORSE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 By Douglas Steinke  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some say they are charming and romantic, others say
they are dirty and mistreated, but one thing is certain: Nearly all
New Yorkers have something to say about the carriage horses that
carry tourists and lovers around midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps none are more outspoken than the animal rights activists
who are trying to send the horses galloping out of the city and to
the farms where they say the horses belong.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which has six stables, isn't the only city that has a
carriage industry, and wherever carriage horses are found, animal
rights activists are not far behind. Atlanta, Boston, Chattanooga,
Tenn., Chicago, Indianapolis, Ind., and Kansas City, Mo., also have
carriage horses, although New York's industry is one of the biggest
and oldest.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, when several horses died of heat exhaustion
and other health conditions there, activists lobbied for stronger
laws. This year, a horse was electrocuted and died in a street
accident near Central Park. Activists are saying again that the
conditions for the horses have not improved and that the animals do
not belong in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would at least like to review this insane policy of having
the horses all over the city,'' said Susan Wagner of Equine
Advocates, a program that rescues abused horses nationwide and
places them with new owners.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1989 and 1994, a city law confined the horses to Central
Park. But when that law expired, a new one allowed the horses to
roam farther and later into the night. The horses are not allowed
all over the city, but they can travel through Central Park and
along a small stretch near the city's theater district.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner said that the horses had no place to graze and that at
night many are kept in tie stalls _ stalls so small that the horses
are unable to lie down or turn around in them. Some city stables
have the roomier quarters known as box stalls, although most do
not, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tie stalls, Michael Goodale of Pride of Kansas City Carriages in
Missouri acknowledges, are ``maybe a little small.'' But Goodale,
who keeps his 10 horses in the larger stalls, said activists are
comparing the living requirements of a horse to those of a human.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not that way,'' Goodale said. ``A horse is made for
strength and for pulling plows and carriages.''
</P>
<P>
   After the electrocution in New York, activists have been
``bearing down,'' said Henry Rogers of Chateau Stables in New York.
The horse that was killed was not owned by Chateau, he said, but
that has not kept the activists at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't care whose it was,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than four different city agencies oversee the New York
carriage industry, including the consumer affairs and health
departments. Under city law, the Department of Consumer Affairs is
required to inspect the carriages at least once every four months,
and the humane law-enforcement division of the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals monitors the horses.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Holly Cheever, a veterinarian and consultant with the ASPCA from
1988 to 1994 whose duties included inspecting the stables, said the
conditions of the stables were narrow, dirty, and stiflingly hot in
the summer months. ``It was a narrow, black hole of Calcutta type
of thing,'' Cheever said, referring to conditions in the city in
India.
</P>
<P>
   The horses were watered only when they were working, she said,
and they were not often brushed or hosed down.
</P>
<P>
   While she said the condition of the horses seemed to be better
than it was during the 1980s, when there were few laws protecting
the horses, she's not confident that stable conditions have
improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have are the same stables that were used during the
days when carriages were the main form of transportation, archaic
stables that are in poor condition,'' Cheever said, referring to
19th-century stable conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Stables, on Manhattan's West Side, provides horses for
theatrical productions in addition to the horses it uses for
carriage rides. Situated near a long string of car dealerships not
far from the Lincoln Tunnel, the two-story red brick building has a
ramp that the horses use to go to their stalls on the top floor.
</P>
<P>
   Four small Dumpsters filled with horse manure sat outside the
building on a recent afternoon, and the building itself is marked
by an old sign that reads, ``Chateau Stables/Chateau Theatrical
Animals.'' The company no longer raises the chickens and other
small animals it provided for Broadway shows, according to
Chateau's Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers declined to talk about the stables or the horses. ``We're
not looking for publicity right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Stagno of the New York chapter of In Defense of Animals,
a California-based group that is leading the charge against the
carriage industry in New York, said there was a different reason
why the carriage horse operators had little to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because they don't want people to know'' about the
conditions of the horses, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stagno said she did not think the carriage horses would ever
leave New York, but in St. Petersburg, Fla., Greta Bunting of the
Carriage Horse Action Committee of St. Petersburg hopes to push the
city's only carriage horse operator out of town.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Mo., if animal rights activists were not
concerned about carriage horses there, at least one newspaper
editor was. Laura Scott, assistant editorial page editor of The
Kansas City Star, wrote in 1997 that ``much evidence points to the
reality that the horses don't belong on the Plaza.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goodale of Pride of Kansas City Carriages, a company that
has been in the carriage horse business for 20 years, disagrees.
``The ambience of the Plaza,'' he said, referring to an area of the
city that frequently hosts conventions, ``includes the horse-drawn
carriage. I don't know why these people think the horses are
abused.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cities, such as Sante Fe, N.M., Palm Beach, Fla. and Las
Vegas, have banned the carriage horse trade at the activists'
behest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing to do,'' Bunting said of the carriage
operators, ``is to try to stop them before they get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodale called the animal rights activists ``hate groups'' that
are more concerned with putting the carriage operators out of
business than with the safety of the horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the horses are your livelihood, then of course you're going
to take care of them,'' he said.

THE BOWERY AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE

   NEW YORK _ Sitting in a wheelchair parked on the corner of
Bowery and Houston Street, Ed Caldwell pointed to his old haunts.
The Blue Moon bar was across the street. Now, it's a parking lot. A
cathouse, where the former merchant marine spent a few nights, is
on the intersection's southwest corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get drunk like any other man, and when that run out you
get back to the ship or you go to jail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his left leg four years ago in a subway accident.
Caldwell, a bearded 53-year-old, is destitute and begs about $20 a
day. It is enough to rent a cubicle at the White House, a nearby
flophouse that used to cater to only white men. A black man,
Caldwell says it is integrated now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a mile from 14th Street south into the heart of
Chinatown, the Bowery was home to 7,000 people in the late 1960s,
twice as many in the 1940s. Many were homeless and penniless. The
Prohibition-era World League Against Alcoholism counted 200 bars on
the Bowery and 44 lodging houses, where rooms could be rented for
10 or 15 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowery, the country's most famous skid row, now sports a few
hot nightspots. Instead of being overwhelmed by the homeless, some
young people come here to live and play. Glimpses of the newcomers
remind long-time residents of how far the Bowery has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first moved here there were a lot of drunks,'' said
Sally Amato, who with her husband Anthony moved the tiny Amato
Opera Theatre to the Bowery nearly 50 years ago. She said the
Bowery's old denizens never gave her any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just blow on them and they fall down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amato, Caldwell, and others who live and work on the Bowery say
the street began change about five years ago. On Bleeker Street and
Bowery, a block away from Caldwell's corner, Astor Restaurant &AMP;
Lounge opened two years ago. Owner Murat Bugdaycay put in high
ceilings and plenty of brass and wood for a look he called an
``American-French bistro combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Amatos, he is also asked why he chose the Bowery. But
he believes the street is gaining a cachet of its own, one he hopes
will match the surrounding neighborhoods. In a way, the street's
notoriety even works to his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows where the Bowery is, for sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greasy spoons along the Bowery used to specialize in pig snouts
and cabbage, the cheapest food around. Now that Astor has an
outdoor caf license, diners can enjoy house house specialties like
seared tuna with escarole to diners seated on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything has changed. Street preachers like Brother John
Callahan of the flapper-era Hadley Hall mission fertile ground for
their message of salvation. That tradition continues with the
Bowery Mission, run by the non-denominational Christian Herald
Association since 1878.
</P>
<P>
   New York City recognizes the mission as a historical landmark. A
grant to renovate the building's fade is in the works. It will
cover the cost to touch up the masonry and highlight the stained
glass. A neon cross is also planned. It would extend into the
street and serve as a beacon for those who need it.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowery Mission now feeds, clothes and shelters the men who
enroll in its program of bible study and and job training. By
appearances, the mission recalls this earlier era. Facing the
Bowery is a stained glass portrayal of the wayward Prodigal Son's
returning to his father. Inside is the chapel. But it hasn't run
out of customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a crowd for every meal,'' said Rod Malloy, the
mission's director of development.
</P>
<P>
   One enrollee is Lynn Thomas, a 54-year-old North Carolina native
with a crushing handshake. Thomas' last bout with drugs and alcohol
landed him in Harlem Hospital's psychiatric ward. Speaking as he
prepared trays of frozen hamburgers for lunch, Thomas said he
learned of the Mission through word of mouth and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like God led me here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Thomas, many men who have become unhinged find their way to
the Bowery. Not all choose the Bowery Mission's bible-based
program. But Malloy said he was constantly amazed to see that men
from all over the country still gravitate to the Bowery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get guys from all over the country that come to New York
for a new start, '' he said. ``Or to escape from whatever problems
they were having.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Diana Wells decided to close her wood-paneled
travel bookstore, she wanted to turn her misfortune into a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who specialized in obscure titles like the British
``Cadogan Guide'' and Peter Hathaway Capstick's ``Sands of Silence:
On Safari in Namibia,'' was shutting down her tiny shop after
months of fruitless marketing to her 65,000 globetrotting
customers. She sent newsletters, appealed to them on her new Web
site and spotlighted her veteran staff's knowledge about travel
tips in Tuscany and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   But by December, Wells knew her 17-year-old Traveller's
Bookstore was no match for Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that since we're struggling so much now, I would only
lose more money and more of my heart by continuing on,'' Wells
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's going to be that much worse during the next
year because it's growing so fast,'' she said of the popular online
bookseller. ``It's a brand new world that's opening up for so many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells decided to make the best protest she could. In the window
of her store - nestled inside the lobby of the midtown Time Warner
building - she posted a New York City map showing 56 independent
bookstores, with a bold red X marking each of the 17 stores that
she says have closed in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Meg Ryan character in the movie ``You've Got Mail,''
Wells and other independent sellers have increasingly felt the
pinch of the behemoth bookstore chains and the unprecedented
Amazon.com online juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry that prides itself on service and expertise, many
independent stores are at a loss to compete with the convenience of
online shopping and discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Online book sales accounted for 2.4 percent of total sales in
1998, or $650 million, said Ken Cassar, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications, a New York-based Internet research firm. By 2002,
he projects, sales will be 11.3 percent of the market, or $3.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the Web's largest book seller, raked in 1 million
new customers during the holiday season and peddled $250 million in
business in the fourth quarter, according to company figures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of independent bookstores in the United
States has dropped 27 percent between 1991 and 1997, according to a
study last year by the American Booksellers Association. In the
same time, large chains have increased by 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The squeeze is not limited to New York. In October, the
family-owned Baxter's Books closed its doors in downtown
Minneapolis. In California, Gaya Books, a 12-year-old Berkeley
store specializing in New Age spirituality, and Printers Inc., a
Palo Alto store, also shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those bookstores would not be closing today if it was just the
Internet,'' said James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester
Research, who contends chain stores also are choking the
independent. ``It's just a more difficult market than it ever has
been before.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells has accepted the inevitable. ``If you can sit in your
pajamas and order at 1 o'clock in the morning from the comfort of
your own home, I think people will,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many independent holdouts are clinging to the belief that
the big chains cannot match their service. Proprietors at the
Military Bookman on Manhattan's East Side and Murder Ink, featuring
rare murder mysteries, say their own Internet sales have actually
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Seelen, an owner of the 75-year-old Drama Book Shop, said
his clientele was unflaggingly loyal. ``If they have anything to do
with the theater, they're a customer of ours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Manhattan's Corner Bookstore, owner Lenny Golay insists
online customers have a different profile, often preferring books
about Web-related topics. ``They're not books that a literary
bookstore would carry,'' Golay said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent comparison showed that of the 25 top sellers on
Amazon.com, nine did not make The New York Times best seller list.
Many best selling books online deal with technology or the stock
market: Recent hot sellers on Amazon.com have been ``How to Get
Started in Electronic Day Trading'' and ``The Motley Fool's Rule
Breakers, Rule Makers: A Foolish Guide to Picking Stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Golay is concerned, this is a sign that independent
stores will continue to have a niche in a city full of bibliophiles
like New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be home with the flu on a weekend, you're
not going to go to Amazon.com,'' Golay said. ``You're going to go
to the local bookstore.''

WHEN THERE WERE RINGS

   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By ANDREAS TZORTZIS  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a small crime. Miguel Castillo did not rob
anybody, steal money or commit murder. But the one incident of
shoplifting was enough for Miguel's father and he pulled his
13-year-old son down to the West Side Boxing Gym for some
discipline and distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo couldn't stand the gym. He was more comfortable fitting
his 310-pound frame into the sofa in front of the television, or
spending his afternoons playing video games.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 6 feet 2 inches and on the good side of 199 pounds,
Castillo, now 20, is a lithe, muscular shadow of his former self.
The video games have been given up for the speedball and punching
bag. In place of the shoplifting is the steady work West Side Gym's
owner, Arthemio Colon, gives him when he needs the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a pops, a grandfather to me,'' Castillo said. ``I
get a place to chill, and, when I was younger, stay out of
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   But trainers like Colon and gyms like the West Side are
beginning to vanish. Since 1994, New York City has lost 40 gyms,
leaving just 63 registered with USA Boxing, the national amateur
governing body. The annual Golden Gloves tournament in New York
City, open to all amateurs willing to brave the ring, had a 5
percent drop in the number of competitors this year, said John
Woluewich, the vice president of USA Boxing's local committee in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just teaching a fighter how to take a punch is not enough.
Today's boxing instructor and gym owner need to be able to write a
convincing grant proposal, present an attractive budget and hustle
for sponsorships. Most need to keep their flock from an even more
powerful lure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I think we're losing the kids to the streets, the
drug money, the flashiness,'' said Woluewich, who also trains young
fighters at Gleason's Gym on the shores of the East River in
Brooklyn. Last year, Woluewich lost one of his star fighters after
he was convicted of murder and sent to prison. ``The lure of the
streets gets them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Equally distressing is a lack of money to finance small,
neighborhood gyms. Money from the city and some agencies is not
enough to maintain the equipment needed to run a successful gym,
some gym owners say.
</P>
<P>
   Even USA Boxing can do little to help. The organization charges
each boxer $18 to register, a requirement if they want to compete
on the amateur level. In exchange, the gyms where the athletes
train receive a $1 million insurance policy to cover their
liability, but little else.
</P>
<P>
   The number of amateur boxers registered has stayed the same,
said Kevin Neuendorf, a USA Boxing spokesman, and 300 new gyms have
sprouted around the country over the past four years. But Woluewich
said high rents have caused the boom to skip New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of money has caused gyms to begin behaving like
struggling non-profit organizations. Recently, USA Boxing put out a
pamphlet for gym owners on the basics of grant proposal writing and
scripting endorsement letters to possible sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be out there on the front line pounding their
fist on the desk and asking for money, basically,'' Neuendorf said.
</P>
<P>
   In a city as awash in boxing history as New York, it's hard for
some to swallow that the gyms that spawned champions such as Sugar
Ray Robinson and Riddick Bowe and provided the training ground for
Muhammad Ali are vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   It makes veteran fighters like Woluewich, 42, pine for the days
of his youth, when disputes were settled in a ring, not the street.
Woluewich himself got into the sport after breaking a classmate's
nose 40 years ago. A local family court judge required him to
enroll in the neighborhood Police Athletic League and take his
right hook to the local ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Athletic League continues to provide boxing classes
on a $100,000 budget for New York City's youth population at six
sites in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens. But the 85-year-old
non-profit's focus has shifted over the years. Stressing exposure
to the fundamentals rather than serious competitiveness, the Police
Athletic League provides boxing instruction for children who may
not be interested in ever stepping into a ring, said to its sports
director, Jim Dolan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't discourage that, but our focus is on keeping kids off
the streets by showing them positive things to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Police Athletic League can only pay for its own
programs, and still jockeys for corporate and city grants with
other gyms. Gone are the days when the New York City Parks and
Recreation Department ran up to a total of 30 boxing programs in
all boroughs. Today, there are fewer than five sites in New York
that offer boxing instruction. ``It's too expensive,'' said Mike
Rosario, who runs a popular boxing program at the Thomas Jefferson
Recreation Center. ``They don't have the money to pay for the rent
or for equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Acevedo, the boxing instructor at St. Mary's Recreation
center in the Bronx considers himself a sort of public relations
executive. To raise enough money for the extra protective headgear
and gloves needed on a yearly basis, he goes to the Bronx borough
president, Fernando Ferrer, and other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all go through a little budget changing,'' Acevedo, a New
York City Park and Recreations Department employee, admitted. ``But
I've got good sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Acevedo and others say the reason they hustle to keep the
programs around is simple. All agree the pride, discipline and
dedication instilled in the young fighters keeps them away from
less productive distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing for many kids is a way of expression, it's self-pride,
that you can do something, you can accomplish something,'' said
Bert Sugar, a popular boxing historian and author who edits Boxing
Illustrated magazine. The boxer ``is expending energy. He goes home
and he's tired as hell. He doesn't have time to go out and steal a
hubcap.''
</P>
<P>
   In the narrow, low-ceiling labyrinth of a gym in Washington
Heights, Castillo found the discipline, release and dedication
missing from his youth. In order to make it to class at La Guardia
Community College on time, he rises at 5 a.m. to jog in Riverside
Park or at a track near Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. After school,
Castillo will head straight to Colon's gym for an intense workout
and a few rounds of sparring in the tiny ring, then straight to
bed. ``I'm too tired to do anything else,'' he said.

   Colon, 79, remembers the 40 fighters he had in the years after
he first opened the gym in 1960 on the advice of his friend Rocky
Marciano. The gym, with its sloppy, white plaster walls, tired old
iron machines and damp air became the testing ground for 18 Golden
Gloves champions over the years. Colon trained them as rigorously
as he does Castillo, and the weathered ring, now in a room closer
to the gym's entrance, was often filled with their blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps me here,'' Castillo said of Colon. ``I get to train
for free and work and you can't beat that.''

THE 'PLAY'S' THE THING AT JAZZ COMPOSERS' WORKSHOP

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jamie Begian has been fine-tuning his hauntingly
spare composition ``All Beans'' for two months. Nevertheless, the
35-year-old jazz musician is not sure if it has actually improved.
</P>
<P>
   On a morning after his jazz trio performs at a posh Upper East
Side cigar bar, Begian substituted his Gibson ES 335 guitar for a
No. 2 pencil. Seated at a short wooden desk, wearing faded jeans
and a gray crewneck sweater, he wrote meticulously on
lunchtray-sized score paper the musical notes swirling around his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that the first version was the best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But that was not the message from peers and mentors at
New York's BMI Jazz Composers Workshop, a collection of
professional musicians who rely on feedback from one another to
help guide the creative process. With the next meeting just two
days away, Begian was anxious to hear BMI's 16-piece jazz ensemble
``read'' his piece. Only then would he know for sure whether his
minimalist creation was done.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988 scores of New York City's aspiring jazz composers
have participated in the workshop. The original members were mostly
players in the renowned Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra, which
thrived at the Village Vanguard until Jones' death in 1986. The
workshop remains a unique opportunity to have one's compositions
performed by top-notch Broadway and studio musicians, an expense
few novices could afford otherwise. But it is also a venue for
up-and-coming jazz writers to test their talent, meet informally
with their genre's legends and explore musical boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fail or find out great things about yourself,'' said
Manny Albam, 76, one of three musical directors of the program.
Albam has been a composer, arranger and conductor for jazz notables
such as Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughn, Gerry Mulligan, Count Basie
and Woody Herman. He said the key was to write simply,
meaningfully, and quickly, all qualities that enabled him to create
the first jazz arrangement of Leonard Bernstein's ``West Side
Story'' in only five days.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being a haven for experimentation, the workshop
is useful for composers, Albam said, because it brings them
together and helps combat the ``aloneness'' of writing. That is not
to say the workshop is one big love fest.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hoffman, 43, who is earning a Ph.D. in music at New York
University, said fellow musicians were generally ``very
supportive'' of one another ``but that does not mean people don't
leave the workshop really bummed out sometimes.'' Indeed, neither
praise nor monetary success is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say that I have never once received a dime for
anything I've composed, except for a meager $14 in royalties,''
said Hoffman, who is flooding universities with his resume in
search of a teaching position. ``Hearing my stuff played is enough.
If it was never played, I don't think it would be worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Neumeister, a former trombone player in the Jones-Lewis jazz
band that performed regularly at the Village Vanguard, said he
became a ``serious writer'' the day he joined the workshop. Upon
the suggestion of the workshop's musical director, Neumeister began
arranging old jazz standards ``just as an exercise.'' In 1992,
however, one of these exercises _ Neumeister's arrangement of
Manning Sherwin's ``A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square'' _
earned him a Grammy award nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the benefits, as many as 1 in 3 of those who are
selected to join the workshop eventually drop out. ``Some of them
don't realize how hard they have to work,'' said Burt Korall, the
workshop's founder and director.
</P>
<P>
   Those who stick with it have limitless potential, said Jim
McNeely, composer-in-residence for the Village Vanguard Jazz
Orchestra and also a musical director for the workshop. ``Most of
them could certainly do what I've done'' for the Vanguard
orchestra, he said _ no small compliment considering their new
album, ``Lickety Split,'' was nominated for a Grammy.
</P>
<P>
   McNeely said he looked forward to hearing the ways in which
other musicians experiment with sounds. Of Begian, he says, ``He is
not afraid of taking some chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The workshop Begian had been anticipating began at 10 a.m., but
two hours passed before his piece was heard. A surreal and bluesy
composition by pianist Lisa DeSpain titled ``Dreaming in the Land
of Blue Oz'' was met with applause and nods of encouragement. She
even earned a peck on the cheek from Korall, whose jazz critiques
have appeared everywhere from Down Beat to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   DeSpain, 34, said she had worked on the composition for nearly
two years before it became absolutely necessary to have it played
in front of her contemporaries. ``You get so involved when you are
composing that your ears get numb to what you're writing,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Begian's turn arrived, he eagerly arched his body forward
to listen as three flutists, a drummer and a bass player began the
opening lines of ``All Beans.'' The orchestra performed a few bars
from different sections of the composition before Begian abruptly
cut them off by waving his arms above his head.
</P>
<P>
   He had heard enough. He thanked the band, turned off his
recording device and sat down in the last row of folding chairs set
up in the small studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's done,'' he said. ``I think it's done.

REAL MEN DO QUILT, EVEN IN NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Inside Bob Dawson's home on a tree-lined Brooklyn
street there are 27 traditional quilts in different sizes
meticulously pieced and hand-quilted.
</P>
<P>
   Each line of quilting _ the stitches that hold together the
sandwich of soft fluffy batting between two layers of cloth to make
up the quilt _ contains eight to 10 even stitches per inch, in
patterns that vary from straight lines to fancy ferns.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson has made them all.
</P>
<P>
   On a cold, clear Sunday afternoon, he settled into the big
stuffed blue chair in his living room and tightened a 16-inch
square white plastic quilting frame around a quilt of dark colored
squares within squares.
</P>
<P>
   He adjusted the black draftsman's lamp and started quilting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a quilt for when we moved into our new home,'' said
Dawson, 50, an engineer who took an early retirement package five
years ago after 24 years at NYNEX.
</P>
<P>
   He was about to get married to Evie Landry, 45, who has quilted
for the last 25 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While they were house-hunting they looked at a co-op that had an
Amish quilt hanging on a wall, he said. They didn't buy the co-op
but they liked the quilt so much they started looking for one just
like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't find what I wanted,'' Dawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, who works for an international reproductive health
organization, did not have the time to make it. So Dawson read some
quilting books and made it himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dawson quilts almost every day, recreating historical quilts
he sees in books, stores or at shows, adding his own touches, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally he uses the computer to figure out dimensions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he may have been influenced by his grandmother, who was
a quilter, Dawson said his master's degree in engineering has also
been helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easy to figure out the geometry,'' Dawson said.
``It helps in piecing and quilting. It's about being precise and
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry said: ``I let him figure out my quilts now. I let him
engineer it and cut it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Horansky, 70, a retired pattern maker, and his wife, Ruby,
69, have attended the monthly meeting of the Empire Quilters' Guild
in Manhattan for almost three years.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting, they pinned fabric together for a double
wedding ring quilt, a gift for a friend, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Horansky started quilting about five years ago after she
left her job as a mystery novelist, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife did it as a hobby and I watched,'' Horansky said. ''
'I could do that,' I said.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his retirement Horansky read a book on quilting and
made his first quilt, a crib-sized Irish chain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I got interested in log cabins,'' he said, referring to a
traditional pattern of strips sewn into squares.
</P>
<P>
   Horansky proudly displayed a photo of Clambake, his 4-by-4-foot
quilt _ a log cabin pattern in orange, green and tan _ in the book
``1999 Great American Quilts.'' It was named for the bright colors
in the center, like you would see in a fire at a clambake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Horansky and his wife machine piece, and unlike Dawson, they
machine quilt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their styles are different and they usually work independently,
Mrs. Horansky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm not sure of something I'll ask him,'' she said.
``It's really very helpful to have another quilter there.''
</P>
<P>
   Horansky sees many benefits from his quilting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's given me new friends,'' he said. ``I like to show the
quilts. It gives me a sense of purpose and giving the quilts away
gives me great pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   His latest project was inspired by a large stone he saw in a
museum on a recent trip to Mexico City, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be forty inches round of the Aztec stone of the sun,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At another table at the guild meeting, Sam Novgorodoff, 45, sat
pinning and sewing hand-dyed pieces of fabric in the shape of apple
cores.
</P>
<P>
   He has been quilting for about six years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtually unappreciated in today's society,'' Novgodoroff
said of quilting. ``It's warm and is an expression of love.''
</P>
<P>
   The first quilt he made was a panel for the NAMES Project _
which commemorates the lives of people who have died from AIDS in
3-by-6-foot quilts _ in memory of his painting teacher, he said.
Then Novgodoroff helped friends make five other panels.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in quilting continued, he said, and he has made
about 30 bed- or wall-sized quilts since then. Most of them he has
given away.
</P>
<P>
   Novgodoroff said his techniques included machine and hand
piecing and quilting, photo transfer and trapunto, in which extra
batting, or stuffing, is sewn into small areas of the quilt
resulting in a raised effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's boring if you keep doing the same thing,'' he said. ``The
new techniques allow you to try new things all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Novgodoroff and Horansky are the only two men who belong to the
approximately 300-member guild, said its president, Susan Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But both men said they felt comfortable and enjoyed meeting
people at the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The guild does a lot of charity work, Novgodoroff said,
including quilts for children at places like the Ronald McDonald
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us like to quilt and don't know what to do with our
excesses,'' he said. ``If we don't see it ever again, we know that
it's been used for a good purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Horansky and Novgodoroff may be the only two men in the Empire
guild but Judy Doenias, 58, who has been teaching hand-quilting
classes in New York City since 1990, said that on average she
usually has one man in each group of 16 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of professional people who usually have a lot
of down time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Ritchey, 47, a computer programmer and one of two men in
Doenias' Tuesday evening class, recently bought his uncle's
farmhouse in Ohio and discovered a dozen quilts and quilt tops in
the attic, some in need of repair, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchey plans to move into the farmhouse in about three years,
he said, and he decided to work on the quilts himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea there was quilting in New York City,'' he said.
``Quilting is something I associated with the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Vogler, 40, a bank auditor and the other male student in
the class, said he was inspired by some Shakers' quilt work he saw
upstate in New York's Columbia County.
</P>
<P>
   A male friend of his brother-in-law also quilts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other men, Vogler said he was very comfortable with his
new hobby.
</P>
<P>
   His boss, a woman, knows that he quilts, he said, and although
he has not told co-workers, he thinks they would accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly,'' he said, ``I think it would raise a momentary
eyebrow and that's it.''

OWNER OF SINATRA SHRINE DOES IT HIS WAY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anthony Marinaro swears he is the illegitimate son of
Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   He has no proof, but he does have Sinatra's swagger. He has
Sinatra's swing. And he has Sinatra's stuff. Lots and lots of
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bunch of junk, you know that?'' Marinaro said as he
surveyed the crowded walls of his Brooklyn
coffee-shop-cum-Sinatra-shrine. ``I'm a completist. I've got to
have it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinaro's coffee shop, Sinatra's Coo Coo Nest Caffe, is the
kind of establishment that probably wouldn't make it anywhere but
New York, New York. It's small, with just five tables. It's dingy,
with sporadic overhead lighting. It's hidden on the second floor of
a quiet Brooklyn neighborhood. And Marinaro, 36, has made only the
slightest accommodation for customers seeking solid food to go with
their coffee. Hostess cupcakes and small bags of potato chips are
available upon request.
</P>
<P>
   The Coo Coo Nest's only real attractions are the Sinatra
memorabilia, a creaky old jukebox, and Marinaro himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one believes me when I say I'm Frank Sinatra's son. But how
else do you explain this?'' he said as he dropped a quarter in the
jukebox and belted out an on-the-spot rendition of, ``Available,''
an obscure Sinatra ballad.
</P>
<P>
   A large brown-eyed man with a slight paunch, Marinaro's
mannerisms and lyrical command of the song invoke a vision of the
slight, blue-eyed pop icon.
</P>
<P>
   Marinaro even dresses the part on some nights, with a vintage
suit and vagabond shoes that could have been plucked right out of
the Chairman's closet from his Rat Pack days.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the cafe are lined with dozens of framed photos of
Sinatra at every stage in his career. A picture of Ol' Blue Eyes in
a sailor suit with Gene Kelly. One with fellow Rat Packers in front
of the now demolished Sands Hotel. And then there's a fuzzy
photocopy of a picture of Marinaro and Sinatra singing a duet. The
Xerox job looks a little suspicious. But side-by-side, there is a
slight facial resemblance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they're cousins,'' allowed Nancy Sizemore, a
neighborhood resident who is more likely to be found in the bar
next door. In this little corner of Brooklyn, everyone feels like
they own a little bit of Frank Sinatra, Sizemore said.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra was born across the river, in Hoboken, N.J. He did not
make it over to Brooklyn much when he was growing up. But once he
had reached the top of the heap, Sinatra would order two sausage
pizzas from Grimaldi's, located just a mile up the road from the
Coo Coo Nest, whenever he was visiting the city that never sleeps.
Sinatra's presence is everywhere on that mile between the two
establishments. Many of the shops in Brooklyn's Little Italy have a
framed photo of the famous crooner on the wall behind the cash
register, and his voice occasionally floats out on the sidewalk
from open windows. Almost a year after Sinatra's death, people
still come to the neighborhood from all over to worship at
Marinaro's shrine to one of the most popular entertainers ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they hear about the place,'' Marinaro said.
``We're a long way from any other stop on your standard New York
City tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of them catch the fact that ``Coo Coo'' is a reference to a
lyric in the Sinatra standard ``The Lady Is a Tramp.'' But fewer
still can swallow Marinaro's claim to the Sinatra throne. It might
be because Marinaro can't really back up the assertion. He says
that he learned of his heritage 10 years ago when his mother
confessed to him that he was adopted as part of a top secret
cover-up. The story is contrary to his birth certificate, and
Marinaro's mother has died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable that people doubt me, of course,''
Marinaro said. ``There's so many people in the world out to lie to
you, so why should they believe me, right?''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, those who come to the Coo Coo Nest have
apparently decided that it does not matter. The Chairman went to
the great boardroom in the sky last May, and someone has to take
his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were happier back in the days when Sinatra was at his
peak,'' Marinaro said. ``Everyone thinks those days are gone.
They're not gone. They're still happening in this little room.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Frank Sinatra's not gone either. He's sitting right
here.''

FAA COMPLETES FIRST STEP IN COMPUTER UPGRADE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
 PM-FAA-COMPUTERS-NYT  (gm) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration has finished
replacing a hulking, obsolete, trouble-prone mainframe computer at
its air traffic control center in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., the first step
in its nationwide modernization campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Air Route Traffic Control Center, on Long Island,
has been running the replacement computer full time since Feb. 24,
following last-minute changes insisted on by electronics
technicians for safety reasons. The FAA has suffered many setbacks
in its efforts to modernize but is pointing to Ronkonkoma as a
path-breaking success.
</P>
<P>
   The center handles mostly high-altitude, long-distance flights _
a total of 2 million in a typical year. The computer failed twice
in May 1996, delaying hundreds of flights by as much as an hour and
a quarter, among other failures.
</P>
<P>
   The device _ actually a computer and an identical backup _ fills
about 250 square feet, replacing an 1,800-square-foot IBM Model
3083 from the late 1980s. The replacement model, an IBM G-3, is not
new, but is still in wide use and, more important, is young enough
that replacement parts are widely available.
</P>
<P>
   When the younger models are installed at all 20 of the FAA's
high-altitude, long-distance centers nationwide in the next few
months, the agency expects to save $15.6 million in electricity
costs, about 95 percent of the bill, over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new machines are smarter, faster, more reliable and easier
to maintain, and that's going to have a positive impact on
safety,'' said Rodney E. Slater, the transportation secretary, in
an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garvey said in a statement that the new computers are ``a
central element of our modernization program to build the air
traffic control system for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The replacement computers are also certified as being able to
handle the rollover to the year 2000. The old one was not, and IBM
said it no longer had programmers who could read the outdated
computer code and correct it. The FAA eventually had to hire two
retired programmers to work on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was becoming desperate because the old machines,
installed from 1986 to 1988, were becoming impossible to service. A
recent report by the General Accounting Office said that a part
used to cool the old machine, called a CVLM, burned out regularly
and only about two-dozen spares remained nationally. Not only were
new cooling parts not available, but, according to the report,
nobody at the agency or IBM even remembered what CVLM stood for.

   1. MUST THE IRAQI PEOPLE BE PUNISHED FOR SADDAM'S EVIL? You have
probably heard of Scott Ritter, the UNSCOM weapons inspector and
former U.S. Marine, who resigned his post last August to protest
what he saw as the failure of the United States to act more
forcefully against Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction.
But you may not have heard of Denis Halliday, who resigned his post
as head of the United Nations' Oil for Food Program in Iraq just
two weeks later to protest the humanitarian costs of the U.N.
sanctions. ``Four thousand to 5,000 children are dying
unnecessarily every month due to the impact of sanctions,'' he
said. ``We are in the process of destroying an entire society. It
is as simple and terrifying as that. It is illegal and immoral. By
Matthew Rothschild. From The Progressive. Full-length (3,000 words)

Barbara Walters and Larry King go after big names such as Monica
Lewinsky. By Barbara Matusow. From Washingtonian magazine.
Full-length (3,500 words) + edited article available. 3. ELECTROBOY
``As far as manic-depressive tales go, my stories are typical. My
illness went undiagnosed for a decade, a period of euphoric highs
and desperate lows highlighted by $25,000 shopping trips, impetuous
trips to Tokyo, Paris and Milan, drug and alcohol binges, days
without sleep, sex with strangers and jail time. After seeing eight
psychiatrists, I finally received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder
on my 32nd birthday.'' By Andy Behrman. From The New York Times
Magazine. 1,500 words. 4. KUBRICK : THE RECLUSIVE MOVIEMAKING
GENIUS Stanley Kubrick died on Sunday at the age of 70 at his home
outside London, leaving a $100-million legacy - his latest film,
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' a psychological thriller starring Tom Cruise
and Nicole Kidman which is due to open in July, two years later
than expected. Steven Spielberg called Kubrick ``the grand master
of filmmaking. He copied no-one while we scrambled to catch up with
him.'' By Ivor Davis. 1,500 words.

 &HT;    Please don't call him `Junior'
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ So, George W. Bush had a lineup of Republican
political superstars itching to tell an assembly of reporters _
representing media outlets from all over the Unites States, Japan,
Great Britain, Mexico, Texas and at least a couple from South
Austin _ what a great guy he is and what a great president he'd
make.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal. So, George W. Bush has won re-election as governor of
Texas _ something no governor since Dolph Briscoe in the 1970s had
managed to accomplish. Another big deal.
</P>
<P>
   So, George W. Bush delivered a nice piece of political rhetoric
that hit a nice tone of inclusiveness, self-reliance and the
importance of entrepreneurship, of owning something.
</P>
<P>
   Well, another big deal. Because if you listened to George
Stephanopoulos, George W. Bush doesn't even own his name. On the
Sunday morning talk show, ``This Week,'' Stephanopoulos referred to
the Texas governor and possible presidential candidate as ``George
Bush Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   And during the Sunday afternoon news conference convened to
introduce members of a committee that will explore the viability of
a George W. Bush presidential candidacy, the governor had to field
more than one question about his father.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say having a father who was once president gives
George W. Bush a big boost. That may be right, but if Sunday's
press conference is any indication, George W. may spend more time
than he really wants answering questions about his father, George
Herbert Walker Bush.
</P>
<P>
   We've been down this road before, but let's go down this road
again. The governor is not a Junior, in any sense. His friends
refer to him as ``W'' (or as ``Dubya'' as columnist Molly Ivins has
tagged him) when they want to make clear which George they are
talking about. But ``Junior'' the governor is not.
</P>
<P>
   After the governor and potential presidential contender laid out
his definition of a ``compassionate conservative'' and talked about
the importance of an America in which no one is left behind (I told
you those rhetorical touches were nice), one of the first questions
he was asked was about his dad and what part the elder Bush's brain
trust would play in the national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's George W. Bush who is going to be the candidate. I'm
going to have my own team,'' the governor responded, adding about
his father, ``I inherited half his friends and all of his
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was also asked if his father's policies would be held
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any rival who criticizes my father makes a huge mistake. He's
not the candidate _ I am,'' the younger Bush responded. The
governor was just as quick to edit the remark to be more
conditional _ if he were to be the candidate, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Though having a famous namesake is no doubt a blessing, George
W. has had to accept the conscious and unconscious comparisons to
his dad. In his first run for governor, there were enough snide
comments made about ``Junior'' to paper the interior of the
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   And as recently as Sunday, George W. was answering questions
about what kind of advice he was getting from his dad. He said he
would listen to advice from both parents, but that he would have to
take advice from his mother because ``she's going to give it
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor handles questions about his pop with wit and class.
He makes clear that he reveres and loves his father, but makes
equally clear that he is an individual in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   Before this exploratory phase of the Bush presidential candidacy
is over _ and make no mistake, it is a candidacy _ you're probably
going to read a lot about George W. and his father's shadow. Maybe
those father-son comparisons are inevitable. We haven't had a son
follow a father into the presidency this century. The last two to
pull that off were the Adamses, John and John Quincy.
</P>
<P>
   At the minimum, however, you would think that people who get
paid a lot of money to dispense political analysis on national
television this century would at least get the Texas governor's
name right.
</P>
<P>
   Or do you think that I might be just a shade sensitive on this
particular issue?
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Garcia, who has spent 51 years on this planet as a
``Junior,''is the editorial page editor of the Austin
American-Statesman. He can be reached at agarcia(at)statesman.com.

 &HT;    Senate's freshman class of '99
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One is an insurance defense attorney from
Beaumont. The other helps run a family-owned construction company
in LaPorte, between Houston and Galveston. Both are married with
two children.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two men _ Democrat David Bernsen and Republican
Mike Jackson _ make up the smallest freshman class in the Texas
Senate for as long as anyone can remember.
</P>
<P>
   Bernsen, 48, is the only actual newcomer to the Texas
Legislature. Jackson, 45, served in the Texas House for a decade
before his promotion to the Senate in last year's election.
</P>
<P>
   But Bernsen is no stranger to politics or state office. He got
involved in his first statewide race in 1978, helping the late
former House Speaker Price Daniel Jr. in his losing try for the
Democratic nomination for attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Bernsen's political work in Southeast Texas for some top
statewide Democrats, including former Gov. Ann Richards, was one
reason she appointed him to the Texas Highway Commission in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Bernsen got to the Senate by defeating incumbent Republican
Michael Galloway of The Woodlands, with 55 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bernsen, who attended Lamar University in Beaumont on a baseball
scholarship and got his law degree from St. Mary's University in
San Antonio, said the learning curve in the Senate is not a curve
at all, but ``straight up.'' His opposition to school vouchers,
Bernsen said, stiffened when a phone bank operation started
patching through telephone calls from district residents trying to
influence him to change his stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's explained to me how you take money away from public
education and make it better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson quit college in his native Louisiana to join his
father's fledgling industrial construction and maintenance company,
Force Corp., in 1973. After his dad died in 1994, Jackson became
president.
</P>
<P>
   He won his Senate seat almost by default. He took over a solidly
Republican district when the incumbent, Jerry Patterson of
Pasadena, made an unsuccessful run for the GOP nomination for land
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's pet project is legislation to require that when a
convicted sex offender is about to be released, neighbors in the
area where the offender will be moving be notified.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who with Bernsen also represents Galveston Island, said
he will be working with Bernsen and state Rep. Patricia Gray,
D-Galveston, on attempting to rebuild and control beaches
threatened by erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing our beaches at an alarming rate,'' Jackson said.
He hopes to get help from the federal government and the state land
office.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also is exploring establishing a regional port authority
to help the four ports in his district _ Freeport, Galveston, Texas
City and the Port of Houston _ cooperate more closely.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who overlapped in the House for one term with Lt. Gov.
Rick Perry, said he misses the easier camaraderie of the House but
has found veteran senators welcoming and helpful. The fact he
represents five times as many people, has a veto on gubernatorial
appointments in his district and is one of just 31 rather than of
150, has raised his profile with lobbyists and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a whole lot more new best friends than I had in the
House,'' he said. ``David Bernsen and I get along great, and I
think that he's going to be great in the Texas Senate,'' Jackson
said.

 &HT;    This mama wishes Monica Lewinsky some nurturing, self-worth and
self-confidence
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Newspaper columns represent many points of
view. Whether written to disperse information, to dispel
information or to persuade, they all have a point of view. My point
of view has been and always will be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Mama's.
</P>
<P>
   Of my many roles: wife, daughter, sister, aunt, ``mama'' is the
one that will have the most far-reaching influence. Some may argue
that ``wife'' should be primary and they are right. But consider
that my husband's views, morals and personality were shaped long
before I met him. He never depended on me for food, shelter or
clothing. Our children depended on us both to meet those needs. And
it is he and I who will havehad the greatest role in shaping our
children's views, morals and personality. What we do and have done
to and for them will influence this world for many generations.
</P>
<P>
   Mama is not the same as ``mother.'' Mother can be strictly a
biological function. Mom is a nickname. Mama means someone who is
always there. Your No. 1 fan. Your biggest defender. The one who
loves you no matter what you do but the first one to cut the switch
when it is needed. ``Mama'' doesn't always have to be blood kin,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this mama is sad.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I watched Monica on television last week.
</P>
<P>
   What a pitiful sight. She has the shape and the polish of a
woman, but she is a girl. Though she seemed not to lack for
material things throughout her life, she definitely missed out on
some intangibles. Nurturing. Self-image. Self-confidence.
Self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   When she grows up, she could be a fine adult but anyone,
especially a mama, knows that might never happen. Most kids make
mistakes, get past them, then make more, sometimes even the same
ones. Their families love them through it all. Then they generally
turn out OK. They do all this in relative anonymity. But this girl
fell onto the front page, in front of the TV cameras and smack dab
in the middle of the United States Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Will she survive?
</P>
<P>
   I hope so, but her mama, and the rest of her family, have much
nurturing to do so that she might gain self-image, self-confidence
and self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing.
</P>
<P>
   After generations of patting men on the back who abandoned their
mates of many years for younger trophy wives and merely tsk-tsking
when others chose to have extramarital affairs, why were we so
shocked when our president entered that arena?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the guy didn't come here from Mars. He grew up right
here in our midst, in our country, in our culture.

 &HT;    Where do old models go? Back to work
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Dayle Haddon blames the coyote.
</P>
<P>
   The story goes like this: Aging former model lives in Paris,
making movies. Husband dies. Seeking a change of scenery and the
means to raise her daughter, she moves to California, where she
learns her European acting means squat.
</P>
<P>
   Too old for modeling (so they said), she takes a job as a
receptionist in a tiny ad agency, making coffee and answering
phones. While going over reports, she discovers that the coyote _
the coyote _ in one photo shoot is making more than she earns in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   That's it, she decides. Grabs Rolodex. Visits cosmetics
companies. Tries to point out the potential of the aging Baby
Boomer market. Doors slam. Keeps trying.
</P>
<P>
   Starts a modeling agency for older models, including herself.
Gets picked by Clairol as a spokesperson. Then Estee Lauder. Then
L'Oreal.
</P>
<P>
   Then she writes a book.
</P>
<P>
   Ageless Beauty: A Woman's Guide to Lifelong Beauty and
Well-Being.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told when I was 38 that my life was over,'' Haddon says.
</P>
<P>
   She's 50 now. Recently, Vogue magazine reunited the top models
of the 1970s for a photo shoot by Annie Leibovitz. Lauren Hutton
was there, Isabella Rossellini, Iman, Christie Brinkley. . . and
Haddon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we all looked more beautiful than in our heyday,''
Haddon says.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do they airbrush your photos, or do you ask them not to?
</P>
<P>
   A. I can't do much about it, but I ask them. I don't like to
airbrush too much.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you think about plastic surgery?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think that's an individual choice. I don't think there's
anything wrong with it. It's like makeup or a great dress _ if you
don't feel great about who you are . . . At this stage, you've got
to develop your inner life.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Have you had plastic surgery?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I don't know if I would do it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your morning routine?
</P>
<P>
   A. The moment I wake up, I like to stretch. Then I meditate. I
shower, drink coffee and read the paper. I like to watch the sun.
Then I have a mini-trampoline _ $49.95 _ and I turn on music and I
jump. Or I take a very early morning walk. It helps you in
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much time does all of this take?
</P>
<P>
   A. As much time as I can. I'm always late (laughs). I like to
have a half-hour that's mine. And I organize my outfit the night
before.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about makeup?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm very big into cleaning and moisturizing. And I make sure
to put sunblock on my hands, too. (She suggests Neutrogena's
Sensitive Skin SPF 17.)
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are some of the mistakes older women make, beauty-wise?
</P>
<P>
   A. Some think the older you get, the more makeup you put on. And
applying blush in stripes. We don't blush in stripes! And hair
coloring _ going too dark. That kabuki look, jet black.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you color your hair?
</P>
<P>
   A. I definitely color, yeah. My hair was almost blue-black. You
can't keep that up. (She uses Clairol for her roots between visits
to the salon.)
</P>
<P>
   Q. Any exercise advice?
</P>
<P>
   A. Exercise! I use (resistance bands) while washing dishes, I do
squats while vacuuming. I do side bends while brushing my teeth.
When I'm with friends, we take a walk instead of getting a big ol'
danish.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about people a generation older than 50, in their 70s
and 80s?
</P>
<P>
   A. Go walking. Do mini-weights. I keep weights by the TV and use
them while I watch.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What happens to all the other models who get old?
</P>
<P>
   A. They get sent to a farm far away (laughs). They kind of
disappear into the sunset. They either marry, or marry very well,
or get into other parts of the beauty business or do other things.
I call myself a dinosaur in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Q. During the Vogue photo shoot, was everyone checking each
other out, thinking, ``Look at what's happened to her!''
</P>
<P>
   A. No! I think women are more beautiful when they're older.
There's more freedom. A merging of who they are and what they look
like. How you've lived shows up after a certain age in your face.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does your face say?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's up to others to say. Behind it, I feel great.

 &HT;    Answering the crawl in Costa Rica
 &HT;    By Holly Hepp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ People are pretty jealous when I tell them I've
recently returned from a trip to Costa Rica. They immediately ask,
``Did you go to the beach?'' ``Did you stay at a resort?'' ``Did
you scuba dive?''
</P>
<P>
   I have to be honest and answer, ``No, I collected caterpillar
poop.''
</P>
<P>
   When their faces crinkle up in disgust, I add: ``And I can't
wait to go back!''
</P>
<P>
   While it may seem like a strange way to spend one's vacation, I
really did venture into the forests of Costa Rica this summer _
picking up the poop of exotic caterpillars, in the name of science,
for three weeks as part of an Earthwatch ``research'' trip. It was
one of the most exciting journeys I've ever taken.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm not an entomologist. I took my last biology course
somewhere around the ninth grade _ and all I remember is the vats
of frogs in formaldehyde. I am, however, an amateur naturalist. I
love to hike Austin's nature trails with my binoculars. I've spent
hours poring over wildlife magazines and watching nature videos on
television. I'm deeply interested in ecology and conservation.
</P>
<P>
   When I sought out the perfect vacation, I not only wanted to
venture into a forest, I wanted to make some small difference in
preserving it. I also wanted a trip that was inexpensive. And safe
for a woman traveling alone. And populated with interesting people
who that could snatch me from a jaguar's jaws if need be ...
Luckily I found Earthwatch, an international organization that puts
interested volunteers into scientific research projects.
Participants share among themselves the costs of their food,
housing and transportation. No special skills or education
required. The only problem with Earthwatch is the multitude of
project choices. In my three-week block of time, I could study the
lemurs in Madagascar, the cultural heritage of Easter Island, the
elephants in Botswana or Neanderthal bones in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hard choice, but I knew it had to be Costa Rica. I sent
in my money and forms and daydreamed all summer about walking
through the pristine forest.
</P>
<P>
   My friends and co-workers tried to dissuade me, but I laughed
them off _ how difficult could it be? I'm 34 years old and hike
Town Lake every day. With a little extra bug spray and sunscreen,
I'd be fine. To the forest!
</P>
<P>
   In the airplane, flying into the capital, San Jose(accent), I
had my first pangs of doubt. The clouds parted for a moment, and
when I looked out there was nothing but uninterrupted forest as far
as the eye could see.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God,'' I thought, ``I'm flying into the jungle!'' I knew
there was no way out then.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting up with the Earthwatch group, we set out in a
small bus for the Guanacaste Conservation Area in what was formerly
called Santa Rosa Park.
</P>
<P>
   Through the windows of the small bus, I watched the forest get
thicker and thicker. Coatis _ raccoon-like mammals with brown and
white fur _ ran across the road, holding their absurd striped tails
in the air. Rain came down in thundering torrents. We were all
relieved to finally reach the field station and move into our
dormitories. When I looked down at the other women laughing and
putting up mosquito netting, I felt like I was 9 years old and back
at sleep-away camp. There were 13 people on the team, and I
couldn't have asked for a greater bunch. They hailed from all over
the globe, and one Japanese woman said that the hardest part of the
whole trip was trying to understand English coming at her in so
many thick accents.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the project was Dr. Eric Olson, an enthusiastic
field biologist from Boston who never seemed to tire of sharing his
knowledge of the tropics. The first couple of days, we went on
orientation walks and learned the names and strange habits of the
creatures that buzzed us. Leaf cutter ants marching with their
green sails. Ant acacia trees with their ferocious red soldiers.
Black iguanas, striped iguanas and grasshoppers with green plate
faces. For me, though, the most magical were the night walks.
</P>
<P>
   No fear ... just move among the trees with your headlamp and see
what you can see. Brightly colored birds asleep in a tree. Lizards
asleep on leaves. A bat cave in constant motion. One night we
climbed a steep hill and set up a black light to attract moths. I
expected the usual small, brownish-gray flutterers, but instead
found myself standing in a swirl of infinite variety and color.
Some like little wood chips, some lacy and transparent, some green
like fungus. There was even one that resembled a bird dropping
until it spread its wings.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Olson picked up a sphinx moth with a 4-inch wingspan, and it
twittered its little abdomen nervously. Very gently, he took a twig
and gently poked it into the ``mouth'' of the moth, eventually
drawing out its amazing 6-inch tongue. When he let go, it curled
back like a tape measure and fit snugly into a little pouch beneath
its face.
</P>
<P>
   On our walks I learned that field biology is not just about
using your eyes. Dr. Olson stopped to touch, smell and handle each
insect. He put his ear to trees and once rubbed a soft caterpillar
across his lips. The quest for caterpillar poop
</P>
<P>
   By the third day, we had a good feel for the trails and started
collecting data. Dr. Olson's research consisted of examining the
detailed connections between tropical trees, the herbivorous
insects that are their major enemies and the enemies of the insects
themselves: birds, wasps and spiders.
</P>
<P>
   The Guanacaste Conservation Area is a tropical dry forest that
differs from a rain forest in that it is only wet during the rainy
season. It is similar to North American temperate hardwood forests
in that it has annual cycles of leaf flush and loss. We were there
in the middle of the wet season.
</P>
<P>
   One of our daily activities was to collect caterpillar droppings
(called ``frass'' by entomologists) from plastic sheets placed on
wire pegs throughout the forest. Frass pellets were then dried and
weighed to quantify whole forest herbivore activity.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for us to be excited about a plastic sheet
that was filled with frass. When we came back to the dormitories in
the evening, everyone had a story about the unique poop they had
found that day. Corkscrew and twisted, sculpted and spiral, each
piece was carefully picked up with tweezers while the plump
caterpillars munched overhead. ``Hey,'' we said, toasting ourselves
with plastic cups of rum, ``this is science!''
</P>
<P>
   My favorite activity though, was the beating and pooting.
</P>
<P>
   With my daily research partner, I would set out into the forest
armed with a beating stick, a meter-wide canvas sheet strung tight
on poles, and a glass vial with an attached plastic tube. Through
this tube I would suck _ or ``poot'' _ specimens into the vial.
</P>
<P>
   It's a two-person operation. One of us would whack the
vegetation with the stick and watch the rain of bugs fall onto the
sheet. Meanwhile, the other swished the plastic tube back and forth
like a vacuum cleaner and sucked them up for later identification.
Although we were only supposed to collect ants and spiders, our
whacks would bring down all sorts of strange creatures: dazzling
beetles, stick insects and huge praying mantises that would look up
with a curiously intelligent expression. The hunter and the hunted
</P>
<P>
   This was our research: what was eating what and who was eating
whom. Unfortunately, everything was eating us. Throughout our trip,
I felt like I was walking around with a sign that read ``free
lunch!'' No amount of bug repellent or protective clothing could
stop the feast.
</P>
<P>
   It began with the chiggers, poking their way through boots and
two pairs of socks; they left rings of fire around our ankles. When
there seemed to be no uninflamed skin left, they made their way
upward to the warmer, moister parts of our bodies. Chigger itch was
maddening, but it was reassuring to know that the mitedropped off
after its bite.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with ticks. They latched on to the most private, hidden
folds of the body, and the shrieks coming from the morning showers
let us all know a new one had been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   There were mystery critters, too. A 5-inch centipede that fell
down a shirt and left a white spiral sore. Scorpions that waited at
the bottom of backpacks and stung unwary fingers. Even the
mosquitoes seemed fiercer in the forest, buzzing and biting right
through the bug spray. We scratched and compared our bites in the
evening, but no matter how bad it was, no one wanted to leave. We
all knew this was a once-in-a-lifetime trip in a once-in-a-lifetime
forest.
</P>
<P>
   The insects, biting or not, were just one part of the incredible
diversity of life that we encountered in Guanacaste. In the
morning, as we first entered the forest to start our collections,
everything fled before us. But as we settled down, the animals
slowly returned. Birds of every size and color, skinks (a type of
lizard), agoutis (rabbit-sized nocturnal rodents), deer and, of
course, the innumerable monkeys. I don't know how many hours I sat
on the forest floor and watched the antics of the white-faced
capuchins or listened to the unearthly bellows of the howler
monkeys. I also discovered something else in the forest. Working on
the research or walking down the paths, I felt incredibly,
intensely awake. All of my senses were extremely acute and my mind
felt clear and alert. There seemed to be a sharpness and clarity to
everything I saw and heard. Other members of the team noticed it,
too. It was an incredible, energizing sensation that seemed to grow
as the trip went on.
</P>
<P>
   As well as feeling personally fulfilled, it was gratifying to
know that our basic research was going to further the understanding
of the dry forest and help with its conservation. For example, the
discovery that dry forest organisms may be relying on nearby
montane and rainforest areas as seasonal refuges was part of what
motivated the Costa Rican government and international donors to
pay for the Guanacaste Conservation Area.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Costa Rica has one of the world's best conservation
records; approximately one quarter of the country is under some
form of official protection. Much of this land is in the form of
national parks that, as well as being attractive to tourists,
sponsor research expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   Would I be a part of one of these research expeditions again?
You betcha. I just can't decide whether to study the dancing birds
in the Monteverde cloud forest, the sea turtles on Playa Grande or
the moths in La Selva rainforest. I only hope that it'll be half as
wonderful as the trip I spent in Costa Rica, picking up poop.

   COXNET-TRAVEL 0312: I'm going to tell you my picks for the most
romantic cities in Europe. But before I do that, allow me to give

First, stay in one place in Europe. Don't go driving all over the
continent in an effort to see everything. You'll just get tired and
cranky. Stay in one city, and it will become ``your'' city, the one
that will be foremost in your photo album. (Blackerby, Palm Beach

   ROMANTIC-EUROPE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I'm going to tell you
my picks for the two most romantic cities in Europe. But before I
do that, allow me to give those of you contemplating a honeymoon a
few pieces of advice: First, stay put! Don't go driving all over
the continent in an effort to see everything. You'll just get tired
and cranky. Second: Go in spring or fall, even winter, but not
summer. Europe is too crowded, hot and expensive in summer, and
this tends to make people tired and cranky. And, I thought of a
third point: Don't worry about spending money. Budget enough for
the trip so that you're not fretting about every franc you're
spending on taxis and food. The wedding trip is not the time to
worry about money _ there's plenty of time for that later in the
marriage. And my No. 1 personal favorite city for romance?

   CHAMBERMUSIC _ Overview for a really interesting week in music
in Atlanta, which bounces between classical crossover, rock/pop and
improvisation. Shows are: Thamyris NextFest (at) Emory w/''The Mad
King'' (opera thing, I'll get more info) on 3/15; and NY's Bang On
a Can All-Stars doing Brian Eno's ``Music for Airports'' 3/20;
British guitar genius Derek Bailey, who's influenced everybody,
making a very rare US appearance 3/18 or 3/19 at the Existential
Church in Candler Park; and the Hilliard Ensemble (vocal chamber
outfit; pretty major in classical world). The idea is that it's one
of those unusual weeks in Atlanta when all this cool stuff
collides, and that it all says interesting things about music at
the end of the century, and that, though it's all ostensibly
high-brow a lot of it is wildly unconventional. (Dollar, Atlanta

   COXNET _ BOOKS 0312: In ``Visions of Technology,'' Richard
Rhodes has compiled an anthology of more than 200 selections
tracing the development of technology through the 20th century. It
begins with the birth of radio, movies and airplanes, moves through
the era of television and satellites, and finally to the
development of the Internet and artificial intelligence as the
century closes. (Bookman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)

   REVIEW -- There is a point in some books when satire gives way
to outright meanness. Which means readers will recognize that ``Me:
By Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente,'' Garrison Keillor's supposed ``just
having a little fun'' mock-book about Jesse Ventura, the
pro-wrestler-turned-governor of Keillor's beloved home state of
Minnesota, is, frankly, nasty. (Guinn, N.Y. Times News Service)

   REVIEW -- You read a novel like ``Dreamland'' because you want
to get lost in the past. And where better to get lost than New York
City in 1910, with its millionaires and SKUBE ON BOOKS -- Who isn't
impressed by a two-ton sentence? You wouldn't want to diagram it,
and you certainly couldn't sing it. Either would ruin it. You only
behold its profundity, whatever its meaning. (Skube, Atlanta

   COXNET-TRAVEL 0312: I'm going to tell you my picks for the most

First, stay in one place in Europe. Don't go driving all over the
continent in an effort to see everything. You'll just get tired and
cranky. Stay in one city, and it will become ``your'' city, the one
that will be foremost in your photo album. (Blackerby, Palm Beach

   ROMANTIC-EUROPE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I'm going to tell you
my picks for the two most romantic cities in Europe. But before I
do that, allow me to give those of you contemplating a honeymoon a
few pieces of advice: First, stay put! Don't go driving all over
the continent in an effort to see everything. You'll just get tired
and cranky. Second: Go in spring or fall, even winter, but not
summer. Europe is too crowded, hot and expensive in summer, and
this tends to make people tired and cranky. And, I thought of a
third point: Don't worry about spending money. Budget enough for
the trip so that you're not fretting about every franc you're
spending on taxis and food. The wedding trip is not the time to
worry about money _ there's plenty of time for that later in the
marriage. And my No. 1 personal favorite city for romance?

squat. Too old for modeling (so they said), she takes a job as a
receptionist in a tiny ad agency. She discovers that a coyote in
one photo shoot is making more than she earns in a month. That's
it, she decides. Grabs Rolodex. Visits cosmetics companies. Tries
to point out the potential of the aging Baby Boomer market. Doors
slam. Keeps trying. Starts a modeling agency for older models,

   CHAMBERMUSIC _ Overview for a really interesting week in music
in Atlanta, which bounces between classical crossover, rock/pop and
improvisation. Shows are: Thamyris NextFest (at) Emory w/''The Mad
King'' (opera thing, I'll get more info) on 3/15; and NY's Bang On
a Can All-Stars doing Brian Eno's ``Music for Airports'' 3/20;
British guitar genius Derek Bailey, who's influenced everybody,
making a very rare US appearance 3/18 or 3/19 at the Existential
Church in Candler Park; and the Hilliard Ensemble (vocal chamber
outfit; pretty major in classical world). The idea is that it's one
of those unusual weeks in Atlanta when all this cool stuff
collides, and that it all says interesting things about music at
the end of the century, and that, though it's all ostensibly
high-brow a lot of it is wildly unconventional. (Dollar, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   COXNET _ BOOKS 0312: In ``Visions of Technology,'' Richard
Rhodes has compiled an anthology of more than 200 selections
tracing the development of technology through the 20th century. It
begins with the birth of radio, movies and airplanes, moves through
the era of television and satellites, and finally to the
development of the Internet and artificial intelligence as the
century closes. (Bookman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)

   REVIEW -- There is a point in some books when satire gives way
to outright meanness. Which means readers will recognize that ``Me:
By Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente,'' Garrison Keillor's supposed ``just
having a little fun'' mock-book about Jesse Ventura, the
pro-wrestler-turned-governor of Keillor's beloved home state of
Minnesota, is, frankly, nasty. (Guinn, N.Y. Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   REVIEW -- You read a novel like ``Dreamland'' because you want
to get lost in the past. And where better to get lost than New York
City in 1910, with its millionaires and SKUBE ON BOOKS -- Who isn't
impressed by a two-ton sentence? You wouldn't want to diagram it,
and you certainly couldn't sing it. Either would ruin it. You only
behold its profundity, whatever its meaning. (Skube, Atlanta

novel, ``Replacing Dad,'' which will be aired as a CBS movie Sunday

KRAFT HAS NEW SUITOR FOR PATRIOTS IN HOUSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Patriots have picked up a new suitor, which gives
owner Bob Kraft a new card to play if he so desires.
</P>
<P>
   However, someone close to Kraft said Wednesday Kraft's ``focus
is on Connecticut,'' and the Krafts had not spoken with Bob McNair
of Houston, who sent letters to nine NFL owners last week saying he
was interested in buying a team.
</P>
<P>
   McNair is trying to bring an NFL team to Houston. He hopes
Houston is awarded an expansion team at the annual league meetings
next week, but Los Angeles is favored to get the nod.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Houston have offered $300 million in public money
to construct a stadium for an NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   But McNair doesn't have a team. So last week he contacted nine
teams, including New England, that are having stadium problems,
saying he would be willing to pay top dollar for a team.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has a tremendous deal on the table in Connecticut, but
officials there now know that if anything happens to delay building
a stadium in Hartford, Kraft has more options that just returning
to Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Since buying the Patriots, Kraft has said repeatedly that he
would not move the team out of New England unless he feels he is in
a position where he could not compete financially.
</P>
<P>
   Houston gives him that option.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Namias, a spokesman for McNair, said a story in Wednesday's
Boston Herald indicating McNair was interested in buying and moving
the Patriots to Houston if a Hartford deal fell through was
``overblown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McNair hasn't targeted the Patriots over any other team,''
said Namias. ``The reason he's talked to Bob Kraft a few times is
because Mr. Kraft is the co-chairman of the finance committee and
he would have reason to discuss his issues with Mr. Kraft. What Mr.
McNair did was send letters to teams in nine cities currently
trying to work out new deals and indicated to them that if
something shouldn't work out that he would love to have a
conversation with those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots spokesman Stacey James issued a statement saying in
part, ``Mr. Kraft has informed Mr. McNair that the Patriots are
fully focused on bringing the Hartford stadium to fruition.''

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Drivers caught in a snarl of freeway traffic leading into Dallas
looked up last week at that tall skyline and saw a huge new black
billboard with a few stark words in white:
 &HT;    ``Keep Using My Name In Vain, I'll Make Rush Hour Longer. GOD''
 &HT;    Those driving in from different directions saw other billboards
with equally arresting messages from the Creator:
 &HT;    ``Don't Make Me Come Down There. GOD''
 &HT;    ``What Part of `Thou Shalt Not...' Didn't You Understand? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Will the Road You Are on Get You to My Place? GOD''
 &HT;    The God Ad Campaign is being donated by local billboard
companies as a public service. There will soon be 10,000 billboards
like these all across America as billboard firms donate the space.
 &HT;    ''It is a gift to the community,'' says Nancy Fletcher,
president of the Outdoor Advertising Association of America. ''It
is a positive way to get people thinking about spirituality, and
increasing the numbers who are going to church. It makes you
believe in divine intervention!''
 &HT;    The campaign began in Broward County, Florida, in and around
Fort Lauderdale last fall. It was football season, of course. So
two of the first billboards to go up tartly said:
 &HT;    ``Let's Meet at My House Sunday Before the Game. GOD''
 &HT;    ``C'mon Over and Bring the Kids. GOD''
 &HT;    The ads were developed by The Smith Agency after an anonymous
client came in one day and told owner Andy Smith, ''I have one
goal. I need to have people start thinking about God. Things are
getting out of control. People are not obeying the rules any more.
Every day you read about murder, robbery, adultery everything that
God said, `Don't do.'
 &HT;    ''If we can get to one person before he robs a bank, to think
about God first, maybe we can stop him. If so, it will be worth
it.''
 &HT;    I tried to find out who the anonymous benefactor was even to
learn whether he was a pastor or businessman, but could learn
nothing. Oprah Winfrey offered to put the guy on her show, but he
declined: ''If people focus on me or the money I spent, they will
forget the message of the ads. Forget about me. I am looking for
nothing. The message is much more important than who I am.''
 &HT;    So let's go back to the message. This summer you may be driving
along some hot day and look up to see these billboard that ought to
get your attention:
 &HT;    ``You Think It's Hot Here? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Need a Marriage Counselor? I'm Available. GOD''
 &HT;    Some of the messages were written by the anonymous donor. They
are more gentle:
 &HT;    ``I Love You...I Love You...I Love You. GOD''
 &HT;    ``Tell the Kids That I Love Them. GOD''
 &HT;    But most were written by Charlie Robb, who describes himself as
''being in the target audience of people who used to go to church,
but who don't any more.''
 &HT;    ``I'm a former altar boy,'' he told me. To reach such people,
Scripture would not work, he says. ''We had to make the message
contemporary, slightly irreverent, reminding people that they are
dealing with the ultimate CEO.''
 &HT;    ``Need Directions? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Do You Have Any Idea Where You're Going? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Follow Me. GOD''
 &HT;    ``Have You Read My Number 1 Bestseller? There Will Be a Test. --
GOD''
 &HT;    How has the God Ad Campaign worked? The Miami Herald surveyed
churches in he area and reported that attendance rates were up.
Even Charlie has been to church a few times. A woman in Fort
Lauderdale sent an E-mail to the Smith Agency, thanking it for the
ads which are ''such a breath of fresh air.'' She said her niece
was married to a man who would never go to church with her. While
driving along, they both saw this ad:
 &HT;    ``I Loved the Wedding. Invite Me To The Marriage. GOD''
 &HT;    The man went to church with his wife for the first time the next
Sunday, and has been going ever since.
 &HT;    ``We Need To Talk. GOD''

THE TOOTH ABOUT IPANA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Sometime in the '40s when I was in the service, Ipana
toothpaste was taken out of stores. I have not seen it on the
market again. What happened to it?
</P>
<P>
   _ W.A.P., Grandview, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Ipana toothpaste has disappeared from the United States but
is being sold in Turkey, according to a Jan. 14 Christian Science
Monitor article.
</P>
<P>
   Ipana was the most popular U.S. toothpaste or powder from 1936
to 1945, but was abandoned by manufacturer Bristol-Meyers in 1968.
The brand was sold to new owners and revived twice, with limited
success.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble and a Turkish company restarted the brand in
1991 in a joint venture. ``Ipana is now a leading toothpaste in
Turkey,'' the Monitor reported.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to F. Lee Bailey?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.P., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to the defense attorney at 1400 Centerpark Blvd., Suite
909, West Palm Beach, FL 33401.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, whose past clients include O.J. Simpson and Patricia
Hearst, made the news recently when he was subpoenaed by Cleveland
prosecutors to produce any records he has pertaining to the late
Dr. Sam Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard was charged with the 1954 murder of his wife in a case
that inspired the ``Fugitive'' TV series and films. Bailey handled
the appeal that resulted in Sheppard's 1966 release.
</P>
<P>
   He has served as chairman of penal reform for the Association of
Trial Lawyers and co-chairman of the Foundation for the Advancement
of Inmate Rehabilitation and Recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a longtime fan of Tom K. Ryan, the creator of the
Tumbleweeds comic strip. Can you tell me where to write to him?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.M., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: You can contact Ryan at Box 446, Deerfield, FL 33443, or
through his Tumbleweeds World Wide Web site at www.tumbleweeds.com.
</P>
<P>
   Tumbleweeds, which appears in about 200 newspapers, was created
by Ryan in 1965. The 72-year-old cartoonist continues to produce it
from his Florida home.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan also sells autographed copies of his latest book,
``Presenting the Best of Tumbleweeds,'' for $15.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: SHOULD A VALET BE A HERO?
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (k) commentary for release Sunday,
March 14.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The senator pumped my hand and wished me luck. ``I
know you'll do the right thing,'' he said, looking me in the eye.
In this case, the ``right thing'' meant keeping mum about my life
and times as his top aide.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years I spent on Capitol Hill, before going back to
journalism, I learned more lore about the inner workings of the
Senate and the White House than I could ever hope to glean in a
lifetime of reporting. The president's national security adviser
(''everyone calls me Henry'') gladly gave me his personal phone
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly 30 years since I walked through the
``revolving door'' that divides media and politics _ the same door
that columnist Pat Buchanan recently turned as he began his third
run for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Working for a powerful pol can stir some strong emotions,
particularly if you're young and ambitious. The pink message slips
mount to impossible levels, forcing you to constantly choose whose
calls to return.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the perks. At the Kennedy Center, you sit in
the best seats _ for free. You ride in a limo to the flight line,
bypassing the ``civilians'' awaiting their boarding passes back at
the airport terminal.
</P>
<P>
   But then, sooner or later, it's time to go. And then you must
decide what to say about what you know.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti made such a choice when he left the White House in
1966 to become president of the Motion Picture Association of
America. Ever since the day John F. Kennedy was shot, and Lyndon B.
Johnson asked Valenti to leave his Houston ad agency to join the
inner circle, Valenti's code has been one of silence.
</P>
<P>
   While a staffer, Valenti was widely ridiculed for his fierce
loyalty. Once Valenti told an audience of advertising executives
that ``I sleep each night a little better, a little more
confidently, because Lyndon Johnson is my president.'' In the
Washington Post, Herblock lampooned him as a slave whose overseer
(LBJ) whipped him, ordering him to sleep better.
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos made such a choice, too, when he left the
White House in 1996 to become a commentator and a college
professor. After pocketing a huge advance, he wrote a tell-all
memoir about Bill Clinton that makes Clinton sorry he hired him. In
plugging his book, Stephanopoulos concludes that his former boss
isn't ``fit enough to be elected'' president.
</P>
<P>
   The book's ``All Too Human'' title refers to Clinton. But it
could just as easily refer to the author. Unlike Valenti,
Stephanopoulos soon had trouble sleeping as a staffer. He consulted
a psychiatrist, who prescribed Zoloft, an antidepressant that he
kept taking until after he had moved to a less pressured life in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   My own choice was to say nothing about what I'd heard and seen
while working for Republican Sen. Charles Percy of Illinois. In the
ensuing decade, until he left the Senate, Percy and I remained on
good terms. But never once did he feed me even a crumb of news.
</P>
<P>
   Having both dealt with flawed leaders, Valenti and
Stephanopoulos no doubt both buy into the adage that no man is a
hero to his valet. The real question is, how are valets to behave
when they leave service?

CONNERLY PUTS BUSH ON THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having received a chilly reception from Florida Gov. Jeb Bush a
few weeks ago, Ward Connerly has brought his anti-affirmative
action medicine show to George W. Bush's range.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, the African-American member of the University of
California board of regents who spearheaded the successful
referendum that terminated affirmative action in that state, came
to Austin to show support for proposed legislation that would
outlaw it in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He stood shoulder to shoulder with state Rep. Robert Talton,
R-Pasadena, who filed the bill, which is modeled after California'
Proposition 209 and Washington state's Initiative 200. Talton's
bill would prohibit state agencies from using affirmative action to
overcome the effects of past or continuing discrimination based on
race, color, gender, ethnicity or national origin.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is not the way Talton put it. He spoke of
prohibiting preferential treatment, the way affirmative action foes
always do to distort the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the economic pie becomes available to all people ... not
just one small sliver arbitrarily set aside by those in the
feel-good business,'' Talton said.
</P>
<P>
   And Connerly said, Amen.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be judged on the basis of their talents and
capabilities and not on their skin color, religion, national origin
or gender,'' Talton said.
</P>
<P>
   And Connerly said, Amen.
</P>
<P>
   Actually Connerly didn't say the word ``Amen.'' But that was the
gist of his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   What he actually said was:
</P>
<P>
   ``If this nation is ever going to live out its creed of equal
protection under the law, equal treatment for all people, it all
begins with the government treating everybody as equals.''
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that preferential treatment isn't the answer to
disparity of opportunity, Connerly declared: ``There is nothing
affirmative about treating people differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Give that man a Kewpie doll. He is absolutely right about that.
Treating people differently in the workplace and in public
institutions because they are female, because they belong to a
racial or ethnic minority or because of their religions is utterly
negative.
</P>
<P>
   Make that ``reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   If that kind of negativism no longer happened to an appreciable
degree, there would be no need for affirmative action to give
minorities and women a fighting chance at a small portion of the
pie to which Talton so idiotically referred.
</P>
<P>
   Surely Talton does not really believe that because of
affirmative action, Hispanics, African-Americans and women are
gobbling up most of the Texas economic pie and leaving just a small
sliver for Anglo males.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, that's what he implied. But only an idiot wouldn't know
better. And there are no idiots in the Texas Legislature. Are
there?
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, of course, knows better, or should. He's been black a
long time. If he can't see that this society is a long way from
being colorblind, he must be really blind.
</P>
<P>
   Having brought his crusade to save the white majority from
affirmative action to Texas, Connerly has created a dilemma for the
Texas governor, the Bush who would be president. He may force
George W. to show his true colors on affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   That's something that the Texas governor has shown some
reluctance to do because he's courting Hispanic voters. And some of
them think he's for affirmative action and that he might oppose the
bill that Talton is carrying for Connerly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, has insisted that he's for something called
``affirmative access,'' another of those phrases like
``compassionate conservatism'' that Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander
refer to as ``weasel words.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the unavoidable fact of the matter is that Bush is
going to need the support of the hard conservative right in the
Republican Party to win the nomination, and ``affirmative access''
just might not be strong enough for them.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, George W. Bush's best course may be to give
the California crusader the Jeb Bush treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue won't go away. House Education Chairwoman Irma
Rangel, D-Kingsville, has filed a bill that would have the effect
of reinstating the affirmative action policies of public colleges
and universities that were voided by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals' controversial Hopwood ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush who would be president may wind up having to sign or
veto one or the other. And the whole nation will be watching.

TERMINATED WORKERS ADVISED TO TAKE CHARGE, NEGOTIATE BETTER
SETTLEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you just got your pink slip or see it coming, don't despair _
get a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least get your hands on a copy of ``Getting Fired: What to
do if you're fired, downsized, laid off, restructured, discharged,
terminated, or forced to resign'' (Warner Books, 370 pages, $24).
</P>
<P>
   The book was written by Steven Mitchell Sack, a labor and
employment lawyer who has represented more than 12,000 fired
workers in his near 20 years of experience. He has also written
eight other popular books, including ``The Employee Rights
Handbook.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million workers are fired annually, Sack writes.
Hence the need for a book focused squarely on the rights of those
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to get past the emotion of being on the hit
list, and recognize that you often have a negotiating standpoint,
Sack says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are so disillusioned and shell-shocked after
receiving the news that they merely bow their heads and shuffle
their feet out the door,'' Sack writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, by questioning the firing and demanding more
benefits, or be anticipating a layoff and acting properly, you can
gain enhanced financial benefits and the confidence to look for and
find a new job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sack says that no matter what type of industry, no matter how
much you make and no matter what level of job you hold, you can
often reach a more amicable settlement than just clearing out your
desk and walking away from your employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, I have become convinced that the vast majority
of private employers fear the repercussions of most firings and are
willing to explore amicable solutions to avoid additional legal
expenses, bad publicity, and potential damages that sometimes
arise,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, employees lose millions of dollars each year
by taking too long or not trying at all to take action against
their firing, Sack writes.
</P>
<P>
   The book provides numerous strategies to follow based on court
rulings, regulations and labor law. Chapters including firing based
on gender, age, race, religion or handicap; and chapters on firing
to deprive workers of benefits or because of some action by the
employee, such as being a whistle-blower or having an office
romance.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the book discusses how to negotiate the best
severance package after you have been fired. The third section
talks about how to fight back using litigation or a related
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The book is peppered with interesting vignettes to illustrate
Sack's points. Also, Sack turns a great deal of legal material into
plain English that is easy to understand.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting trends to which Sack refers is
corporate America's firing of older workers instead of younger ones
to cut costs without cutting as many jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because younger workers were typically at the low end of the
wage scale, companies learned they would have to make substantial
cuts to achieve meaningful savings,'' he writes. ``They realized it
was more effective to offer early retirement and severance packages
to older workers at the top of the wage scale as the way to reduce
costs and stay competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two decades, employees have gained many more rights
through changes in law, Sack writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until twenty years ago, employees had few options when they
received a pink slip ... because of a legal principle called the
employment-at-will doctrine,'' Sack writes.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal laws have since been passed to protect
occupational health and safety, civil rights, freedom to complain
about unsafe working conditions and other related areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The net effect has been a gradual erosion of the
employment-at-will doctrine in many areas,'' Sack writes.
</P>
<P>
   Some states let fired workers sue in tort, as opposed to claims
based on a contract, and recover punitive damages for pain and
suffering brought on by the firing.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, there's more to firing than just the pink slip. And
Sack's book may provide you with enough information to leave that
company with more dignity, and more money.

   At least one software maker estimates that 5 percent of all U.S.
businesses will fail because of not fixing their Y2K problem in
time. A computer consultant estimates that 95 percent of all PCs
will fail a simple Year 2000 test. Author K.C. Bourne, a software

</P>
<P>
   By Poonam Sharma
</P>
<P>
   John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $14.95
</P>
<P>
   This book focuses specifically on entrepreneurs or wannabes in
college now or those who have recently graduated. It provides an
overall business primer and shows how to combine your college
education with a business plan. As the authors are quick to point
out, Bill Gates left college to start his own company. At the very
least, the ambitious should be able to start their company while in
school or just out of it. The several authors of this book, all at
Harvard, write chapters on finance, legal protection, marketing,
ethics and other related topics.

   ``Eating the Big Fish: How Challenger Brands Can Compete Against
Brand Leaders''
</P>
<P>
   By Adam Morgan
</P>
<P>
   John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $29.95
</P>
<P>
   Many books are devoted to the No. 1 brand in any given category
of goods or services as a way to teach how to boost your own
brands. This book takes a slightly lower look, focusing on the No.
2 slot, the so-called challenger brand. After all, says Adam
Morgan, a planning director at one of the world's largest
advertising agencies, No. 1 is more the exception to the rule, and
all the brands under it are more the norm. This is a detailed and
interesting book on the amazing world of brand marketing.

`CORRUPTOR' A LITTLE TOO FAMILIAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even the name of the new action thriller, ``The Corruptor,''
sounds anemic. This story of cops who initially can't stand each
other when forced together and who learn to trust each other brings
together Chow Yun-Fat, the elegant Hong Kong movie icon, and Mark
Wahlberg, who did a credible job in last year's ``The Big Hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahlberg moves well, though his speaking voice makes him sound
like he's at least one latte short of being awake. He's the new kid
on the block, a novice detective who has been thrown into an
all-Asian task force. They couldn't be less happy with this white
addition. (Chow makes another obvious color joke _ he calls
Wahlberg ``green,'' because of the kid's inexperience. Of course,
after his career as an off-white hip-hop performer, Wahlberg should
be used to having his chops busted for being the token Caucasian.)
</P>
<P>
   They swing through the impenetrable crime world of Chinatown,
where Tong bosses have become skilled in playing both sides against
the middle. Chow has starred in roughly 70 films, and in what seems
like about 50 of them, he's played this exact same role: a
tough-as-nails rogue cop trying to winnow away mob influence on the
police force. In ``Corruptor,'' he is one of the cops who does
business with the mob.
</P>
<P>
   Revving up his trademark snarl and throwing his arms out with a
flourish, Chow steps from one side of the street to another, both
sides of which are in the dark. And when Wahlberg is targeted by
the mob bosses who want another cop in their pockets, Chow no
longer seems so alone.
</P>
<P>
   Except Wahlberg turns out to be an Internal Affairs operative
who's been sent to investigate Chow. This is supposed to add
another layer of complication to the story, which it does on the
most superficial level. Director James Foley gives some competence
to the routine proceedings, which are so shopworn that you'd swear
that Kim Chan, the actor who plays Tong kingpin Uncle Benny, has
not only played such a character before; he's actually played one
called Uncle Benny before. One car chase sequence that takes place
in downtown Manhattan is the best thing in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   But this kind of
guns-flying-and-glass-splintering-in-slow-motion is not Foley's
metier _ his previous work includes directing Wahlberg in the
potboiler ``Fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley also handled David Mamet's fragrant stew of a movie,
``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' where the real violence came from the
language. This kind of urban assault vehicle requires a devotion to
a craft he's indifferent to. Fans of the genre will dismiss it.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Mark Wahlberg will get the requisite thrill from his
dramatic display of pecs and tush. And fans of Chow Yun-Fat will
wonder if he'll ever get to star in an American picture that takes
advantage of his unique gifts in the action genre. Sure, you grade
those Hong Kong pictures in which he stars on a curve, because
they're outlandishly plotted. But they're full of snap and
wildness. In this area, that's a plus.

IF BUSH IS RUNNING, HE'S NOT TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, R-Texas, announced Sunday that he is
forming a committee to explore whether he should run for president.
After a parade of adulatory speeches from committee members, he
fielded questions.
</P>
<P>
   One reporter asked whether abortion should be illegal in the
first trimester. ``That's a hypothetical question,'' said Bush.
What about global economic instability? ``I won't have specific
remedies or specific suggestions until I start moving around the
country,'' Bush replied. Should we build a missile defense system
even if it violates the antiballistic missile treaty? ``I will be
glad to answer all those questions once I get out in the course of
the campaign,'' Bush offered, ending the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   What a charade. Bush's ``campaign'' has been underway for a
year. He has plotted strategy, assembled a campaign team, pitched
to donors, courted politicians and written letters to potential
allies in key states. His fund-raisers expect to collect $10
million by the end of March. For the next three months, his
``exploratory'' committee will raise money and build a campaign
staff. Yet Bush remains clueless about many national issues and, on
others, he knows he can only lose votes by being pinned down.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the longer he postpones his candidacy, the longer he
deprives his rivals of a target, thereby starving them to death.
For these reasons, Bush is claiming immunity to policy questions.
And he's getting away with it, thanks to several excuses:
</P>
<P>
   1. I'm doing my job. At his press conference, Bush refused to
answer questions about tax cuts and other ``issues'' until Texas
finishes its legislative session in May. He explained that being
governor is his ``job'' and that he had promised Texans he would
stay home through the session. ``I'm a person who does in office
what I say I will do,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   2. Read my principles. Bush outlined his ``core, conservative
principles''--''limited government,'' ``low taxes,'' ``free and
fair trade,'' ``local control of schools,'' ``strong families,''
and ``personal responsibility.'' When asked about specific issues,
he referred back to his principles. ``How exactly do you plan to
preserve the prosperity of the United States?'' asked one reporter.
``When I start to emerge out of the state after the legislative
session,'' said Bush, ``I'm going to lay out an economic stimulus
package that will do just that. You heard the principles by which
I'll be making decisions.'' On foreign policy, he said only that
his ``framework'' would emphasize what's ``good for America.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Read my testimonials. To deflect scrutiny from his own views,
Bush stacked his committee with people who can vouch for him. At
the press conference, President Reagan's secretary of state, George
Shultz, and President Bush's national security aide, Condoleeza
Rice, vouched for Gov. Bush's toughness on foreign policy. Reps.
J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla., and Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, vouched for
his racial inclusiveness. Pro-choice Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.,
vouched for his belief in individual freedom. When a reporter asked
what Bush would do about Russia's meltdown, Bush cited his
``principles,'' babbled about missile defense, and said, ``I of
course will be relying upon the briefings on details from people
such as Dr. Rice.'' With friends like these, who needs positions?
``He has George Shultz advising him on foreign policy,'' observed
ABC's George Will with delight.
</P>
<P>
   4. Read my polls. Since Bush's advantages lie in politics rather
than policy, he steers attention to his campaign juggernaut rather
than to his platform. ``The men and women on this stage represent
the best of the Republican Party,'' he boasted at his press
conference. Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., handed Bush ``a list of 80
current members of Congress who have already endorsed your
candidacy,'' and Bush's aides distributed a similar list to
reporters. On the weekend chat shows, pundits marveled at Bush's
deluge of endorsements, his bottomless coffers, and his godlike
standing in the polls. Bush never explicitly brings up money or
polls, because he doesn't have to. But he counts on them to keep
the press pining for him while he stiffs policy questions.
</P>
<P>
   5. Shame on you. When pressured to clarify his positions, Bush
morphs the question into attack politics and attack journalism. ``I
will campaign on my beliefs and my principles, and I will not
engage in the petty politics of personal destruction,'' he
insisted. A reporter asked him about conservative opponents who
associate him with his father's moderation. ``I'm going to try to
work hard not to play the typical political game of tearing down
your opponent,'' Bush sniffed, ``and I would hope others wouldn't
tear down my dad.''

GOOD MORNING, JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL KRUGMAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The winter of 1981-82 was a grim one for the U.S. economy. After
a nasty recession in 1980, there had been a brief, hopeful period
of recovery--but by early 1982 it was clear that a second, even
worse recession was underway. By late that year the unemployment
rate would rise above 10 percent for the first (and so far only)
time since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   So bleak was the prospect that in February the New York Times
Magazine ran a long article (by Benjamin Stein) titled ``A Scenario
for a Depression?'' which suggested that ``the nation has arrived
at a new spot on the economic map where the old remedies--or what
we thought were remedies--have lost their power and the economic
wise men have lost their magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, however, it turned out that the old remedies were
just as powerful, the nostrums of the economic wise men just as
magical, as always. The Federal Reserve Board, which had been
following a strict monetarist rule, reversed course in midsummer
and opened up the monetary taps. Interest rates came down, the
stock market rose, and by early 1983 the economy was unmistakably
on the mend.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the workers and factories left idle by the slump went
back to work, output soared: Real GDP grew almost 7 percent during
1983, and in 1984 Ronald Reagan was triumphantly re-elected under
the slogan ``It's morning in America.'' It wasn't: Once the slack
had been taken up, growth slowed again, and over the '80s as a
whole the economy actually grew a bit less than it had in the '70s.
But the surge in 1983 was a spectacular demonstration of the way
that a sufficiently expansionary monetary policy can reverse a
depressed economy's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single question now facing the world economy is
whether the same magic can work in today's Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In some important ways, Japan today bears a strong resemblance
to the United States in that frightening summer of 1982. Like the
United States then, Japan has some serious long-term problems: a
slowdown in productivity growth, an ossified management culture, a
troubled financial sector. But overlaid on these long-term
difficulties is a severe recession. Japan's unemployment statistics
notoriously understate the true extent of joblessness, but even so
the current 4.4 percent rate is the highest in the 45 years the
number has been published.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whose estimates you believe, the economy is
operating anywhere from 6 percent to more than 10 percent below its
capacity. That means that Japan's ``output gap'' is probably
comparable to that of the United States 17 years ago. So if Japan
can somehow persuade its consumers and business investors to start
spending again, there is room for several years of rapid
growth--even if the ``structural'' problems remain unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one big difference between America then and
Japan now. Japan can no longer use conventional monetary and fiscal
policies to get the economy moving. Whereas U.S. interest rates in
early 1982 were in double digits--and could therefore be sharply
reduced--Japanese short-term interest rates have been below 1
percent for years, apparently leaving little room for further cuts.
And Japan's government is already deeply in debt, already running
huge deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of the past few months (in which the prospect
that the government would have to sell vast quantities of bonds to
finance its deficits temporarily led to a tripling of long-term
interest rates) suggests that any attempt to stimulate the economy
with even bigger deficit spending will do more harm than good. So
it might appear that there are no easy answers, that nothing short
of a total restructuring of the Japanese economy can turn it
around.
</P>
<P>
   But the events of the last few weeks suggest that there has been
a sea change of opinion inside the Bank of Japan--a change similar
to, but even more striking than, the abandonment of monetarism at
the Fed during 1982.
</P>
<P>
   After years of warning about the risks of inflation and the
importance of sound policy, the BOJ has suddenly begun flooding the
market with liquidity. The overnight rate at which banks lend to
each other--the equivalent of our ``Fed funds'' rate--has been
driven down literally to zero. Banks now charge each other only for
the administrative costs of making the loan.
</P>
<P>
   And still the expansion continues. It's still a bit hard to
believe, but it looks as if Japan's central bank has been
radicalized--that is, it has finally seen the light, has finally
understood that in Japan's current state adhering to conventional
notions of monetary prudence is actually dangerous folly, and only
monetary policy that would normally be regarded as irresponsible
can save the economy.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, big risks in any such radical policy
departure. My own view is that the biggest risk is that the new
policy will not be radical enough, for it is a characteristic of
deflation-fighting that half-measures get you nowhere. Suppose, for
example, that the Bank of Japan were to try to convince the public
that the future will bring inflation, not deflation. But that the
target inflation rate is too low, so that even if everyone believed
that target would be achieved, the Japanese economy would remain
seriously depressed. Then deflation would continue--and the policy
would ignominiously fail.
</P>
<P>
   But if the BOJ is determined enough--and if people like me have
analyzed Japan's plight correctly--then six months or a year from
now Japan may be on the road to an economic recovery more dramatic
than anyone would now dare to forecast. By sometime next year, the
Land of the Rising Sun may, at least for a while, live up to its
billing. You heard it here first.

ACTIVISTS BLAST LONGER COYOTE HUNTING SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Since the cartoon career of Wile E. Coyote and
his disaster-ridden pursuit of Road Runner, the lowly scavenger has
been the Rodney Dangerfield of the wild. Now the coyote isn't even
getting respect from the New York Department of Environmental
Conservation, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the agency is planning to extend by about month the
already lengthy hunting season on the reviled omnivore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is growing interest in coyote hunting in New York state
and we think we can provide some additional recreational hunting
with no danger whatsoever to the coyote population, which is
expanding,'' said Gerry Barnhart, director of wildlife and marine
resources. Barnhart said the proposed extension would standardize
the coyote hunting season throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   The season in the northern zone _ which includes the
Adirondacks, the St. Lawrence valley and the Lake Champlain valley
_ now begins the next to last Saturday and October and ends the
last Sunday in March.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern zone, which encompasses the rest of the state,
the season opens the last Saturday in October and closes the third
Sunday in March. The Department of Environmental Conservation
proposes a standard hunting season running from Oct. 1 to the last
Sunday in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides an opportunity for some regulatory
simplification,'' Barnhart said. Barnhart said that with as many as
18,000 coyotes roaming every region of the state except Long Island
_ a pair was found in New York City a few years ago _ there's
hardly any risk of extinction. And with an animal that lacks the
cuddly qualities of, say, Bambi, and whose shyness is often
mistaken for treachery, no one would be likely to howl about an
extension in the hunting season _ or so it would seem.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fund for Animals is up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's purely recreational,'' Marion Stark of Albany, an
activist with the group, said of the proposed extension of coyote
hunting season. ``There is no biologically valid reason to kill
coyotes ... They (state regulators) are catering to the whim of
hunters.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark said the animals perform a useful function, eating rodents
and carrion (dead animals) and serving as ``sanitation workers of
the wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, she said that killing coyotes will, in the long
run, only result in more breeding; coyotes self-manage their
numbers by practicing a form of birth control when the population
gets too dense. ``The female will stop reproducing,'' Stark said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fund for Animals is attempting to fight the proposed hunting
extension. It is issuing press releases, encouraging constituents
to write to their representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Hope Ryden, author of 23 books on North American wildlife _
including one titled ``God's Dog'' in which she chronicles the
seven weeks she spent living near a den of coyotes to observe their
behavior _ has also joined the crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, coyotes have been scapegoated, but they are a
valuable part of our natural world,'' Stark said.

DIVERSITY LEADS TO A HEALTHFUL DIET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phytochemicals. It's the latest buzzword in nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   To put it simply, phytochemicals are chemicals found in plants
that are suspected to have beneficial health effects. Some, such as
linoleic acid (pumpkins, melon, walnuts) are believed to block
biological processes that lead to cancer and prevent
arteriosclerosis. Others, like capsaicin (cayenne, chili, Tabasco,
bell peppers), may act as a pain reliever.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing new here is the terminology. The American Cancer
Society has been advocating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables
for years to help stave off certain cancers. Perhaps the biggest
news to come out is that the health benefits from phytochemicals
cannot be obtained from a pill.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement from the American Dietetic Association,
``the beneficial effects associated with a diet high in fruits and
vegetables may not be demonstrated when individual nutrients such
as vitamins E and C or beta carotene (which are also
phytochemicals) are consumed in supplement form.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with phytochemicals becoming a food fad is that
information about how much of each chemical people need for optimal
health has yet to be determined, according to the American Council
on Science and Health. In addition, says the Agricultural Research
Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, scientists can't say
which phytochemicals are important; they probably work together.
</P>
<P>
   Though some plant products contain more phytochemicals than
others, health specialists say the best way to receive the likely
benefits of phytochemicals is to eat a large variety of fruits,
vegetables, whole grains, legumes and soy products. Here are a few
suggestions for adding more of these to your diet:
</P>
<P>
   _ Drink green tea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try tofu and tempeh. Soy products have image problems but
they're surprisingly easy to use and tasty.
</P>
<P>
   _ Substitute sorbet or juice bars for ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   _ Include red, green, orange and yellow fruits and vegetables in
your diet each day to ensure you are getting variety.
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose breads, cereals and pastas labeled ``whole-grain'' or
``whole-wheat.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Make plant-based foods the mainstay of your meals. Use meat as
a condiment.

HOW TO BRING A PEACH TO RIPE PERFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA STEVENS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: I bought peaches at the supermarket because they were
a really good deal, or so I thought. They were as hard as rocks.
How can I get them ripe?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Ethylene gas speeds up the ripening process, so here's
what to do. Place the fruit in a paper bag with something that
gives off ethylene, such as an apple, and keep it at room
temperature for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the pop-up temperature indicators on turkeys and chickens
reliable?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bessie Berry of the U.S. Department of Agriculture says the
pop-ups found in chickens and turkeys are reliable indicators that
the poultry is cooked to safe temperatures. She recommends,
however, to double check with a meat thermometer, just to be on the
safe side.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is dietary fiber and where is it found?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dietary fiber is made up of parts of plants the body cannot
digest, explains the National Barley Food Council. Foods rich in
dietary fiber include barley, dry beans, legumes, nuts, seeds,
fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tufts University Guide to Total Nutrition'' explains that
fiber does not have a nutritive value, but it is very useful in
digestion and is credited with helping lower cholesterol and cancer
rates.

`DEEP END' SINKS UNDER ITS OWN EMOTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Beth Cappadora, Michelle Pfeiffer gets to suffer glamorously
in ``The Deep End of the Ocean.'' After she leaves her 3-year-old
boy, Ben, alone with Vincent, his 7-year-old brother, in a hotel
lobby, and Ben ends up missing, she falls into a puddle of shock.
</P>
<P>
   Not at first, though _ initially, this disorganized photographer
tries to tick off all the places he could be, and as it slowly
occurs to her that he's gone, she drops into a heaving heap. Her
husband, Pat, (Treat Williams) steps in to try to hold the family
together, but his wife devotes herself to trying a find a son who's
probably dead.
</P>
<P>
   It's a horror story from Jacquelyne Mitchard's novel that sends
a tremor of fear through audiences _ what if you were responsible
for your child's disappearance, instead of some leering,
yellow-toothed monster out of an episode of ``Hard Copy''? When,
during an argument, Pat screams, ``Kids don't just vanish up in
smoke,'' you feel her misery.
</P>
<P>
   And what would happen if you got a chance to be reunited with
the disappeared child, but he didn't know who you were? The boy,
now named Sam (Ryan Merriman), stumbles back into her life nine
years later _ he offers to mow her lawn. She pulls herself into
shape, whipping out her camera to get shots and compare them to
computer projections of what the boy might look like now.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has tried to get on with his, or her, life, but a scar
has been cut through this family. It turns out that the boy was
raised by a man (John Kapelos) who didn't know the child was
kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   The Cappadora misery is inflicted on everyone. It's one big,
unhappy family.
</P>
<P>
   The real misery comes in sitting through ``The Deep End of the
Ocean,'' which is all over the place. Michelle Pfeiffer is
undeniably the star, and she gets all of her close-ups. But ``Deep
End'' is also scrupulous in trying to get everybody's feelings into
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   It's so rigidly worked out that it doesn't seem to be about
anything _ it bends over backward in trying to be fair. Lacking a
point of view, the movie is a mawkish mess, a USA cable movie given
the emotional meandering of an Actor's Studio exercise. It's almost
impossible to take seriously, especially Whoopi Goldberg as a
detective who becomes Beth's friend.
</P>
<P>
   Except Pfeiffer has some fine moments, and Jonathan Jackson, as
the teen-age Vincent, has a quicksilver temperament _ his rage and
melancholy keep him at a distance from everyone. It's a stirring
piece of work that's too good for the picture.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ruth Reichl slips into a corner seat, eluding yet
another commanding maitre d' with one of her trademark disguises.
The restaurant critic for The New York Times has just dropped her
son off at school and is on her way to meetings at Gourmet
magazine, where she will take over as editor in chief at the end of
April. In the afternoon, she'll pick up her son, then end the day
in a restaurant. Tomorrow or the next day she'll file one of her
last reviews for the Times.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of this double life, which she finds exhausting,
she'll travel to several cities on a book tour for ``Tender at the
Bone'' (Broadway Books), her memoir that was just released in
paperback. Tomorrow night, Reichl will read from the book _ in
disguise, of course _ at the Brookline Booksmith.
</P>
<P>
   Reichl (pronounced RYE-shul), 51, surprised colleagues in
January with the announcement that she would leave the Times after
5 1/2 years to revamp sleepy Gourmet magazine. Considered one of
the most influential voices in the food world, Reichl writes
reviews that are read as much for lively cultural commentary as for
her dissection of restaurant pretentions. She admits she hardly
glanced at Gourmet when it came across her desk. ``I had to go back
and read old issues,'' she says of the Conde Nast publication,
which has a subscription of 760,000 and newsstand sales of 130,000.
</P>
<P>
   While some restaurateurs find Reichl too critical (this goes
with the territory), others say that she elevated the art of
reviewing with stylish writing and refreshing frankness. Amusing
reports on what happened during her visits invariably include
snippets of overheard conversation _ some of it absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Her most celebrated review occurred early: After poor treatment
(in disguise) at Le Cirque, a temple of cuisine, Reichl returned
looking like herself. ``The King of Spain is waiting at the bar,''
owner Sirio Maccioni told her, ``but your table is ready.'' In the
star-rating system of restaurant reviews, this discrepancy cost Le
Cirque one precious star.
</P>
<P>
   A staff who caters only to the rich will pay a price. ``My
particular bent is that restaurants aren't for the 1 percent who
can afford them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend calls it my misguided populism.''
</P>
<P>
   That populism was honed in Ann Arbor, where she attended the
University of Michigan, and polished in Berkeley, Calif., where she
worked in a restaurant for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Reichl stumbled into reviewing 20 years ago, long before the
nation's interest in food peaked. She worked at New West magazine,
which later became California magazine. After handing in her first
review, an editor told her, ``You were born to do this,'' she
recalls in ``Tender at the Bone.'' From there, she moved to the Los
Angeles Times, where she began as critic and eventually became the
food editor, too.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she arrived in New York in 1993, ``restaurants had
become the icon of the '90s,'' she said. Now, she adds, ``they're
part of the natural conversation because the culture demanded it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her job, in a way, was to entertain. ``Reviews are an odd
combination of service journalism and fantasy journalism,'' she
said. In the same way that readers examine reviews of plays and
films they might never see, they also read about food they'll never
eat. ``People get to have little visits to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't even mind know-it-alls _ the people who study
restaurants and then make sure everyone knows their views. ``It's
much more fun dealing with an educated public,'' she said, ``than
dealing with a stupid public.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reichl began using disguises as a way to remain anonymous in a
city where critics' photographs hang in restaurant kitchens. She
owns many wigs and pairs of glasses, which she combines for a
variety of looks, from sleek to heavy, chic to frumpy. ``They took
on a life of their own,'' she said. ``I was late this morning,''
she said, holding out plain hands. ``I usually do nails.''
</P>
<P>
   It would seem cumbersome to eat when tucked into a costume, but
the critic has made much about the disguises, talking about them on
radio interviews when her book was first published. Yet one diner
who has eaten with Reichl several times contends he has never seen
her in disguise. Reichl says she goes out in disguise about half
the time: ``There's a limit to how long you can stand to be done up
all day. Every restaurant I go to I try to do both to see what kind
of a difference there is. Usually if I go out to a restaurant in
disguise at lunch, I don't (do so at) dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   She also distances herself from the restaurant owners. She
eliminates any difficult conversations with them after her visits
by not talking to anyone at the restaurant. She hired an assistant
to call for details about hours and to book reservations because
New York restaurants-of-the-moment fill early. ``It can take hours
on the phone because they keep you on hold.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no problem filling the table. Her eaters include
``starving artists, friends whose children have already left home,
and childless friends who are always thrilled to have a free
meal.''
</P>
<P>
   When she first began at the Times, she thought it was a plum
assignment. She was dutiful about reporting to work in the Dining
section. ``The first three years I went in all day every day. `This
is such a princess job,' I told myself, `it really behooves you to
show up.' '' She would work until 5 p.m., go home for an hour or so
to see her son, and then go out again. Now she picks him up from
school every day. ``But we don't have family dinners.''
</P>
<P>
   The job, she said, is ``very high pressure. You think, what's so
high pressure about it? But people read these things with such
intensity. You have so much power.

   ``I always thought that a critic needed a great palate, stamina,
and good metabolism,'' she said. ``A friend once said, `What you
really need is to be endlessly social.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And she is. ``That part of it I really like.''
</P>
<P>
   Before reviewing took over her life and abolished the nightly
dinner hour, she and her then-husband, Doug (she has since
remarried), were part of a group house in Berkeley. The place, as
she describes it in her book, was always filled with friends, most
of them hippies willing to go along with a housemate's latest
ecological phase.
</P>
<P>
   When she became a reviewer, said Reichl, she had to move the
party out of her home. ``I just transferred it to restaurants. Now
I'll transfer it back. What really makes me happy is to have people
around the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, she and her husband bought a house in the country and
now she has a Wolf range. ``The house has a really good kitchen.
There are wonderful days when I cook and write. I bake or make a
big stew. My big pleasure is just cooking, and now I'll get to do
that.''

</P>
<P>
   When Conde Nast approached Reichl, she had no idea what went on
at Gourmet, or if, in fact, there was any talent on board. The
pages lack vitality and many think its subscribers are mostly
octogenarians.
</P>
<P>
   Reichl shows off her new allegiance. ``It's the most loyal
readership of any magazine ever. I want to keep them,'' she says _
and add others.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast publisher Si Newhouse called Reichl when the
appointment was made public. ``Will you go over and knead the
staff?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   So she called a meeting. ``I love meetings.'' When she was food
editor of the Los Angeles Times, the staff met all the time. ``We
wrote captions together,'' she said, ``and headlines. You can do a
lot in a 10-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Would this happen at Gourmet? ``There I was. These people were
worried about their careers. I was fully prepared to talk to
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   What she found, she said, was a roomful of willing people, ``an
amazing resource, a staff that was eager and full of ideas.' As it
turned out, they were attending their first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Reichl says she plans to bring new writers to the pages of
Gourmet. Her own issues won't begin until September and she has
already contacted a few friends. An early phone call went to
humorist Calvin Trillin.
</P>
<P>
   Did he want to travel somewhere and write for her, she asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, Bud. Isn't there somewhere you want to go?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay,'' he answered. ``To the pimento festival in Spain. I've
always longed to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just what she wanted to hear. ``I want travel to be like
that. We have the expertise to add the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   To her amazement, she learned that the staff traveled as a group
once a year to an exotic location and that every editor got to
attend cooking school wherever in the world she wanted. ``Does the
magazine reflect this?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   And the testers. ``It's a dream job. I want to take that kitchen
and give it a personality.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be eight kitchens in the new Gourmet offices at 4
Times Square, which will house all the Conde Nast publications. The
magazines will move in gradually over the course of next summer.
Gourmet's editor in chief will have a private office. It was to
have a sofa and coffee table, and a private bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed to use a toilet that's just mine,'' says the
populist reviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the designer to take out the sofa and put in a big
table and six chairs. I want meetings every morning. That way we'll
get a magazine that has its look. I want to be able to open the
magazine and say `This is Gourmet.' ''
</P>
<P>
   By then, someone else will own the wigs, though not her
successor, William Grimes, a reporter in the Times's Dining
section. Reichl says she had visions of throwing a party and
tossing out the wigs like bouquets. ``Whoever caught the most would
get the job.''
</P>
<P>
   She checks her watch. The staff at Gourmet is waiting for her.
On the way over, she'll call her office at the Times for messages
and it's unclear whether she'll do this from the back of a taxicab
or right on the street. She grabs the ubiquitious black bag carried
by every well-dressed New York woman, straightens out the jacket of
her expensive black suit, and dashes away.
</P>
<P>
   For today a platinum blonde with arched eyebrows, sunglasses,
and big scarlet lips, she looks like Tracey Ullman doing the Upper
East Side. There are so many women who fit the description, it's
scary.
</P>
<P>
   Even after sharing a meal, it's not easy to tell what Reichl
really looks like.
</P>
<P>
   (It wasn't very good.)

GORE MAY FACE CONTESTS IN MASSACHUSETTS, NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore makes his first
official presidential campaign visit to New Hampshire on Monday, he
will be coming to a state where he has the largest share of
Democratic money and support. But despite his appearance as the
inevitable nominee, the race may be far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic activists and political analysts interviewed this
week said that of all the states where Gore will run against former
New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, New Hampshire and Massachusetts
top the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``His biggest challenge is probably that both states like there
to be a contest,'' said Clinton's former labor secretary, Robert B.
Reich.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire voters never give anybody a free ride. They want
their candidates tested in the battle of primary campaigns,'' said
Reich, an economist at Brandeis University. ``Massachusetts is a
politically sophisticated state, a liberal state, that will not be
taken for granted,''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit Monday will mark his 15th trip to New Hampshire
since 1994, which is double the number of visits then-Vice
President George Bush made to the Granite State at a similiar point
in his 1988 campaign for the presidency. Bush had made only seven
trips to New Hamsphire by March 1987, and a total of 23 before the
state's primary in February 1988, according to trip records
provided by his presidential library in College Station, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After a rally and meeting with Democratic activists in
Manchester, Gore will fly to Iowa, where the first presidential
caucuses are held, to campaign in Des Moines. He will return to New
Hampshire on March 26-27 to attend three ``house parties'' with
small groups of voters and to address a county Democratic gathering
in the eastern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say that among Gore's challenges in New Hampshire is
proving that he can do retail politicking just as ably as President
Clinton and finding a way to do it, despite his Secret Service
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he can't run for president behind a rope line,'' said
Gore backer Jeff Woodburn, former chairman of the New Hampshire
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Woodburn said Gore must also step outside of Clinton's shadow
and exert his independence, which Gore advisers suggested won't
occur until much later this year. And he'll be pressed to take time
from his day job to campaign directly against Bradley, whose
one-on-one skills off the basketball court have been lauded even by
Gore allies, especially in a state with a penchant for hurting the
front-runner and propelling the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary is about 11 months away. Anything can happen
between now and then,'' said Kathy Sullivan, the new chairwoman of
the New Hampshire's state Democratic Party. ``From what I've seen,
the vice president is taking New Hampshire very seriously, and we
expect to see a lot more of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, where Gore has personal connections _ having
graduated from Harvard University, while his wife, Tipper,
graduated from Boston University _ might also present challenges
for Gore, despite his tremendous organizational and fund-raising
advantage over Bradley. Bradley has yet to begin organizing in
Massachusetts, though his aides say he will soon release the names
of some of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Gore is in the middle of a feud between Boston
Mayor Thomas M. Menino and Housing and Urban Development Secretary
Andrew Cuomo over alleged discrimination in the city's public
housing.
</P>
<P>
   And the Clinton-Gore team's preference for Los Angeles over
Boston as the site for the Democratic National Convention in 2000
didn't sit well with the mayor. Gore has visited California 53
times since 1993, and said last week that the nation's largest
state deserved more of his attention, a comment that, while
arguably true, made even some of his allies cringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd just assume he stay here than in California,'' quipped
Woodburn. ``Maybe he's just warming up for a general election. He
can do that and just make sure he's in New Hampshire in February.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently seizing an opening, Bradley initiated a meeting a
couple of weeks ago with Menino, a conversation that the former
senator's communications director, Anita Dunn, described as a
get-acquainted session and an exchange of views about issues facing
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Menino, through a spokesman, declined to comment for this
report.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the flap hasn't affected the
vice president's relationship with Menino or created problems for
his campaign in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we view our relationship with the mayor the same way
it has always been, which is a great relationship,'' Lehane said,
after listing various federal projects that Gore helped steer to
Boston, including money for the city's empowerment zone.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said Bradley views the Bay State as potentially friendly
turf because Clinton and Gore didn't have to actively compete there
in 1992 when Paul Tsongas, the late Massachusetts senator, was a
candidate. It was a similar situation in Iowa, she said, where
Senator Tom Harkin was running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a critical state and it's a state where we believe Bill
Bradley can do well,'' Dunn said. ``Massachusetts is not a state
where Clinton-Gore ever had much of an infrastructure. They didn't
contest it in '92, so it's a little bit like Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Landy, a political scientist at Boston College, said
many local politicians could jump on the Gore bandwagon if he looks
like a sure winner. ``Many officeholders in Massachusetts really
felt in '92 that they were on the sidelines because of the Tsongas
campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark Hubbard, a political scientist at the University of
New Hampshire, said Massachusetts, even more than the Granite
State, might prove an interesting matchup between Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's particular brand of politics, that kind of
intellectual approach to policy liberalism is the kind that plays
well in Massachusetts,'' he said. Hubbard added that former
Governor William F. Weld ``is a Republican example of that kind of
approach, and I think Bradley could make a stronger run against
Gore in Massachusetts than he can in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodburn said Gore could be helped in New Hampshire by the
state's open primary laws that enable Democrats to vote in the
Republican primary, which may have as many as 11 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``A smaller turnout is going to help the better organized,
incumbent candidate,'' Woodburn said. Even so, he added, ``The race
is going to tighten, and it's going to be a fight and Al Gore is
going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich said Gore's ``biggest danger is keeping his candidacy
fresh and interesting. The American public bores quickly. Gore has

Clinton-Gore administration for all its strengths and faults is
also likely to be shopworn after eight years,,'' he said. ``How
does Gore communicate new energy, vitality, and excitement? That's
the big question.''

WALL STREET LESSON ON INTERNET'S POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a company gets taken over by another company and Wall
Street likes the deal, that's called a successful takeover. When a
company gets taken over by another company and Wall Street hates
the deal, that's called a ``take-under,'' because the acquisition
causes the acquired company's stock price to plummet.
</P>
<P>
   USA Networks' proposed acquisition of the Internet company Lycos
is a classic example of a ``take-under.'' Since the deal was
announced last month, Lycos's stock has lost one-third of its
value. Wall Street's reaction has been so negative, in fact, that
it now appears that the deal as proposed will collapse.
</P>
<P>
   David Wetherell, Lycos's largest investor, announced on Tuesday
that he was quitting the company's board and had hired the
investment firm of Morgan Stanley to help him line up another
buyer. This news was cheered by investors. Lycos's stock rose
smartly. The hope on Wall Street was that a bidding war for Lycos
would ensue.
</P>
<P>
   On one level that's what this story is about: people haggling
over the price of a stock. But on a more important level, it's
about the future of the Internet. Is the Internet just another
distribution channel? Or is it the mother of all distribution
channels? Is the Internet just another home shopping network? Or
does it touch every aspect of our lives?
</P>
<P>
   On one side are the traditionalists. Traditionalists, truth be
told, don't like the Internet. They don't understand it. Internet
culture makes them uncomfortable. Most traditionalists have missed
the run-up in Internet stocks. And most of them believe, in their
heart of hearts, that the whole Internet ``thing'' is basically a
speculative bubble waiting to burst.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are Internet enthusiasts. They believe that
the Internet is a transforming technology. They believe it is
capable of organic growth. They believe it erases boundaries and
rewrites the rules of business. They're long on Internet stocks.
They've made fortunes investing in the ``thing.'' And they believe
that when all is said and done, the future of commerce, education,
health care, entertainment, financial services, and a hundred other
business categories is on line.
</P>
<P>
   USA Networks' proposed acquisition of Lycos was structured with
traditionalists in mind. The chief executive of USA Networks, Barry
Diller (for whom I once worked briefly as a consultant), promised
investors that if the deal went through, he would deliver $1.2
billion in revenue in the first year. The traditionalists liked the
sound of that. They could imagine that some of that revenue might
become earnings. Traditionalists worship at the altar of earnings.
An Internet offering with real earnings made their hearts flutter.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasts hated the deal, since it narrowed the Lycos
platform. They saw it consigning Lycos to the role of alternate
distribution channel for Diller's Home Shopping Network zirconium.
There wasn't much value in that. That was all about the low end of
the market _ the demographics that least attracted their interest.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasts look at Lycos as a potentially immense platform,
capable of delivering all kinds of goods and services to an
expanding number of customers. For every joint venture that Lycos
enters into there will eventually be revenue. If it offers low-cost
long-distance telephone service in conjunction with a long-distance
reseller, there will be a penny earned on every other minute of
every call. If it offers low rate credit cards, there will be a
dollar earned on every $100 worth of transactions conducted with
that card. If it offers on-line banking services, there will be
fees earned with every new customer.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasts look at Lycos and see a hundred streams of future
revenue combining into a mighty river. They believe that in five
years, high-speed modems will be ubiquitous and that Pentium II
chip computers will retail for less than $400. Once that
infrastructure is in place, the entire world of commerce will
change. Those companies that have real Internet customers, like AOL
and Yahoo and Excite, will command a huge premium for access to
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   And the beauty of it is that Lycos already has those customers _
not in numbers anything like AOL, but in impressive numbers
nonetheless. The larger the number of customers, the larger the
value of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Diller's deal doesn't expand the customer base. It constricts
it. Which is why, in the end, the enthusiasts attacked the deal
with such ferocity. They were determined to win.
</P>
<P>
   Which they have done. The balance of power on Wall Street has
shifted. The enthusiasts have prevailed. On one level the Diller
deal was a miscalculation about price. But on a more important
level, it was emblematic of how the Internet changes perceptions of
value.
</P>

CRIME FICTION WITH THE STAYING POWER OF ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
DESIRE LINES 
By Christina Baker Kline 
Morrow, 343 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bright, popular, pretty Bangor girl disappears mysteriously on
the night of her high school graduation in 1986. Still haunted
powerfully by the incident 10 years later, her closest friend
returns to the Maine town and, at some risk, tries to fill in the
blanks and find her classmate, dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
   Any plot outline of ``Desire Lines'' would leave the impression
that Christina Baker Kline's fine novel, her second, is a work of
crime fiction. But accurate plot summaries offer little more
insight into books than their covers do. ``Desire Lines'' is
considerably more than genre fiction. The main distinctions are its
fuller embrace of the world and the psychological ripeness and
complex indelibility of its central characters _ the searching
Kathryn Campbell and her missing, magnetic friend, Jennifer
Pelletier.
</P>
<P>
   Recently divorced, Kline's protagonist returns reluctantly to
Bangor, dragging a sense of failure, to live with her mother. Kline
captures her melancholy homecoming with the same edgy truth that
makes the ensuing mother-daughter psychological warfare sourly
palpable. Feeding this turmoil and air of defeat is Kathryn's very
dimly understood, but almost overpowering, connection to her
long-lost friend.
</P>
<P>
   Kathyrn's search for the facts about Jennifer, which she digs up
while freelancing a series of stories for the local paper, provides
the skeletal, conventional mystery in ``Desire Lines.'' The feature
stories are to be published in connection with the 10th reunion of
Kathryn's high school class, which is also the anniversary of
Jennifer's disappearance. The sometimes wary interviews with aging,
changing classmates, and the reunion itself, have a bittersweet
``Big Chill'' tang. They also trigger the suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Purely by the standards of good popular mystery fiction,
``Desire Lines'' is fun but undistinguished, the suspense late in
developing and accompanied by some overobvious hints about the
villain of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   But the soul of the novel is the deeper and more engaging
mystery within Kathryn herself. Her unexamined past unnerves and
imprisons her, rendering her churlish and childish. She's obsessed
with her missing friend but unclear about the swirling feelings
aroused by her search _ an inchoate mixture of adolescent idolatry,
love, jealousy, and nagging guilt. As she better understands
herself, Kathryn ``distinctly remembers wishing she could jump
inside Jennifer's skin and inhabit her body, to see the world
through those light-blue eyes.'' And in further probing the truth
about Jennifer and clarifying their relationship, Kathryn emerges
almost as if from underwater, released from a kind of suffocatingly
protracted adolescence. Even her hometown, which originally seems
inhospitably provincial and raw, blushes with color and promise.
</P>
<P>
   We don't expect even the best crime fiction _ whether it's by
Elmore Leonard or Sara Paretsky _ to insinuate itself into mind and
heart or, certainly, to linger there long if it does. If their
narratives move and crackle stylishly as we read them, fine:
Ephemeral exhilaration is what we happily pay for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desire Lines'' has the staying power of art. I hesitate to
call Kline a ``serious novelist'' for fear of obscuring her easy
style and fluid metaphor-making, not to mention the simple
pleasures of her eventually suspenseful story _ but she's the real
deal. Kline dramatizes private life, from the charged crosscurrents
of broken families to the robust intimacies of sex, with a
generous, knowing appreciation of human nature. But what impresses
most about the author is the pulsing depth and ambiguity she brings
to her sometimes maddening but lovable main character, Kathryn, who
blooms into adulthood as she turns over the soil of her past and
exposes the hidden turnings of the human heart.

UCONN'S CALHOUN LEAVING NOTHING TO CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Jim Calhoun wants to make certain he's covered
everything. There is so much you can't control in the NCAA
Tournament, so many elements that could sneak up on teams talented
enough to win it all.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the University of Connecticut coach, whose top-seeded
Huskies (28-2) meet 16th-seeded Texas-San Antonio (18-10) in the
West Regional first round, took care of the altitude factor by
bringing his team here a day early and altering the sprinting
drills. In addition, he said he will rotate more players in to
lessen the affects of the thinner air.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun saw two Texas-San Antonio game films and Monday lamented
he didn't know more about freshman guard Devin Brown, the
Roadrunners' leading scorer at 16.9 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun has allowed injured center Jake Voskuhl (foot) to
practice only sparingly, and after sophomore guard Albert Mouring
aggravated his right knee injury Wednesday, Calhoun said it is
doubtful he will play.
</P>
<P>
   Anything else?
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think you always get surprised by a number of
things,'' said Calhoun, who added that despite having taken seven
other UConn teams to the NCAAs, ``sometimes you get surprised by
how your team reacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or it could be officiating in the game, where you say, `Whoa,'
'' he added. ``Even though we've done a good job of nationalizing
officiating, there are still such variations. What I would
constitute as not even being a touch foul might be assault and
battery to some guy because that's how they play.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun, in his 13th season with the Huskies, knows this may be
his best shot yet at advancing to the Final Four. With all the
intangibles covered, he can focus on a Texas-San Antonio team that
scored 80 or more points 15 times this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They average 78 points a game,'' said Calhoun, ``and they
played a 3-2 zone against Southwest Texas State twice and
completely stymied them, and Southwest Texas was probably the best
team in their conference. I think we'll probably see zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. John's plays a 3-2 zone, but (coach) Mike Jarvis doesn't
believe in that. He did it because people have been slowing us down
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn is coming off two lopsided wins in the Big East tournament
_ including an 82-63 rout of St. John's in the final _ after a
57-56 nail-biter over Seton Hall in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies are led by Big East Co-Player of the Year Richard
Hamilton (21 ppg, 4.8 rebounds per game), the Big East tournament's
most outstanding player, Kevin Freeman (12.7 ppg, 7.1 rpg), and
All-Big East point guard Khalid El-Amin (13.8 ppg, 3.6 assists a
game).
</P>
<P>
   UConn, the third-winningest team in Division 1 over the last six
seasons (165-34), tied its 1995-96 school record for wins and the
senior class set a record for most wins in four seasons (108).
UConn was the last unbeaten men's Division 1 program this season,
starting 19-0, and the first team to go 9-0 in Big East road games.
</P>
<P>
   But Calhoun knows that in the eyes of many, the tournament is
the only thing that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's assume we lose a game and we only win 29 or 30 or 28,''
said Calhoun. ``We would lose three games this season and people
would say it's an unsuccessful season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to say that it would be an unsuccessful
season. I would feel the accomplishments of what we could have done
weren't met, because this team is good enough to advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the Huskies placed basketball concerns aside.
Associate director of athletics/communications Tim Tolokan said the
team was mourning the death of former team manager (1992-95) Joe
McGinn, 26, of Bristol, Conn., who lost a battle with kidney
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The team has petitioned the NCAA for permission to wear uniform
patches honoring McGinn, who was a regular at games and joined the
Huskies in the locker room after their Big East championship last
Saturday night. ``He touched all of our lives,'' said Calhoun.

CANADA'S CBC HITS STATIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Since the 1930s, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. has
been one of the strongest threads binding this vast but fragile
country, a nation still struggling for a cohesive identity and
greater cultural confidence.
</P>
<P>
   From Nova Scotia fishing hamlets to Inuit settlements of the
high Arctic to prairie wheat farms in Saskatchewan, CBC radio and,
later, television has been where most Canadians turned for news
about the world and about themselves, as well as an eclectic
mixture of sports and highbrow entertainment. Although audience
share has plunged precipitously in the era of cable and satellite
TV, the CBC remains a unifying force with its broadcasts in
English, French, and aboriginal languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It played a defining role for Canada, and still does,'' says
Vince Carlin, a former top news executive with CBC who today heads
the school of journalism at Toronto's Ryerson Polytechnic
University. ``No one else is doing the breadth of Canadian
programming that the CBC offers.''
</P>
<P>
   But these are dangerous days for Canada's national network,
which receives most of its funding from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by labor unrest, fierce competition from private rivals in
Canada, and programming beamed from the United States, plus the
more or less open hostility of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, the
public broadcaster appears to be in a struggle for its life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different layers and levels of problems all
squeezing together at a bad time,'' Carlin says. ``A strike would
be disastrous. But just as dangerous is political interference. The
corporation's existence may be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 2,000 CBC technicians launched a strike that has
turned top newscasts into comic operas, with anchors describing
massacres in Kosovo or plane crashes in India while the camera cuts
to footage of fashion models prancing in Paris, or the screen
simply goes blank.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has even disrupted broadcasts of ``Hockey Night in
Canada,'' a show that as a national symbol ranks right up there
with the Mounties and the Maple Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that could have far more serious consequences, the
CBC's 3,300 reporters, producers, and anchorpeople gave their union
a strike authorization last week in a vote that carried by a 5-to-1
margin. If they join the technicians on the picket line next week,
the CBC could be shut down for the first time since its founding in
1937.
</P>
<P>
   The risks are enormous. Already, fewer Canadians are tuning in
to the CBC, opting for proliferating specialty channels and popular
American programming.
</P>
<P>
   Despite CBC's long history and status as a national icon, the
network today captures only about 10 percent of viewers in English
Canada, although its French-language service _ watched mainly in
Quebec and New Brunswick _ attracts a substantially higher share
because it faces less competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger is that people will give up in our absence and
tune out the CBC for good,'' Eric Foss, a striking sound
technician, told Maclean's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the broadcaster is sagging under budget cuts and what
appears to be political meddling by the Chretien government. The
prime minister's attitude toward CBC is said to fall between
annoyance and antipathy.
</P>
<P>
   According to Canadian press reports, he has been especially
incensed by the French-language arm of CBC, whose news broadcasts
are perceived to be pro-separatist _ in effect, favoring the
political unraveling of the country that feeds it.
</P>
<P>
   But officials have also been outraged by CBC news reports that
took hard, critical looks at actions and policies of the Chretien
government. In one case, the government forced the suspension of a
CBC reporter who swapped information with groups embroiled in a
dispute with the prime minister's office over alleged
heavy-handedness by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   The correspondent did appear to have breached journalistic
ethics, but Chretien has the leverage to sway CBC's management. He
picks the head of the CBC, and its board is stacked with political
appointees, some of them described as hostile to the notion of
tax-supported broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the 1990s, the government slashed funding to the
network by hundreds of millions of dollars, and last month CBC was
forced to shutter foreign bureaus in Paris, Mexico City, and Cape
Town to control costs. That's an especially demoralizing blow since
the CBC is Canada's most important journalistic enterprise, and has
a reputation for foreign coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offer homegrown, highly trained eyes and ears on the rest
of the world for Canadians, and that sets us apart from others,''
says Peter Mansbridge, anchorman of the CBC's nightly national
newscast.
</P>
<P>
   Founded during the Great Depression, the CBC's mission has
always been more than to just inform or entertain. From the start,
the goal was to bind an immense, inchoate nation lying in the
cultural shadow of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The ties that bind Canada are still loosely woven, but there is
no question that the CBC has helped forge a stronger national
identity. Even today, roughly 90 percent of its prime-time
programming is made in Canada, ranging from TV dramas such as
``Emily of New Moon'' _ a series, based on books by Canadian author
Lucy Maud Montgomery, about two girls coming of age in rural Prince
Edward Island _ to hard-hitting news shows.
</P>
<P>
   Americans might not realize it, but CBC has shaped American
television and radio programming as well. National Public Radio's
``All Things Considered,'' for example, was closely modeled on CBC
Radio's ``As It Happens,'' while so-called TV news magazines, such
as ``60 Minutes,'' trace their genesis to similar CBC news
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Canadians, CBC has been a sort of CBS, NBC, CNN, and PBS
all rolled into one,'' says Carlin. ``It's allowed Canada to talk
to itself about its own issues, and my view is that Canadians need
and expect a public broadcaster.''

BAY STATE SEEN LAGGING ON ELECTRIC CARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts state government, which once led the
national fight to force car makers to sell vehicles that run on
batteries, seems to be losing interest in the battle for
zero-emission cars under Governor Paul Cellucci, just when
activists say state leadership is needed more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires the sale of almost 20,000 zero-emission
vehicles in 2003, but the state has done little to prepare for the
coming upheaval. A program to test-drive cars using alternative
fuels has been cut, almost no one is building electric charging
stations, and the state is just beginning to buy electric vehicles
for official use.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, advocates of electric vehicles fear that
Massachusetts will be unprepared to enforce its hard-won law, which
requires 10 percent of new vehicles sold in 2003 to run on
batteries or a hybrid of batteries and gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're quite at the point where we don't have
enough time to do something, but we will be in a year or so,''
warned Michelle Robinson of the Union of Concerned Scientists. ``We
can't go from zero to 10 percent overnight, and it will give
industry a whole lot of ammunition to kill the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and other observers say it is too soon to blame
Cellucci for the lack of initiative. Problems such as convincing
skittish state agencies to buy electric cars date back to Governor
William Weld, while funding problems may reflect the transition
from one administration to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, Steve Skiffington, director of the state's
electric vehicle pilot program, estimates that he has lost almost
$1 million in funding for the program since last June and that the
number of vehicles under his control has dwindled from 20 to five.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Skiffington can't lend electric and hybrid vehicles
to all the public and private fleet managers who want to learn
about the new technology. And he has been unable to field test new
models in cold New England weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see more funding for more cars,'' said
Skiffington, who works in the Division of Energy Resources. ``We
want to be the Consumer Reports of state agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight for electric vehicles was a signature issue for Weld,
who went to court repeatedly to force car makers to offer
zero-emissions vehicles as part of the state effort to reduce
summertime smog. Because of a quirk in federal law, Massachusetts
had to abandon sales mandates for 1998 and 2001, but the 2003 sales
requirement is still on the books.
</P>
<P>
   Weld also signed a 1996 executive order committing the state to
buying large numbers of vehicles that run on fuels cleaner than
gasoline. By 2003, three-quarters of the new light-duty vehicles
must run on alternative fuels, and 10 percent of the total must be
electric.
</P>
<P>
   However, environmentalists say that, to succeed, these
initiatives require vast amounts of public education about the new
vehicles, as well as a fair amount of vehicle services. For
example, California businesses and government agencies have built
more than 300 public charging stations for electric vehicles, a
project that hasn't even begun here.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists also say that the state has been slow to set
an example by purchasing electric and other low-polluting vehicles.
``They're way behind'' in meeting the spirit of Weld's executive
order, said Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   So far, just 32 of the state's 2,700 light-duty vehicles run on
a fuel other than gas. All of them run on natural gas, though the
Metropolitan District Commission will soon get the state's first
electric vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But Herb Falconer, who oversees the purchase of light-duty
vehicles at the Executive Office of Administration and Finance,
promised there will be more purchases as older vehicles are
retired. ``This has a lot of potential for clean air,'' Falconer
said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the state's electric-vehicle testing program has
won praise from environmentalists for gathering information about
how electric vehicles with limited driving range can meet
commuters' needs. The program also identified the need for a
kerosene heater so that drivers of electric cars don't drain their
batteries providing heat in a typical New England winter.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Skiffington's program has five of the latest electric
vehicles, the Honda EV Plus model, equipped with batteries that can
go 100 miles before recharging. But Skiffington is still looking
for the money to acquire other state-of-the-art vehicles, such as
Toyota's hybrid version of the RAV 4, which has a longer driving
range because it runs on gas and batteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have access to money to test the vehicles that the
manufacturers will deliver in the future,'' said Sheila Lynch,
director of the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium, a
Boston-based industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists suspect that Cellucci, who took over from
Weld in July 1997, is less committed to electric and hybrid
vehicles than Weld was, in part because of Cellucci's ties to
former auto-industry lobbyist Andrew Card. Card lobbied hard
against the electric-vehicle law.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials Wednesday said there had been no
change in state policy. ``There has been no trickle down from
Cellucci'' suggesting that policy had changed, said Skiffington.
</P>
<P>
   And Newton Mayor David Cohen, who wrote the state's
electric-vehicle law when he was a state representative, said he
believes that Cellucci will rally to the cause once his
administrators grow comfortable in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have every hope,'' Cohen said, ``that the program will be
implemented successfully.''

TIME FOR QUALCOM TO SHARE THE SPECS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This summer, digital phone maker Qualcomm will release a new
suite of programs called the Qualcomm Phone Utilities. The suite
comes with a cable that lets you connect a Qualcomm cellular phone
to any Windows-based computer, and a set of programs that give you
unprecedented control over the phone's functions.
</P>
<P>
   One of my biggest complaints about portable phones is the
difficulty of programming their phone books. Little 10-digit
keypads are great for dialing a number or two, but I prefer a
full-size computer keyboard if I'm going to type in more than a few
names and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Qualcomm Phone Utilities solve this problem with a program
called Speed Dial Manager. This program lets you upload or download
the 99-entry address book that every Qualcomm phone has. You can
also sort your phone book, automatically remove all of the ``1s,''
change area codes, and, perhaps best of all, assign different rings
to different phone numbers. You can even create your own ringers
and load them into the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Another program, the Qualcomm Phone Exchange, allows you to back
up all of the settings in your phone to a floppy disk or copy them
from one phone to another. This is a very handy feature if you run
a business and want to download the same address book into all of
the phones in your fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Qualcomm Phone Monitor lets you view the phone's screen and
press its buttons from your computer. Finally, Phone Utilities
comes with a windows driver that turns a Qualcomm phone into a
wireless modem. Today that modem runs at 9600 baud, but in a year
or so these same phones will be able to pump data along at 64 kbps
or even 128 kbps, just as soon as carriers such as Sprint and Bell
Atlantic start to offer high-speed wireless data services.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm should be applauded for developing this kind of
application and bringing it to consumers. The company will also be
rewarded for its effort. Although Qualcomm's Phone Utilities should
be a good seller in its own right, this program's real value to
Qualcomm is that it will stimulate the sale of Qualcomm telephones
and base station equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm's software also opens up an interesting opportunity for
off-hours engineers, hobbyists, and freelance programmers. Many of
these people are sure to buy the Phone Utilities kit, eavesdrop on
the communications between the phone and the computer, and reverse
engineer the commands that Qualcomm uses to control their phone. In
no time at all, we're likely to see shareware and freeware programs
that can also control Qualcomm phones. In all likelihood, people
will create programs for the Linux operating system, the Macintosh,
Palm Pilots, and even Windows CE machines. It will be far more
software than Qualcomm could have ever created on its own.
</P>
<P>
   I know this is what the future will hold, because I know at
least two engineers who want to work on these projects. The only
thing holding them back is the lack of a cable and lack of
published specifications from Qualcomm.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm isn't alone. There's not a single manufacturer of
cellular telephones that publishes the internal specifications of
its telephones. One reason is the fear of fraud: The cellular
telephone systems that were deployed in the 1980s were
fundamentally unsecure. By modifying the code in a telephone, it
was possible to charge phone calls to somebody else's telephone
number, or to create a telephone scanner that could eavesdrop on
other people's telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nearly a decade ago a trio of hackers, including Tsutomu
Shimomura and Mark Lottor, reverse engineered Oki's 900 cellular
telephone and could do just that. Ironically, one of their
motivations wasn't committing fraud, but creating software that
would let people upload and download telephone books into their
little phones.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason that manufacturers haven't published their
specifications in the past is embarrassment. Much of the embedded
computer systems currently in the marketplace are built upon
computer programs and protocols that are poorly thought out and
technically ugly. For many companies, publishing this sort of
technical information is akin to revealing their dirty laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors and users in the world of computer software have been
struggling with this issue for many years now, and an interesting
trend has been emerging. Some companies, such as Microsoft,
continue to hold their software secret. But other companies have
started releasing their so-called ``source-code,'' or the actual
code that their programmers write.
</P>
<P>
   One company that has opened up its source code is Netscape
Communications, which last year published the source code for the
5.0 version of Netscape Communicator. Another company that
publishes its source code is Red Hat Software, which produces a
version of the Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage of open source software is that its users can
examine it, fix the bugs, and make it better. Open source software
taps the creativity and programming excellence of hundreds of
thousands of programmers across the Internet _ far more engineers
than even Microsoft could hire.
</P>
<P>
   The next logical step after open source software is open source
hardware. These days, practically every piece of consumer
electronics or home appliance comes with an embedded computer. If
the makers of these products would simply publish their software,
consumer programmers could take that software and remake the
products.
</P>
<P>
   Like open source software, the idea of open source hardware is
threatening to many companies. But it's also powerful. It will take
only a few forward-thinking companies to start the industry down
the path. Let's hope Qualcomm is pointing the way.

THE WESTERN IS BACK IN THE SADDLE, AND WHAT A RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Kid and The Big Hunt: Unabridged Stories from The Tonto
Woman and other Western Stories,'' by Elmore Leonard; read by Brian
Dennehy and Liev Schrieber; approximately 90 minutes; Simon &AMP;
Schuster Audio; $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who enjoys the talented Leonard probably knows that he
began his prolific-writing odyssey with westerns. More than three
decades before ``Get Shorty'' and other best-sellers, Leonard was
an accomplished writer of such classics as ``Hombre.''
</P>
<P>
   A Leonard-the-western-writer revival is taking place, and this
isn't a bad thing at all. These stories don't showcase his gift for
dialogue, but his lean and economic prose is evident, as is his
compassion for the people and places being written about.
</P>
<P>
   In both ``The Kid'' and ``The Big Hunt,'' men with resolve tough
their way through trying times. These aren't larger-than-life
creations, either. They are determined men of character, taking
their lumps but never losing their focus.
</P>
<P>
   The acclaimed horse trilogy by Cormac McCarthy did not breath
new life into the western genre, but it's possible the re-release
of Leonard's earliest works (1950s and early '60s) just might. They
are accessible stories that, once started, compel the listener to
take them to their conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``8.4,'' by Peter Hernon; read by Campbell Scott; abridged,
approximately 4.5 hours; Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio; $24.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to the Richter scale, which may tell you all
you want to know about Hernon's second suspense novel in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   An explosive fault line has come alive in America's heartland,
near the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. It has
erupted once, killing tens of thousands, and appears likely to
break loose at least one more time, much like the series of
earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 that devastated large portions of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   John Atkins and Elizabeth Holleran, seismologists who previously
did not know each other, discover love as they search for answers
to the trembling fault line's potential. We're not sure why she
finds him attractive. At the same time, there are devious men among
them, some working for the U.S. Geological Survey, who for reasons
that never become clear are undermining their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Hernon, a reporter with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, should be
ready to quit his day job, thanks to ``8.4.'' NBC has purchased the
rights to turn it into a movie, and the book indeed has all the
makings of a big- or small-screen thriller. Which doesn't mean this
isn't a flawed work, despite the rumbling action.
</P>
<P>
   Hernon clearly knows science better than he knows character or
plot development. As a result, ``8.4'' in fact fails to register on
a literary scale.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunter,'' by James Byron Huggins; read by Boyd Gaines;
abridged, approximately 4.5 hours; Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio; $23.
</P>
<P>
   There is a comic-book quality to Huggins' latest thriller. The
protagonist, Hunter, the world's best tracker who has a massive
wolf as his loyal companion, is, if possible, more unbelievable
than Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan. We don't know how Hunter came to
be such an amazing tracker, nor do we learn the origins of his
amazing physical strength. He just is, and he seems not a whit
real.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is asked to assist a team of elite Army troops as they
search for a beast loose somewhere north of the Arctic Circle. The
beast is in fact a monster, created by a secret government agency.
The beast is hellbent on brutally killing and devouring every
person it encounters. It's not an exaggeration to say this creature
is every bit as believable as Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins pulled off an almost first-rate techo-thriller in 1997
with ``Cain,'' but ``Hunter'' misses the mark. Even a superb
reading by the always reliable Boyd Gaines can't keep ``Hunter'' on
track.

_CREATINE MAY SLOW LOSS OF MUSCLE TISSUE  
 _INCREASE IS TRACKED IN LIVER DISEASE RATES

 Creatine may slow loss of muscle tissue
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A popular food supplement used by athletes and body builders
shows promise of slowing the progressive muscle-wasting in people
with degenerative diseases like muscular dystrophy, according to a
new study.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine, an apparently safe and widely used amino acid,
produced an average 10 to 15 percent improvement in the exercise
ability of 81 patients with neuromuscular diseases, according to a
report published Wednesday in the journal Neurology. Dr. Mark
Tarnopolsky of McMaster University Medical Center in Ontario gave
the patients 10 days' worth of creatine, and found that their hand,
foot, and leg strength ``went up on every measurement.''
</P>
<P>
   The researcher said larger studies are needed, but he suggested
that taking creatine, which is relatively cheap, might delay for
weeks or months patients' loss of independence in various
activities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, researchers from Cornell and Harvard universities
recently reported that creatine benefited mice with a disease much
like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease. The
mice moved and ate better and lived longer, said the report.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Increase is tracked in liver disease rates
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More people are developing liver cancer and are dying from it
younger, according to a study that tracked rising rates of the
disease over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of 1.4 cases per 100,000 people in 1976 to 1980 rose to
2.4 per 100,000 in the period of 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, liver cancer affects elderly people in developed
countries, said the researchers in a report in the current issue of
the New England Journal of Medicine. But younger people are
developing the disease from infections with hepatitis B and
hepatitis C, and those two diseases are primarily reponsible for
the increase in liver cancer incidence, according to the
researchers from the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in
Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The authors say the increase in liver cancer rates may continue
for a number of years as some people who now have hepatitis B or C,
but haven't yet developed cancer, will later be diagnosed with it.
Liver cancer has a five-year survival rate of only about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Nedim Ince and Jack R. Wandes
of Massachusetts General Hospital said aggressive treatment with
antiviral drugs may reduce the risk of hepatitis patients
developing liver cancer, but that larger studies are needed to show
how effective this strategy will be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Drug found to benefit Parkinson's patients
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Modern drugs can slow the decline of people with Parkinson's
disease, but at a heavy price _ the drugs may make the patient
psychotic. As many as 22 percent of patients with Parkinson's _ a
progressive loss of movement, flexibility and balance _ develop
delusions, hallucinations, and other severe mental problems, and
it's the single biggest reason such patients are put in nursing
homes.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, many antipsychotic drugs. But most of
them, ironically, make the Parkinson's symptoms worse.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome news from the research front, however, says that
clozapine, a relatively new drug normally used for schizophrenia,
benefited about 85 percent of Parkinson's patients with
drug-induced psychosis. In the study, reported in the current issue
of the New England Journal of Medicine, small doses of the drug
reduced the hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms by about 25
percent, and the drug even improved tremors caused by Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   The study was headed by Dr. Joseph H. Friedman at the Memorial
Hospital of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Jeffrey L. Cummings at the
University of California at Los Angeles Medical School said the
study suggests that use of clozapine ``may allow some patients to
continue living at home for longer periods and will facilitate the
care of many of those living in nursing homes.''

SPYING ACCUSATION SHAKES SILENCE AT LOS ALAMOS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ Even now, more than half a century after its
hush-hush creation, Los Alamos is not a town that talks much.
</P>
<P>
   Trained in science and silence, the elite research community
that developed the world's first atomic bomb still prides itself on
its secrets. Some husbands and wives know only the roughest
outlines of their spouse's assignments. Most neighbors know better
than to ask. Gossiping goes against instincts ingrained in the days
when residents were told not to talk to outsiders unless absolutely
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all trained not to talk about anything we were working
on, ever,'' said Lawry Mann, a retired physicist who is now vice
chairman of the Los Alamos County Council. ``So that certainly cuts
down on the rumor mill.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainty -- that silence must and will be maintained --
was challenged this week when a computer scientist at Los Alamos
National Laboratory was fired for allegedly handing nuclear warhead
secrets over to the Chinese. In a city where nearly every other
adult works at or for the Lab, as locals call the 43 square miles
of offices, explosive testing sites and laboratories, the
revelations were wounding. They were not, however, stunning.
</P>
<P>
   As Richard Perkins, who works for the Lab's largest
subcontractor, Johnson Controls, put it, ``I thought it was pretty
much inevitable.'' Added Mann, ``It's the type of thing that's
going to happen when you've got something other people want to
steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as they absorbed the potential magnitude of the scandal,
residents did tend to take the alleged betrayal professionally, if
not personally. Los Alamos, after all, was a town knit together by
a single purpose when the Manhattan Project was launched in 1943,
six secretive years before the city was formally established. The
18,500 or so people who live in the county are used to being blamed
for building the Bomb. Even as the Lab expands its work to the
other sciences, such as biomedical and environmental research, they
remain known for their first and most controversial success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get so much bad publicity and this isn't going to help,''
said Sandy Warnock, who lives across the street from the alleged
spy in their midst and whose husband is a project manager at the
Lab. ``The tree huggers in Santa Fe hate us. But I'm surprised at
my own reaction. I think they ought to put this guy on the end of a
nuclear weapon and send him to China.''
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee, the 59-year-old scientist who was just months shy of
retirement when he was fired, has not yet been arrested or charged
with any crime. Allen Marshall, a substitute teacher whose family
has lived next door to Lee for 16 years, said he finds it
impossible to believe Lee will be. Marshall, 25, grew up with the
Taiwanese-born Lee's two children and recalled him as a man who did
the cooking for the family and cooked the Marshall's a Peking Duck
every Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Lab you're told what to look for in case of spying and
none of those red flags came up,'' said Marshall, whose parents
work at the Lab. ``My parents are taking this hard. We just can't
see him doing something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Few, however, were surprised that Lee had the opportunity to do
so. Scientists from other countries regularly visit Los Alamos,
whose own scientists in turn make frequent trips abroad. Along with
9,242 others, Lee also had the highest security clearance awarded
by the Lab. Called Q clearance, it gave him access to every area,
no matter how sensitive the work being done there. Another 1,588
subcontractors, and Lab and US Department of Energy employees and
retirees, have more limited access, known as L clearance, said Lab
spokesman Jim Danneskiold, and 7,569 have Lab identification badges
but no security clearance at all.
</P>
<P>
   Those totals are far higher than the actual number of Lab
employees, 8,955 -- a number so large that the population of Los
Alamos doubles during the day and restaurants that are packed at
lunchtime are deserted by dinner. Located on a secluded mesa
surrounded by the Jemez Mountains about 35 miles northwest of Santa
Fe, and with the Lab requiring so much land, the city has nowhere
to grow. Even Wal-mart has been unable to find a spot for one of
its sprawling superstores.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, housing prices are higher than the national average
and the highest in New Mexico. According to Danneskiold, about half
of the employees live outside Los Alamos. Many of the people who
work at the Lab can't even afford to live nearby, not even down the
hill in White Rock where Lee has a burnt red, wood-and-brick house
in a pricey subdivision built in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He
and his wife Sylvia, a former Lab secretary, were in seclusion
there this week, their telephone disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably only 30 to 50 houses on the market at any
given time,'' said Suzie Havemann, a former president of the Los
Alamos County Chamber of Commerce who grew up in the city, left,
then returned about six years ago. ``I may be exaggerating, but
it's really bad. Everything is more expensive here: transportation,
housing, gas, food. But it's a great place to live if you can
afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the center for nuclear defense research, Los Alamos is in
essence a small town with a big brain. Architectually, it has a
1950s feel. Intellectually, it's already in the next millennium.
PhDs with seven syllable specialties abound, along with Nobel Prize
winners. A downtown street is named after J. Robert Oppenheimer,
the University of California physics professor who led the secret
effort to develop the first atomic weapons. Since World War II
ended, the university, rather than the US government, has run the
Lab as a federal contractor and signed its employees' paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Today Los Alamos is struggling to shed its status as a
one-company town. Last year, the county was given a $22.6 million
payment from the federal government, which discontinued the $2.8
million paid annually in lieu of local property taxes. Some of the
money has gone toward taking over the water system and the small
airport on the way into town, where the first commercial flight is
scheduled to take place later this month. A research park on land
that once belonged to the Lab is planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always surprised when they come into town and see
it's not a military base or a big, flat desert where nuclear
testing is done,'' said Kevin Holsapple, executive director of the
Los Alamos Economic Development Corp. ``There is a town that is a
very separate thing from the Lab, and we want even more of that.
We're not just about nuclear weapons anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs of change, in fact, are everywhere on the way into Los
Alamos. Unlike the early days, arrows now point the way for
visitors. Havemann, who never visited her father's office at the
Lab and could not recall a single father or mother who worked there
speaking at her school's career day, stressed that people are more
open today. Some could even joke about Lee's alleged betrayal of
the scientific community.
</P>
<P>
   ``In meetings today, people made some tongue in cheek comments
about spies and things,'' Havemann said. ``But we've always had a
controversial heritage. Maybe if I were a senior manager at the Lab
I'd see it differently, but absolutely I don't see it as a
reflection on me or Los Alamos.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Commentary
</P>
<P>
   By Waldo Proffitt
</P>
<P>
   NYT Regional Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   There is a big push in the Florida Legislature to authorize the
</P>
<P>
   state to issue auto license tags carrying the slogan ``Choose
</P>
<P>
   Life.''
</P>
<P>
   I expect there are enough votes in the Republican-controlled
</P>
<P>
   Legislature for the push to succeed. Which is unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   The state simply has no business taking sides in what may well
</P>
<P>
   be the most intractable dispute in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents of adding this tag to the 43 vanity tags already
</P>
<P>
   available argue that ``choose life'' in this context only
indicates
</P>
<P>
   approval of child adoption.
</P>
<P>
   I think not. If that were the case, it would be a simple matter
to
</P>
<P>
   approve a tag reading, ``Adopt A Child,'' and you could get
</P>
<P>
   unanimous support from every legislator and every legislator's
</P>
<P>
   constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The words, ``Choose Life,'' as proposed in this usage, translate
</P>
<P>
   to ``Outlaw Abortion'' _ a perfectly legal public policy
objective,
</P>
<P>
   though not one I approve. More to the point, it is a policy most
</P>
<P>
   polls show is not supported by a majority of Floridians.
</P>
<P>
   To say that a ``Choose Life'' tag is intended only as a
</P>
<P>
   pro-adoption slogan is to engage in the sort of specious,
</P>
<P>
   evasive, less-than-the-whole-truth sophistry of which we have
</P>
<P>
   seen all too much in Washington during the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Those who may doubt that is a fair statement are invited to go
</P>
<P>
   forth and sign up legislative support for a license plate slogan
</P>
<P>
   reading, ``Choose Choice,'' or even ``Choose Freedom'' _
</P>
<P>
   certainly noble objectives almost universally approved by all
</P>
<P>
   Americans. But, you try to get those words on license plates
</P>
<P>
   under the sponsorship of men and women who support the
</P>
<P>
   freedom of women to make their own choice in matters of
</P>
<P>
   reproduction, and you will have a whale of a fight on your
hands.
</P>
<P>
   I think it would be just as wrong and stupid for the Legislature
to
</P>
<P>
   authorize ``Choose Choice'' tags as to approve ``Choose Life''
</P>
<P>
   tags. Either one would be seen for what it is _ a slogan
</P>
<P>
   expressing a point of view about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Either one would be appropriate as a bumper sticker. Indeed,
</P>
<P>
   there are plenty of stickers using even stronger language
</P>
<P>
   already rolling down the highways.
</P>
<P>
   But, there is a big difference between an unofficial message
</P>
<P>
   pasted on a car and a message bearing the imprimatur of the
</P>
<P>
   state of Florida, unavoidably giving the impression that the
</P>
<P>
   sentiment expressed represents, if not the official view of the
</P>
<P>
   state, at least the view that it is appropriate for the
sentiment to
</P>
<P>
   appear under state auspices.
</P>
<P>
   This is not comparable to allowing Gators and Seminoles to
</P>
<P>
   taunt each other or encouraging the protection of universally
</P>
<P>
   valued species such as manatees and Florida panthers.
</P>
<P>
   It is more akin to pouring gasoline on a raging fire. It is
neither
</P>
<P>
   responsible nor proper for the state to reduce one of the most
</P>
<P>
   complex and divisive issues of our time to a battle of slogans.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that totally committed pro-life people and totally
</P>
<P>
   committed pro-choice people irritate each other by marching
</P>
<P>
   under banners which present their cause attract- ively.
</P>
<P>
   That they are both able to do so illustrates, I suggest, the
</P>
<P>
   complexity of the issue and the ambivalence it evokes. I don't
</P>
<P>
   know anyone who thinks an abortion is a truly joyous event which
</P>
<P>
   should be celebrated with toasts and merriment. On the other
</P>
<P>
   hand, I know few people who think no woman should ever be
</P>
<P>
   allowed to have an abortion under any circumstances
</P>
<P>
   whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   I think the views of most of us lie somewhere between these
</P>
<P>
   extremes, and probably not very far from the position of the
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court in Roe vs. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   I think, further, that, not many years hence, the abortion
debate
</P>
<P>
   will be mooted by advances in medicine which will prevent most
</P>
<P>
   unwanted conceptions and allow those which do happen to be
</P>
<P>
   ended by a woman without surgical intervention and without
</P>
<P>
   making her way through a wall of jeering pickets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it is not wise to step up the level of intensity in a
</P>
<P>
   dispute for which there is no outcome that will satisfy
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   There are stories from Richmond indicating Virginia may follow
</P>
<P>
   Florida's venture in reproductive sloganeering, and I don't
think
</P>
<P>
   this is something for which we will get much credit by setting
an
</P>
<P>
   example.

GUIDE DOG DROPOUT LANDS ON HIS FEET

 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's been employed by the Australian Protective Services three
months now, prowling the terminals of Sydney International Airport
searching for hidden firearms and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   His partner says he's a solid, earnest worker. And he'll be part
of the security force deployed next year to ensure the safety of
athletes and officials who will be arriving in the city for the
2000 Olympic summer games.
</P>
<P>
   He is Ocoee, a high-spirited 3-year-old black Labrador Retriever
who understands the angst of trying to find the right career.
</P>
<P>
   Born at the Guiding Eyes for the Blind's 30-acre breeding and
placement center in Patterson, N.Y., Ocoee was bred for specific
purpose of becoming a guide dog.
</P>
<P>
   But, like a Marine who washes out of basic training, he flunked
out of his first career. When the crucial moment came, at a test
for guide-dog certification, Ocoee cowered and slunk away, as the
family who adopted him brushed back tears.
</P>
<P>
   After a second, failed attempt at serving as a pet for a family
with an autistic son, Ocoee caught on with the US State
Department's anti-terrorism team, and it was the start of a
brilliant career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is doing very well,'' assures Doug Andrew, his partner,
housemate and senior canine detection trainer for the Australian
Protective Services, which is similar to the US Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``He still is playful.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocoee's triumph, after striving for success, may be dramatic
enough to warm the heart of any yuppie, but it carries special
meaning for the Norfolk, Mass. family that raised him, then let him
go after his dismal failure on the guide-dog proving ground.
</P>
<P>
   Aislynn Rodeghiero, a sophomore at the Rivers School in Weston,
Mass. three years ago, spent six months persuading her family to
help train a Guiding Eye puppy, to allow her to meet her school's
30-hour community service requirement.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 months, the Rodegheiros were responsible for raising
Ocoee in a safe and loving environment, teaching him obedience and
manners, and laying the basic foundation he would need for
guide-dog school.
</P>
<P>
   That meant frequently consulting an 81-page manual and calling
Guiding Eyes with questions. It also meant exposing him to a
variety of social environments: the Meadowbrook School in Weston,
Mass., where Linda teaches music, to weekly ``socialization''
classes in Kingston, Mass., and outings to malls, supermarkets and
busy city streets.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rodegheiros were prohibited from preparing Ocoee for his
biggest challenge: a half-hour temperament test he would have to
pass for admission to guide-dog training school.
</P>
<P>
   When that time came, the Rodegheiros personally delivered him to
the Guiding Eyes training center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. As she
and her parents drove away in tears, Aislynn says, she looked back
and saw Ocoee, looking bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, really hard,'' she says. ``He was looking around
as if to say `What do I do now?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ocoee breezed through the obedience exercises, and barely
flinched when they fired gunshots to see if he'd panic. But when a
large umbrella suddenly sprung open in front of him, he cowered and
slinked away, flunking the test.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Gressle, a puppy evaluator at Guiding Eyes, said
confidence in a guide dog is crucial ``because they can't always
count on the person they are being teamed with being in the know.
The person . . . can't see what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rodegheiros took the news of Ocoee's failure hard, but
Gressle notes nearly half of the 520 puppies raised each year by
Guiding Eyes volunteers fail the test.
</P>
<P>
   Aislynn admits she wanted to adopt Ocoee, but talked it over
with her parents. They convinced her to see if he might have
another calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised him as a family and we made the decision as a family
to see how far he could go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ocohee was sent back to Guiding Eyes, his tail between his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Guiding Eyes placed Ocoee with a family that has an autistic
son, but he was returned within a week after he tore through the
garbage and accidentally knocked over the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad idea,'' said Kathy Kraft, director of Guiding
Eyes' adoption program. ``He's a big dog, 85 pounds, and very
exuberant. He was jumping on counters and stealing food. He wanted
a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it made him unsuitable as a special needs dog, those same
qualities made Ocoee a hit with a scout for the US Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the bureau picks about two dozen dogs from Guiding
Eyes for training to detect explosives. Those dogs are then sent to
work abroad under a State Department anti-terrorism program.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Australian Protective Services was included in
that program, and Andrews personally selected Ocoee as his partner.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodegheiros, who keep a framed portrait of Ocoee in their
living room, remain attached to him. They saved his baby teeth,
quarterly puppy evaluations, collars, and toys as mementos, and
brought him $100 worth of his favorite treats when he graduated
from the ATF training center in Front Royal, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to see the cycle finish,'' says Aislynn. ``As
much as I wanted to keep him, I know he's over there for a
purpose.''

FRIEND FONDLY REMEMBERS SPRINGFIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She was constantly late, rarely sure of her talent
and never realized just how much loyalty she inspired, says Fred
Perry, the late Dusty Springfield's lighting designer and pal for
22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Perry joined Springfield's organization in 1964 as ``I Only Want
to Be With You'' was rising in the pop charts on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I met with her, she was terribly glamorous,''
said Perry, a longtime Burbank resident. ``We talked about
everything but the lighting, and we clicked. That was the start of
a long and beautiful friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Springfield died March 2 at age 59 after a long battle with
cancer. Perry returned to Britain this week to attend today's
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was always late,'' Perry recalled. ``She would arrive on
stage at the precise moment the orchestra would strike up. Once
after missing the tour bus, she'd hired a car and driver. They're
driving across the moors, and they see this yellow and brown bus
with instruments and costumes showing through the back window. So
she follows alongside, stops the bus to get on, and it turns out to
be Cilla Black and an entirely different tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Springfield retained her popularity at home and abroad because
listeners could identify with the emotions of songs like ``You
Don't Have to Say You Love Me,'' ``The Look of Love'' and
``Son-of-a Preacher Man,'' Perry believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she never thought she was any good,'' Perry said. ``She
was very shy, very closed, and you really had to be in her
confidence to get to know her well. She was very vulnerable and
never realized the loyalty she inspired in people.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry last saw Springfield, who spent about 15 years in Los
Angeles, about six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just very upsetting,'' he said. ``She was a wonderful
lady.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A life in Fulson: We were sad to hear of the death of West Coast
bluesman Lowell Fulson last weekend. Fulson, 77, died of heart
disease at his Lancaster, Calif., home.
</P>
<P>
   Best-known for his oft-covered hit ``Reconsider Baby,'' cut in
Dallas with David ``Fathead'' Newman on tenor sax and later
recorded by Elvis Presley, guitarist-singer Fulson was a mainstay
of Los Angeles' Central Avenue postwar music scene of the late '40s
and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   He also co-wrote ``Tramp,'' which was a hit on Stax Records for
Otis Redding and Carla Thomas. In 1993, Fulson received five W.C.
Handy Awards. &QL;

BROWSERS ANONYMOUS

 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, Hiawatha Bray is my real name, though some refuse to
believe it. I've had people compliment me on dreaming up such a
splendid pen name, one that makes me sound mysterious and exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm about as exotic as the south side of Chicago. And
being named Hiawatha Bray can have its disadvantages for an
Internet journalist. When I post a message on the Internet's Usenet
bulletin board system, seeking tips on how to beat a computer game,
I sometimes get replies like this: ``Are you THAT Hiawatha Bray?
Your column stinks. Get a clue! P.S. Love your nickname.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see why I sometimes post Usenet messages anonymously.
The ability to communicate across the world without having to
identify yourself is one of the Internet's most attractive
features. It's also proving to be one of its most troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymity is often the enemy of clear communications. For one
thing, it liberates people to engage in rude on-line ``flame
wars,'' secure in the knowledge that their vulgarity won't earn
them the black eyes and busted lips they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Others use their anonymity to spread information that's just not
true, or information that was supposed to remain confidential.
Lately certain aggrieved parties have fought back through the
courts, thereby demonstrating how flimsy Internet anonymity can be.
</P>
<P>
   In our own back yard, Raytheon Co. is suing 21 employees for
disclosing company data in a message board run by the Yahoo
Internet service. Trouble is, Raytheon doesn't know who the
employees are. So it's gone to court to subpoena their identities
from Yahoo. If the subpoena is issued, Yahoo says it will comply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in no way trying to harm freedom of expression,'' says
Raytheon spokesman Dave Polk. ``We're trying to protect proprietary
information.'' But civil libertarians fret about a chilling effect
on Internet free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, Georgetown University law professor and
executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
notes that courts have upheld the right of political activists to
preserve their anonymity. But companies like Yahoo that provide you
with Internet services usually require that you identify yourself,
and the courts say that this personal data can be subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to complain about this. I have no patience with people
who give away company secrets or spread hurtful lies on the
Internet, then cower behind the shield of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   And yet anonymity can be a godsend for the battered spouse
looking for help, the corporate whistle-blower, the journalist
looking for tips. If cases like Raytheon's continue to mount, will
any on-line anonymity be left to us?
</P>
<P>
   Just a bit. E-mail offers some hope of secrecy, through
``anonymous remailers'' that route e-mail through several
computers, making it very hard to trace. But because of the
complicated path your message takes, it can take hours or days for
a remailed message to arrive. In addition, you can't use remailers
to post Usenet messages without a fair amount of technical
knowledge and a good deal of work.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are Internet discussion sites that don't care who you
are, and don't collect any personal info, not even your real name.
There are places like the geek hangout Slashdot
(http://www.slashdot.org), where you can publish criticisms of the
latest technologies under the generic nickname ``Anonymous
Coward.'' Or consider Free Republic (http://freerepublic.com), a
rambunctious conservative Web site that welcomes anonymous insults
of liberals in general and President Clinton in particular.
</P>
<P>
   There are many such places on-line, but all in the minor
leagues. Major providers of free e-mail like Yahoo collect
information about you, if only to sell you something. I use one of
these free accounts to post my ``anonymous'' Usenet messages, but
I'm not anonymous to the company that provides the service. I'd
better watch what I say about Raytheon.
</P>
<P>
   These secret Web accounts are about as anonymous as license
plates: Civilians can't read them, but techies and cops sure can.
But they do offer some protection from unwanted junk mail, as well
as a chance to dream up a clever new name for yourself _ a severe
challenge for me. How do you top Hiawatha?

DEAR CALEB, EVERY WORD COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My beloved Caleb,
</P>
<P>
   What a comical kid you're becoming! You have grown in so many
ways this past year, but the change that tickles me most is the
appearance of your sense of humor. Where did it come from? All on
your own, you've turned into a little joker. When I call your name
_ ``Caleb, come here, please!'' _ you run and hide, then burst out
laughing when I find you. When I dress you in the morning and we
get to your socks, I ask for your foot and you stick out your
hands. Lately you've perfected a new shtick: You open the cupboard
under the sink, pull out the dishpan, and put it on your head.
Mommy cracks up every time she sees it.
</P>
<P>
   How did you figure out that some things are funny? For that
matter, how do you decide when an old joke has gone flat? A year
ago, the words ``splish-splash'' sent you into a giggling fit. Now
that you've reached the ripe age of 2, it takes more than that to
amuse you. What will you be like when you're 22? If you take after
me, you'll be reciting Monty Python skits from memory. If you take
after your mother, you'll be laughing at ``Dilbert.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why you aren't speaking yet, but you certainly
aren't having trouble building up your vocabulary. You are forever
pointing imperiously to objects around the house, demanding to know
what they're called. ``Radiator!'' we say. ``Window!''
``Bookcase!'' ``Plant!'' ``Another plant!'' Sometimes I'm the one
doing the quizzing. ``Where are the snaps?'' I ask as we put on
your onesie, and you grab the fasteners on the bottom. ``Where's
your belly button?'' _ and you pull up your shirt to show me.
``Where's Jemima?'' _ and you run to the cat.
</P>
<P>
   It pleases me to watch you learn so many words, but more
gratifying by far is how attached you've become to your books. You
are growing up in a home without television, and so you have
absorbed next to nothing about the rituals of TV-watching. But our
house is chock-a-block with books, and the rituals of reading are
already becoming second nature to you.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen times a day you pull a book from your shelf and
march over to the nearest parent, waving it aloft. You've got us
well-trained, Caleb: As often as not, we stop what we're doing,
snuggle with you on the couch, and begin reading ``The Little Red
Hen'' (or ``Are You My Mother?'' or ``Curious George Rides a
Bicycle''). By now you are so familiar with each book _ you must
have 20 _ that no matter which one we're reading, we can count on
you to turn the page at the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   But even I didn't realize just how aware you are of each
individual title and its contents until a few days ago. We were in
the kitchen looking out at the snowstorm, and I said
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I know it is wet
</P>
<P>
   and the sun is not sunny.
</P>
<P>
   but we can have
</P>
<P>
   lots of good fun that is funny
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL; 
and you immediately ran to the living room and pulled ``The Cat in
the Hat'' off the bookshelf. Exactly right! That's the book I was
quoting.
</P>
<P>
   As I say, it perplexes me that you still aren't talking. But
it's not an entirely bad thing. After all, you have never yet told
a lie. You have never yet used a bad word. You have never yet
uttered an insult or hurt anyone's feelings. You have never yet
spread malicious gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Once you start talking, you'll feel the urge almost daily to
engage in one or another of these forms of wrongful speech. And _
trust me on this, Caleb _ it's an urge fiendishly difficult to
resist. But resist you must, and part of my job is to help you
learn how. Our tradition places so much emphasis on the importance
of avoiding malignant talk. ``Who is the man who desires life, and
yearns for many days to enjoy good?'' asks King David in the 34th
Psalm. ``Then guard your tongue from evil and your lips from
speaking lies.''
</P>
<P>
   I know that nothing will influence the words that come out of
your mouth than the words that come out of your parents' mouths. So
we are careful about what we say and how we talk in your presence.
The Talmud teaches, ``What a child says in the street is the words
of his father or mother.'' Eventually you will meet people, maybe
even other kids, who resort to crude language or cutting putdowns
when they don't get their way. I cannot shield you from such speech
forever, but I can try to make sure you never hear it at home.
</P>
<P>
   When I was little, my mother would tell me that every person is
born with a fixed quota of words, and when you've used up your
allotment, you stop speaking. Her motive, I suspect, was to hush me
up _ I used to be quite a chatterbox.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a deeper meaning to your grandmother's remark. A
story is told about a Hasidic (itals)rebbe(unitals who taught that
everything that exists in the world has a lesson for mankind. One
disciple, sure the (itals)rebbe(unitals) was exaggerating, asked,
``And what lesson do we learn from a train?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That for being one minute late,'' the master replied, ``you
can lose everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And from the telegraph?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That you pay for every word.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the telephone?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That what you say (itals)here(unitals), is heard
(itals)there(unitals).''
</P>
<P>
   Never forget, Caleb: Every word counts. And never forget: There
is One who hears everything you say.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, I'm not rushing you. When you're ready to start
talking, you'll start talking. For now, it contents me to see how
happy you are. Your days are filled with delight and laughter. May
your life be that way always.

NEW CARTOON SERIES ARE TRULY INTERACTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   See the kitty with the goo-goo eyes. So precious. So cuddly. So
annoying. Are you tired of the kitty-cat's peepers? No problem.
Just click a button and they disappear. Click again and replace
them with snake eyes or Picasso-like, cubist orbs.
</P>
<P>
   This is a cartoon lover's dream, an animated feature where the
viewer actually gets to change the characters' features and to
determine the plot. It's genuine interactivity, the future of
animated entertainment, and it's happening now at a few sites on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The cute kitty, for instance, is in a new series of experimental
toons recently launched by Cartoon Network Online, the web site of
Ted Turner's cable network. The network, which is at
http://cartoonnetwork.com, didn't go for the obvious by retooling
old classics. Instead, it recruited two underground artists _ Gary
Panter, the maestro of punk and designer of ``Pee-Wee's
Playhouse,'' and Mark Newgarden, creator of the notorious ``Garbage
Pail Kids'' trading cards. Panter came up with a series called
``The Pink Donkey and the Fly,'' a surprisingly sweet toon about a
braying animal who gets into trouble like Eve in the Garden of
Eden.
</P>
<P>
   Newgarden's creation, on the other hand, is deliciously warped.
It's called ``B. Happy,'' a series about a foul fowl who is
anything but joyous. This blue bird of unhappiness encounters that
cute little kitty and crazy things happen. Newgarden introduces the
fabulous Click-a-Rama feature, where viewers get to make all sorts
of amusing choices. There are plenty of on-line jokes built into
the feature; without spoiling the fun, let's just say there are
times when the program seems to malfunction, sort of like real
life. The cantankerous bird also does a high-tech version of what
theater folks call tearing down the fourth wall: The big blue bird
bangs on the screen, mouthing off at all those computer geeks on
the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that `B. Happy' is similar to me in my fouler
moods,'' Newgarden says quite cheerfully during a telephone chat.
``Let's say I'm going for a satiric bent.'' Newgarden is just like
all the rest of us when it comes to ``interactivity'' on the Net.
He knows that nine times out of ten, when you are urged to click a
button on the Internet, you're offered a ``hot'' opportunity to buy
some unique (read: useless) product or subscribe to some innovative
(read: expensive) service. He parodies that in his on-line toon.
</P>
<P>
   Interactivity, of course, is the buzzword of the moment in the
constantly morphing Internet entertainment industry. Newgarden has
big dreams for the future: ``I see a time when shows are implanted
in everyone's brain on a small chip; do away with television, do
away with the computer and go directly to the middle of the head.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, animation is clearly way ahead of video when it
comes to entertainment on the Net. Streaming video _ which might
better be called screaming video _ is an overhyped technology. It
takes forever to download, and then you have to squint at grainy
images on a teen-tiny screen about 2 1/2 inches wide. Thanks to a
technology called Macromedia Flash, animation is fast, and the
resolution is crisp.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me about streaming video is that it's trying to
hammer one medium into the other, trying to make the computer look
like television,'' says Peter Girardi, creative director of Funny
Garbage, the web design firm that produced the Cartoon Network
series.
</P>
<P>
   These web features aren't like your typical Saturday morning
toons. That doesn't mean the folks at the Cartoon Network wouldn't
like to spin one of the new characters off in television land.
``The Internet is like the Neilsen ratings on steroids,'' says Sam
Register, vice president of Cartoon Network Online. ``People
respond quickly, and you get really great feedback. It would be
great if we found our next new hit character on-line.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartoon Network isn't the only outfit experimenting in
interactive animation: In 1997, John Kricfalusi, the creator of the
``Ren and Stimpy Show'' who was booted by Nickelodeon honchos for
being too outrageous, launched his own animated web series at
spumco.com. It features George Liquor, a red-blooded American who
swears a blue streak while he's taking care of his nitwit nephew.
It's like ``South Park'' fueled by grain alcohol _ crude, lewd and
bitingly funny. It's also honest about its commercial ventures: Its
advertisements are built into the content of the show, a technique
that is shamelessly refreshing. Hey, everybody wants to make money
out of the Internet, so why not just be honest about it? Honesty is
what drives Newgarden and his character, B. Happy. A lot of
so-called ``interactive'' content is pretty canned; Newgarden toys
around with that notion in his series. ``When I was a kid, I had
this play telephone,'' Newgarden says. ``You would push a button
and Mickey Mouse would say `Hi.' I'd say `Hi' back and Mickey Mouse
wouldn't respond. It felt like a cheat. The interaction has to be
framed in a way so it doesn't seem like a cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   I certainly didn't feel cheated when I made the cute kitty's
eyes go bye-bye or when B. Happy banged on the screen, shouting,
``You double crossed me, computer geek!'' The next episode will be
on-line Monday. This geek is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of tunes, there's a new comprehensive site at
http://www.tunes.com (formerly www.jamtv.com). This ``music hub''
provides an astonishing compilation of audio and video clips, as
well as access to the archives of Rolling Stone, The Source, and
Down Beat. yes, you can buy music, too, through links to e-commerce
sites.

TULIPS SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF SPRING AND ITS RENEWAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tulips have a lot to say. They speak to us of the fullness of
spring, of private, individual glory and public ostentation in vast
numbers, of greed and human foible, and always of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Garden
</P>
<P>
   Pathways
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, they speak with quite a voice. The city plants 30,000
each year, 26,000 in alternating beds along the pathway in the
Public Garden from Arlington to Charles streets and 4,000 in front
of the visitors information center in the Common.
</P>
<P>
   These are classic public displays, usually in peak about
mid-April. The city plants seven kinds, mostly rugged Darwin
hybrids: ``Pink Impression,'' ``Elizabeth Arden,'' ``Jewel of
Spring,'' ``Apeldoorn''s Elite,'' ``White Emperor,'' ``Gordon
Cooper,'' and ``Diplomat.''
</P>
<P>
   After blooming, they are yanked to make way for bedding annuals
and shipped to a compost heap on MDC land. According to John
Slater, superintendent of the city greenhouse, city workers used to
dig them, store and dry them, then distribute them to the public,
but Boston Parks and Recreation no longer has the time and money to
do that. (After all, they do set out 150,000 bedding plants, and
that is after growing them in the first place.)
</P>
<P>
   In Marshfield, in my garden, tulips speak more softly. The
``Angelique'' double-petaled tulips (a wonderful soft pink)
whisper, ``Transplant us, you fool, because we're lost in that
shrub border you had to have.'' The red tulips (I have lost track
of what they are, but they may be ``Red Riding Hood,'' a brilliant,
long-lived Greigii) along the property line tell me I was smart to
plant them extra deep, as they have been reliable for 10 years now.
</P>
<P>
   The multiflowering ``Toronto'' tulips (a pleasing clump of
salmon) politely suggest the potential of tulips I have failed to
adequately pursue. And the dozens of carefree 4-inch-tall yellow
Tulipa dasystemons tell me I did all right in choosing these hardy
species tulips to carpet the dry yellow bed.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, the first chat of the year with tulips comes at
the New England Spring Flower Show, where easily forced bulbs
always shout the cheerful news that spring is nigh.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's show, there will be another tulip voice, Anna
Pavord, gardening correspondent of Britain's Independent and
featured speaker at the show March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Pavord is the author of ``The Tulip,'' a painstaking 400-page
labor of love _ ``It was written entirely for me,'' she told me _
that she spent six years researching. She planted 2,500 in her own
garden last fall; she feels tulips are the flowers to give at
Valentine's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never know whom we're going to fall in love with,'' she
said, explaining her fascination with tulips and citing their
subtlety and versatility. ``They can do so many tricks, such a
staggering combination of colors.''
</P>
<P>
   And in staggering detail, ``The Tulip'' _ more a history than a
so-called garden book _ tells the tale over the centuries of a
flower that now comes in 120 species and 5,600 cultivars. They are
not native to western Europe (or the New World), arriving from the
East in the mid-1500s. Wherever they went, they created a
sensation, or, rather, people did.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, long, thin, pointed petals, a spidery effect, were
prized. Tulips were collected for the gardens of sultans and
portrayed in tile and on dishes. In the West, the English florists
(not flower sellers, but aficionados and growers of particular
flowers) valued tulips in a half-sphere, and tulips also were
well-portrayed in art, perhaps even more so because there was a
time when a painting of tulips was cheaper to purchase than the
bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   French tulip madness came first. In the early 17th century, one
grower exchanged a single bulb for a brewery worth 30,000 francs. A
miller traded a mill for a bulb of ``Mere Brune.''
</P>
<P>
   The famous Dutch tulipomania followed closely, then launched
itself to a new level, pure speculation for profit, not beauty. It
got entirely out of control, and it all came crashing down, of
course, and prices went into pretty much of a permanent recession.
But for a while, ``Semper Augustus'' sold for 1,000 florins a bulb,
more than six times the average annual income, and a price of
13,000 florins (more than the cost of a mansion) was quoted at the
height of the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Tulip madness struck again, this time in, of all places, Turkey,
where the things grow wild. The Tulip Era peaked under Sultan Ahmed
III, who imported millions of tulip bulbs from Holland and spent
fortunes on extravagant tulip festivals. His 1730 overthrow
resulted.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, too, went a little crazy. Florists' societies
flourished and held feasts with bouts of drinking and eating and
bulb showing and trading.
</P>
<P>
   These evolved into shows, and, Pavord wrote, ``between 1750 and
1850, scarcely any town of importance in the north of England was
without its tulip show.''
</P>
<P>
   The great tulips were those that had ``broken,'' flowers that
arose one color one year and the next had multi-colored flames and
feathers. This was almost magical, and many recipes for it existed,
but in reality it was the result of a virus, which weakened but did
not kill the tulips, transmitted by aphids. Once a prized broken
tulip was selected, it could be reproduced exactly through the
bulb's offsets. This took time and labor and contributed to the
price, but with enough time and trouble, prices would and did fall,
along with the fortunes of speculators and collectors alike.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons, fashion being a big one, tulips
declined in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the great broken tulips are lost. (Growers want flames
and feathers but without virus.) Also, Pavord lamented, ``all those
wonderful Ottoman tulips are all gone.'' Istanbul is full of tulips
all right, but they're Dutch. Of the British tulip societies, only
one survives, and hereabouts you cannot find a tulip society,
though irises and day lilies and roses have organized worship.
Pavord's book tells us all this history, then concludes with
rundowns on the species and hybrids. The book is packed with
gorgeous color reproductions of rare tulip art, the closest you or
I will ever get to ``Semper Augustus'' or ``Louis XVI.''
</P>
<P>
   The tulip, once a ``jewel flower'' worn in hats and hair,
remains a potent flower of color and shape. ``I think we might be
on the verge of a revival,'' Pavord said.

MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS: HOW TO GET PAST THE SLAMMED DOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What Diane Aronson remembers most about her daughter Rachal's
preteen years is what a struggle they were. ``Often, I felt a very
deep, personal despair,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Rachal remembers being happiest when she shut herself in her
bedroom, with her mother on the other side of the door. ``Sometimes
I was so angry, I hated her,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this is a classic story of mother-daughter
conflict: stormy fights, shut doors, hurtful barbs. Yet it is also
a success story. Rachal, now 22, lives back home in Arlington,
Mass. with her parents and considers her mom a good friend. Last
week they went to Arizona together, just the two of them.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a mom who simply got lucky. Diane Aronson worked
hard. Her goal _ to respect Rachal's need for privacy but to also
stay connected _ seemed contradictory and downright impossible at
times. But it put her on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   Parents typically see the ages of 11 to 14 as a time when a
daughter's task is to separate and a mother's is to back off. But
researchers say that leads to a disconnect; a girl feels deserted
by her mother. They urge mothers to see this instead as a time of
change and renegotiation. Then daughters are more likely to feel
supported, and connections less likely to be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake to see this as `I'm losing my daughter.' That
prompts you to withdraw and causes real separation. Think of the
relationship as still intense, just different,'' says researcher
and psychologist Judith Jordan of the Stone Center at Wellesley
College. She specializes in the psychology of girls and women.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it is difficult. Instead of telling you secrets and
leaving hearts on your pillow, your daughter is sending mixed
messages, from ``Stay out of my life!'' to ``Will you make me
macaroni and cheese? No one does it as good as you, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder mothers are confused.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in spite of their insistence at wanting distance, daughters
are confused, too. ``They are dying not to need you but the truth
is they do, so they get angry at themselves. That results in the
mixed messages,'' says psychologist Roni Cohen-Sandler, coauthor of
a new book, ``I'm Not Mad, I Just Hate You: A New Understanding of
Mother-Daughter Conflict'' (Viking).
</P>
<P>
   She says girls have a tremendous need to vent. Cognitive,
social, emotional, and physical changes cause girls enormous
stress, and, she adds, ``The hormonal surge of puberty leads to
less impulse control than they had at 8 or 9.''
</P>
<P>
   That Mom takes the brunt of this intensity and not Dad is
probably because her mother is the person a daughter feels safest
with. Most mothers recognize this for the backanded compliment it
is and can take the intensity when it's directed at peers, or
teachers, or issues in general. It's harder to take when you're the
focus of the intensity:
</P>
<P>
   You come downstairs in the morning dressed for work, your
12-year-old slowly looks you over from head to toe, then asks,
``You're not leaving the house like that, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   As mean as this sounds, it has more to do with
self-consciousness about her own appearance than anything else. The
more you can ignore it, the better. Even tougher to take, however,
is criticism of you as a person.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Rogers, a psychologist at the Harvard Graduate School of
Education who specializes in girls' development, tells of one
13-year-old who overheard an argument between her parents and told
her mother, ``He crushed you like an aluminum can.''
</P>
<P>
   This hurts to the quick, but so can your response hurt her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, mothers have encouraged girls to voice their
feelings. But when a girl turns her newfound observational
abilities on her mother's inner world, it's disturbing,'' says
Rogers. The typical mother responds in icy self-defense: ``This is
between me and your father; it's not your business.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter is stunned. Why has Mom shut her down, closed her
out? ``Daughters feel deserted when mothers don't speak honestly
about their own lives,'' says psychologist Janet Surrey, codirector
of the Gender Relations Project at the Stone Center at Wellesley.
</P>
<P>
   A daughter is also confused, says Jordan: ``She's looking at
what it means to be an adult woman and she may not like the model
her mother presents.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a betrayed and angry mother and a betrayed and angry
daughter. Nasty, vindictive words are shouted, doors slammed,
relationships damaged.
</P>
<P>
   This is not inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can be authentic in your feelings, you can mitigate
conflict,'' says Rogers. Don't overdo, however. A good response
might be, ``You're right, that's a part of my relationship with
your father that I struggle with. I'm working on it.'' But don't
seek her advice or burden her with details.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even in the heat of angry moments, Diane Aronson never took
anything personally. ``I just didn't let myself,'' she says.
Cohen-Sandler applauds that strength. ``I tell mothers to take even
the meanest, most hateful thing a daughter says and translate it to
this: ``I'm upset right now and it may have nothing to do with you,
but I don't have words or thoughts for it, so it's coming out as
anger toward you.' '' Consider, she adds, that your daughter simply
can't help herself.
</P>
<P>
   She also suggests ways to keep arguments from escalating:
</P>
<P>
   --Stay focused. A 12-year-old can twist even the most
straightforward comment. Tell her, ``We're getting sidetracked
here. What I really need is help setting the table.''
</P>
<P>
   --Monitor the level of anger. When it's spiraling out of control
(it's a red flag if you're saying mean things to her), tell her,
``You know what? We're both too angry to continue. Let's take a
break and talk when we're calmer.''
</P>
<P>
   --Comment on feelings. A 13-year-old can get furious if you
misstate the tiniest fact of a complicated story, so don't bother
with them. Instead of saying, ``What did she say to you?'' try,
``That must have made you feel awful.''
</P>
<P>
   --Set limits on abusiveness. It's one thing to let her vent,
another to allow her to abuse you. Say, ``I'm happy to listen to
you but I can't do it until you stop calling me names.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most of all, don't consider the slammed door the end of
a discussion. ``It can mean anything from, `I had a bad day; leave
me alone,' to `I'm in trouble; come get me,' '' says Cohen-Sandler.
Rogers tells mothers to put this spin on a slammed door: ``Don't
give up on me!''
</P>
<P>
   ``A teenager slamming a door really wants you out of her face,''
she says. ``But a preteen wants you to notice something is wrong,
and what's wrong for her is being at an impasse with her mother. It
doesn't feel good to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Tread gently, though: Knock lightly on the door and say
something like, ``I just want you to know I'm here; I care. We can
talk if you want.'' That way, says Jordan, ``you open the
(figurative) door to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   When and if she walks in, validate her feelings: ``I know there
are a lot of pressures in your life right now.'' That alone is a
signal of respect that she will appreciate. Follow it up with, ``I
want to help, but I'm not sure how.''
</P>
<P>
   For many mothers, this process is hampered by their own fear of
conflict. ``There's a tendency to see it as destructive,'' says
Cohen-Sandler. But it's more destructive if a girl doesn't get the
anger out. ``They turn it inward and it leads to things like eating
disorders and depression,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan tells mothers that allowing the conflict to exist in an
appropriate way in the relationship is a critical learning model
for girls. ``They need to see they can handle conflict and not lose
the relationship,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   During the most difficult times, mothers need someone to talk
to. Aronson had her husband, but she also had the support of a
close friend who, happy coincidence for her, happened to be Janet
Surrey, the Stone Center researcher. ``Sometimes just being able to
say out loud what I was feeling was all I needed,'' Aronson says.
``It also helped that Jan could keep me focused on the big picture
_ keeping the connections alive _ rather than on all the little
disconnects.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly she did that. Rachal is not only a confident young
woman, but one who talks about her mother with respect and love.
When she looks back on those years, even though she remembers her
own anger and hate, she also talks about understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom never held a grudge,'' she says. ``When I was ready to
make up or to talk, she would be, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --When you tell her, ``Don't talk to me that way!'' she feels
misunderstood and controlled. Try instead, ``It's OK to be angry
with me, but not to voice it in such a hurtful way.'' Or lighten it
up by saying, ``Phew, that hurt,'' and move on.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't talk too much about your own preteen years. A
12-to14-year-old is too self-absorbed to imagine it's relevant.
</P>
<P>
   --What never to say: ``I know you're upset; it won't last.''
</P>
<P>
   --Most preteens shrink from public affection. Follow your
daughter's lead but don't be the first to withdraw. Keep in mind,
too, that she may still be OK about affection in private. Show
respect by asking first: ``I'm in the mood for a hug. Are you?''
</P>
<P>
   --Many girls are proud of their mothers. That doesn't mean
she'll tell you so or that she won't find something to criticize
you about. You might get less intensity, though.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ During cold weather, don't decide your infant
isn't warm enough by feeling her hands and feet. A baby's
extremities are normally cold. Feel around her belly instead.
</P>

THE WESTERN IS BACK IN THE SADDLE, AND WHAT A RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Kid and The Big Hunt: Unabridged Stories from The Tonto
Woman and other Western Stories,'' by Elmore Leonard; read by Brian
Dennehy and Liev Schrieber; approximately 90 minutes; Simon &AMP;
Schuster Audio; $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who enjoys the talented Leonard probably knows that he
began his prolific-writing odyssey with westerns. More than three
decades before ``Get Shorty'' and other best-sellers, Leonard was
an accomplished writer of such classics as ``Hombre.''
</P>
<P>
   A Leonard-the-western-writer revival is taking place, and this
isn't a bad thing at all. These stories don't showcase his gift for
dialogue, but his lean and economic prose is evident, as is his
compassion for the people and places being written about.
</P>
<P>
   In both ``The Kid'' and ``The Big Hunt,'' men with resolve tough
their way through trying times. These aren't larger-than-life
creations, either. They are determined men of character, taking
their lumps but never losing their focus.
</P>
<P>
   The acclaimed horse trilogy by Cormac McCarthy did not breath
new life into the western genre, but it's possible the re-release
of Leonard's earliest works (1950s and early '60s) just might. They
are accessible stories that, once started, compel the listener to
take them to their conclusion.

</P>
<P>
   ``8.4,'' by Peter Hernon; read by Campbell Scott; abridged,
approximately 4.5 hours; Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio; $24.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to the Richter scale, which may tell you all
you want to know about Hernon's second suspense novel in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   An explosive fault line has come alive in America's heartland,
near the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. It has
erupted once, killing tens of thousands, and appears likely to
break loose at least one more time, much like the series of
earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 that devastated large portions of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   John Atkins and Elizabeth Holleran, seismologists who previously
did not know each other, discover love as they search for answers
to the trembling fault line's potential. We're not sure why she
finds him attractive. At the same time, there are devious men among
them, some working for the U.S. Geological Survey, who for reasons
that never become clear are undermining their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Hernon, a reporter with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, should be
ready to quit his day job, thanks to ``8.4.'' NBC has purchased the
rights to turn it into a movie, and the book indeed has all the
makings of a big- or small-screen thriller. Which doesn't mean this
isn't a flawed work, despite the rumbling action.
</P>
<P>
   Hernon clearly knows science better than he knows character or
plot development. As a result, ``8.4'' in fact fails to register on
a literary scale.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunter,'' by James Byron Huggins; read by Boyd Gaines;
abridged, approximately 4.5 hours; Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio; $23.
</P>
<P>
   There is a comic-book quality to Huggins' latest thriller. The
protagonist, Hunter, the world's best tracker who has a massive
wolf as his loyal companion, is, if possible, more unbelievable
than Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan. We don't know how Hunter came to
be such an amazing tracker, nor do we learn the origins of his
amazing physical strength. He just is, and he seems not a whit
real.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is asked to assist a team of elite Army troops as they
search for a beast loose somewhere north of the Arctic Circle. The
beast is in fact a monster, created by a secret government agency.
The beast is hellbent on brutally killing and devouring every
person it encounters. It's not an exaggeration to say this creature
is every bit as believable as Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins pulled off an almost first-rate techo-thriller in 1997
with ``Cain,'' but ``Hunter'' misses the mark. Even a superb
reading by the always reliable Boyd Gaines can't keep ``Hunter'' on
track.

<P>
   The table is set with starched linens, freshly polished silver,
and hand-washed crystal and china. When the candles are lighted,
the three-or-four-times-a-year ritual begins _ the family holiday
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   All the participants take their places at the table, unwrap
their embroidered linen napkins, and pass the plates piled with
food.
</P>
<P>
   The hostess holds her breath.
</P>
<P>
   Will Uncle Charlie, who has never met a glass of wine he didn't
enjoy, once again send a plate crashing to the floor? Will he put
yet another mortal dent in Grandma's original set of 14 place
settings, in a pattern that was discontinued 40 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   The hostess can relax. Whatever Uncle Charlie does, a dirge is
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is a growing number of companies that specialize in
locating hard-to-find or discontinued china patterns. Aided by the
Internet, these firms work globally in tracking down a serving
dish, a teacup and saucer, or dinner and salad plates. There's only
one business in New England, but the others are easily reached by
phone, fax, or Internet.

   Owner Corinne Raymond has been in the antiques and tableware
business for 30 years. She now concentrates on discontinued china.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we no longer have a retail room, we have a warehouse
filled with merchandise,'' says Raymond in a phone conversation
from Florida, where she and her husband were on a buying trip.
``Anything we don't have in stock, we can get from our other
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of her customers want to replace a broken piece of china,
fill out a place setting, or add place settings. Some are looking
for a gift, such as the husband who wanted to give his wife two
place settings for Valentine's Day in a pattern they chose when
they married.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's very easy to find what the customer wants and
other times it's not,'' says Raymond. ``Last year a woman called
and wanted 14 place settings in a discontinued pattern. It took
awhile, but we found them. She was so appreciative, which makes
this business so enjoyable.''

Replacements Ltd. in Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   This is the granddaddy of replacement services and the largest
in the world. Founded in 1981 by Bob Page, Replacements has in
stock 83,000 china patterns from 2,286 manufacturers. The firm
draws from 1,000 suppliers nationally who regularly scout for
merchandise at flea markets, estate sales, and auctions. Sales rose
from $150,000 in 1984 to more than $64 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   As for the cost to the customer, prices vary and are based on
supply and demand, according to Mark Donahue, media placement
coordinator at Replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price varies because it depends on the pattern, how much
was manufactured, when it was discontinued, and how popular it
is,'' says Donahue. ``Most of our requests, 80 percent, are for
discontinued patterns. Prices for active patterns are competitive
with department stores, but ours are often cheaper because we buy
directly from the manufacturer. Plus, if a client just wants one
plate or one cup, we provide a single piece. Department stores sell
place settings,'' which include a dinner plate, salad plate, bread
and butter plate, and a teacup and saucer, ``not single pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most popular patterns, he says, are Desert Rose by
Franciscan and Rose Chintz by Johnson Brothers.

co-run by her daughter, Jennifer Marcell, has an inventory of more
than 2,000 patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't the biggest, but we're growing,'' says Marcell.
``And we know dishes backward and forward. Plus, we aren't just a
replacement business. We have a retail store, a bridal registry,
and help people mix and match their china over the phone.''
</P>

   She says mixing patterns has become popular in the past two
years, ever since Martha Stewart gave it the nod. And some young
people still want older patterns because of the designs and
workmanship.

   Audrey Rickard started her business 15 years ago when her
stepdaughter inherited her great-grandmother's china and needed
pieces to fill out the place settings. She found the sleuthing
interesting and now concentrates on English and American china.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the smaller replacement dealers are more
knowledgeable,'' says Rickard. ``I've spent a lot of time in the
library.''
</P>
<P>
   She says her customers fall into three categories: a grandmother
or mother looking for replacements of a missing piece or pieces to
fill out place settings for a wedding gift; someone looking for a
piece like one broken at a party; or people with growing families
looking for more place settings to accommodate holiday feasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most young people today are buying cheaper china in the chain
stores,'' says Rickard. ``When a plate chips, they throw it away.
They move around a lot, and things get broken in transit, so they
don't want to be bothered with heirlooms. And nowadays working
couples don't have time to entertain elaborately with china and
crystal _ it's easier to meet friends in a restaurant. And it's a
very different world from when the man bought the car and the
dishwasher, etc. and the woman's domain was the china and
crystal.''

   Owner Stacy Davidson started her business 21 years ago after
leaving her job as an executive in Macy's dinnerware department.
She says many of her customers bought one place setting per year
after they married, and when the time came to add the serving
pieces, the pattern had been discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus husbands are infamous for breakage,'' says Davidson.
``They'll call up hysterical trying to locate a plate or teacup
before they have to tell their wives. There's a lot of sentimental
value attached to dinnerware that's handed down from generation to
generation.''

   Her customers contact her from all over the country. She
recently found pieces in the same Lenox pattern for a woman on Park
Avenue and one in Kansas.

   ``People think they can make a quick dollar in this business but
it takes a lot of knowledge and you have to have a large inventory
if you're going to fill people's requests and get the merchandise
out the day of a request,'' says Ives.

 BOSTON: ... of STDs.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way Murphy, of Burlington, sees it, the numbers showing a
decline in the proportion of teenage boys having sex don't match
the world he lives in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't aware of circumstances in the past, but from what I
see I don't think there's been a decrease at all,'' he says. ``If
they can get it, they're going to do it. If a kid knows he can have
sex with his girlfriend, he's probably not going to turn her down.
Kids think it's better to be having sex than not to be having
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all of Murphy's incredulity, polls of young people's
attitudes show shifting mores. The title character in the WB
network's prime-time teen drama ``Dawson's Creek'' is not the only
guy who says ``I have no problem being a virgin.'' Ask college
freshmen if they think casual sex is OK, and more of them _ 46
percent of men and 72 percent of women _ say ``no'' than at any
point in the quarter century that the University of California has
been polling on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the number of young adults, 18 to 24, who tell the
University of Chicago's General Social Survey that premarital sex
is always or almost always wrong is rising. It's 25 percent of
young men, up from 16 percent in the early 1970s, and 30 percent of
young women, up from 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I had sex, it was with a girl I loved,'' says
one 18-year-old. ``It was two years with the same girl before we
had sex. We talked about it. It was a mutual thing. It was not
something we regretted afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like more of a relationship first. Then you know the person,
how they are and know how they act afterwards,'' says McCaskill,
the Roxbury 18-year-old. ``If I'm going out, I'm not going to go
too quick. I'm going to take my time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I'm choosing to save myself for my wife is it's
more like a gift,'' says Dolan, the Nahant 17-year-old. ``I want to
be completely in love with her so I'm making love, not having
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   If love has something to do with it, then so does God. ``I'm
part of the Catholic Church, and that's a sin, and I don't want to
disobey God,'' says Matthew Murphy, Ray's 15-year-old brother
</P>
<P>
   ``God is the No. 1 thing in my life,'' says 17-year-old David
Ruff of Stoneham, a member of a charismatic Christian church. ``He
helps me make the right choices. Some guys might say you're a man
if you have sex before marriage, but I think a real man is someone
who waits until after marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   For teens who are having intercourse, the big news is the rise
in condom use. The Urban Institute says sexually experienced
teenage boys are using condoms 69 percent of the times they have
intercourse, up from 56 percent in 1988. And 45 percent are using
condoms with each encounter, up from 33 percent. Black youths use
condoms 73 percent of the time, up from 63 percent in 1988, the
study says. White youths, registering the biggest boost, use them
70 percent of the time, up from 54 percent in 1988. The smallest
change is among Latino youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get no resistance when I talk about condoms,'' says Eugene
Jones, a case manager at Boston High School's health clinic.
``Whether they do it or not, they know they should be using it. The
old reason for not using it _ that it doesn't feel as good _ you
don't hear as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask 16-year-old Darryl Barnes of Dorchester about condoms and he
reaches for the pouch in his backpack that he says he carries with
him ``twenty-four seven,'' 24 hours a day, seven days a week. ``You
never know,'' he says. ``I just keep them on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Murphy's mother gave him condoms to carry in his wallet,
even though she doesn't know, and hasn't asked, if he's ever had
occasion to use them. Most of his friends, he says, carry condoms,
too. ``There was an incident in my school, and it came out that a
kid had sex without using a condom,'' Murphy says. ``He really got
ragged on. If you're going to do it, do it the right way. Kids have
gotten smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Murphy thinks little else has changed among teenage
boys, he says he's not looking for notches on the bedpost. ``I
think there should be some kind of commitment, but it's not stay
together forever. You don't have to be in love to have sex,'' he
says. ``And I think it's bad if you give yourself away a lot before
finding that one person to be in love with.''
</P>
<P>
   In Swampscott, Greg Racki and his girlfriend have talked about
sex. ``We decided we're not ready,'' he says. ``Just being unsure
of where that would lead us. Maybe fear of regret.''

`FRASIER' STAR PLAYS SINGING BARBER OF FLEET STREET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Having spent 15 years in the cutthroat,
cannibalistic world of network television, you may ask what's
compelling Kelsey Grammer to play a slash-happy London barber who
kills, then devours, his victims.
</P>
<P>
   A simple case of ``turnabout is fair play''?
</P>
<P>
   Not really. It's just that, as Grammer acknowledges, he's always
been a man of voracious appetites _ for work, success and new ways
of pushing and polishing his craft.
</P>
<P>
   A man who likes to stay hungry _ very hungry.
</P>
<P>
   That accounts for why the well-paid star of NBC's long-running
hit comedy ``Frasier'' could be found last week at Paramount
Studios' Stage 29, picking through the carcass of a takeout lunch
while waiting to resume rehearsals for ``Sweeney Todd _ The Demon
Barber of Fleet Street,'' the landmark Stephen Sondheim-Hugh
Wheeler musical.
</P>
<P>
   A 20th anniversary concert version of the dark-hued,
quasi-operatic work, mounted by the 2-year-old ``Reprise!'' series
and directed by Calvin Remsberg, will open a five-performance,
minimally staged, concert-style run tonight at the Ahmanson
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Grammer will star as the demoniacal title character, whose
unjust imprisonment, coupled with the loss of his wife, leads him
to exact a terrifying revenge. The production co-stars Christine
Baranski as Sweeney's chipper partner in crime, Mrs. Lovett, and
also features Neil Patrick Harris, Melissa Manchester, Dale
Kristien and Ken Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ``Reprise!'' cast is packed with brand-name,
award-winning talent, the production timetable has been tight,
lasting only a couple of weeks from start to finish. Cramming in a
rehearsal last week between ``Frasier'' tapings, Grammer admitted
that his appearing in ``Sweeney Todd'' ``doesn't make any rational
sense, because I don't have the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Remsberg, a close friend of Sondheim's, obtained
production rights to the show and approached Grammer about playing
the lead, it ``was just too good an opportunity to pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of my earlier promise to myself that I would
continue to challenge myself throughout my life,'' says the
44-year-old actor.
</P>
<P>
   His ``boyhood dream,'' Grammer explains, was to play the great
Shakespearean tragic heroes _ Romeo, Macbeth, Hamlet, maybe
Othello. Earlier in his career, the classically trained actor
performed on stage at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre, on and off
Broadway and at regional theaters around the country. He also
starred in the Bard's ``Richard II'' at the Mark Taper Forum in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Grammer believes that ``in terms of the physical requirements
and the demands and attention to specificity on the language and
vocal production,'' ``Sweeney Todd'' comes pretty close to
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Moor or the melancholy Dane, Sweeney has to carry
a tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the hardest things to do is to actually sing a
song in front of an audience,'' Grammer says, ``because you have to
remember character and situation and relationships all at the same
time _ and actually having an audience watch it _ while you're also
trying to still play a part. That's the essential requirement _
that the part is still being portrayed through the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``And sometimes (the song) has one word too many that can cause
a little short-circuit _ especially with this limited a rehearsal.
If you had three months to rehearse this, that would no longer be a
concern. But since we have just a short time to rehearse, it's a
little nerve-wracking.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is he doing it?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm a workhorse,'' he says quickly. ``And in this
way, at least I still get to get my juice from a live performance
that I do really miss some of the time. It's a craving I have.
Probably the place where I feel most invigorated, in terms of my
work experience, has always been live theater. So here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Grammer is, technically speaking, is about as high as you
can get up the network food chain without being Jerry Seinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   His creation, Dr. Frasier Crane, a neurotic, bombastic radio
psychiatrist, already is among the longest-lived characters in
sitcom history, having spent nine seasons as a beloved ``Cheers''
regular before being rewarded with his very own show six seasons
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As Frasier, Grammer wields a slashing, intelligent wit that's
well balanced by the equally cutting humor of his foils David Hyde
Pierce, Jane Leeves, Peri Gilpin and John Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   His instinct for going for the comic jugular looks well-suited
to the funny, macabre ``Sweeney Todd,'' whose retro-gothic melodies
and fiendishly clever lyrics sent shivers of stunned admiration
through Broadway when the show opened in March 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Christopher Bond's 1973 drama, which itself was derived
from an 1847 Victorian melodrama in the ``penny dreadful'' manner,
``Sweeney Todd'' pushed the Broadway musical into high tragedy and
further toward the pointillistic, atonal musical palette that
Sondheim continues to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   However, some found it hard to stomach this ghastly stew of mass
murder and cannibalism, improbably sweetened with some of the
loveliest melodies Sondheim ever has written (``Pretty Women,''
``Johanna,'' ``Not While I'm Around''). The score also is spiced
with such cruelly witty numbers as ``A Little Priest,'' in which
Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett debate the relative gustatory merits of
various professional men who've been baked into her dreadful pies.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, while admiring the show's exquisite craftsmanship
in the original Harold Prince production, complained about its
coldness. Others found that coldness appropriate for a story framed
by the mise en scene!off! of dog-eat-dog, 19th-century London
during the Industrial Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Although Grammer has seen few live productions of Sondheim's
work, he counts himself a ``huge'' fan of the composer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really just love his imagination and his brain,'' Grammer
says. ``I saw `A Little Night Music' years ago in the theater and
of course was charmed by that piece. I think that's a really
marvelous piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Manchester, who plays the mysterious Beggar Woman in the
``Reprise!'' production, remembers the tremendous impact ``Sweeney
Todd'' had on her when she saw its first national tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so densely filled with all levels of humanity, the
psychological and the emotional and the poetic. So it's a feast,''
Manchester says. ``And studying the score more and more, you
realize the exquisite intricacy of the storytelling and the actual
score itself. I mean, it's no surprise that (Sondheim) loves
puzzles, because this has just been put together flawlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Seligson, producing artistic director of ``Reprise!''
says she's wanted to do ``Sweeney Todd'' ever since she kicked off
the series with the Neil Simon-Burt Bacharach-Hal David musical
``Promises, Promises'' in 1997. But she believes ``we never
would've been able to do this three years ago. It would've been too
big for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one day she got an unexpected call from Remsberg, who'd
performed the role of the Beadle in the original national tour of
``Sweeney Todd'' and had heard about ``Reprise!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just called me, I think he got my phone number from
(`Reprise!' music director) Peter Matz, and said, `Would you want
to do this?' And I said, `I would kill to do this!'''
</P>
<P>
   Heh, heh, heh.
</P>
<P>
   Gallows humor is a useful commodity for a show that shatters the
Broadway cardinal rule about sending audiences home savoring a
happy ending and whistling a catchy romantic melody.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Grammer thinks even a man who turns himself into a killing
machine can be lovable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My version? They're gonna love him!'' he declares, chuckling.
``What's lovable about him is his pain. There's not a woman in the
house who won't think, `Oh, that poor, dear man!'''
</P>
<P>
   Grammer has always been candid in discussing the pain in his own
life, which approaches Shakespearean proportions. His father and
his 18-year-old sister were both murdered. Two half-brothers were
killed when he was 25.
</P>
<P>
   Grammer has acknowledged past episodes of substance abuse and as
recently as September 1996, he checked himself into the Betty Ford
Center for treatment after he crashed his Dodge Viper near
Mulholland Highway in the Malibu Lake area while under the
influence of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Twice divorced, he once was the subject of sexual misconduct
allegations brought by a teen-age girl that resulted in no
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he politely deflects any suggestion that his past troubles
could supply plenty of grist for his portrayal of Sweeney _ a man
who, like Shakespeare's Lear, may be more sinned against than
sinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had an approach to the work where it ignites my
imagination, and, oh, if some of the stuff in my own life can kind
of come along for the ride, fine,'' Grammer says. ``But I would
never try to weigh down what is bigger than me with my own
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I mean I'm not much of a method actor, I guess.
Well, I've found my own method! I don't think that my stealing a
candy bar when I was 8 years old has any real significance in what
is a much larger canvas than my own life. But what I can bring to
it is my imagination _ which is as big as all life.''

THERE'S A KIND OF `HUSH' IN ROBERT PARKER'S WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
HUSH MONEY 
By Robert B. Parker 
Putnam, 309 pp., $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert B. Parker, then a professor at Northeastern University,
began his writing career by producing a novel, published in 1974,
about a private eye who gets involved in an academic matter. It has
been years since Parker has seen the inside of a classroom, but he
hasn't forgotten university politics, and periodically he arranges
for Spenser to return to campus to teach those pointy-headed
professors a thing or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``University politics is very odd,'' observes a good-hearted
professor of English. ``You get a lot of people gathered together
who, if they couldn't do this, really couldn't do anything. They
are given to think that they are both intelligent and important
because they have PhDs and most people don't. Often, though not
always, the PhD does indicate mastery over a subject. But that's
all it indicates, and, unfortunately, many people with PhDs think
it covers a wider area than it does. They think it empowers their
superior insight into government and foreign policy and race
relations and such. In addition these people are put into an
environment where daily, they judge themselves against a standard
set by 18- or 20-year-old kids who know little if anything about
the subject matter in which their professors are expert.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hush Money'' begins with a case of university politics. An
African-American professor, Robinson Nevins, has been denied
tenure, and the reason seems to be a rumor that he was sexually
involved with a male student who committed suicide after the affair
ended. Spenser's sidekick, Hawk (who is also black), was saved from
the streets by Nevins's father, and Hawk doesn't think that's what
happened. Once the sleuthing begins, neither does Spenser, whose
latest adventure turns into a sinister comedy of politics _ or of
political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   The deceased student was producing a publication called
OUTrageous, which was devoted to outing closeted homosexuals. He
was also making a sizable amount of hush money by blackmailing
closeted homosexuals who didn't care to appear in the columns of
OUTrageous.
</P>
<P>
   A second and virtually independent line of the plot concerns a
friend of Spenser's significant other, Susan. K. C. Roth is a
hot-to-trot divorcee who is being stalked. Spenser agrees to look
into the matter, but before long the divorcee has fixated her
attentions on him. Gallantly Spenser spurns her advances because
sex is one thing, and loving Susan is another. So now K. C. Roth
becomes the stalker and Spenser the stalkee.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way there's a defenestration, some double dealing, an
exploded car, and the bad guys' attempt to take Spenser out, which
is a mistake. Despite these pleasures, the plot, or the plots, are
not the strongest suit of this particular outing, and Parker helps
himself to situations, devices, and phenomena that have proved
helpful to him in the past (most recently in ``Night Passage,'' the
first novel featuring his new detective, Jesse Stone). There's an
unusual amount of sex this time, and Parker uses it to cause and
explain too much.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately Parker has long since conditioned his readers to
expect something more intresting than a plot from a Spenser novel.
There's character, for one thing. This book provides a privileged
glimpse into Hawk's youth, and brings back Lee Farrell, the
sympathetic gay cop with whom Spenser sustains a chapter-long campy
conversation. (They meet for a drink in the Limerick, and Spenser's
opening gambit is, ``I figured you'd order a pink lady.'') Susan's
professional psychologizing can sometimes be an irritant, but here
she sounds both sensitive and shrewd, particularly when compared
with a prominent feminist professor: ``There is no liberal agenda,
however goofy, that will not attract her attention. There is no
hypocrisy, however bald, that she will not endure if she can
convince herself that it is in the service of right thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the characters are acting on a skewed agenda, motivated
by political conviction and political correctness. Parker has no
use for this. He gives us Farrell, and also some thoroughly
unsympathetic gays; he gives us a man of conscience in Nevins, and
some very slimy African-American brothers. K. C. Roth is both a
wronged woman and a troublemaker. A dangerous right-winger becomes
almost likable when he risks and loses all for love. Spenser's
moral compass holds true, and every individual is judged on his or
her merits.
</P>
<P>
   With the kind of detail Parker's readers delight in, Spenser
whips up a decent supper out of unlikely ingredients including
linguine and canned black beans, samples some beer, pitches woo
with Susan, identifies a Carol Sloane record, laments the decline
in baseball broadcasting, walks around actual landscapes, and
patronizes real businesses. The university is unidentified, but the
student is named Prentice Lamont, which may provide a clue to
readers with detective instincts of their own.
</P>
<P>
   In one surprising moment, Spenser fancies himself as the movie
star of the '40s, Brian Donlevy. ``I could raise one eyebrow, like
Brian Donlevy, but I didn't very often, because most people didn't
know who Brian Donlevy was, or what I was doing with my face.''
Spenser apparently doesn't know (as film encyclopedist Leonard
Maltin does) that Donlevy wore platform shoes, a toupee, false
teeth, and a girdle. Or maybe he does, and doesn't care, because
that eyebrow trick has got to be worth something.

EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT WINDOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Questions commonly heard at the Home Show: Where can I find
comparative information about windows? Which are best in new
construction? Which are best for replacements?
</P>
<P>
   Those are good questions, but there isn't much of an answer,
because most information on windows comes from the manufacturers,
who say, naturally, theirs is the best.
</P>
<P>
   So, what do you do? &QL; 
 &QL; 
New construction windows &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In houses under construction, the Big Three _ Andersen, Pella,
and Marvin _ all make a quality window. One reason all these
windows are quality windows is that they are made of wood. There
are many other companies that make windows; the list is almost
endless.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen uses vinyl to clad the sash (the movable part of the
windows, the frame that holds the glass). Pella uses enameled
aluminum to clad the sash. Each claims its type works best.
</P>
<P>
   There are many styles that use cladding of some kind on one or
both sides of the window. Cladding on the inside allows finishing
of wood on the interior.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever seen a window catalog, you've seen the huge and
bewildering selection of sizes, styles, cladding, and colors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the windows have low-e double glazing, two layers of
glass with an interior film that increases resistance to heat loss
and gain.
</P>
<P>
   Double-glazed low-e glass is as good as you can get,
insulation-wise, without spending a lot more for the window.
</P>
<P>
   And, a quality wood window, double-glazed, is made by Brosco,
distributed by Brockway-Smith.
</P>
<P>
   If you like the idea of vinyl windows, check out those with a
steel or aluminum skeleton. It is this metal skeleton that gives
vinyl windows their ability to resist warping.
</P>
<P>
   Vinyl windows are built in two different ways: welded (no seams
or other fasteners) and mechanically assembled with screws or
bolts. The mechanical gurus think that mechanical assembly is best
because there are no welded seams to break, and such frames can be
disassembled to allow changing of glazing (glass).
</P>
<P>
   As for metal, it is this handyman's feeling that they should be
avoided, except for storms. Even though metal windows have a
thermal break between inner and outer surfaces to prevent loss of
heat and the dreaded sweating that so many metal windows get, metal
is just not the best of materials for a window in a house.
</P>
<P>
   As for styles, take a look at double hung (those that slide up
and down), casements (those hinged on one side and open like a
door), horizontal sliders (avoid them, they don't work very well),
awning (hinged at the top) and open outward; hopper (hinged at the
bottom and open inward), and the wide variety of picture windows,
bow windows, and bay windows.
</P>
<P>
   While double hungs are most popular, casements are good on
certain style housesand are fast gaining in popularity. For good
reason, too; casements close more tightly, casements can be opened
fully, (only half of the double hungs and horizontal sliders can be
opened), and casements, when open, act as baffles to draw fresh air
into the house. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Replacement windows &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What about the replacement windows? Americans seem hipped on
replacement window, probably because they have been convinced that
they need them.
</P>
<P>
   Before you consider replacement windows, ask yourself, do you
really need them, and if so, why?
</P>
<P>
   You might be surprised at the reasons people choose replacment
windows: 1. The old ones are leaky and drafty. 2. The old ones are
just tired looking, and I want a new look. 3. I'm tired of putting
up and taking down the storm windows. 4. I'm tired of washing four
surfaces of glass with my old windows and storms. 5. I don't like
the weights, ropes, and pulleys. 6. I'm tired of sweating windows.
7. This is the best one: I want tilt-outs for easy washing.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever turns you on, I suppose, but consider the possibility
that replacements are not needed unless the old windows are
actually broken beyond reasonable repair or are rotting. These are
legitimate reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Another good reason: The old windows are cheap and ineffective,
a common component of many houses built in the last 30 or 40 years.
Too often builders bought cheap windows as a way to save costs. It
was good for the builder, not good for the new homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   Still another good reason is if you have steel casements, which
not only don't insulate very well but also sweat like crazy in
winter because the metal is just as cold on the inside as on the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   But if your old windows are of reasonably good quality, close
well, and operate without huffing and puffing and breaking
fingernails, they can be weatherstripped to make them airtight and
weathertight, and equipped with a top-quality storm window that is
equally airtight, all of which will achieve close to what you would
get in a replacement window.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement-window business is huge, and the varieties of
styles and types, including vinyl cladding and other perks, are as
great as in the new construction window business.
</P>
<P>
   And a good thing about replacement windows is that most
companies manufacture and install just the sash, not the whole
window, at considerably less cost than a whole window. Besides,
entire windows seldom need replacing.
</P>
<P>
   The sash is the movable part of the window, the frame that holds
the glass. This applies to any style windows, including
double-hungs and casements. These replacement sash cost generally
from $150 to $200-plus per window, and installation is less
complicated and costly than removing and installing a whole new
window: casing, frame, sash, and all.
</P>
<P>
   Replacements come in vinyl clad wood, aluminum clad wood, plain
wood, and vinyl. They are all double-glazed, and some have the
low-e option. Most have the much-desired tilt-out feature.
</P>
<P>
   As with new construction windows, wood or vinyl-clad or
aluminum-clad wood are the best. If you choose vinyl, specify those
with an aluminum or steel skeleton to resist warping. And be aware
that the frames of vinyl windows are extra wide, and any storm you
may want to keep cannot easily be taken out and washed.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the reasons some window installers say you don't
need a storm with a double-glazed window, but if you already have
the storms, why not keep them; you will get triple glazing and the
insulative value of both windows will increase by about a third.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with double glazed windows, in both new construction
and replacement types, is that, up to now, the glass was difficult
or impossible to remove and replace in case of breakage or fogging.
</P>
<P>
   When that occurred, the movable sash (the frame that holds the
glass) had to be replaced, an expensive proposition unless the
window was in warranty.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, double-glazed windows cannot be fixed by the
homeowner, who used to do it easily on his single-glazed windows.
That was in a simpler time.
</P>
<P>
   It is fervently hoped that this can be corrected, so that the
homeowner, if he feels like it, can indeed replace just the glass,
not the sash, and certainy not the whole window. In a nutshell,
that is the lowdown on windows in new construction.
</P>
<P>
   Anything else? Yessir. Keep those old or new windows washed and
sparkling, and they will raise your morale summer and winter.
</P>
<P>
   And, admittedly, the tilt-outs make washing a breeze.
</P>

DEFINING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN VENUS AND MARS

<TEXT>
<P>
   A &UR;  &LR; few differences between the sexes:
</P>
<P>
   When a woman wears his clothes she's in love; when a man wears
her clothes he needs professional help.
</P>
<P>
   Women look in the mirror and see flaws; men look in the mirror
and see why women find them fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Women cry at the movies because they're in touch with their
feelings; men cry at the movies because they're not.
</P>
<P>
   Women see a half-empty gas tank; men see more than enough gas to
get to Hartford and back.
</P>
<P>
   Women wear basic black because 1) it makes them look thinner; 2)
it goes with everything else they own; 3) it's sexy. Men wear basic
black because it hides the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   A woman knows all his specifics, right down to his watch-band
size. A man has a rough idea of her height and the size of her
chest, but can't remember exactly what color her eyes are.
</P>
<P>
   Men forget women's birthdays; women forget how old they are.
</P>
<P>
   At work, women take orders from men. At work, men take
suggestions from women.
</P>
<P>
   A woman will ask a man if she looks fat; a man will never ask a
woman if he looks bald.
</P>
<P>
   Men argue and five minutes later it's forgotten and they're best
friends again. Women argue and then brood over it for months.
</P>
<P>
   When women say ``I'm sorry,'' and they say it constantly, it's
usually automatic, mindless, a bad habit. On the rare occasions men
say they're sorry, they really mean it.
</P>
<P>
   Women know when it's over; men stick around until they're asked
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   A woman will write a check for $2.37 at the supermarket. A man
would rather starve.
</P>
<P>
   Men talk about themselves endlessly; women talk about men
endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Men put their mistakes behind them. Women relive their mistakes
over and over again until they die of embarassment.
</P>
<P>
   Women name their cars; men name their penises.
</P>
<P>
   Men play to win; women play to play.
</P>
<P>
   Women believe in maps; men believe in their sense of direction.
</P>
<P>
   Men think women have no sense of humor. Women think men have no
idea how funny male behavior is.
</P>
<P>
   Men drink beer because that's what men do. Women drink beer
because there's nothing else available to drink.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman says ``I'll call you'' it means she'll call you.
When a man says ``I'll call you,'' it could mean anything.
</P>
<P>
   Women want to share feelings; men want to share pizza.
</P>
<P>
   A man will give up drinking and lose 10 pounds in three days. A
woman will give up eating and gain five pounds in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Men jump to conclusions. Women consider things forever, from
every possible angle, and still can't decide.
</P>
<P>
   Women know they're at the mercy of their biological clocks. Men
are sure they have all the time in the world.
</P>
<P>
   A woman will recork a bottle that holds half a glass of wine. A
man will finish off the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Women love to send greeting cards. Men aren't sure what greeting
cards are for, exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Men are attracted to younger women because they want to feel
like kids again. Women wish men would grow up and act their age.
</P>
<P>
   A woman thinks she's saving money if she goes to a sale and buys
something she doesn't need. A man won't go to the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Women think good sex is an integral part of a relationship. Men
think sex is an integral part of a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Men stereotype women. Women generalize about men.

NEVER-FAIL RECIPES ARE TRIED AND-TRUE FAVORITES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - Dependable. Tested. Tried and true.
</P>
<P>
   When we asked you to send in your favorite standby recipes, you
sent us the favorites you turn to again and again in a variety of
situations: for every day, for snacks, for entertaining. Some of
the recipes have been favorites for decades.
</P>
<P>
   They opened a window into pantries. The recipes show what real
people keep on hand. From this informal survey, we would have to
say that the frozen item that gets used most often is chicken
breasts. In pantries, the No. 1 item that sits on the shelf is _
yes, an old favorite _ canned, condensed ``cream of'' soups,
especially cream of mushroom soup. Packets of onion soup mix are
popular, too.
</P>
<P>
   By culinary coincidence, two of the first three recipes to
arrive were virtually the same dish: chicken breasts combined with
a can of whole cranberry sauce and a small bottle of French or
Catalina salad dressing. We tried it, and the results are a solid
``Wow!''
</P>
<P>
   We also received several versions of enchilada casseroles and
two near-identical recipes for a casserole of hamburger and
vegetables with a mashed-potato topping.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is soul food pure and simple!'' Betty Wikenhauser wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One warning: We didn't ask for low-fat recipes. Some are more
healthful than others. Some are one-dish meals. A few are
vegetarian, many are economical to make, almost all are versatile.
You can use your favorite fat-lowering techniques (such as
substituting reduced-fat cheeses) when you make your own versions
of these dishes.
</P>
<P>
   A sincere thank you to everyone who sent in recipes. More of
your recipes are available at www.azcentral.com/food/standby.shtml

This is so easy to throw together. I have even put frozen chicken
breasts in the baking dish and just poured the sauce over them and
baked it without thawing the chicken _ and it turned out super!''

``This is my favorite standby recipe,'' Kathy Cutler writes. ``You
can change the ingredients to suit your liking, like pork, beef or
veal for the chicken, and any kind of canned fruit for the peaches.
It's quick, easy and filling, and you can reduce the fat and
calories by substituting a vegetable spray to cook the meat and
using canned fruit in their own juices.'' &QL;

   ``Wherever I am, people normally have eggs and rice,'' Cynthia
Clements observes. ``For vegetables, I use whatever is available
and seems good, usually carrots and garlic, green onions if I have
it. The rice should be prepared and in the fridge for an hour or
two, but you don't have to if you don't have time. . . . The only
other thing you need to know is not to add soy sauce until it is
finished, and to have the oil be hot.''

CHIEFTAINS' LATEST: OLD MUSIC, NEW FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chieftains have always aimed high. From the start, they
sought to bring Irish traditional music out of the pubs and into
theaters and opera houses around the world. They've done that with
style. They've also aimed high with their albums, which have
included guest shots by everyone from Sinead O'Connor to the
Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   Their latest disc, ``Tears of Stone,'' may be their most
ambitious yet in a 36-year career that has garnered seven Grammy
Awards. It sweetly marries many leading female singers _ including
Joni Mitchell, Bonnie Raitt, Natalie Merchant, Joan Osborne,
Loreena McKennitt, and O'Connor _ with Irish songs, most of them
love songs, some going back hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these songs I learned growing up. I learned them from
my mother and my grandmother,'' Paddy Moloney, the leader of the
Chieftains, said during lunch at the Ritz-Carlton this week, in
advance of a concert Sunday at Symphony Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is perfect. Female artists are making inroads like
never before _ witness the abundance of female winners at this
year's Grammy Awards _ and music insiders feel this could be the
best-selling Chieftains album in their history. That means it would
surpass the 500,000 sales of their 1995 CD, ``The Long Black
Veil,'' which paired them with the Stones, O'Connor, Mark Knopfler,
Tom Jones, and others.
</P>
<P>
   But while women are the focus of the new release (``I'm
fascinated by the sound of female voices with the Chieftains,''
says Moloney), he adds that this ``was not done for the money, but
is very much a friendship album.''
</P>
<P>
   Moloney has known some of these women for years. McKennitt, the
bewitching Canadian world-music phenomenon, once toured Japan with
the Chieftains. Raitt has been a supporter since Moloney popped
onstage with her two years ago, backing her on penny whistle.
O'Connor has sung with the Chieftains off and on for the last
decade, while Sissel (who sang on the ``Titanic'' soundtrack) has
toured with the group.
</P>
<P>
   The music _ chosen mostly from Moloney's suggestions _ is as
worthy as the concept. The sensuous, dusky-voiced Osborne sings the
classic ``Raglan Road.'' Merchant sings the haunting ``The Lowlands
of Holland.'' Mitchell adds her own ``Magdalene Laundries'' (a true
story about a convent where unwed mothers used to be cared for),
Mary Chapin Carpenter sings beautifully in Gaelic on her selection,
``Deserted Soldier,'' and Japanese singer Akiko Yano performs
``Sake in the Jar,'' a takeoff of the famed tune, ``Whiskey in the
Jar.''
</P>
<P>
   The album has its share of fun, but also has a poignant side.
Most laudably, the Chieftains do not crowd the guests, preferring
to add background embellishments rather than scream forth with ego.
``It's not us playing and them joining in,'' says Moloney of the
six-piece ensemble. ``It's them singing and us joining in. But
every track was an event. It was a big happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the respect that musicians have for the Chieftains that
Osborne, after she cut her track in New York, traveled to Ireland
to hang out with the band. While they were quaffing a few at the
Roundwood Inn in County Wicklow, Merchant walked in with her new
manager, Cambridge-based Gary Smith, co-founder of Fort Apache
studio. ``You know, Natalie, you should do a song on Paddy's
album,'' said Osborne. Merchant quickly complied, recording her
song in two takes.
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual number finds Brenda Fricker (who won an Oscar
for best supporting actress in the film ``My Left Foot'') reciting
the William Butler Yeats poem, ``Never Give All the Heart.'' Also
unusual is the inclusion of the overexposed Irish tune ``Danny
Boy'' by jazz vocalist Diana Krall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told people a hundred times that we wouldn't record
`Danny Boy,' '' says Moloney. ```Daniel Boone' is what I used to
call it. But Diana did an absolutely lovely job with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chieftains' current tour includes two guest performers:
fiddler Eileen Ivers, who played on the new CD, and singer Yvonne
McMahon, a member of the road crew.
</P>
<P>
   Old music and new friends _ a combination that has kept the
Grammy-winning Chieftains clicking for all these years.

DONALDSON DOWN, BUT UNREPENTANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By some yardsticks, 1998 may have been a worse year for Sam
Donaldson than for Bill Clinton. The statement he uttered four days
after the Monica Lewinsky story broke _ that if Clinton ``is not
telling the truth, I think his presidency is numbered in days'' _
made him the poster boy for errant punditry. The president's escape
from Monicagate has forced Donaldson to acknowledge that he's been
operating ``with the baggage of the old rules which no longer
apply.'' And April's issue of Brill's Content magazine names him
one of the ``Worst White House Reporters,'' accusing him of being
more ``talking head'' than ``reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   To millions of Americans, ABC's 65-year-old chief White House
correspondent _ and cohost of ``20/20'' and ``This Week with Sam
Donaldson and Cokie Roberts'' _ is the classic
``gotcha'''journalist, barking impertinent questions to important
people at inopportune times. And if the Lewinsky scandal exposed a
major ``disconnect'' between the Beltway media and the rest of the
populace, it proved daunting for the man known for the arched
eyebrow and archly phrased question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of wrong predictions early on in this thing, and
one of the reasons . . . was that I brought the Nixon grid,'' said
Donaldson in an interview with the Globe before speaking at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ``I was ABC's Watergate
correspondent . . . and I thought at the end, the lesson was no man
is above the law; if you commit felonies in the Oval Office, you
have to leave. So, I come and I set that grid down (thinking) `I
know how to do this; this is what happens.' Wrong!''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson may have been bloodied by the past year's lessons, but
he is typically unbowed. People who complained that the media were
beating the Monica story into a bloody pulp ``are being
disingenuous in the sense that our business is not to stop,'' he
said. ``Very frankly, we don't have to worry about the public
opinion polls as to whether they like us or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew, everybody in the press corps knew the first day (the
Lewinsky story broke) that Mr. Clinton was lying,'' Donaldson
declared. Yet the reporter who has covered the White House since
Jimmy Carter's tenure acknowledges that the Clinton administration
is uniquely adept at news management.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Clinton basically,'' he explained. ``He's at the center
of the ability to persuade, to assuage, to convince, to change the
subject . . . Once in a while _ August 17 was a perfect example of
course _ he's off, he strikes the wrong note,'' he said, citing the
president's prickly public performance after his grand jury
testimony. ``But other than that, it's wonderful. Who couldn't like
him? I like him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Donaldson harbors any residual ill will about the flogging he
and others took for their obsession with Lewinsky, it is reserved
for journalistic critics like Steven Brill and New York Times
columnists Frank Rich and Anthony Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complaint suddenly became from journalists that other
journalists were actually trying to investigate this story as if
there was something wrong with putting out the facts,'' he said,
oozing incredulity. ``Now what was that about?''
</P>
<P>
   Brill, whose August ``Pressgate'' article attacked the Beltway
media for slipshod coverage of the scandal, seems particularly
capable of raising Donaldson's ire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud to be on (Brill's) list of the 10 Worst White House
correspondents,'' he said. ``Cokie (Roberts) and I play in his
magazine . . . So what are you gonna do? Try to sell your magazine
against the press by pointing out that Sadie Gulch, who represents
three stations, is a bad reporter? No.''
</P>
<P>
   One other lesson of the impeachment scandal is not lost on
Donaldson: the impact of the cable news networks. ``They're putting
us out of business, those of us who thought we were the hard news
broadcast centers of America,'' he observed. ``You know, the cable
networks are not watched by many people, minuscule audiences. But
their reach and their influence goes far beyond that . . . 10 years
ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, (there were) things we would
immediately put on the air as a bulletin . . . we don't bother
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the nightly network newscast is headed for
extinction, Donaldson said, ``I don't think we, at ABC for
instance, will make a decision internally that we want to
discontinue our early evening newscast. The danger comes from our
affiliates. If the affiliates come to us and say `guys, it's over,'
then it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Donaldson _ like the rest of America _ watched Barbara
Walters's interview with Lewinsky and sized up the woman who helped
launch one of the most intense media frenzies in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's pathetic and shallow,'' he said. ``Here is a
young woman who clearly doesn't feel any personal shame, doesn't
really think she did anything wrong . . . The presidency is in this
sense forever tarnished as far as the history books go . . . and
she's part of that . . . And she doesn't get it.''

TRAINING THE EAR TO HEAR THE SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was intrigued by a talk being given at the Waldorf School, a
private elementary school in Beverly. Its title was ``The Twelve
Senses.''
</P>
<P>
   We all know the usual five suspects _ touch, smell, taste,
sight, and hearing _ but what could the other seven possibly be? As
I drove to Beverly I turned over candidates in my mind. Intuition,
surely. It's often considered a sixth sense. Then a sense of humor,
and perhaps a sense of timing to describe what determines the
different pace at which each of us operates. I also came up with a
sense of empathy, our means of identifying with another person, and
a sense of sympathy, the process by which we feel compassion for
others.
</P>
<P>
   I was up to 10. I added a sense of excitement, the biological
source of our enthusiasm for life, and ended with a sense of self,
an inner compass that informs us that we're more than the sum of
messages from our culture. By the time I arrived, I figured I could
give the lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, was I wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Steiner, the man upon whose philosophy the school is
based, was operating on an entirely different level. His 12 senses
included the basic five, and four more: a sense of balance, a sense
of movement, a sense of life, and a sense of temperature. But it
was the last three that captured my attention, what he considered
``higher, spiritual'' senses that we achieve with adulthood: a
sense of the word, the thought, the ego.
</P>
<P>
   We are born, of course, hearing all the sounds that surround us,
becoming more and more attuned to the spoken word as we grow older.
Then we learn to listen for the thought behind the words, the
larger meaning intended by the speaker. At this level, many of us
excel at picking up information and formulating it into concepts
and theories.
</P>
<P>
   Although our culture considers a rational understanding of what
we hear the goal of education, Steiner didn't stop there. He went
on to postulate ``a sense of ego,'' an awareness that beyond
particular words and thoughts dwells a being, a person with hopes
and dreams, a spirit, and a soul. At Steiner's highest level of
functioning, we attune ourselves to that reality, using words and
thoughts as a bridge between listener and speaker. We hear in such
a way that boundaries dissolve, creating an awareness and openness
to the depths of the other.
</P>
<P>
   I think we all reach that level of functioning in the early
throes of love, whether for a mate or a young child. The silliest
comment or the most trivial remark seems to illuminate the soul of
those we love passionately, as if every utterance were a pathway to
the core of the beloved. Yet we rarely manage to hold on to that
degree of responsiveness. We get so caught up in making judgments
or rehearsing our own replies that we're lucky if we even catch
another's meaning.
</P>
<P>
   I want to learn how to reverse that.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, I've just begun attending a Circle of Quiet at our
Unitarian-Universalist Church, which is held every other Monday
night. After a period of listening to music in silence,
participants are directed to talk to one another, without
interruption or eye contact, for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   We sit in pairs, side by side, and listen to each other. As the
first person speaks, the listener doesn't comfort or nod assent.
She needn't formulate advice or encourage the speaker with nods or
sympathetic noises. In fact, during those 10 minutes, the listener
is expressly forbidden to give any feedback at all. It's a strange
and unnerving experience for both parties, not only to speak and
listen without interruption, but not to worry about how the other
person might be feeling about the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Last time, I sat with a woman I hardly knew. As I listened, I
became intensely aware of her tone of voice, her moments of
hesitation, the places where she felt confident or uneasy. I could
hear her desire for understanding and connection as clear as a
bell. When our mutual sharing was completed, I felt as if I'd made
contact with the being who inhabited her depths and embraced her
spirit. The experience made me aware of how infrequently I reach
that level with my family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old concept, what our minister calls ``sacred
listening.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 13th-century poet Rumi described it: ``Out beyond ideas
of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. When the soul lies
down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about. Ideas,
language, even the phrase each other doesn't make any sense.''

School's football team, and all the guys he hangs with are
athletes, too. A while back, one of his buddies confided that he
and his girlfriend had been having sex for six months. The friend
told nobody else.
</P>
<P>
   What's this? No locker room bragging about sex? No stereotypical
``jock'' out to ``score'' off the field as well as on? Well, not
the way 17-year-old Greg Racki tells it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one person that did it made it a total secret,'' Racki
says. ``Kids aren't in such a rush anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Racki's health teacher shakes his head as he listens to three
boys talking about sex. ``I'm thinking what it was like when I was
their age,'' says 46-year-old Buck Harris. ``It was the more
notches you got on your belt, the better. That was in the late
'60s. The norm was that having sex with lots of people was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But times are changing. Recent headlines alleging high school
rapes in Brookline and Falmouth may serve as grim reminders that
harassing girls and talking trash _ and, sometimes, much worse _
are still facts of teen life. But recent surveys reveal something
else, too: Fewer teenage boys report having had sexual intercourse,
and those who have done so report having fewer partners. As for
condom use, it's increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation has almost been tagged the sex generation, with
MTV and the music,'' says 17-year-old James Dolan of Nahant.
``Everything seems oriented around sex. It's kind of funny that
it's gone down.''
</P>
<P>
   The shifts, to be sure, are modest (and rates of teen sexual
activity are still higher than in the early 1970s), but the
declines show up on survey after survey. They jibe with polls that
find young people's social attitudes increasingly conservative.
They jibe with data recording decreases in teen pregnancy and most
major sexually transmitted diseases, albeit with some sobering
caveats. The American rate of teen pregnancy remains virtually the
highest in the Western world, and 4 million teens a year report new
cases of STDs.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the Youth Risk Behavior Survey of the Centers for
Disease Control, which asks high schoolers about everything from
sex to cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been a significant change over the course of the
'90s in the proportion of girls who say they've had intercourse or
who report having had four or more partners. But the number of high
school boys who say they've had intercourse dropped from 57 percent
in 1991 to 49 percent in 1997, roughly the same as the 48 percent
of high school girls who say they've had sex. Almost one fifth of
boys report at least four partners, but that's down from almost a
quarter in 1991. Almost 63 percent of sexually active boys used
condoms the last time they had intercourse, up from 55 percent in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Urban Institute's National Survey of Adolescent
Males, which looks at 15- to 19-year-olds, in school and out. In
1995, 55 percent said they'd had intercourse, down from 60 percent
in 1988, with the decrease concentrated almost entirely among white
males. Researcher Freya Sonenstein calls it ``primarily a suburban
phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   While condom use remains highest among black teens, the increase
in use is most dramatic among white youths. While comparable
surveys of teenage girls show an increase in the number of girls
having intercourse before age 15, from 11 percent in 1988 to 19
percent in 1995, the survey of adolescent males shows that the
level is stable at 21 percent. Only Latino youths register
significant increases in early sexual initiation.
</P>
<P>
   So what are teenage boys saying about sex these days?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, they're saying they're scared. Mention the topic
to a group of young men at Stoneham High School and they mention
``the book,'' a graphic, pictorial guide to sexually transmitted
diseases, that they perused in 10th-grade health class, the one
that 17-year-old John Curtis laughs ``is going to scar everyone for
life'' and lead them to monkhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am scared to death about STDs,'' says 18-year-old Robert
Hanley, who has seen a family friend die of AIDS. ``I am scared out
of my mind about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm way more worried about getting a girl pregnant,'' Curtis
interjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you serious?'' asks Hanley. ``I could deal with a baby but
not with dying of STDs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can prevent a baby,'' says 18-year-old Ryan Brown, ``but
you don't know if someone's clean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of four people have STDs,'' says Hanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' says 16-year-old Ryan Szloch as he surveys the eight
other classmates sitting around the table, ``is two of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a scare thing nowadays. You don't want people to
know you've had sex,'' Hanley says. ``Girls have the frame of mind
we have. We could have something goofy down there.''
</P>
<P>
   This, says Stoneham health teacher Sharon Chapman, is not a
conversation she would have heard a decade ago. ``It was all macho.
The guys who spoke up were the ones who knew everything and had
done everything,'' she says. ``You didn't hear them speak about
waiting. You didn't hear kids standing up for abstinence the way
they do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Abstinence, that is, from sexual intercourse. Adults may have
been surprised by the recent Kinsey Institute report that college
students don't consider oral sex ``having sex,'' but teenage boys
weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had oral sex and they ask if you're still a virgin,
you'll say yes,'' says 17-year-old Brian O'Keefe of Stoneham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot to ask students to abstain from other things like
oral sex,'' says Racki of Swampscott. ``I think that's where most
kids draw the line. I think if they did the polls again and
included oral sex, the numbers would be way up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're still a virgin till you go to bed with her in the
womb,'' says 16-year-old Anthony Liriano of the South End.
</P>
<P>
   Oral sex, says 16-year-old Raymond Murphy of Burlington, ``is
one step above making out,''
</P>
<P>
   One major difference driving today's kids, of course, is AIDS.
The oldest among the teens of 1999 were babies when AIDS was
identified in 1981. The rest weren't even born. They're the
generation that grew up with sex education, not sexual revolution,
with consequences, not carefree loving.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you jump in a girl, and she's easy, you know she's got
something,'' says 18-year-old Sarnie McCaskill II of Roxbury. ``If
she's active, she might have something else active.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd have to look pretty hard to find a teen who hasn't learned
about AIDS in school. The CDC reports 92 percent have had some kind
of HIV curriculum. ``It's been 10 or 15 years since comprehensive
sex education,'' says Harris, the Swampscott health teacher.
``We've never had a generation that's better educated.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk into Swampscott High and the corridor is festooned in the
colorful paper pledges of students to forswear ``destructive
behavior.'' The most popular club on campus is the peer leaders
group, whose roster lists 150 of the school's 750 students. Walk
out of Stoneham High on a recent afternoon and the announcements
include an invitation to a session on AIDS and STDs. ``The thing
that helps us so much,'' says Stoneham's Hanley, ``is health class
in 10th grade.''
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of room, nevertheless, for concern in the latest
surveys. A majority of sexually active teenage boys, 55 percent,
don't use condoms each time they have intercourse. Roughly three of
every 10 say their last sexual encounter followed consumption of
alcohol or drugs _ a number that hasn't changed appreciably during
the '90s. Here in the Bay State one fifth of high school girls
report they've been hurt physically or sexually by someone they
dated. Three-quarters of 15- to 17-year-olds, according to a new
Kaiser Family Foundation national survey, underestimate the
incidence of STDs.

SCORE ANOTHER ONE FOR ACURA  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, MARCH 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Acura scores another one in the ``much-improved''
category with its refurbished flagship, the 3.5RL.
</P>
<P>
   Not that last year's version was bad, but the RL for '99 has
more of the performance and handling edge that once brightened
Acura's whole range of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Acura softened up its offerings in recent years, making them
more comfy and unobtrusive while losing its cadre of well-to-do
driving enthusiasts. Those drivers had foreseen Acura becoming the
Japanese performance equivalent of BMW. Which didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the upscale branch of Honda is making cars that to some
degree manage to recapture the flair and flavor of those early
Acuras that drew so much acclaim. With the new CL compacts and the
sporting, enjoyable 3.2TL already onboard, Acura brings forth a
tighter, brighter flagship.
</P>
<P>
   The RL is sleek and slick, with a high-end feel and good
performance from the smooth V-6, focused steering and excellent
brakes. The suspension is a bit soft for my taste, dulling the
handling with too much wallow and body sway. But most luxury-car
buyers will appreciate the cushy ride.
</P>
<P>
   Still, road feel is much improved. Rather than having all the
sensations of driving smoothed out to non-existence, the RL imparts
good feedback through the steering wheel and driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the RL is not meant to be a sports car but a luxury
transport that is also enjoyable to drive. As such, it's a very
comfortable long-distance cruiser that feels competent and
composed, if not sparkling.
</P>
<P>
   The RL, formerly known by the much-more-memorable name of
Legend, moves up a notch stylistically with a bolder, shinier
grille, more prominent rear lights and a sharpening of the body
contours. But I think it bears too much of a resemblance to the
highly successful Lexus ES300, a direct competitor. Really, when
they go by in traffic, it's hard to tell them apart.
</P>
<P>
   Though the look is attractive, with excellent fit and finish, RL
fades into the crowd, bringing nothing to set it off visually.
Acura stylists really need to break out of their rut. They're way
too conservative for what should be a happening car company.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller TL was a departure from this trend, with a stronger
identity and performance capabilities. The styling of the Legend
has been made bolder but less distinctive, going with the same big
chrome grille treatment and larger taillights as everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   The refined interior is marred by plastic-wood inserts, but
seats are exceptionally supportive. The cabin is roomy, with a
Honda product's typical low cowl line, good back-seat space and
large trunk. Naturally, it's loaded with comfort and convenience
features, and a super stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   Though pricey, the RL offers a lot for the money. It's an
excellent family car and, like all Acuras, commands an enviable
reputation for reliability and resale value.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car was equipped with Acura's Global Positioning
System, which provides a screen in the dashboard with a moving map
that shows where you are and tells you how to get where you're
going. The $2,000 option uses the military's 27 GPS satellites to
locate each car.
</P>
<P>
   The RL is an understated luxury car that's loaded with value,
comparing well with its many competitors. Although it seems like a
lesser luxury car than top-drawer sedans such as the Lexus LS400 or
Cadillac DeVille, both substantial cars powered by V-8s, the Acura
offers high quality and a fine record for reliability.
</P>
<P>
   These are things of substantial value. &QL; 
 &QL;

SNOW THE SWEETENER AT SUGARLOAF REUNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARRABASSETT, Maine _ The two rather amazing events that
occurred in Carrabassett Valley last weekend probably have nothing
to do with each other, but somehow they cannot be separated.
</P>
<P>
   And it is particularly fitting that the Sugarloaf/USA ski area
is involved since, earlier in the season, the western Maine ski
area was victim of a snow drought the likes of which we had not
seen in about 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   And things were not improving. Every time there was snow, warm
rainy spells followed, creating an ice cap on every summit in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just down the road and across the river from the Sugarloaf
access road is a derelict building that looks a little like an old
country barn. The red paint is faded and the floor sags. The
cavernous rooms below have been dark for decades, with an
occasional faded poster on the wall recalling days long gone.
</P>
<P>
   The stage upon which Jud Strunk and the Sugarloafers once played
their semi-amazing eclectic rock is still in place, and the dance
floor is, like the rest of the interior, dark raw wood, including
the stout oaken posts that hold up the rest of the building. A few
booths where revelers once sat are still in place, and the bar in
the corner tilts with the sag of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The place may never have looked much better, but rarely was it
ever seen without a wall to wall crowd, and it may be significant
that few pictures exist of the most famous apres ski bar of its
era, the Red Stallion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of stories told about the Red Stallion
over the years,'' says founder Ed Rogers, who bought the club when
he was fresh out of University of Maine, ``wild stories, crazy
ones. But they're all true.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was speaking last Saturday night to about 400 graying
sixties kids who flocked to the Red Stallion for a one-time blast
down memory lane. A Founder's Night to raise money for the
Sugarloaf Ski Club brought back the hundreds of old-time
Sugarloafers who remember the Red Stallion as an emblem of youth
itself _ their own, and the wildly growing sport of skiing that was
never more popular, before or since.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always remember an era through a kind of memory haze and
romanticize it,'' said Bruce McLeod, who was drawn to the party by
word of mouth, its only advertising, ``but I hear these people talk
about the Red Stallion and I know I missed something pretty great.
I was about 10 at the time this place was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories include horses, lost skiers who took up residence in the
inn, and at least one New Year's Eve ski race down the roof of the
inn into one of the first heated pools north of Portland. Clothes
were optional.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an amazing place,'' said John Diller, who was a
bartender at the Stallion in the early '70s and is now general
manager of the mountain. ``It really was part of the identity of
the old Sugarloaf.''
</P>
<P>
   In those years, the area known as ``The Loaf'' had acquired an
identity that contained elements of wildness _ in part owing to its
location in the Great North Woods of Maine _ and fierce
independence outside the accepted skiing establishment. The quality
of terrain on the only lift-served area in the East with above
timberline skiing spoke for itself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Globe managing editor Ian Menzies took a trip to the
area then considered an outpost among Boston skiers. He found Ed
Rogers at the Red Stallion, which in those days drew the likes of
Normal Mailer and IMG's Jim Watson. Said Rogers:
</P>
<P>
   ``A person can do what they damn well please here, what they're
most comfortable doing . . . that's the real Carrabassett
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Sugarloaf matured and the various corporate entities that
ran it sought to market the area's unmatchable New England terrain,
many sought to distance the mountain's image from the wild and
wooley days. The area became Sugarloaf/USA, and the beginning of a
village and several condo pods were designed to bring a family base
to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering those days of the 1960s when skiing growth was at
its most vigorous, Rogers alluded to how ``homogenized'' the sport
and Sugarloaf had become. Fact is that few could have survived the
intensity of the Red Stallion days and ways for very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here tonight,'' said one middle-aged woman who asked
not to have her name appear, ``to find the bouncer who threw me out
of here and confiscated my fake ID. And he's right over there.''
The two shared a beer and a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the first light flickered in the old bar and the
first chords of rock 'n' roll heard in decades through the old
place were played by Uncle Al (an original), an amazing thing
happened besides the fact that the floor seemed to be sinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that snow,'' someone said, and sure enough, a blizzard
had started that would blanket the mountain in over 20 inches of
snow through the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, true to form, those who rocked the night away in
the Stallion were out for first tracks to ski in the deepest
lightest powder anyone in New England could remember. Some talked
of ``champagne powder,'' and early powder hounds had the snow
flowing off their chests and over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there were those who will always believe in
strange forces afoot. ``Finally, they figured out something that
pleased the snow gods,'' said a hotel operator. ``They opened up
the Stallion, and winter happened.''

AUSTRIANS LIVE UP TO RAVE BILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the snow melts from the Alps and the Rockies this spring, and
as memories solidify of the World Cup ski season just winding up in
Sierra Nevada, Spain this week, two images will be lasting: an
Austrian ski team that has dominated the season like an
overwhelming red-and-white wave, and the pair of Norwegians who
stood up to the onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   With the downhill complete and three races to come for both men
and women, the overall season standings could change slightly, but
the Austrian men hold seven of top 10 spots and nine of the top 15.
That won't change.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the standings of the Austrian women, who have four in
the top 10 spots _ including slots one and three _ and five in the
top 15. About a dozen countries compete regularly in World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegians Lasse Kjus and Kjetil Andre Aamodt stand 1-2 in the
overall standings, having knocked Austrian Hermann Maier into third
place overall after Wednesday's final downhill of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer when the team began working out earlier than
most on the glacial snow, word began trickling out of camp that the
Austrian team was special. And it didn't take them long to prove
the point.
</P>
<P>
   By midseason the Austrians were turning in history-making shows
_ like winning the top nine places in the Super-G at Innsbruck, a
feat never before accomplished. It also sent home the point that
this was a team effort rather than a star show, despite the
emergence of Maier, ``The Terminator,'' as the featured
personality. Austrian men took at least half the top 15 spots in
most races they entered.
</P>
<P>
   By the World Alpine Championships in Vail, Colo., last month,
the Austrian team was competing with itself _ kids against the
veterans, women against men _ and a headline in a Vienna newspaper
wondered: ``Where's the competition?''
</P>
<P>
   Historic Austrian names such as Karl Schranz and FranzKlammer
were being joined with new giants from the Tyrol, Maier and Thomas
Sangassinger. At the prominently located Austria House in Vail
Village, the old legends were mingling constantly with the younger
skiers, heightening the sense of national force, complete with its
own oompah band.
</P>
<P>
   And while most talk was once focused on the greatness of the
male team, it was suddenly apparent that the Austrian women had
also been developing into almost as dominant a force as their male
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   From Anita Wachter, a longtime queen of Austrian skiing, arose a
new generation of young women _ Michela Dorfmeister, Renate
Goetschl, and Alexandra Meissnitzer _ who congealed into a
well-sesoned team by the time of the Worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``All season we have been pushing each other really hard,'' said
24-year-old Meissnitzer on the day she won the giant slalom gold
medal at Vail, seeming to take the mantle of team leadership from
the bronze medalist, Wachter. ``We are a team. We support each
other, but when it is time to race, we compete hard against each
other. We have to be very competitive just to get to race.''
</P>
<P>
   Meissnitzer won Wednesday's final downhill of the season to give
her an unbeatable lock on the overall World Cup title with 1,640
points to Germany's Hilde Gerg at 1,163.
</P>
<P>
   To many observers, internal competition is part of the Austrian
secret. With strong state support in the nation's number one sport,
wave upon wave of rising young skiers compete for very few spots.
In some events, in fact, the toughest competition takes place in
the training runs that determine which Austrians will make the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we must race for a place on the team,'' said 21-year-old
phenom Ben Raich, who holds 10th place in overall World Cup
standings, ``there is very fierce rivalry between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranate Goetschl, who won the gold medal in women's downhill at
Vail, agrees, adding that ``you must understand that in our country
skiing is the number one sport, like football and basketball here.
Every little kid grows up dreaming about being a famous ski racer
on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on weekends, millions of Austrians are glued to their
television sets watching World Cup ski racing. But, beyond the fact
that the sport is a big moneymaker, the effort to raise a nation of
ski racers is a patriotic one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no team in the world that gets so much government
money and support,'' says Patrick Lange, a spokesman for the World
Cup tour that was started by his father, Serge, in the 1950s. ``You
look around at the race course: The Austrians have more coaches and
trainers, more skiers. They just do more than the other countries.
No one can touch them.''

INTEL FACES ANOTHER FLAP OVER PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Intel Corp. faces a new round of criticism
from privacy advocates over a computer chip that identifies users
as they surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the privacy advocates objected to technology, known
as a Processor Serial Number, or PSN, contained in Intel's new
Pentium III chips. The PSN identifies individual machines connected
to the Internet by way of a unique number embedded in each chip.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, a French programmer notified Intel that one of
its chips found in new laptops inadvertently contained experimental
circuitry that was the forerunner to PSN. Intel spokesman Tom
Waldrup said the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company, the world
leader in microprocessor chips, had confirmed the flaw.
</P>
<P>
   According to Intel, the chips, which include some of the Pentium
II and Celeron lines, were part of a prototype that later led to
full-fledged installation of an identifying serial number feature
in the company's new Pentium III chips.
</P>
<P>
   The PSN feature is the subject of a formal complaint filed with
the Federal Trade Commission by Internet civil rights advocates,
who argue that the identifying feature violates user privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Waldrup said Wednesday that the experimental circuitry was
supposed to be erased from the chip during the manufacturing
process. However, an assembly line error allowed the prototypes to
remain enabled on the chips.
</P>
<P>
   Waldrup said Intel was releasing software that can turn off the
feature.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw was discovered by a French computer programmer, Pierre
Chassaing.
</P>
<P>
   Waldrup said inserting experimental features in existing
computer chips was part of a validation process that allowed Intel
to evaluate future manufacturing capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that most of these (chips) have been shipped into
the business market,'' Waldrup said. ``Only a small minority
would've been sold to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Waldrup, the flaw affects only chips made after
Jan. 5. He declined to say how many chips had been shipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is troubling,'' said Ari Schwartz, a privacy policy
analyst with the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Democracy and
Technology, a party to the FTC complaint. ``Intel throws this
technology out there, and then everyone else, customers, computer
makers and regulators, has to deal with it.''

JAMES WITHSTOOD HURRICANES' WORST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ He could have left. Lots of people told Tim James that
was the proper career choice to make.
</P>
<P>
   Stay in Miami? Play for a team that drew few fans, was seldom on
television, and was coming off a Big East season that was historic
_ 0-18 _ in the most negative kind of way?
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, that's why James chose to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I heard from people was how bad Miami was,'' said the
6-foot-7-inch orward who not only stayed but turned into the
brightest star a University of Miami team that _ can you believe
it? _ has a chance to be a legitimate player in the NCAA
Tournament, which begins for the Hurricanes Friday in Boston with
an East Regional game against Lafaytte. ``That just drove me.
People talked about all those empty seats at UM games, the fact
that the 'Canes weren't on TV, but all of the negative comments
motivated me. I looked at it as a challenge I wanted to meet
head-on. I wanted to come here with a few other guys and help make
this a respectable program.''
</P>
<P>
   Respectable?
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes are 22-6, seeded No. 2 in the East, and
considered by many a sleeper team that has an actual shot at the
title if the champion is destined to be a team other than Duke.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Big East will argue with that.
</P>
<P>
   Not St. John's, which lost to Miami twice in the regular season
before finally nipping the Hurricanes, 62-59, in the semifinals of
the Big East tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Not Connecticut, the Big East tournament and regular-season
champion, which went all out to beat the Hurricanes in Miami,
winning by a basket in overtime in January, but then lost by a
basket in a rematch last month at UConn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are,'' said St. John's coach Mike Jarvis with as much
relief as satisfaction after last week's win, ``a very good team
that is going do well in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, James _ the Big East's Co-Player of the Year
(with UConn's Richard Hamilton) _ will most likely be the primary
reason.
</P>
<P>
   When James arrived in Miami as a freshman in 1995-96, the 'Canes
were looking for a cornerstone. He came out of Miami's Northwestern
High School and was a star from the start, leading the team in
offensive rebounds and blocked shots, while finishing second in
scoring on a 15-13 team (8-10 in the Big East) that was only two
years removed from that dreadful 0-18 stain.
</P>
<P>
   By his sophomore year he was the team leader, the catalyst for
teams that have made the NCAA field the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Milestone after milestone has been reached. This Miami team was
the first since 1964-65 to win 20 games. One more victory will tie
the school record.
</P>
<P>
   As for James, how many superlatives do you want to use? He is
the first Hurricane to score 1,500 points, grab 800 rebounds, and
block 200 shots. He leads the team in scoring (18.9 ppg), rebounds
(8.3), and blocks (2.2). He is fourth all-time in school history
with 1,685 points.
</P>
<P>
   And check this out. Before the last regular-season home game,
against Rutgers, his number, 40, was retired. The only other male
Hurricane player to be so honored was Rick Barry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what a joy Tim has been to work with,'' said
Miami coach Leonard Hamilton. ``He tries to do what is right all
the time. And it's always been that way.''
</P>
<P>
   James has done all of this in the most low-key fashion. You
don't hear a whole lot of trash talking from him, or see a lot of
showboating. But the fires within him are as stoked as anyone's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't see it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you will see more in the next few weeks as James's
career at Miami winds down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have goals,'' said James, who still carries around the
disappointment of last year's first-round loss to UCLA. ``Last year
was a learning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   James began learning early. He came out of the tough James E.
Scott projects in Miami's Liberty City section. The realities of
the world intruded quickly. At 13, he saw a shooting victim
sprawled dead on the street.
</P>
<P>
   But his mother, Betty, wove a warm cocoon of safety around him.
It was a comfort zone that James stayed in when it came time to
pick a college.
</P>
<P>
   James figured, ``Why go somewhere else when you can play
big-time basketball right here in Miami?''
</P>
<P>
   He has played, and played as well as any Miami player since
Barry.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it makes no sense, all of this coming together in
such a short time.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways, it makes all the sense in the world.

HYPOCRISY IS STANDARD PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A word (three, actually) to all the moralists out
there:
</P>
<P>
   Take a hike.
</P>
<P>
   It's too late. The time to start clucking about graduation rates
and eligibility standards on our Division 1 men's basketball teams
has already come and gone. That time was, well, I don't know
exactly when it was because that, frankly, is the way we Americans
want it.
</P>
<P>
   You want pure ``student-athletes''? Good. Head to Hartford and
see Trinity. Go to Manchester (Indiana). Point the car toward
Hampden-Sydney, Va. They're all good Division 3 teams and they're
all at home in their own nice little tournament this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not putting them down. I love basketball at all levels. One
of those teams probably has a 6-3 inside man I'd adore. But that's
one level of competition, and what we've got going on in the
FleetCenter starting Friday is another. The 64 teams in the real
NCAA Tournament have better athletes than the teams playing in
lower levels, and those are the ones most sports fans want to see.
And if a few of them (aside from the Lafayettes and Penns who have
zero chance of winning it all) also happen to have a half-decent
student or two, that's a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   If Duke wins, you'll be reading and hearing about how coach Mike
Krzyzewski does it the ``right'' way, and there will be some truth
in that. Duke is a good, private (key word) school. But don't allow
people to sling too much bull. Absent their basketball skill, few
of Coach K's great players over the years would have gotten past
the Duke academic police. If Duke kids happen to have better board
scores than, oh, I don't know, Cincinnati's, it's still relative
because those scores won't match up to a random sampling of any
dozen Duke students. Duke has a double standard, all right. It just
isn't as pronounced as some others.
</P>
<P>
   Duke wins with Duke-like students, not by-the-numbers Duke
students. Moving right down the list of the remaining 309 Division
1 schools, there's not a scholarship-granting college among 'em
populated entirely by athletes who would have gotten into that
institution if subject to the same process as the nonathlete. Not
one. But no one wants to talk about that. We'd rather pretend that
Duke and Stanford are 100 percent virtuous and that Fresno State
and New Mexico are 100 percent evil.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just Us being Us. America is distinguished among all
nations for many reasons, not the least of which is a phenomenal
capacity for hypocrisy. Nowhere is this more evident than in our
love affair with big-time college sports.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the premise that no other country on earth does what
we do, and that includes America Lite, our neighbor to the
immediate north. There has never been an adequate justification for
our unique decision to include the full-blown business behemoths
known as major college football and basketball in our higher
education structure. What does having a great football team or
basketball team have to do with running a proper university? People
have been asking that question for the better part of this century.
Some have actually answered according to their conscience by
withdrawing from the process (see University of Chicago, circa
1939).
</P>
<P>
   The rest of them, and, yeah, us, have likewise come up with an
answer. Our public pronouncement is that there should be high
ethical and academic standards. You know, look at Whizzer White and
Bill Bradley. They are proof that one can have a full cake left on
the plate even after consuming a very large piece. They are the
shining examples that prove the system works.
</P>
<P>
   Hand me the hefty-sized barf bag.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is we really don't care if our favorite college teams
happen to be populated by semi-literate purse snatchers as long as
they win. Oh, we care about standards, all right, but not our
standards. The standards we really care about are the ones at some
other guy's school, usually one in direct competition with ours.
</P>
<P>
   We Americans want to think well of ourselves. We would like to
project an image of always taking the high road. Just don't judge
us by our actions. We deplore pornography, but it's a
multibillion-dollar industry. We preach nutrition, but we love our
Big Macs. And we'd like our school to win the ``right'' way, but
why won't Admissions let us have the 6-11 kid with the 610 boards
and the rap sheet? If we don't take him, Backcourt Tech down the
street will. Worse yet, they're on our schedule.
</P>
<P>
   So here we are, on the eve of another NCAA Tournament, and
what's the news? It seems that a former employee of the University
of Minnesota claims that she wrote papers and did take-home exams
for upwards of 20 Gophers basketball players, including members of
the 1997 Final Four team and four players on the current squad,
which is preparing to play Gonzaga in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling? I'm shocked!
</P>
<P>
   If true, it's regrettable and shameful. I'd also bet a weekly
NBA superstar paycheck that Minnesota just happens to be the one
that got caught _ this time _ and that the general reaction among
Gophers fans will be to string up the woman who couldn't keep her
mouth shut and go along with the program. This in itself isn't even
a new twist on the topic. What about the academic adviser down
there at the University of Georgia a few years back? It's all part
of the deal, because it's what we Americans want, and always have
wanted. We want to eat the sausage. How they make it is of no
concern.
</P>
<P>
   If we really wanted to see pure scholar-athletes in this
country, we'd have more of them. Real full-time students would play
and the others would perform for independent clubs or in
professional settings, the way they do everywhere else in the
world. But we don't want that; we want March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   If any members of the press are offended by it all, let them
phone in sick and allow the sports editor or news director to have
someone else cover the games. This is not the time to be crying
about graduation rates or eligibility standards. The rest of us
long ago made our peace with the system. We're good Americans. We
want it both ways, and we've got it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, then, you think Kent really has a shot at Temple?

RUIZ CLOSES IN ON A DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Norman Stone had his dream fulfilled not too long
ago. John Ruiz is still waiting on his.
</P>
<P>
   Stone is the local guy who bet everything _ his future, his
house, his dreams _ on a kid from Chelsea with nothing going for
him but a big heart and a willingness to fight for what he could
get. He hasn't quite won that bet yet but Wednesday he and Ruiz sat
in the last row of a three-tiered dais at Madison Square Garden
looking down at Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis knowing they are
only months away from fighting one of them for the biggest prize in
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   That has been Stone's dream all along, that somehow Ruiz would
become the No. 1 contender in the heavyweight division. If boxing
history is a barometer, that was about as farfetched an idea as
there could be. But it came true late last year, not long after
Stone signed Ruiz to a promotional deal with Don King and began to
get the kind of fights and connections that can put a fighter in
the rankings if he wins often enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz beat former International Boxing Federation heavyweight
champion Tony Tucker and steppingstone opponents such as Jimmy
Thunder and Ray Anis, and one day he woke up and learned his
manager's dream had come true even if his hadn't quite yet been
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Johnny and told him he was No. 1 in the (World Boxing
Council) and he just said, `Yeah?,' '' Stone recalled. ``Then he
called me the next morning and says, `You sure?' Now look at us.''
</P>
<P>
   The sports world will be looking at them Saturday night when
Ruiz opens the Holyfield-Lewis pay-per-view show against Mario
Cawley, a kid he figures to knock stiff in a round or two. Cawley
comes in with a gaudy 21-1 record but he's been on what boxing guys
call ``the Nashville diet,'' meaning he's been fed a lot of kids
from Tennessee and Ohio who can't fight much so the only number
about him that's real is the number 1. That blemish came a year ago
in his last fight, when Hartford heavyweight Lawrence Clay-Bey
knocked him out. The consensus is whatever Clay-Bey can do, Ruiz
can do better.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the point at this juncture. Ruiz is 33-3,
the North America Boxing Federation champion and holder of what the
No. 1 contender's spot brings _ a guaranteed title shot against the
WBC champion by October or thereabouts. When you're in that slot,
you're not looking for tough tuneups.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to John Ruiz's dream.
</P>
<P>
   He never dreamed of being the No. 1 contender, never thought
about it at all. He's happy to have the WBC's blessing but fighters
don't think about being a contender. If they really are fighters
they think about being a champion, something the kid from Chelsea
is now only two wins away from if he's lucky and boxing's gods
smile on him a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have believed that on all the nights Ruiz refused to
go out with his friends because he had to go to the gym or on all
the bitter cold, stone dark mornings when he ran through the empty
streets while his family slept? Who could believe a kid from New
England could become the No. 1 contender when no one had done it
since Rocky Marciano five decades ago?
</P>
<P>
   A kid could believe it. A kid with some talent and some will and
maybe not enough sense to know what is impossible in life. A kid
like John Ruiz could believe it and now he has done it. Now he has
given the man he calls Stoney his dream and is only one win away
from living his own dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was always to fight for the heavyweight
championship,'' Ruiz said softly as he sat 10 feet behind the boom
box voice of King.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about it, it's been a lot of years to get to this
but in other ways it feels like only Wednesday when I was fighting
in the Olympic Trials (1992). I took the hard road. We didn't have
connections or a big promoter or anything when we started. There
were times where it looked like there were a lot of obstacles
between us and the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've had a lot of time to learn. I've had time to do a lot
of thinking. Now here I am, on the verge of fighting for the
heavyweight championship. That's not written in stone yet, but it's
my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a goal that looked distant after Ruiz tore the tendons in
his hand while losing a decision to cruiserweight Sergei Kobozev
Aug. 12, 1993. Ruiz's career was threatened and his goal seemed to
fade into the night after he finally got a shot on HBO and was
knocked out in 19 seconds by David Tua.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz walked out of his corner and into a crushing hook, the kind
of thing that happens to a professional fighter about as often as
lightning strikes him. But it happened and when it did many
dismissed Ruiz as just another kid who couldn't hold his hands up.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruiz looked at it for what it was _ an ill-prepared boxer
learning a hard lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that fight I sat down and thought about what I wanted to
do in my life,'' Ruiz said. ``The answer was I wanted to become
heavyweight champion. So I decided it was time to start training
harder, staying more focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame myself for the Tua fight. I wasn't serious enough. In
a way, I'm glad it happened because when something like that
happens either you quit or you go forward. It opened my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   He has gone forward ever since. At the start there were wins
over guys you never heard of again. But then came a shot to serve
as Lewis's sparring partner and a connection with his promoter,
Panos Eliados. Then came a shot at the NABF title against Thunder,
a big puncher who Ruiz knocked flat, then came wins over Anis and
Tucker, an 11th round TKO of the former champion just over a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter King stepped in and Ruiz won the World Boxing
Association North America title against journeyman Jerry Ballard.
Now here he is, the embodiment of Norman Stone's dream on the verge
of living his own.
</P>
<P>
   For a kid from Chelsea, for a kid from Anywhere, USA really,
it's a hell of a story. A story, Ruiz and Stone believe, that has a
chapter or two to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `In your wildest dreams did you ever think this
could happen?' '' Stone said as he looked around the Theatre at the
Garden Wednesday packed with so many of boxing's big names. ``I
tell them that's where it all started for Johnny and me. In our
wildest dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times we fought over the last hot dog in the arena
but the kid is here now. He made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Made it to Norman Stone's dream. One more win and John Ruiz will
have his dream, too. He'll have a title shot.
</P>
<P>
   In boxing, that's about as good as it gets.

COLLEGE HOCKEY SET FOR SECOND SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The University of New Hampshire and Clarkson University won the
marathons.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's on to the sprints: A two-weekend dash to crown Hockey
East and ECAC tournament winners and another two-weekend race after
that to determine a national champion.
</P>
<P>
   UNH shut down Maine last weekend in a first-place showdown to
win its first outright Hockey East regular-season championship and
Clarkson beat Cornell Saturday night to hold off St. Lawrence and
win the ECAC title.
</P>
<P>
   Besides earning the top seeds for their league tournaments, UNH
and Clarkson each snatched one of the 12 guaranteed berths in the
NCAA Tournament that begins March 26-27. At least a couple of more
spots for Eastern teams are up for grabs the next couple of
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   While Maine and Boston College in Hockey East and probably St.
Lawrence in the ECAC are in great shape for at-large bids, the only
sure way into the NCAAs for most teams is to win the league
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The chase begins Thursday. No. 2 seed Maine hosts No. 7
UMass-Amherst for a best-of-three series and No. 3 BC has No. 6
UMass-Lowell, running through Saturday, if necessary. UNH hosts No.
8 Merrimack and No. 5 Boston University visits No. 4 Providence in
series that open Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard plays at RPI Friday and Saturday in a two-game,
first-to-three-points series. While the Hockey East teams play each
night until a winner is determined, in the ECAC the first game can
end in a tie after a five-minute overtime. If the first game is a
tie, the second game will be played until there is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty on the line this weekend and next, when Hockey
East moves on to the FleetCenter and the ECAC heads to Lake Placid,
N.Y., for the championship rounds.
</P>
<P>
   There is seeding order _ and first-round byes _ to be determined
for the national tournament. There is fine-tuning for the NCAAs.
There is the chance to regroup _ or to salvage a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just getting there, to Lake Placid,'' said Harvard
coach Ronn Tomassoni. ``We feel if we play well as a team we can
win this tournament. Now it's the playoffs and the slate is wiped
clean.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that Harvard started the season 2-8-1 overall
and 0-8-1 in the ECAC.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that BU also was 2-8-1 out of the gate. Or
that the Terriers, with some less-than-spectacular penalty killing,
lost all three of their games against Providence.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that BC, ranked No. 1 in the country when the
season began, has not quite lived up to expectations despite being
among the top seven teams in the nation all year.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't even matter that UNH and Maine went head-to-head
all season at the top of Hockey East, were among the leaders in the
nation, then did it again in a wild weekend in Durham last week.
</P>
<P>
   Any team can get hot and do some damage. Just as any other team
can falter now, or in the NCAA regionals, and see a glorious season
end in a quick 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard will try to ride the momentum from a strong finish that
included a pair of wins last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   BU will hope its penalty-killing unit plays more like the group
that allowed one power-play goal in its opponents' last 19 chances
than the unit that saw Providence score nine goals in 17 chances in
three losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we can beat anybody in this tournament,'' said BU
coach Jack Parker. ``No question about that. This is the only team
we haven't beaten, and in some ways it's nice to go down there in
that role.''

   BC, which lost in the national championship game to Michigan
last year, looks to keep one modest streak alive and end another.
The Eagles were the only Hockey East team that had home ice to
advance to the FleetCenter last year and UMass-Lowell has made it
to the semifinal round six straight times.
</P>
<P>
   Maine coach Shawn Walsh left Durham last week happy with the way
his team played, excited about the national tournament, and even
more excited that his team didn't have to play again on a rink as
wide as UNH's.
</P>
<P>
   UNH knocked off one of its demons last weekend and now takes aim
at another. The Wildcats have never won a Hockey East tournament
title and this year's group of seniors _ led by high-flying forward
Jason Krog and steady defenseman Steve O'Brien _ has only made it
to the FleetCenter once.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they were upset by Maine and sat out the Hockey East
championship round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pumped and we're looking forward to playing,'' said UNH
coach Dick Umile. ``We want to take the team and our fans and go to
the FleetCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the sprints begin.

`FLESH' IS CERTAINLY SKIN-DEEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   French actress Isabelle Huppert's mystery _ even when she cries,
she's blank-faced _ is the center of director Benoit Jacquot's new
film, ``The School of Flesh.'' Jacquot seems her equal in terms of
enigma. They've created a low-blood-pressure tale about the dirty
magnetism of sex. Huppert plays a French fashion executive who
falls for the slinky young package played by Vincent Martinez. He's
younger and morally pliant _ a hustler who plays on both sides of
the sexual equator.
</P>
<P>
   Despite tumbling into sex with Huppert, which he finds so
satisfying that he refuses to charge her, Martinez treats her like
just another trick after they begin a relationship. She chases him
around to a bar where he once worked and grills his former lover
(Vincent Lindon) for information. And after Martinez abandons her,
she debases herself further by hounding him to a desolate part of
Paris where he's moodily turning tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's performance consists of posing his angelic figure as
if he's lost in dreams of starring in a Vogue spread. All the
chemistry from Huppert comes mainly when she's petty and grasping,
afraid of losing him and embarrassed about her obsession. Her
heart-shaped face takes on a mousy intensity at that point.
</P>
<P>
   Jacquot and his writer have adapted ``Flesh'' from a novel by
Yukio Mishima. I've not read this book, but based on my familiarity
with his other work, I'm sure that themes such as ambiguity, a
flirtation with humiliation and a tough scheming for dominance
resonate in it. They sort of do in ``Flesh,'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   You can feel the blood rushing through the temples of the
characters in Mishima's work, whereas Jacquot tends to be drier _
especially here, for reasons that don't make sense. It's a movie
about sexual politics that is neither sexy nor sexual. Jacquot has
conjured a reflective piece, despite a story line that sounds
quintessentially French, that doesn't really have a brain in its
head. But it sure acts as if it's smart.

JOINT COMPOUND WILL SMOOTH BEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The rough-hewn beams in my family room are almost black. I
not only want them smooth, but I'd also like to paint them lighter.
I would not want to box them in because that would make them too
big for the room. I've heard that you can apply joint compound to
smooth them out and then paint. Would that work?
</P>
<P>
   JANE WISLEDER, Hingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You betcha. You answered your own question. The roughness of
the beams will allow the joint compound to stick well, even
resisting peeling when the wood expands and contracts. To make sure
the compound will resist peeling, apply as thin a coat as possible.
The more coats, the smoother the finish, but it is better to stick
to one, two at the most. Paint with two coats of a flat or eggshell
latex wall paint.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My Corian countertops are scratched, and I was told to sand
out the scratches. I power-sanded and made a mess; the surface is
now very uneven, with different glosses. What did I do wrong, and
is there any way I can improve the surface?
</P>
<P>
   M.S., Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think that while sanding is good to take scratches and
stains off Corian, power-sanding is not. Try steady, overall
hand-sanding with the finest sandpaper you can obtain, or emery
cloth. Or, use one of those stiff plastic scrubbers of a coarse
consistency; the kitchen Scotch pads are not stiff enough. If you
are reluctant to do that, call the dealer or Dow, the manufacturer;
they might have additional suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have some metal casement windows that have no
weatherstripping; the windows close with a metal-to-metal contact,
not very good for weather-tightness. Where can I find a retrofit
seal for such casements?
</P>
<P>
   PETER ZIMMERMAN, Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I suggest using self-adhesive foam tape. Press it in place on
the frame where the window closes on the frame. This way the window
will press against the foam, compressing it when the window is
closed. With this method there will be no frictional wear on the
foam. It will simply be compressed, which does not amount to much
wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   Window places might carry a weatherstrip just for metal windows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 1961 house has a septic tank, which is OK, but my
neighbor's failed the Title 5 test, so I am a little leery of mine.
Now we are getting sewers in the street. Are there any negatives to
a hookup to city sewers?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN HART, Natick, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Absolutely none, in my opnion, and I speak from experience,
having had a cesspool for some years that was creating a dismal,
smelly swamp in the back yard. I had good reason to go to sewers
when they came in, and I think I was the first in my block to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wise for you to be the first (or second, after your
neighbor) to hook up. It'll cost a sum to hook up, and the annual
sewer charge will nearly equal the water bill, because sewer usage
is calculated on water usage, but I think you will be happy with
it.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a bonus: Your septic tank won't need pumping out
anymore. Of course, the savings won't equal your annual sewer
charge, but you'll rest easy knowing there is no septic system to
fail.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the best time to start painting the outside of my
house? Is there anything more to preparation than scraping and
sanding?
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW WALL, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Paint when the temperature is 50 degrees Fahrenheit or higher
and will stay that way, and below 90 degrees. This information is
on the can of stain or paint. Scraping old paint and sanding are
the two most important parts of preparation. And you can start
anytime while waiting for painting weather. Another important part
of preparation is to wash or power-wash with detergent and water
after sanding.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

STAR TREK PLOTS YOU'LL NEVER SEE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if the news were not depressing enough, what with Bob Dole
shilling for Viagra while his wife considers running for president,
there is now talk of a 10th Star Trek movie.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Star Trek has ``matured'' over the years from the
drooling, hormone-addled Capt. Kirk to the cool, politically
correct Capt. Picard, the movies in many ways remain the same. The
infuriating Spock has been replaced by the equally infuriating Data
and the Enterprise is bigger and higher-tech, but much of what made
the show endearing (or annoying, depending on your point of view)
remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it be the first movie, the 10th movie or the 20th movie,
here are some of the things that have never happened and never will
happen on Star Trek.
</P>
<P>
   (Some of the material in this column was gleaned through a
Vulcan mind-meld with Peggy Robin, author of ``The Starfleet
Academy Entrance Exam'' and from the approximately 10,000 Star Trek
Web sites out there, a fact that, in its own way, is alarming.)
</P>
<P>
   1. The Enterprise runs into a mysterious energy field of a type
that it has encountered before.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise attracts mysterious energy fields the way
President Clinton attracts interns. And, like interns, these energy
fields are all capable of great destruction. It would be nice if
the Enterprise could, just once, pass through a mysterious energy
field that smoothed wrinkles, brightened teeth and gave Capt.
Picard a full head of hair.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Enterprise goes to check on a remote outpost of
scientists, all of whom are perfectly all right.
</P>
<P>
   If I were a scientist on a remote outpost, I would look forward
to a visit from the Enterprise with the same enthusiasm I would
look forward to an attack of shingles. Everything is fine until
these idiots in the funny shirts show up.
</P>
<P>
   3. The crew of the Enterprise is stricken by a strange alien
plague, the cure for which is found in the ship's well-stocked sick
bay.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of nine movies, there has been no evidence that
the staff of the Enterprise's sick bay could cure so much as a
hangnail, let alone a mysterious pox brought aboard by some alien
creature with two heads and six arms. The Enterprise may as well
convert the sick bay to shuffleboard courts for all the good it
does.
</P>
<P>
   4. A power surge on the bridge fails to electrocute the user of
the computer panel due to a highly sophisticated 24th-century surge
protection device called a ``fuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy from ``Home Improvement'' would feel right at home on
the Enterprise, where you can't even plug in your electric
toothbrush without causing a fire or electrocuting half the crew.
Perhaps the Enterprise's electronics were designed by the same
geniuses who wired the Mir.

   5. Somebody takes out a shuttle and it doesn't explode or crash.
As with the sick bay, I don't know why the Enterprise bothers with
shuttles. Just select the person or persons you want to ride in the
thing, then line them up against the wall and shoot them. It would
be cheaper, a lot less messy and allow more time for the users of
the computer panel to electrocute themselves.
</P>
<P>
   6. The crew of the Enterprise is captured by a vastly superior
alien intelligence that does NOT put them on trial.
</P>
<P>
   What is this thing that vastly superior alien life forms of the
24th century have with trials? Don't they have Court TV in the
future? Can't they just run down to Blockbuster and rent a copy of
the Simpson trial? Perhaps aliens in the future are all Republicans
and just like staging trials whether they have a good reason or
not.

WE STILL DON'T GET BILL AND HIS WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday March 16)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yeah, I watched it. We learned that Monica is still afraid of
Ken Starr, that she feels sorry for hurting Hillary and Chelsea,
that at first she thought the blue dress was funny. But we still
don't know much more about the man she calls her sexual soulmate.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the others? I kept thinking about Juanita. Where
does unhappy Juanita fit in with the hundreds of women who Monica
says Bill Clinton had sex with.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in those relatively naive days before Monica and
before Kathleen but long after Gennifer and right after Paula, I
was trying to sort out why many women were remaining loyal to Bill.
I decided that we had a sisterly relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
   He was the brother with the potential, and we were the sisters
who depended on him to make the family proud, even though he had
this one jerk tendency.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of the family and for the sake of Bill we tried to
emphasize his strong points and downplay, even rationalize, his
weak points. In the long run he was capable of doing so much good
that we felt it necessary to stand united behind him, although
privately, when we heard rumors, we wanted to hiss, ``Knock it
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it got worse, as things often do when you cross
your fingers and wish problems would just go away. Monica followed
Paula and Kathleen followed Monica. And we found it harder to think
of him as our hero. He was starting to embarrass the family.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were no other heroes, and we'd hung in with him
this far.
</P>
<P>
   And so we took Hillary's cue and held his hand and said this was
a private matter and had nothing to do with the presidency, even
though we were inwardly disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Juanita. She made it harder than ever for the sisters
because what she claims happened with Brother Bill goes way beyond
being a rogue, a skirt chaser, a crude make-out man and even an
adulterer.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita said he raped her.
</P>
<P>
   We may still get into debates on what is sexual harassment and
whether you can have an affair without intercourse, but we
understand rape.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what Juanita's story is about. She worked on his
campaign, and they were friendly. She said he asked to come up to
her hotel room. She didn't feel endangered. He tried to kiss her
and bit her lip. He pushed her on the bed and she said no. It was
not consentual.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the chilling end in Juanita's story. He goes to
leave, puts on his sunglasses and tells her she better do something
about that lip.
</P>
<P>
   The way she tells it makes Clinton sound so smug, so belittling
toward her that you can understand why she would stay angry and
humiliated for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some accused her of lying, but they were halfhearted critics and
sounded as practiced as a lawyer jumping up in court and yelling
``Objection.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work as well this time. In the past the woman who have
accused Bill Clinton have been more easily and readily varnished,
at least at first, as being a bimbo, gold digger, temptress, even
slightly disturbed. They could be lying or exaggerating or doing it
for the money. Maybe they just misinterpreted his warm, friendly
nature.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as you don't want to believe Juanita, she is
believable, especially given Clinton's record. Even if you have no
more energy to deal with another accusation, she can't be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Ireland, head of the National Organization for Women,
said she understands why Juanita would have resisted coming
forward. She also said she doesn't expect an explanation from
Clinton because his denials aren't worth the air it takes to say
them or the paper it takes to write them.'
</P>
<P>
   If Juanita had charged Bill Clinton with rape 21 years ago,
would that have made a difference? He was state attorney general
and running for governor, a high-powered man. And she let him into
her room. And she did go to a fund-raiser for him later on. They
would have barbecued her, but still it might have alerted someone,
maybe even Clinton himself, that there was a problem that could get
him into big trouble down the road, even kill the dreams he and
Hillary had taken such care to fashion. Maybe he would have gotten
some counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he has all of us armchair analysts taking one more
voyeuristic tour through the Oval Office to catch him if we can.
</P>
<P>
   Monica spoke well. She was poised, charming in a bright-eyed way
and believable, even when she says she's giving up married men.
</P>
<P>
   But her old boyfriend, our president, is still a worry.

COUPLE SEEKS TO ADOPT A BABY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday March 18)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martha notices babies everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the mall, sleeping so sweetly in strollers. In restaurant
booster seats. Cooing in their mom's arms.
</P>
<P>
   She can't wait to be one of those women pushing a stroller,
holding a bottle or patting a warm, wriggly bundle on their
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But the path to finding her baby has been frustrating and
arduous. A year of fertility treatment, including artificial
insemination and injectable drugs. Three shots a day. Frequent
visits to the fertility clinic for Martha and her husband, Mike.
Four failed attempts to coax a zygote from egg and sperm. A bill of
$3,000 each time.
</P>
<P>
   After the last treatment, all the signs were there: a maternal
glow, the camellia in the side yard bursting into bloom, an
intuitive feeling that this would be the time the miracle would
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the letdown and the mourning for the child that wasn't
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the time had come for the question: Do we want to adopt?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always wanted to be pregnant, to have a baby and feel
her kick inside me. Letting go was hard. But at that point, I
thought, we can make our family in a different way. With adoption
you know at the end of that road there's a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciding to pursue adoption led to dozens of new questions:
Domestic or foreign? Older child or infant? Private lawyer or
agency?
</P>
<P>
   After research, including talks with several adoptive parents
and an adoption consultant, Martha and Mike decided on domestic
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a newborn,'' Martha says. ``Through international
adoptions, an infant can be up to 12 months old. And, in the U.S.,
there's a much greater chance of prenatal care and education.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, they found a few books that were particularly
helpful, such as ``Raising Adopted Children,'' by Lois Ruskai
Melina, and ``The Adoption Resource Book'' by Lois Gilman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one of the books, it said that when you adopt, people will
say to you, `Oh, you got your baby the easy way,' '' Martha said.
``But there's nothing easy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``birth mother letter'' was especially difficult to write.
</P>
<P>
   What image in their family photos, what reassuring words, would
convince a young, pregnant stranger that they were the couple to
raise her baby?
</P>
<P>
   They wrote about their house on a quiet street in suburban
Atlanta, their dog who was rescued from an animal shelter, shared
backpacking trips, family reunions at the beach and a vacation to
Australia, complete with kangaroo sightings.
</P>
<P>
   They wrote about why they wanted to bring a child into their
home, into their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they mailed the letter to lawyers and agencies, to go in
files thick with other letters, other photos of smiling couples
hoping to be selected.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night sometimes, I'll see a real vivid picture in my mind
of our baby on the changing table with me doing raspberries on her
tummy, and she's giggling and kicking her feet,'' Martha says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fills me with warmth and happiness. And it keeps me from
getting too anxious about all the hurdles we still have to clear.''

GORE MAY FACE CONTESTS IN MASSACHUSETTS, NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore makes his first
official presidential campaign visit to New Hampshire on Monday, he
will be coming to a state where he has the largest share of
Democratic money and support. But despite his appearance as the
inevitable nominee, the race may be far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic activists and political analysts interviewed this
week said that of all the states where Gore will run against former
New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, New Hampshire and Massachusetts
top the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``His biggest challenge is probably that both states like there
to be a contest,'' said Clinton's former labor secretary, Robert B.
Reich.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire voters never give anybody a free ride. They want
their candidates tested in the battle of primary campaigns,'' said
Reich, an economist at Brandeis University. ``Massachusetts is a
politically sophisticated state, a liberal state, that will not be
taken for granted,''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit Monday will mark his 15th trip to New Hampshire
since 1994, which is double the number of visits then-Vice
President George Bush made to the Granite State at a similiar point
in his 1988 campaign for the presidency. Bush had made only seven
trips to New Hamsphire by March 1987, and a total of 23 before the
state's primary in February 1988, according to trip records
provided by his presidential library in College Station, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After a rally and meeting with Democratic activists in
Manchester, Gore will fly to Iowa, where the first presidential
caucuses are held, to campaign in Des Moines. He will return to New
Hampshire on March 26-27 to attend three ``house parties'' with
small groups of voters and to address a county Democratic gathering
in the eastern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say that among Gore's challenges in New Hampshire is
proving that he can do retail politicking just as ably as President
Clinton and finding a way to do it, despite his Secret Service
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he can't run for president behind a rope line,'' said
Gore backer Jeff Woodburn, former chairman of the New Hampshire
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Woodburn said Gore must also step outside of Clinton's shadow
and exert his independence, which Gore advisers suggested won't
occur until much later this year. And he'll be pressed to take time
from his day job to campaign directly against Bradley, whose
one-on-one skills off the basketball court have been lauded even by
Gore allies, especially in a state with a penchant for hurting the
front-runner and propelling the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary is about 11 months away. Anything can happen
between now and then,'' said Kathy Sullivan, the new chairwoman of
the New Hampshire's state Democratic Party. ``From what I've seen,
the vice president is taking New Hampshire very seriously, and we
expect to see a lot more of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts, where Gore has personal connections _ having
graduated from Harvard University, while his wife, Tipper,
graduated from Boston University _ might also present challenges
for Gore, despite his tremendous organizational and fund-raising
advantage over Bradley. Bradley has yet to begin organizing in
Massachusetts, though his aides say he will soon release the names
of some of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Gore is in the middle of a feud between Boston
Mayor Thomas M. Menino and Housing and Urban Development Secretary
Andrew Cuomo over alleged discrimination in the city's public
housing.
</P>
<P>
   And the Clinton-Gore team's preference for Los Angeles over
Boston as the site for the Democratic National Convention in 2000
didn't sit well with the mayor. Gore has visited California 53
times since 1993, and said last week that the nation's largest
state deserved more of his attention, a comment that, while
arguably true, made even some of his allies cringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd just assume he stay here than in California,'' quipped
Woodburn. ``Maybe he's just warming up for a general election. He
can do that and just make sure he's in New Hampshire in February.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently seizing an opening, Bradley initiated a meeting a
couple of weeks ago with Menino, a conversation that the former
senator's communications director, Anita Dunn, described as a
get-acquainted session and an exchange of views about issues facing
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Menino, through a spokesman, declined to comment for this
report.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said the flap hasn't affected the
vice president's relationship with Menino or created problems for
his campaign in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we view our relationship with the mayor the same way
it has always been, which is a great relationship,'' Lehane said,
after listing various federal projects that Gore helped steer to
Boston, including money for the city's empowerment zone.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said Bradley views the Bay State as potentially friendly
turf because Clinton and Gore didn't have to actively compete there
in 1992 when Paul Tsongas, the late Massachusetts senator, was a
candidate. It was a similar situation in Iowa, she said, where
Senator Tom Harkin was running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a critical state and it's a state where we believe Bill
Bradley can do well,'' Dunn said. ``Massachusetts is not a state
where Clinton-Gore ever had much of an infrastructure. They didn't
contest it in '92, so it's a little bit like Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Landy, a political scientist at Boston College, said
many local politicians could jump on the Gore bandwagon if he looks
like a sure winner. ``Many officeholders in Massachusetts really
felt in '92 that they were on the sidelines because of the Tsongas
campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark Hubbard, a political scientist at the University of
New Hampshire, said Massachusetts, even more than the Granite
State, might prove an interesting matchup between Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's particular brand of politics, that kind of
intellectual approach to policy liberalism is the kind that plays
well in Massachusetts,'' he said. Hubbard added that former
Governor William F. Weld ``is a Republican example of that kind of
approach, and I think Bradley could make a stronger run against
Gore in Massachusetts than he can in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodburn said Gore could be helped in New Hampshire by the
state's open primary laws that enable Democrats to vote in the
Republican primary, which may have as many as 11 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``A smaller turnout is going to help the better organized,
incumbent candidate,'' Woodburn said. Even so, he added, ``The race
is going to tighten, and it's going to be a fight and Al Gore is
going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich said Gore's ``biggest danger is keeping his candidacy
fresh and interesting. The American public bores quickly. Gore has
been a highly visible vice president. He's a known commodity. The
Clinton-Gore administration for all its strengths and faults is
also likely to be shopworn after eight years,,'' he said. ``How
does Gore communicate new energy, vitality, and excitement? That's
the big question.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PUEBLO, Mexico _ Among the many books in the governor's mansion
in this state east of Mexico City, Manuel Bartlett Diaz kept a copy
of ``The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an amusing choice of reading for a man struggling to
overcome an image as one of Mexico's most endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett -- who wants to be Mexico's next president -- has a
reputation for being one of the country's crustiest ``dinosaurs,''
the nickname for the authoritarian faction that used to control the
Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The party, which celebrated its 70th year in power this month,
has dominated the Mexican presidency and nearly every other aspect
of political life here since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   However, the PRI has been losing ground in recent years, and in
July 2000 could face Mexico's most competitive presidential
election yet. Hoping to energize its grassroots supporters, it has
decided to establish a more democratic internal process to select
its nominee for the election. Ironically, Bartlett -- considered by
many to be the consummate anti-democrat -- is benefiting most from
more party democracy and emerging as a front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where rumors substitute for solid information,
Bartlett is haunted by unproved allegations that he masterminded
electoral fraud for the PRI a decade ago and has consorted with
drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the favorite of President Ernesto Zedillo, a PRI
reformist and one of the 'technocrats' or free-market proponents
now dominating the party. But Bartlett is a shrewd politician who
is popular in Puebla, the state he governed for six years until
last month, and surveys show he is a top choice among the party's
rank-and-file.
</P>
<P>
   That support is significant because later this year, for the
first time in the PRI's history, the rank-and-file will be allowed
a voice in selecting the party's presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a candidate for the presidency of the republic in a
totally new process,'' said Bartlett, beaming with confidence in a
recent interview with Cox News Service.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the PRI's candidate has always been hand-picked by
the sitting president of the republic in secret machinations known
as the ``dedazo,'' the ``big finger.'' But this May the party is
expected to devise a new system for holding primaries to select a
candidate either by direct votes or through delegates at a national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect is delicious to Bartlett, who exudes the enthusiasm
of a born-again democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``For six decades the decision as to who would be the
presidential candidate was made behind-the-scenes by people on
high,'' Bartlett said. ``This process was useful and worked for
many years. But now it doesn't work because the country has changed
and we have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, following a speech by Zedillo endorsing the concept
of rank-and-file voting, Bartlett wasted no time in kicking his
campaign into gear.
</P>
<P>
   He made political history here by becoming the first PRI hopeful
to start airing television commercials explicitly depicting himself
as the best choice for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He is challenging potential rivals serving in the federal
government to give up their jobs and declare themselves candidates,
too, so the fight can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett has set up campaign headquarters in Mexico City and
other cities, and is making rounds to shore up his support among
PRI-affiliated labor unions and other party associations.
</P>
<P>
   At a speech last month before the Revolutionary Confederation of
Workers and Farmers, a PRI-controlled union, Bartlett gave the
crowd what it wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bases resent the loss of vigor in our party, resent its
separation from popular concerns,'' he said to cheers and
backslapping. ``They demand that the party be rescued.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Bartlett tried to drum up support at a Mexico City
university recently students mocked him with signs calling him
``Manuel Barney,'' a play on the stuffed purple dinosaur toy.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts too find Bartlett's embrace of democracy surprising,
given his strong-man image.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he thought he'd get the 'dedazo,' he'd never be in favor of
democracy now,'' said Luis Miguel Rionda, a political scientist at
Mexico's University of Guanajuato.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Licona Ygaldi, director of Market Research, a polling
firm in Mexico City, said that Bartlett's chances at the nomination
are very good if hard-core PRI activists are allowed to vote
without interference by the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The militants want Bartlett because he would protect them.
He's a true PRIista(CQ). He's totally different than the
technocrats,'' said Licona. ``His message is he's strong, firm,
capable of governing. And he's confronted the president by
criticizing his neo-liberal policies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He also inspires fear,'' Licona added. ``Some people think,
'He'll get rid of crime, but he might get rid of me, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Free-market changes pushed by Zedillo and other technocrats --
including the sale of state-owned industries and reduced tariffs on
imports -- have left some PRI members disgruntled.
</P>
<P>
   Many blame the policies for deepening poverty and driving people
away from the PRI, which no longer controls the Congress nor all
state governorships.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's populist rhetoric is aimed at the disaffected, who
long to revive a paternalistic system that exchanges votes for the
PRI with special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of Mexico has to make social needs a top
priority,'' said Bartlett. ``We can't maintain social peace in the
country if we don't make sure the country is employed and that
poverty doesn't get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett believes the PRI must attend to the poor, and he isn't
shy about claiming personal responsibility for providing basic
services like water and sewage systems to his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   He has softened his opposition to free trade, noting that during
his term as governor Puebla's giant Volkswagen plant expanded,
producing more automobiles for export and attracting more foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean that we don't think globalization has its
serious problems, not just for Mexico but for the world,'' Bartlett
said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, who inherited his last name from an English
grandfather, has a long history in public life in Mexico. Even
those who would never vote for him regard him as intelligent,
quick-witted and an able administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The fit 61-year-old bears a striking resemblance to CNN's
popular talk show host Larry King. He's held several powerful jobs,
including secretary of public education and secretary of the
interior.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the latter post that Bartlett, in charge of the
nation's elections, was widely denounced as the mastermind of
alleged fraud during the 1988 presidential race -- which put the
PRI's Carlos Salinas de Gortari into office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That claim is absurd,'' Bartlett said, arguing that several
investigations have absolved him.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett is equally upset by persistent allegations that have
cast him in an evil light in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An informant told United States authorities that Bartlett was
present at a torture session of Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, a U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was murdered in Mexico in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Camarena case is another false statement that's used to
attack me politically,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was forced to hire a law firm in the United States to
represent him and has provided evidence showing that the
informant's story was fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities requested that Bartlett testify before a grand
jury in the United States, but he declined to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not submit to any grand jury or any justice system of
another country,'' he said, ``because I have not been (formally)
accused of anything. I am the victim, and it's the responsibility
of the United States government to clarify this. I've done my
part.''

 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ All is not utopia in the brave new Internet flea
markets. Just ask the customers of Craig Lee Hare.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the Federal Trade Commission charged Hare, of Lake
Worth, Fla., with fraud for collecting thousands of dollars from
buyers who responded to his bogus offers for used computer
equipment. Hare had posted ads on the popular eBay on-line auction
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities shut down Hare's operation, and he was
eventually convicted of fraud, sentenced to six months' home
detention, ordered to pay restitution of $22,000 and barred for
life from conducting business on Internet auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Hare's customers apparently aren't the only ones who have been
burned by on-line auction sites. In early January, the New York
City Department of Consumer Affairs began investigating eBay's
practices regarding the buying and selling of fake sports
memorabilia, including bogus autographed baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these reports, on-line auction houses continue to be the
current Internet rage, creating a thriving home business meant for
people like Lela McKenna, 36, a mother of two in Castro Valley,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work part-time at a store to earn spending money,''
McKenna said. ``But after a full Saturday shift, and after taxes, I
found myself coming home with $35.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, McKenna, a long-time toy collector, discovered
eBay while surfing the Web. After some initial sales from her
Barbie collection, McKenna quit her job and now spends her spare
time auctioning and buying Japanese fashion dolls and Asian comic
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put in about an hour keeping up with my auctions, and I can
clear four or five hundred dollars,'' she said. ``I don't have to
cope with spending my afternoons restocking shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors seem to agree with the San Jose-based eBay, which,
like most on-line auction houses, connects sellers and buyers in a
highest bid contest. As of Monday, eBay had $20.5 billion in market
capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   In traders' books, eBay is now worth more than Kmart and
Seattle's on-line bookseller Amazon.com, the legendary Web success
story.
</P>
<P>
   As auction sites proliferate _ there are nearly 200 auction
sites open on the Internet _ so do concerns about consumer fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, on-line auction fraud has become the most
common form of fraud on the Internet, according to the Internet
Fraud Watch, a division of the National Consumers League advocacy
group based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auction sites are popular right now, and as more and more
people come onto the Internet, they check the sites out,'' said
Cleo Manuel, a spokeswoman for Internet Fraud Watch. ``Con artists
naturally gravitate to what's popular and new.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has begun looking into the problem of protecting
consumers who use on-line auctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always advise people not to send money, like money orders
or cashier's check, for on-line purchases,'' said Eileen
Harrington, director for marketing practices with the FTC.
Harrington said that the nature of on-line auctions, like other
Internet transactions, seems to prompt some consumers to spend
money in reckless ways, giving scam artists new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd never just talk to someone on the phone about a used car
you saw in a classified ad, then send him a check,'' Harrington
said, ``but people do that all the time on the Internet.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the authorities chase down bad on-line auction site
sellers and try to figure out who exactly carries the liability for
on-line auction fraud, consumer advocates and auction sites are
publicizing safeguards that consumers can follow to keep themselves
from becoming victims.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a digest of some of those safeguards. Many of these tips
were gleaned from ``Going, Going, Burned!'' by Beth Laurence,
published in the current issue of Nolo News, the quarterly
publication of Berkeley-based Nolo Press, the legal self-help book
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   _ Educate yourself. All on-line auction sites have extensive
rules and frequently asked questions (FAQ) pages. Keep in mind that
different auction sites have different rules, so take the time to
read each site's information carefully. Also, check out the various
on-line auction chat rooms such as AuctionWatch
(www.auctionwatch.com) for talk of bum sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Start small. You'll reduce your risk while you learn the
ropes. At eBay, free insurance guards transactions up to $200, with
a $25 deductible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beware of shields and shills. A shill is auction talk for a
seller or friend of a seller who puts bogus bids on an item to
drive up its cost. A shield is someone who bids on an item to drive
up prices and drive away legitimate buyers. At the last minute, the
shield withdraws his or her bid, letting a co-conspirator get the
item at a lower cost. You can sometimes spot a shill or shield by
similarities in e-mail addresses between a seller and a high
bidder. The better defense is to avoid bidding wars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your market. Internet auctions don't automatically mean
bargains. Sellers are trying to get the highest price for their
goods and will hype their products in the descriptions. Compare
real-world prices at local stores and antiques shops before
bidding. Also, don't forget to factor in shipping costs while
you're bidding. Usually the buyer pays for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your seller. Before the sale closes, phone the seller to
confirm condition of the goods, shipment methods and costs. Also,
check out the track record of your seller. Most auction sites have
feedback forums that list a history of the seller's transactions,
buyer satisfaction, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep records. Print out everything relating to the sale,
including any e-mail you exchange with a seller, the original
posting of the item and any pictures included with the posting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use an escrow service. After a bid is accepted, an escrow
company collects the buyer's payment. Those funds are released to
the seller after the buyer receives and inspects the item and finds
it satisfactory. Escrow services usually charge a small percentage
of the sale price, but are well worth it for expensive items.
Companies providing the service include I-escrow (www.iescrow.com)
and Tradesafe (www.tradesafe.com).

WELL-TOLD, JUST NOT SO WELL-FILMED (For use by NYTimes News Service

By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In August 1994, former ``Saturday Night Live'' player Julia
Sweeney's life took a sudden downturn: Doctors discovered that her
brother Mike had advanced-stage lymphoma. Mike and Sweeney's
parents moved in with Sweeney during his chemotherapy, cramping
life at her dream house. And in March 1995 _ shortly before Mike's
death _ Sweeney found out that she had ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   From this year of hell, Sweeney developed the one-woman show,
``God Said, `Ha!' '' What started as a stage play evolved into a
book, a double-CD album and, now, a movie. It remains a funny,
moving piece, and happily, Sweeney steers clear of anything too
maudlin. But although Sweeney has said she likes the movie version
best, the film is a little odd.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney is attractive and articulate, and you could do worse
than spend an hour and a half with her. But ``God Said, `Ha!' ''
doesn't look as if it was ever meant to be on film (Sweeney's pal
Quentin Tarantino acted as executive producer), and it's often
awkward, as most photographed stage plays are. Sweeney moves around
on her mock-living-room set, and the camera moves almost
independently of her: Sometimes, she looks straight into the lens,
as if she were addressing her movie audience; other times, she's
shown in profile, looking dreamily off into space as if she were
blissfully unaware that anyone would be watching. This calls
attention to itself, as does a moment of rapid editing and another
moment when the camera draws back to show ... more cameras!
</P>
<P>
   The movements distract from Sweeney's words, which are full of
small gems about what it's like to be a single woman in your
mid-'30s living with your parents again, sneaking a forbidden
cigarette or trysting with a lover during one of those rare times
when the house is empty. The movie's advantage over all its other
source material is that it gives you some close-up views of
Sweeney's expressive face, which add to the amusement in her
anecdotes about her devoutly Catholic but somewhat daffy mother and
to the pathos when Sweeney tells of her brother's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the earlier incarnations will notice that a
couple of humorous stories (about attending a Broadway show with
her parents and about being ignored at Starbucks) have been
excised. Although those portions are missed, their omission is
probably a good thing: The CD version of the show runs more than
two hours, which would be far too long for a one-person movie.
Sweeney directed herself, and that's a minor tactical error; if
someone like Jonathan Demme, who has shown a knack for filming
performance in ``Stop Making Sense'' and ``Swimming to Cambodia,''
had been behind the camera, this really could have come to life.
The words remain entertaining, and they make the film worthwhile _
even if, in the end, it doesn't amount to much of a movie.

GE STUDY ON PCB CONTAMINATION DRAWS SKEPTICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The New York attorney general's office and
environmentalists have questioned the validity of the latest study
on PCBs that showed no significant increase in cancer deaths among
workers who were exposed to the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed by the General Electric Co., which stands
to lose hundreds of millions of dollars if found liable for
cleaning up the tons of PCBs that were discharged into the Hudson
River from its factories in Fort Edward and Hudson Falls between
1946 and 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is weighing whether GE
should dredge the chemicals from the river or leave them untouched.
A decision is expected in early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   This latest study, released Wednesday, did not address the issue
of the Hudson River and won't settle the continuing debate between
environmentalists and GE, which is based in Fairfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general is quite skeptical,'' said Marc Violette,
a spokesman for state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. ``This report
appears to contradict scores of independent studies over the years
which show known health risks associated with PCB exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, the federal government has characterized
PCBs as probable human carcinogens, in part because of a 1975 study
by Dr. Renate Kimbrough that linked PCBs and cancer in laboratory
rats.
</P>
<P>
   Kimbrough, the lead researcher on the latest study, said there's
no evidence that the chemicals pose a similar risk to humans. The
study, the largest done to date, focused on 7,075 men and women who
worked at the plants between 1946 and 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers looked at the 1,195 workers in the group who
have since died and compared the causes of death to national and
regional averages. Among all workers, even those with the highest
exposures to PCBs, they found that the death rate attributable to
cancer was the same or lower than would be expected in the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is looking at all of these workers and doing
all of these analyses, we did not find any significant health
effects,'' Kimbrough said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are trying to determine why lab studies on rats don't
always translate into similar results in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason you may have this discrepancy is that humans just
don't react to the same insults of PCBs as humans,'' Kimbrough
said.
</P>
<P>
   PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, are man-made, non-flammable
chemicals that were used commercially by GE as the insulation in
large transformers and capacitors. They were also used as coolants,
lubricants and hydraulic fluids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think this is a very significant study and needs to be
factored into the regulatory discussion on PCBs and on the public
discussion,'' GE spokesman Mark Behan said at a news conference in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Behan declined to say how much the study cost, although he said
the company has spent ``millions'' on PCB research.
</P>
<P>
   State Health Department officials said they were in the middle
of reviewing the study.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists expressed skepticism as to how much weight the
study might carry with policymakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still hoping GE will be compelled to clean up the Hudson
River and do so quickly,'' said Larry Shapiro, the senior attorney
for the New York Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Lee, environmental director for Scenic Hudson in
Poughkeepsie, a river advocacy group, questioned the way the study
was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that when there's more analysis of this report, we're
going to find a lot of problems with the way this data was used,''
she said. ``Statistics can do whatever you want them to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimbrough defended her scientific method, adding that an
independent panel of experts reviewed her work during the eight
years it took to complete the study. She said she used various
sources of information, from GE company records to Credit Bureau
reports. At one point, she hired private investigators to help her
locate workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like counting beans,'' she said. ``You get the death
certificates and compare them to the general population. There's
really no way to bias that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public should be skeptical about sources of information
and keep in mind that there are vested interests at work.''

GOP DEBATES ITS SOUL AND SUBSTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 14)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As roughly a dozen aspirants line up to challenge
one other for the Republican presidential nomination next year, the
most profound decision GOP voters may face is deciding which
philosophical route they plan to take into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be the road of pragmatic progressivism and
internationalism or that of myopic nationalism and a return to
isolationist-protectionist policies of the distant past?
</P>
<P>
   With so many contenders, the Republicans have a choice among
candidates who represent a broad spectrum of ideas and values. All
of them talk of reduced government, less federal spending, tax cuts
and the return of more responsibilities to the local level.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Democrats, they promise to protect Social
Security and Medicare and boost funding for national defense.
</P>
<P>
   But they are divided on matters such as abortion, equal justice
for gays, shifting educational funds from public to private
schools, restoring prayer to the classroom and various other
policies advocated by the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over a party's soul and substance is not new to
either Republicans or Democrats. And it is the kind of debate both
should have almost constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Although a political party needs a philosophical base _ whether
it be right, left or center _ it also needs to be a living, dynamic
institution, not a petrified structure bound to the policies of
yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party was ripped asunder in the 1960s by the
Vietnam War, a revolutionary shift in moral values and violent
demonstrations in cities and on college campuses. But it struggled
back, with the help of Richard Nixon and Watergate and eventually
Bill Clinton's efforts to move the party from the left to the
center of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Now it must find its way into the future by trying to escape the
odor of the Clinton impeachment scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have faced internecine warfare repeatedly since
Theodore Roosevelt, in a dramatic break with the past, gave America
a new purpose and new vision at the beginning of the 20th century.
He made the United States a world power, won the Nobel Peace Prize
for mediating an end to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05, went
after monopolies as an aggressive trust-buster, built the Panama
Canal and decreed that the safest foreign policy for the United
States was to ``speak softly and carry a big stick.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP retreated into isolationism between World Wars I and II
but shed that tainted veil with the election of Dwight D.
Eisenhower as president in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ike 47 years ago, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, son of the
last Republican president, symbolizes the Republican establishment,
which has played a major role in setting America's foreign policy
agenda in the second half of this century.The symbol at the other
end of the spectrum _ the one that calls for trade protectionism, a
pullback of America's responsibilities abroad and a tough stance
against immigration _ is Patrick Buchanan, the one-time Nixon
speech writer who is making his third try for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The other contenders seem to be situated ideologically in
between.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who still must define his stands on crucial issues, has a
bounty of endorsements and attributes that should be the envy of
his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But no prize may be more vital to his future than the fact that
he is supported by half or more of the 31 Republican governors, the
men and women who direct the destinies of their states with an
admirable mixture of efficiency, pragmatism and political
perspicacity. They can help him win primaries and carry their
states on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Probably not since Eisenhower snatched the GOP nomination from
the conservative Sen. Robert A.Taft nearly a half century ago has a
Republican presidential hopeful's bid been bolstered by so many
sitting governors.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them find in Bush the kind of forward-looking moderate
who reflects their own approach to governmental problems and who
stands as a barrier to a total takeover of the party by the
right-wing militants. The governors also see him as a winner with
an ample bankroll at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, as the personification of the Republican
establishment, is exactly the kind of opponent Buchanan relishes.
Buchanan is at war with the establishment. He tried unsuccessfully
to snatch the GOP nomination from President George Bush in 1992 and
then from Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ike, Governor Bush is not a war hero whose popularity
transcends partisanship. Nor are times as desperate as they were in
1952, when Ike was seen by Americans as the leader who could
extricate the nation from a bloody, stalemated conflict in Korea
while at the same time continuing to support war-ravaged Western
Europe with the Marshall Plan and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle for the soul of the Republican Party may be just
as intense in 2000 as it was 47 years ago. Buchanan, a politician
with street-brawler instincts and a certain appeal to industrial
workers and their families, will not be bound by Marquis of
Queensbury rules.
</P>
<P>
   That means Bush and other contenders for the GOP nomination had
better prepare to remove their gloves and get ready for a good
fight. The battle should be a lively one: compassionate
conservatism vs. a passionate return to Old Guardism.

DECISION ON 2003 SUPER BOWL DUE SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The National Football League plans an
announcement soon on whether it will confirm or withdraw its
invitation to San Francisco to serve as host city for the Super
Bowl in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL withdraws the invitation at its annual meeting in
Phoenix next week, a regional task force will offer a plan to host
the game in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding to host Super Bowls is intense because the games
have been shown to generate revenues of $200 million to $300
million for their host cities.
</P>
<P>
   Staff-level discussions between the Oakland Coliseum and the NFL
have been held, according to Coliseum Commissioner Gail Steele.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco 49ers and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown say
they expect to have a stadium built in time for Super Bowl XXXVII,
but the chairman of the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Commission,
Ignacio de la Fuente, said Wednesday he doubted that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an item of urgency,'' he said. ``We are going to be
ready and let the NFL know we have corporate backing.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente said a 7,500-seat expansion of the coliseum's
capacity to 70,000 seats _ the minimum the NFL requires for Super
Bowls _ would cost $750,000 to $1 million. Corporate support would
be needed to make the host plan work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue expressed doubts in January
about San Francisco as the host city. A league spokesman said
Wednesday that a decision on San Francisco as site for the 2003
Super Bowl would be made public Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing problems with the 49ers' proposal to build a new stadium
and adjoining commercial center, at a cost of $525 million,
Tagliabue said in January that Super Bowl XXXVII would be moved to
another city if the project did not come together soon.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue mentioned San Diego, Oakland and Los Angeles as
alternative sites, singling out San Diego as the ``front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco stadium proposal has been dogged by delays,
rising estimates and management problems. The team's co-owner,
Edward DeBartolo Jr., has been suspended over his conviction in a
federal gambling and bribery case.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo was suspended provisionally through the end of the
1999 season, but the league has indicated that final action may be
taken next week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brown is still engaged in talks with Tagliabue in an
effort to keep the game in the city, there is no design yet for a
new stadium and the troubled project's environmental impact report
is overdue. Nor have club officials dealt with demands from public
officials that they provide up to $60 million to offset anticipated
effects on traffic, transportation and parks.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Singer, spokesman for the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. of
Youngstown, Ohio, which controls the club and would build the
stadium, said this week that the corporation intends to meet NFL
requirements for the 2003 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing everything within our power to try to provide a
venue,'' Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   Design and financing proposals recently were presented to
corporate officials, he said, adding, ``They're looking at a
variety of options and opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The corporation has not officially backed away from the original
$525 million project that San Francisco voters approved in 1997,
but it also has said it was exploring all options.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with DeBartolo Corp. deliberations said little
concrete detail was in place when the company's chairman and chief
executive officer, Denise DeBartolo York, took over club operations
from her brother, Eddie, late in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hampered by Eddie's having forged ahead without really
taking a look at how to make this thing work,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing that now _ talking to architects, banks and
planners. Their heart is in trying to make it work for 2003, but
they're also behind because Eddie left them holding the bag on
something he hadn't fleshed out.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's spokesman, Rick Rice, denied the accusation, saying
that when DeBartolo voluntarily stepped down from club management,
``he felt the project was in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie remains committed to the stadium. He was diligently
pursuing that project,'' Rice said.

`WING COMMANDER' DOESN'T FLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The theater was abuzz at the promotional screening for ``Wing
Commander'' _ but not because of ``Wing Commander,'' which turns
out to be as interesting as dropping $6.50 in a video game and then
standing there staring at it with your hands in your pockets for an
hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   No, the excitement had to do with ``Wing Commander's'' being a
20th Century Fox movie _ making it possible, just possible, that
there would be a new preview for the new ``Star Wars'' movie
attached. No such luck. Much of the crowd even sat through ``Wing
Commander's'' closing credits, in the hopes that the trailer would
appear after the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they were just asleep. Or maybe they thought that
``Wing Commander'' was the trailer, although that's unlikely,
because it's the kind of imagination-starved space opera that the
first ``Star Wars'' made obsolete. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew
Lillard play hotshot pilots, ``Top Gun''-style: Prinze is the
maverick who inevitably falls for his female wing commander _ and
somewhat inexplicably, since Saffron Burrows plays her with all the
personality of a cantaloupe. Lillard plays the clown who you just
know will be a danger to himself and others; Jon Cryer's ``For some
reason, everybody calls me `Dead Meat''' refrain from ``Hot
Shots!'' kept springing to mind.
</P>
<P>
   This Freddie Prinze Jr. thing _ don't get it. Yes, the hot young
star is good-looking, and he has a pedigree replete with tragedy.
That doesn't mean he can act, although he is expanding his range:
In ``She's All That,'' he expressed emotions with a furrowed brow,
as if he were fighting off a migraine; in ``Wing Commander,'' he
expresses them with a gaping mouth, as if he were a goldfish
panicked about a lack of water. Lillard, probably the hammiest of
the current crop of young actors, is fun to watch for a while, but
then the screenplay forces him to ``think about what he's done,''
and he becomes serious and boring.
</P>
<P>
   The plot? It's something about humans battling aliens called the
Kilrathi, who are apparently terrifying because they recall bad
'50s sci-fi. There's also some blather about how Prinze's Blair is
a human/alien half-breed, which gives him intuitive navigational
skills but also makes all his allies suspicious of him. Director
Chris Roberts, who created the Wing Commander computer game,
doesn't make things clear with his muddled screenplay (it often
sounds like a game-play manual), although it is comforting to know
that in 2564, we'll still be drinking Johnny Walker Red and saying
things like ``It ain't no thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A particularly charitable audience member remarked after the
screening that the movie reminded him of the first ``Star Wars.''
Well, that's true, in that it does have (celestial) stars, and it
is about a war. It doesn't have ground-breaking special effects, a
myth-making story, interesting lead characters or any supporting
characters to speak of (fine actors such as David Suchet and Jurgen
Prochnow are wasted). Look, ``Star Wars'' fans, if you REALLY need
to see a ``Phantom Menace'' trailer all that badly, download it
from the Web site. But what's your hurry? It's not like ``Menace''
will go away any time soon. ``Wing Commander,'' however, mercifully
will.

DE PALMA'S ORIGINAL SHAMES `CARRIE' UPDATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teen movies are to the late '90s what grunge music was to the
early '90s: A couple of hits, and suddenly everyone's playing
copycat, oblivious to the fact that such bandwagon-hopping leads to
a genre's self-destruction. With grunge, the success of Nirvana and
Pearl Jam left a trail of mediocrity in its wake; with movies,
``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' have led to such
losers as ``The Rage: Carrie 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Nominally a sequel to the 1976 Brian De Palma hit about a shy
and telekinetic teen girl, ``The Rage'' is more of a remake of
``Carrie'' _ and less a remake than a pastiche of the worst of
1999's ``other'' teen movies: ``She's All That'' (misfit heroine,
big party scene), ``Varsity Blues'' (sensitive jock hero, big
football game), ``Jawbreaker'' (conspiratorial vixens) and ``Cruel
Intentions'' (sexual games without thought of consequence).
``October Sky,'' a movie about teens that's not really a teen
movie, got left out, because no character in ``The Rage'' is a
rocket scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rage'' _ what a title _ doesn't even feature a character
named Carrie, unless you count the flashbacks featuring Sissy
Spacek from the '76 film. It's about Rachel Lang (newcomer Emily
Bergl), raised by trashy foster parents after her mother was
hospitalized for acute schizophrenia (seems Mom was unnerved by her
daughter's ability to move objects without touching them). Rachel
attracts the attention of the incurably romantic Jesse (Jason
London, twin brother of ``Party of Five's'' Jeremy), but she's
understandably suspicious of him, because Jesse's football-playing
buds are playing a game of sex-for-points, which led to the suicide
of Rachel's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period, ``The Rage'' looks like it's going to
transcend its teen-movie conventions with its sensitive (albeit
contrived) treatment of Rachel, whom Bergl plays with far too much
confidence for such an outsider character (Spacek earned an Oscar
nomination with her finely observed portrayal of the original
Carrie's introversion).
</P>
<P>
   But as the movie turns toward horror, it lapses into
heavy-handed melodramatics and ludicrousness. In the original,
Carrie's telekinesis stemmed from her repression _ she kept
feelings bottled up so deeply that when she let them loose, things
around her exploded. Here, Rachel's ... er, condition ... is
explained as a genetic disorder (Amy Irving, the only link to the
original, is saddled with this speech).
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Varsity Blues'' and the marginally better ``Cruel
Intentions,'' ``The Rage'' is uncomfortably obsessed with teen sex
_ it should've been called ``The Raging Hormones'' _ without a
thought about the dangers of AIDS or any other sexual fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``She's All That,'' it features a heroine who's only
unattractive in the Hollywood sense _ that is, she doesn't doll
herself up like all those nasty, evil girls do. As with almost all
the recent teen movies, the young people here are almost impossibly
affluent _ wait'll you see the house where the party scene takes
place _ and the outcast heroine is the only person from the wrong
side of the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the teens who bother to compare the original with
``Rage'' realize the difference between a movie with dazzling style
_ De Palma's master craftsmanship injected the original with
incredible flash and verve _ and a movie with little style at all.
Given that ``Rage,'' like the teen films it apes, reflects their
culture in the most cynical light, it may be time for the kids to
boycott.

   ARTISTS-MUSEUMS (New York) _ Of all the love-hate relationships
that roil the art world, none is more fraught or stimulating than
that between artists and museums. This makes perfect sense, since
the two occupy opposite ends of the art world food chain. Artists
make art; museums select some of that art for their collections,
where it is preserved, elevated and, most of all, displayed. Once
on view, it offers other artists inspiration, helping them unlock
their own talents, which brings the food chain full circle. This

<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affliction'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Nolte and James Coburn.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar nominee Nick Nolte gives a searing, career-defining
performance in this soul-weary study of one of the walking dead.
Nolte plays a troubled New England cop whose ``afflictions''
include an angry ex-wife, a frightened young daughter, a boss who
belittles him and a roaringly abusive father (James Coburn, also
Oscar-nominated). 1 hour, 44 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Analyze This'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   This farce about a mobster (Robert De Niro) who takes his issues
to a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) never becomes the laugh-riot it
could be. It's an offer you could refuse, but the stars (plus Lisa
Kudrow as Crystal's fiancee) make it worthwhile.1 hour, 46 minutes.
B
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Geniuses'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kathleen Turner, Peter MacNicol, Christoper Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Turner and Peter MacNicol play rival researchers _ she
the breathy villainess, he the bland do-bee _ rushing to crack the
baby talk code emanating from five brilliant babes. Sly _ the
toddler leader _ has got a secret twin and you've got yourself 94
minutes chock full of stupid pint-sized tricks from the brain of
Bob Clark. At first, ``Geniuses'' is dumb, and then it just gets
dumber.94 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved'' R (violent images, sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton and
Kimberly Elise.
</P>
<P>
   An A-list epic that inadvertently proves that Toni Morrison's
novels are unfilmable. Oprah Winfrey plays Sethe, a former slave
haunted by the ghost of her dead daughter, who takes in the
mysterious stranger Beloved (Thandie Newton). Too faithful to
Morrison's magic-realist prose, the movie substitutes mood for
emotional power and narrative clarity. 2 hours, 52 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Blast From the Past'' PG-13 (profanity, sex, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser does another culture-clash, fish-out-of-water
flick, playing a guy who climbs into the '90s after spending all
his life in a bomb shelter. You wait for the high-concept comedy to
make some smart observations (or at least some decent jokes) about
the collision of the '60s and '90s. But the humor and the plot are
amateurish, leaving its cast flailing. 1 hour, 52 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Station'' R (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Fernanda Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   In this tender and unexpectedly moving Brazilian film, a sour
old woman (Oscar nominee Fernanda Montenegro) takes a motherless
boy she barely knows into rural Brazil to find the father he's
never met. Montenegro's performance is a beautiful study in
bitterness dissuaded, of possibility and optimism stumbled on after
too long an absence from someone's life. Subtitles. 1 hour, 55
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Corruptor'' R (violence, profanity, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chow Yun-Fat, Mark Wahlberg.
</P>
<P>
   Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg play Chinatown cops forging an
uneasy truce in this violent, densely plotted action flick. Fueled
with betrayals and gunfire, it's the closest thing yet to Chow's
Hong King collaborations with John Woo. 1 hour, 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Cruel Intentions'' R (profanity, sexual situations, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe and Selma Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Last decade's ``Dangerous Liaisons'' gets a makeover with Sarah
Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as a couple of desultorily rich
teens manipulating the romantic lives of everyone around them,
purely for their own amusement and without a whit of concern about
who may be hurt in the process. It's practically guaranteed to be a
runaway hit with the teen audience.1 hour, 37 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when your son turns up living two blocks away with
a man who has no idea his then-unbalanced, now-deceased wife
kidnapped him years ago? Well, in this movie you become Michelle
Pfeiffer and self-absorb your way to family bliss. They should post
a warning: the deep end of this ocean is filled with melodrama. 1
hour and 45 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight Millimeter'' R (strong perverse sexuality, violence,
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A new example of Morbidity Chic from the screenwriter of
``Seven.'' Nicolas Cage plays a private investigator pursuing the
possible death of a girl in a snuff flick. It's an unpleasant crawl
through the world of porn; you can tell the filmmakers think it's a
troubling exploration of moral ambiguity, but it's an exploitation
flick tricked out as art. At metro theaters. 2 hours, 3 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett gives a luminous
portrayal, and Geoffrey Rush, also an Oscar nominee, gives her
sturdy support as court politics and intrigues swirl about. This is
a really good story. 2 hours, 4 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The General'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Gleeson.
</P>
<P>
   An entertaining character study of Martin Cahill, a real-life
Dublin criminal who was both lovable rogue and ugly thug. A cunning
thief who took everything from jewels to Vermeers, Cahill is shown
by writer/director John Boorman to be a natural contrarian, who
thumbed his nose at the IRA as well as the cops. Brendan Gleeson
gives a brilliant, blustery performance as Cahill. 3 hours, 3
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' Not rated but sexual themes and brief
nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Three Oscar nominations. A brilliant reimagining of the final
days of gay British director James Whale. Whale, best known for his
classic horror movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died
mysteriously in 1957. Played here by the marvelous Ian McKellen
(best actor), he's an isolated, forgotten recluse who becomes
interested in the hunky new gardener (Brendan Fraser). 1 hour, 35
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Oscar nominations including best picture, best actor and
best screenplay. An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of
a concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. Roberto Benigni's low-comedy slapstick
approach isn't entirely convincing and is often chillingly
wrongheaded. Subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' R (violence and
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nick Moran and Jason Flemyng.
</P>
<P>
   Smokin'. This whip-smart lark is an English caper comedy
glistening with confidence and a wicked sense of humor. Four
likable, somewhat conniving East End lads have a week to settle the
debt they owe a hood named Hatchet Harry. Rookie writer/director
Guy Ritchie piles on the characters, the plot twists and the
violence, but one thing is clear: Everyone involved had a fine time
making this movie. You'll have fun watching it. 1 hour, 45 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Message in a Bottle'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Costner, RobinWright Penn and Paul Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Two messages here: Old-fashioned romances still work, and Kevin
Costner needs an ego check. Badly. For a good while, the movie lets
us luxuriate in the pleasures of sailboats, sunsets, candlelit
dinners, etc. Plus, there's comic relief courtesy of Paul Newman
and Robbie Contrane. But the last 15 minutes are a lunkheaded
embarrassment and Costner (he co-produced) is to blame. 2 hours, 12
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Favorite Martian'' PG (violence, partial nudity and
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeff Daniels and Christopher Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   A big-screen remake of the '60s TV series, with the annoying and
unsubtle Christopher Lloyd as the Martian who camps in Jeff
Daniels' living room. The movie is cobbled together with cheesy
special effects and easy gags. But for kids, it's an OK
baby-sitter. 1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky'' PG (profanity, sensuality, alcohol use, some
thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper and Laura Dern.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teen Homer (Jake
Gyllenhaal) and three friends who, in the 1950s, began to build and
shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of
their small town. Based on Homer Hickam's autobiography ``Rocket
Boys,'' it makes the process of learning seem as exciting as a
special FX-driven action flick. 1 hour, 48 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Office Space'' R (profanity, partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ron Livingston, Jennifer Aniston, Stephen Root and Gary
Cole.
</P>
<P>
   An amusingly and eerily familiar comedy for anyone who's ever
struggled against the monotonous mind control of a large corporate
workplace. After wittily building audience resentment for nearly 90
minutes, writer-director Mike Judge (TV's ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head,''
``King of the Hill'') seems to pull his punches with a
less-than-apocalyptic ending.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Other Sister'' PG-13 (thematic elements involving
sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Juliette Lewis and Diane Keaton.
</P>
<P>
   Juliette Lewis' effective performance as a mentally challenged
woman is the best reason to see this comedy drama, an uneasy
mixture of sentimentality and yucks. Diane Keaton plays her
overprotective mother, and Giovanni Ribisi (also very strong) is
the man she falls for. 2 hours, 11 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' R (violence, profanity, drug and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers vengeance thriller starring Mel Gibson. It's as
generic as its unnamed, dull gray city. 1 hour, 42 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rage: Carrie 2'' R (violence, gore, sexuality, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Bergl, Amy Irving.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Bergl plays a misunderstood, telekinetic teen in this
cheap, dull horror flick. The sort-of sequel is so bad, you might
mistake it for self-parody. Amy Irving also stars as the first
film's survivor, but skulks through her scenes looking like she's
ready to kill her agent. 1 hour, 45 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' R (profanity and brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia Williams.
</P>
<P>
   This original prep school fable pits 15-year-old Max (Jason
Schwartzman) against a tycoon (Bill Murray) in a battle for the
love of a schoolteacher (Olivia Williams). The second film from
director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson proves that they
haven't lost the off-kilter wit and viewpoint they first showed in
``Bottle Rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 33 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen Oscar nominations including best picture. Poor,
overworked Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish his play
``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win the hand
of noblewoman Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) in this witty comedy that
uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot devices. 2 hours, 2
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``She's All That'' PG-13 (profanity, sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook.
</P>
<P>
   High school star Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) accepts a bet to turn
geeky Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) into a prom queen, and falls in
love with her. An amusing, genial reworking of ``Pygmalion,'' the
comedy has one big problem: Its leads are beautiful, but distant. 1
hour, 37 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Anything but simple, this is a character-driven black comedy
with some powerful moral-qualm undercurrents. In the deep snows of
rural Minnesota, two brothers (Bill Paxton, Oscar nominee Billy Bob
Thornton) and a pal (Brent Briscoe) find a downed plane with $4
million in cash. Their ``simple plan'' to split the money leads to
a chain of increasingly disastrous events. 1 hour, 57 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' R (profanity and war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson
and Adrien Brody.
</P>
<P>
   Less a war movie than a meditation on life, death, love, hate,
man and nature. Terrence Malick puts his unmistakable stamp on the
drama of an Army division's struggle to capture Guadalcanal from
the Japanese during World War II. Fueled with voice-overs, gorgeous
images and sudden violence, it's superbly strange, an epic that
feels intimate but distant at the same time. 2 hours, 50 minutes.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally, alone with it, accidentally cracks it and is
thrust back in time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed
the Earth. 40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``200 Cigarettes'' R (profanity, sexual situations, alcohol use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Courtney Love, Ben Affleck and Christina Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   Like a New Year's Eve nightmare writ large, numerous New Yorkers
struggle to hook up with someone on the way to an end-of-1981
party. Most of the characters are obnoxious and sex-obsessed, but a
few performances, the only-in-the '80s outfits and most especially,
the music, shine through. 1 hour, 27 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wing Commander'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Mathew Lillard and Saffron Burrows.
</P>
<P>
   It's one loopy space lark, with pretty boy Freddie Prinze Jr.
and ``Scream's'' wonderfully woozy killer Matthew Lillard playing
fighter pilots in a galaxy at war. Earth is threatened by a
lumbering band of cat-like creatures wrapped in armadillo armor. It
takes eons for ``Wing,'' based on the popular computer game, to get
to the first big dogfight. 1 hour, 53 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some IMAX films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
41 minutes. B-

 &HT;    Seat-of-pants proposals take school funds into wild blue yonder
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If we take a hint from what happened last week
with charter schools, should Texas ever adopt a ``pilot'' voucher
program, in two years it wouldn't matter if 200 voucherized schools
have gone belly-up, if four dozen have been cited for fraud, and if
one had passed out poison Kool-Aid on a message from God.
</P>
<P>
   Texas would authorize a few hundred million more dollars for
school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in the face of many questions about charter schools,
and lacking evidence that they produce a solid yield on Texas'
investment, the state school board voted to lift the cap on the
number of charters the state could authorize. The 8-7 vote reversed
a hold-that-line vote which presumably was a message that Texas
should have a better handle on whether these open-enrollment,
state-funded schools performed as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Charter proponents in the legislature had threatened to revoke
the board's power to authorize charters unless it supported more of
them.
</P>
<P>
   This rush to seed more charter schools comes in spite of
initially dismal test scores from 17 of the original 19 charters
(results on the other 130 in operation are unavailable), and horror
tales shared last week at a hearing by the board's planning
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee heard, for instance, of Waco's E.L. Harrison
Charter School, which has never made payments to the Teacher
Retirement System and is more than $275,000 in debt.
</P>
<P>
   One Houston charter school, Cypress Lodge Charter, took $240,000
of state money and never opened its doors. The Texas Education
Agency had to appoint a master to a third financially troubled
Houston charter.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it's too early to judge to what extent charter schools
in general are debacles or miracles, seemingly policy makers would
be circumspect about pumping more money into what in some cases may
turn out to be dubious Tinker Toys.
</P>
<P>
   Now for vouchers?
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Senate Bill 10 by State Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo,
to authorize vouchers that could be used by low-achieving students
in six major metropolitan districts. Private schools accepting
vouchers would have two years to gain accreditation, of what sort
we would have to rely on the state education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins says he's neither pro-nor anti-voucher. He just wants to
see if the concept works. Students using vouchers would have to
take the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills. Results would be
compared with those of students ``of similar age and background.''
Sounds reasonable. But how within ``similar age and background''
does Texas quantify the participation of a parent in a child's
education? Many parents in public schools are fully engaged in
their children's education. Some aren't. Comparing children of
disengaged parents with those whose parents are involved is
apples-to-crab-apples analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Open-ended measure
</P>
<P>
   The bill appears to set the bar high for participating schools
with a ``partial termination'' clause. In year 2005 a school would
not be able to not accept vouchers ``unless that school's average
student performance level. . . is at least 10 percent higher than
the average performance level of comparable public school
students.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there's no clear provision in Bivins' bill for
scrapping vouchers in general, meaning schools that beat the 10
percent threshold could continue to accept vouchers forever.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened in the interim, Bivins' proposal would amount
to six years, three biennia, of funding private schools, including
church-run schools with no strings attached about how they use tax
dollars for religion.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins' professed clinical interests aside, this is
self-fulfilling legislation. Call it a pilot if you will. But it
portends to be a drain on public school funding from here to
eternity, with fly-by-night operations to cash in at take-off.

 &HT;    Bullets fly, tale twists in bloody `Corruptor'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The longer you watch ``The Corruptor,'' the more you realize
there ought to be an ``s'' at the end of that title. In the
blood-and-neon underworld of this Chow Yun-Fat vehicle, everyone is
out to bend someone else to his will _ through sex or drugs, money
or blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   Chow plays Nick Chen, star officer of the NYPD's Asian Gang
Unit, in charge of patrolling the streets of Chinatown. His latest
challenge: a bloody rivalry between the older Triad gang and a
bunch of upstarts led by a punk-haired kid named Bobby Vu (Byron
Mann). Into this tense setup strolls rookie Danny Wallace (Mark
Wahlberg). He's supposed to be Nick's new partner, but in the grand
tradition of a hundred cop flicks before, Nick complains to his
boss, ``He's green!''
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the script's many threadbare lines, along with
Nick's warning, ``You don't change Chinatown, boy, it changes
you.'' (That's not only a lame sentiment, it's dangerously close to
Joaquin Phoenix's howler about dancing with the devil in ``Eight
Millimeter.'')
</P>
<P>
   But you don't go to a movie like this to savor the dialogue.
``The Corruptor'' is a stylish genre exercise that's selling
hard-guy angst to bloodthirsty teen boys. (Even the name of the
young gang seems designed to make the Clearasil set break out in
giggles and nudges: the Fukienese Dragons.)
</P>
<P>
   Directed by James Foley, ``Corruptor'' tries to duplicate the
outrageous bouts of violence and the byzantine codes of honor found
in Chow's Hong Kong action films. In its opening minutes, it even
maneuvers the star into his trademark position: on the floor, a
pistol in both fists, firing endless rounds of bullets at the bad
guys.
</P>
<P>
   But exactly who the real bad guys are is a slippery question.
The plot can wear you out with its twists and counter-twists, as we
discover that neither Nick nor Danny is exactly who he seems to be.
The story takes us deep into a noirish Chinatown that's personified
by painstakingly polite but ruthless gangster Henry Lee (Ric
Young), who schemes to get both cops under his thumb.
</P>
<P>
   While you're trying to keep straight who's double-crossing whom,
the movie whips up some hyperviolence, including a couple of tense
car chases that fill the streets with twisted metal and bystanders'
corpses. There's also a subplot about Danny's uneasy relationship
with his father, a former cop who's now in debt to some goons. The
story feels overfamiliar, but actor Brian Cox gives the father
welcome shading.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's real star is cinematographer Juan Ruiz-Anchia.
Punctuating shadows with patches of gold, red and blue, he creates
a world that can simultaneously look cold and seductive.
</P>
<P>
   While Chow's Hollywood debut, ``The Replacement Killers,''
played more like an MTV riff on his movies with John Woo (``The
Killer,'' ``Hard-Boiled''), the new film comes closer to the real
thing. But it doesn't have the melancholy, romantic thread director
Woo tugged shamelessly but skillfully in other films (the blind
girl in ``The Killer,'' the imperiled babies in ``Hard-Boiled'').
``Corruptor's'' emotional core is the fragile loyalty between Nick
and Danny, but that never really seems enough.
</P>
<P>
   Chow comes off best here, working his volatile mix of charm and
mad-dog menace; unfortunately, his accent makes a few scenes even
harder to follow than they should be. Wahlberg is OK, but his
unmodulated, little-boy-lost whisper can get tiresome. He comes off
like a cop making his rounds on heavy medication.
</P>

   ``The Corruptor''

   Grade: B-

 &HT;    `LOCK' glistens with confidence and a wicked sense of humor
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's how it works in the deliciously clever ``Lock, Stock and
Two Smoking Barrels,'' a new comedy-caper flick from Britain: There
are small-time bad guys, there are big-time bad guys, and there are
bad guys who are just kinda timeless.
</P>
<P>
   In the first category fall four likable young lads _ Eddie (Nick
Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), Soap (Dexter Fletcher) and Bacon
(Jason Statham) _ who aren't really so much bad as a bit too
conniving. They'd like to make a pile of money without working for
it. To that end they back Eddie, the cardsharp of the group, in a
high-stakes poker game.
</P>
<P>
   The game is, of course, rigged, and our boys end up owing
something like half a million pounds to a big-time bad guy known as
Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty). While someone like Tom may have
``his dirty little fingers in a couple of dirty little pies,''
Hatchet Harry is someone with ``all his fingers into some very big
dirty pies.'' And, speaking of fingers, if they don't come up with
the cash in a week, Hatchet Harry's enforcer, Big Chris _ a
timeless bad guy played with deadpan aplomb by soccer star-thug
Vinnie Jones _ will cheerfully remove a digit each day the debt is
overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Things only get more complicated from there, with rookie
writer-director Guy Ritchie piling on the characters (including
Sting in a cameo as Eddie's bar-owner dad) and plot twists. But
don't be scared off by the intricate narrative (you followed ``The
Usual Suspects,'' didn't you?) or the thick East End accents.
``Lock, Stock'' is a whip-smart lark that glistens with confidence
and a wicked sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the niftiest aspect of the film is that it owes as much
to Damon Runyon as it does to Quentin Tarantino. There's the usual
post-Tarantino surplus of violence (one run-in is so over the top
that it could have been lifted straight out of a John Woo movie).
But Ritchie gives his characters the same shaggy-dog, colorful
appeal that Runyon lavished on his Times Square guys and dolls. One
of Hatchet Harry's minions is known as Barry the Baptist, because
he gets rid of people by drowning them. Or consider Tom's patter as
he sells some ill-gotten goods on the street: ``Hand-made in Italy.
Hand-stolen in Stepney.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture's exuberant visual style mixes ``Trainspotting''
point-of-view shots with mid-1960s freeze frames. Clearly, everyone
involved had a heck of a good time making this movie.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have a heck of a good time watching it.

<P>
   ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels''

 &HT;    The abc's of bras
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 14.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bras are like shoes. Women need one for every outfit,
a style for every occasion, a color for every mood. They're hooked
on them, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   That's why brassieres were the top-selling garment in the
intimate apparel industry in 1998, with sales reaching $4.3
billion, according to NPD American Shoppers, a New York firm that
tracks consumer purchases.
</P>
<P>
   When the two-cup wonder made its debut in the early 1900s,
designed by Caresse Crosby, a New York socialite, its main function
was to stay tight and out of sight. Decades later, the
entertainment industry would help change all that. When performers
such as Madonna and Janet Jackson hit the stage in leather and
lace, a whole new era of bra-wearing was born. Companies such as
Victoria's Secret, Bali and Playtex have created a fleet of styles
to flatter every figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bras have come out of the dresser drawer,'' said Berna
Goldstein, vice president of merchandising at Bali. ``There's a lot
more focus on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of technological advances in fabric and construction,
bras are more comfortable than ever and can do wonders for
sculpting the body.
</P>
<P>
   Spring and summer are big seasons for bras. As women shed bulky
winter wear for the tighter, sheerer and slinkier fashions of the
warmer months, choosing the right bra becomes an important
decision, both for work and for leisure.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there are many more choices in bras than ever, many
women unknowingly wear the wrong size or the wrong style.
</P>
<P>
   You know the type. They're the ones constantly tugging at their
bra straps; or the ones who are bulging on both sides; or the ones
wearing a bra that's so old that elasticity is a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women have no clue how a bra should fit,'' Goldstein
said. ``Probably the only thing worse is buying a bathing suit. The
choices are daunting, and a lot of women are shy and don't want
salesclerks to help them. But it's the best 15 minutes people could
invest.''
</P>
<P>
   A bra has three purposes, fit, function and fashion, said Karen
Bromley, a spokeswoman for the Intimate Apparel Council, a trade
organization in New York City. That's why women need to shop as
carefully for a bra as for the garment that covers it.
</P>
<P>
   Lace for business casual or romantic evenings. A sports model
for jogging and aerobics, and a lightly lined one for sheer tops. A
strapless convertible that can go around the neck for halters or be
worn strapless for bare shoulders. Smooth, seamless bras for knits,
sweaters and T-shirts. And figure-enhancing styles that lift, curve
and shape.
</P>
<P>
   That's just the bare minimum. Experts say the average woman buys
about three bras a year. But she needs a minimum of 12 to 14 to
complement her wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a woman today who could survive with seven
bras,'' said Cleo Edwards, foundations buyer for Rich's. ``Bras
these days are really wardrobing. For every outfit you put on, you
need a different look.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure to get the correct size by having a certified fitter
take your bust measurements. Most major department stores have
fitters on staff, and the service is free. Call ahead for schedule
information.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When fitting yourself, measure around the rib cage directly
under the bust, then add 5 inches to get the band size. Then
measure around the fullest part of the bust. If the difference
between these two measurements is 1 inch or less, you are an A cup;
if the difference is 2 inches, you're a B; if it's 3 inches, you're
a C; 4 inches is a D; and 5 inches is a DD.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If your measurement is an odd number, you'll need to go up 1
inch in size, because bras are measured in even numbers. For
example, if you meaure 35, you'll need a size 36. &QR;  Fit can vary
according to style and maker, so it's always best to try on a bra
before purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For an opaque look, wear a bra the same color as the garment.
White bras should be worn with white tops, black bras with black
tops, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Weight loss or gain could change your bra size; it's a good
idea to get refitted.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A good bra should last about three years, with proper care.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Machine wash on the gentle cycle in a lingerie bag. The bra
should be hooked together before washing. Avoid placing bras in a
dryer, because it weakens the elastic.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Remember, if the straps are too tight or rub the skin, the bra
is too small.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If the straps fall down or a cup puckers, the bra is too big.
</P>

 &HT;    ABUSE OF 'DATE RAPE' DRUGS IS SPREADING, PANEL TOLD
 &HT;    580&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Candace Pruett didn't know Rohypnol had been
slipped into her soft drink, and doesn't remember being raped three
years ago at the age of 15.
</P>
<P>
   The drug and assault were revealed by hospital tests after she
was found by police called by her distraught parents, the high
school senior from Northern Virginia told congressional
investigators Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug I was given unfortunately had robbed me of my
memories of what happened that night,'' Pruett said. ``What my
attacker did to me also robbed me of my childhood. Going through a
trial took away my innocence and forced me to become a grown-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sexual assaults are only the most dramatic element of an
exploding problem with so-called ``date rape drugs,'' witnesses
told the House Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agents and public health officials said the
drugs are much more widely abused as a way to get high, despite the
considerable risks of users lapsing into a coma or dying.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has documented 32 deaths and
more than 3,500 overdoses since 1990 from just one of the drugs,
gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB or ``Georgia Home Boy''), said Rep. Fred
Upton, R-Mich., the subcommittee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said law enforcement agencies, while busy combating
the traditional drugs of abuse like cocaine, marijuana and heroin,
haven't kept up with ``party'' drugs such as GHB, flunitrazepam
(also known as Rohypnol or ``roofies''), and Ketamine (''Special
K'').
</P>
<P>
   The drugs have become favorites at ``raves,'' where teen-agers
dance all night, and at clubs catering to affluent young adults, as
well as with subcultures ranging from body-builders to strippers.
</P>
<P>
   Ketamine, which is chemically akin to PCP, produces effects
ranging from dream-like states to delirium and hallucinations. GHB
is an intoxicant and euphoriant so powerful that users say a bottle
cap full produces the ``high'' of 12 beers. Rohypnol is a
``downer'' belonging to the same chemical family as Valium and is
often taken in combination with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   For computer-savvy kids, information on finding, using or making
these drugs is available with a couple of clicks of a mouse, the
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``GHB is truly the child of the Internet,'' testified Trinka
Porata, a private pharmaceutical consultant and former narcotics
detective for the Los Angeles Police Department. An assortment of
Web sites claim that the drug is safe and non-addictive and provide
directions on how to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, GHB is dangerous, addictive and harder than
heroin to shake,'' Porata told the subcommittee. ``GHB is the
easiest drug on Earth to make and the hardest drug to recognize.''
</P>
<P>
   A Food and Drug Administration official told the subcommittee
that GHB is not an approved drug in the United States, but is being
studied as a treatment for narcolepsy, a rare sleep disorder.
Rohypnol, a prescription anesthetic in some foreign countries, is
also not approved for use in the United States. Ketamine is an
anesthetic and has been approved by the FDA for both human and
animal use. Its most common legal use is by veterinarians as an
animal tranquilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., has introduced legislation to add GHB
and Ketamine to the Drug Enforcement Administration's Schedule III
list of controlled substances, making possession of either drug by
a first-time offender punishable by five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine. It is already illegal to possess Rohypnol.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill has been introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee,
D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Quick action is likely, Upton predicted. He told of a recent
tragedy involving two teen-aged girls in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they were at a party, their beverages were laced with
GHB, probably without their knowledge. Fifteen-year-old Samantha
Reid and her friend lapsed into comas, and Samantha died,'' he
said. ``I am the father of an 11-year-old daughter, and I can only
imagine what Samantha's family and friends have endured.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for a pharmaceutical firm cautioned that GHB could
have medical value in treating narcolepsy _ a rare sleep disorder
that affects about 180,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In an attack, ``the patient appears unconscious. In reality,
however, the person is quite alert and awake, but unable to talk,
move or even remove himself or herself from a potentially dangerous
situation,'' testified Patti Engel, a spokeswoman for Orphan
Medical, a Minnesota firm that specializes in developing medicines
to treat rare ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Tests have shown doses of GHB can reduce attacks in some
patients from 50 a day to two a month, Engel said. She was not
opposed to federal action to stop misuse of the drug, however.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not with medicinal GHB, she said in prepared
testimony. ``Anyone with a computer, credit card, and the
inclination to surf the Net can find the recipe, buy the
ingredients and make a batch of 'home-brewed' GHB,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
   Toting her goldfish in a water-filled plastic bag, Carla Lewis
(Ms. Lewis) returns to her well-to-do family in San Francisco.
Carla, who is 24 and mentally retarded, has been away at a special
school and now it's time to try life on the outside, which, as the
situation suggests, will be a carefully monitored, ripple-free
existence behind all the buffers money can provide.
</P>
<P>
   Carla, however, has other notions. She wants to enroll in trade
school and become a veterinarian's assistant. She also wants her
own apartment. Just these thoughts are enough to send her mother, a
controlling monarch of a woman named Elizabeth (Ms. Keaton), into
fits of fretful disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   But Carla, who is as headstrong as her mother, gets her way. At
trade school she meets a similarly retarded young man named Danny
(Ribisi). Danny also has his own apartment, where he and Carla go
to discuss their places in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Soon they decide that they want a romantic attachment along with
their independence. With the mental development of young children,
they have a tendency to blurt out whatever is on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you two do it yet?'' Carla asks her sister and her
boyfriend. Given that, she is plenty smart and common-sensical.
Reminded by her mother that Danny isn't worthy because he won't be
able to pay the rent, Carla notes that Elizabeth doesn't pay the
rent either.
</P>
<P>
   Danny and Carla want to marry. Elizabeth, who insists Carla pack
pepper spray for encounters with men, has had quite enough. ``Can't
you see me? You never look at me!'' Carla screams at her. Ready or
not, here comes the bride.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX In their ingenuous way, Carla and Danny decide they want to
make love. ``More Joy of Sex'' is consulted. ``We could try page
39,'' Danny suggests. Eventually they retire behind closed doors. &QL;

complicated movie? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 They will be engaged by Ms. Lewis and Ribisi, who
give startling and engaging performances. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP Audiences are accustomed to Ms. Lewis in road
films so her role here is appealing. But a movie that could have
been grittier chooses to stay heavily sentimental. That may attract
others, but it doesn't draw teen-agers.

   It's New Year's Eve, 1981, in New York and around the East
Village everybody feels more or less obliged to go to a party at
Monica's. With love lives on hold or in disarray, no one is looking
forward to it and that includes Monica (Ms. Plimpton), who awaits
terrified that no one will show up and weighing which is worse:
going to New Year's Eve parties or giving them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least going I'm not responsible for how horrible they
are,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody straggles around town, stopping in clubs and
restaurants to kill time before midnight. Lucy (Ms. Love) and Kevin
(Rudd) quarrelsomely review their longtime friendship and on two
occasions attempt to have sex in a diner bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   In from Long Island, two would-be hipsters (Ms. Ricci and Ms.
Hoffmann) brave Satan's Pit and wonder if they'll survive Avenue B.
</P>
<P>
   At the dawn of yuppiedom a good-looking bartender betrays his
true motivations to two potential conquests. He's in law school and
wants to get into real estate. ``Time to pump,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Cindy (Ms. Hudson), an innocent from uptown, gets
together with Jack (Mohr), who the night before was the first man
she ever went home with.
</P>
<P>
   It's Kevin's birthday and Lucy gives him a carton of cigarettes
(200 of them). People kvetch and smoke and smoke. Crowds pile in
and out of the Dog Dive, but no one seems to be getting much closer
to Monica's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help me out, I'm hanging by a thread here,'' she says to her
one guest at the moment. But get there they do, even Elvis
Costello.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Other than some brief pushing and shoving in a club,
none. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Sex is often under discussion, but none is performed. Lucy
and Kevin's fumblings don't amount to much. The next morning people
turn up in bed, but the party is over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Some but mild. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12-14 For the most part, of course, parents don't accompany
their children to movies of this nature. Children who go with their
friends won't be uplifted, but the film is fun and not that
harmful. Perhaps the most objectionable element is all the
smoking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 15 AND UP Parents might cringe, but teen-agers will go.
</P>
<P>
   CRUEL INTENTIONS &QL;

   Directed by Roger Kumble &QL;
</P>
<P>
   97 minutes R
</P>
<P>
   With the movies always dredging up things for teen-agers to do
on screen, Kumble's film sets up a ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses''
junior division, with characters and plot modeled after Choderlos
de Laclos' 18th-century novel.
</P>
<P>
   On summer vacation in Manhattan and the Hamptons, the seductive
Sebastian Valmont (Phillippe) and his vile step-sister, Kathryn
Merteuil (Ms. Gellar), have some sexual projects to carry out while
inflicting as much pain and humiliation on other parties as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The top priority is Annette Hargrove (Ms. Witherspoon). An
All-American preppie queen, Annette has announced her intention to
``save herself'' in a national teen magazine. Kathryn and Sebastian
make a little bet: if Sebastian can't bed her, Kathryn gets his
sports car; if he can, Sebastian gets Kathryn.
</P>
<P>
   Around and around it goes, with Sebastian softening up his
quarry but not quite to the extent necessary and both Kathryn and
Sebastian working their wiles to inflict damage on a variety of
other pliant young people. But there's comeuppance ahead, right in
front of everyone at school, too.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE A latent kind of violence is present throughout.
Otherwise there is a fist fight and a fatal incident late in the
film. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Sex being the one and only subject, it stands to reason that
there are numerous sexual situations and continual references. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY These characters talk dirty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12-14 This is another of those R-rated films about children
but not for children. It's a reach, and not a little silly, to make
juveniles the protagonists of such a story, but many young viewers
won't agree. Also the stars are very popular. Parents beware. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 15 AND UP Like it or not, the film is a natural for many
older teen-agers.

<P>
   The D.J. Apostles Of Rock 'n' Roll &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Documentaries often make the better shows on video. On March 23,
for example, Winstar is to release ``Rock 'n' Roll Invaders,'' a
Canadian film that goes past the performers to get at the AM radio
disk jockeys who brought the music to the people in the 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Dramarama, a Toronto company, the documentary took
its director, Paul Eichgrun, around the United States on a
three-year search for material about a little band of visionaries
who sensed an impending revolution and spun every record they could
get their hands on.
</P>
<P>
   Postwar America was nervous about race and its increasingly
restless teen-agers. ``Kids were becoming an economic power, buying
their own cars and clothes and records,'' Eichgrun said. ``It was a
shock.''
</P>
<P>
   But race was the sore point. The documentary is especially good
at showing how disk jockeys helped move the music that became rock
'n' roll from black to white in the middle and latter part of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Several years earlier radio itself had been revitalized by black
rhythm-and-blues, spread far and wide by the likes of Rufus Thomas
and Martha Jean (The Queen) Steinberg, black disk jockeys on WDAI
in Memphis (later she went to Detroit). Soon rhythm-and-blues met
white rockabilly, introducing white disk jockeys like Dewey
Phillips, the man with Beale Street connections, John R. (John
Richbourg) and Bill (Hoss) Allen of WLAC in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The music worked its way north, and in places like the Record
Rendezvous in Cleveland, white teen-agers combed ``sepia bins'' for
the hot, sweaty, boozy workingman's rhythm-and-blues. At Alan
Freed's Moondog Ball, the first rock concert, a crowd of 26,000
tried to occupy 6,000 seats and there was a riot.
</P>
<P>
   The rambunctious Freed ruled the scene, and the white mainstream
was getting anxious. Rhythm-and-blues was about to become a white
creation. ``They bleached it and changed the name,'' Eichgrun said.
Now it was rock 'n' roll and headed for the coasts.
</P>
<P>
   There was trouble. Freed was on WINS in New York and promoting
concerts around the East. ``Kids, it looks like the Boston police
don't want you to have fun,'' he told a packed crowd in Boston
Arena. That got him indicted for inciting a riot and cost him his
job at WINS.
</P>
<P>
   ABC television hired him, but he lost that job, too, when the
black singer Frankie Lyman danced with a white girl. The show was
instantly canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Middle America wasn't amused when Jerry Lee Lewis married his
13-year-old second cousin. The payola scandals, with many leading
disk jockeys caught taking money to play records, were no help
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Booze, Broads, Bribes,'' shouted a headline about a riotous
disk jockey convention in Miami. Station management introduced the
Top 40, which were played over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Disk jockeys responded by becoming performers in their own
right. At the Apollo Theater in New York, Jocko Henderson gave
songs rhymed introductions that were the forerunners of rap. In
Mexico, Wolfman Jack ruled border radio, the one-million-watt
stations heard all over the country and beyond. ``The Russians had
to spend time blocking out the Wolfman,'' Eichgrun said. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jay Bulworth (Warren Beatty) is so tired of campaigning and
life in general that he hires a hit man to kill him for his life
insurance. Then it occurs to him that he is free to do the utterly
unthinkable for a politician up for re-election: tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he is regaling black audiences to beware of lying white
liberals like him. It's a different approach all right, but
Bulworth stays loose, attracts a young black woman (Halle Berry)
and turns himself into a white rapping homeboy. And that, Janet
Maslin wrote in The New York Times, suits a political satire with
``jubilant wit and energy.'' &QL;

   One True Thing &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Kate Gulden (Meryl Streep) develops terminal cancer, her
daughter Ellen (Renee Zellweger) puts her career on hold and goes
home to care for her. As the illness progresses, the younger woman
struggles with caring for a parent who is reluctant to surrender
control.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for them, the ordeal takes place in a spacious dream
house of the kind invariably used in films that add plenty of
cushioning to their tough situations. All the right emotions get
used _ anger, grief, helplessness and frustration _ but as awful as
the situation is, one is always aware that the movie ``shrewdly
blurs the line between tear-drenched suds and serious drama''
(Stephen Holden). &QL;

immediate extraction and lives to pass out water to the louts on
the local college football team. Ridiculed for his efforts, Bobby
is finally terminated from his post and sent home to mama (Kathy
Bates).
</P>
<P>
   But Bobby craves water (or serving it) and lands with another
team whose coach (Henry Winkler) unleashes his anger and turns him
into a star linebacker. That's probably dumb enough, but ``this
escapist comedy is so cheerfully outlandish that it's hard to
resist'' (Maslin). &QL;

been one of those funny, earthy working-class films that Hollywood
has unsuccessfully been trying to make ever since ``Moonstruck.''

   THREE-DAY SERIES ON THE BUSINESS OF SMUGGLING ALIENS
</P>
<P>
   Attention: National, International editors
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Post is producing a three-day series for
Saturday, March 13, Sunday, March 14, and Monday, March 15 on the
business of smuggling aliens. The series follows in the wake of
news stories this week about two boats carrying more than three
dozen people that sank Saturday 26 miles east of West Palm Beach in
what could be the worst smuggling catastrophe in Florida history.
The Post's series looks at why the U.S. Border Patrol, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the federal court system
cope poorly with alien smuggling in Florida and why Florida
employers are able to hire hundreds of thousands of illegal workers
each year. Stories, graphics and photos will be available Friday
evening. If you have questions or need more information, call the
Cox News Service in Atlanta at 404 526-5456. Here are budget lines
for each day in the series:

   FOR SATURDAY PAPERS
</P>
<P>
   PURSUIT _ WEST PALM, BEACH, Fla. _ Smuggling immigrants into
Florida is a money-making enterprise. It's becoming a booming
business as more and more immigrants find that paying smugglers
equipped with fast boats and high-tech gear improves their chances
of reaching the United States. Sometimes it goes wrong, as when 40
Haitians drowned between the Bahamas and Palm Beach County last
weekend. The Border Patrol is charged with the responsibility of
putting the alien smuggler out of business. But the Miami sector
has less than 60 agents to patrol its four-state region. The agency
hasn't seen an increase in its workforce in 10 years. During that
period, the U.S. Border Patrol has experienced dramatic growth,
doubling the number of agents to a force of nearly 8,000.
Unfortunately for the Miami sector, almost all of the thousands of
agents hired during the past few years have been assigned to Texas,
California, New Mexico and Arizona. For example: The Miami Sector
has 52 agents assigned; Laredo (Texas) has 638; El Paso has 9,752;
Tucson has 1,022; and San Diego has 2,257. Miami's budget is $6.2
million; San Diego is $178 million. (Kane, Palm Beach Post) 60

   DAY _ Border Patrol Agent Larry Belotti works the graveyard
shift. He says he's the often the only Border Patrol agent working
from Corpus Christi, Texas, to Vermont. One recent night, he
rounded up 26 Cubans who came ashore in Miami Beach. This
effectively shuts down the Border Patrol station because Belotti
will spend the rest of the night processing these refugees. (Kane,
Palm Beach Post). 30.

   FOR SUNDAY PAPERS
</P>
<P>
   PUNISH _ U.S. Attorney Tom Scott says his office is adopting an
aggressive stand against alien smugglers. These cases are tough to
prosecute, particularly when Cuban refugees are involved. Justice
Department data shows that federal prosecutors historically haven't
taken on many alien smuggling cases. A couple reasons. The
smugglees make lousy witnesses. There's also the built-in defense:
``I'm not a smuggler. I was fishing and rescued these Cubans from
their sinking raft.'' Prosecutors also have felt that juries of
Cuban exiles and other immigrants find it hard to convict someone
of helping their fellow countrymen escape oppression. Furthermore,
the courts haven't been very tough on convicted smugglers, even if
the case involves the deaths of refugees. For example: In South
Fla, the USAtty prosecuted 62 percent of cases referred by the
Border Patrol; in Arizona, 92 percent; in Southern California, 99
percent; in South Texas, 99 percent. In South Fla, 26 percent of
smu

<P>
   ggling cases referred to USAtty ended with prison sentences; in
Arizona, it's 40 percent; Southern California, 57 percent; South
Texas, 58 percent. 60 inches. (Kane, Palm Beach Post)

</P>
<P>
   WORKSITE _ It's unlawful to hire non-citizens. But Florida is
still the land of opportunity. An estimated 350,000 illegal aliens
reside here. Most work in the vegetable and citrus farms. Many keep
the tourism industry booming as waiters, hotel maids, etc. Some
work on landscaping and construction crews. But the INS cannot go
into the agricultural fields and doesn't have the manpower to do
much other worksite enforcement because it has to focus attention
on alien smuggling. Farmers hire scores of illegal workers and
escape liability by paying licensed farm labor contractors provide
crews. They also argue that workers today carry counterfeit
documents. The INS says they don't expect growers to be document
experts. Migrant worker advocates argue that farmers use their
political clout to handcuff the INS. For example: in 1990, the INS
sanctioned 38 employers in Florida for hiring illegals. That
dropped to 16 in 1991, 6 in 1992 and 2 in 1993. In 1994, 1995 and
1996, it was a dozen or fewer. Only in 1997 did it get back up to
about 20-25 employers. (Kane/Holland, Palm Beach Post). 60.

   ONEWAY _ Most illegal aliens enter Florida not by sea, but by
land. In Operation Oneway, the U.S. Border Patrol discovered that a
network of smugglers were routinely renting trucks in Arizona from
Penske, Avis, etc. for one-way trip to Florida's farmland. (Kane,
Palm Beach Post). 20.

GRAND DECOR ON THE BLOCK  
 INDUSTRIAL CHIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many people think it's news when a prominent interior designer
acts to redo his space. Alberto Pinto, the veteran Paris decorator,
is making news by deciding to un-do his space.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the best five decorators in Paris,'' said Laure
de Gramont, a former editor of Paris Vogue who is now an
international book scout. ``He has to keep reinventing his decor,
just as Hubert de Givenchy and Karl Lagerfeld have done recently.
Creative people get bored with their old things.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinto, whose enviable client list includes and Mrs. Moise Safra,
and Mrs. Michel David-Weill, Count and Countess Hubert d'Ornano,
and President and Madame Chirac, said he'd been thinking about
``changing a few things'' in his apartment for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept asking myself, `What should I keep, and what should I
not keep?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pinto is internationally known for the splendid interiors he has
been confecting for 30 years. His current apartment in a 1920s
building has a grand decor like an intricate music box.
</P>
<P>
   On the Quai d'Orsay overlooking the Seine, the space resembles a
Roman palace, with a monumental staircase, a large, formal drawing
room, a grand dining room and a salon lined in 18th-century
boiseries.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms boast crystal chandeliers and fabulous carved giltwood
mirrors. The windows are swathed in yards of pale pink silk. Tables
and armchairs are festooned with ormolu. Walls have faux finishes,
fine paintings and assemblages of beautifully framed paintings and
gouaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such sumptuous taste is not for everyone, but it's glorious,''
said Mrs. Beatrice de Patino, the widow of a Bolivian tin tycoon.
``The apartment has the proportions of a palazzo and is filled with
beautiful things.''
</P>
<P>
   In the drawing room, overscale antique Russian armchairs rest on
an enormous Napoleon III Aubusson carpet. In the room next door,
the Salon Jaune, a Louis XIV-style Boulle cabinet with
tortoise-shell inlay is placed against a wall upholstered in a
bright yellow toile de Jouy print with red figures.
</P>
<P>
   Every flat surface has its own still life: sets of hard-stone
and semi-precious-stone boxes, busts of Roman emperors,
19th-century animal sculptures and groupings of carved rock
crystal. Even the flatware is over the top; the German silver-gilt
dessert silverware from Hertler of Dresden has porcelain handles.
</P>
<P>
   How could he possibly pull this decor apart and sell it
piecemeal?
</P>
<P>
   ``I closed my eyes and decided to sell everything,'' said Pinto
in a recent interview. ``I thought it would be more fun if I
started again from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would keep the apartment but redo it ``in a more
contemporary style with just a few over-scale pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinto is selling his possessions at Sotheby's in New York.
Scheduled for March 29 and 30, the 282-lot sale is already
generating a lot of buzz.
</P>
<P>
   The 304-page catalog looks like a shelter magazine. Sotheby's
had the apartment photographed so the curious can see exactly how
the maestro placed each treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog also includes quotes from some of Pinto's friends
and clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only the second time we've done this,'' said Pete
Hathaway of Sotheby's European furniture department, referring to
the decision to use such quotes. ``But everyone loves him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Sotheby's is worried that Americans don't know Pinto's
work well enough, even though his clients include Saudi princes,
French nobles and David and Julia Koch, the American couple who
bought the apartment on Fifth Avenue that was owned by Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Diane von Furstenburg, the New York dress designer, for example,
wrote: ``Alberto Pinto is one of the most generous men I know. It
reflects in his taste, elegance, opulence and warmth.'' Countess
Ruy Brandolini d'Adda wrote: ``He can mix things antique and modern
in a very elegant way. He can create different atmospheres in one
minute, all in a very refined style.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinto is not selling everything he owns; he's keeping, for
example, his family silver and paintings. But he is selling a lot.
``He's the Imelda Marcos of antiques collectors,'' Hathaway said.

   Memorable items include a Napoleon III ormolu 12-light
chandelier with small Imari porcelain cups hanging from it
(estimated to sell at $30,000 to $50,000); a pair of Danish
mahogany armchairs decorated with gilded rosettes and leopard-print
upholstery ($15,000 to $20,000 for the pair), and a grand
19th-century Italian mahogany neoclassical center table that rests
on four carved gilt-wood lion supports ($25,000 to $35,000).
</P>
<P>
   Some items from the 19th century are not too expensive,
including the many examples of Palissy-style majolica (each plate
estimated at $800 to $1,200), an Italian mosaic-and-etched-glass
dressing mirror ($2,000 to $3,000) and a few sets of Russian silver
trompe l'oeil wicker baskets, complete with cast-silver damask
napkins ($4,000 to $6,000 apiece).
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he regretted putting any item up for auction, Pinto
said: ``Yes, my favorite green bird. But all my friends want it so
I decided to let them have it.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece, a charming 19th-century Indian enameled silver
cockatoo, used to sit on its silver perch in Pinto's drawing room,
pretending to eat the real pistachio nuts he put out for it.
Estimate: $10,000 to $15,000. At 12 inches high, it's probably
about the smallest item in the sale. &QL;

   Metal seems to be the password for this year's Triple Pier Expo,
which returns to Piers 88, 90 and 92 on the Hudson River this
weekend and next; several dealers are selling industrial-metal
furniture in stainless steel, chrome and aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   For example, David Teague, of America Antiques in Lambertville,
N.J., who will be at Booth 301 on Pier 90 this weekend, is selling
a circa 1950 stainless-steel corporate conference table for $4,800;
a metal Parsons-like table for $2,500, and a collection of
dome-topped medical cabinets in steel with brass feet from Buenos
Aires.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan dealer Michael Ward, who will be showing at Booth
441 on Pier 90 on March 20 and 21, said he had specialized in
examples of industrial design made ``between the Victorian and Art
Deco periods.'' This year he has several circa 1900 ``task'' lamps
that can pivot in many directions; prices range from $400 to $1,200
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   He also has sets of similar lamp shades that can be hung in a
row over a table on cords that drop six feet from the ceiling.
These lights have industrial-glass shades attached to the light
sockets and cost between $250 and $300 per light.
</P>
<P>
   Other dealers are showing metal recycled medical cabinets, and
aluminum storage lockers and factory tables. Who knows, maybe Pinto
will be filling up his apartment with industrial-aluminum
furniture?

`THE LION IN WINTER': A PRODUCTION THAT RARELY SEEMS TO BELIEVE IN
ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The revelations have not been pleasant. Plots and
counterplots, all within one little family, have been exploded. A
shocking sexual secret has been dragged to the surface. A father
has cursed his sons, and the sons have responded in kind. War,
treason, assassination all hover as serious possibilities. So what
does the mother of this unwholesome clan have to say about the
latest of its domestic blow-ups?
</P>
<P>
   The summing up is delivered with dismissive cheer: ``There was a
scene with beds and tapestries, and many things got said.''
</P>
<P>
   And there you have the essence of ``The Lion in Winter,'' James
Goldman's 1966 comic drama of dysfunctional dynasts in 1183 and a
work in which arch isn't just something you find in Gothic
cathedrals. The deliverer of that dry precis, by the way, is
Eleanor of Aquitaine. And in the revival of ``Lion'' that opened
Thursday night at the Roundabout Theater Company, Eleanor is quite
happily embodied by Stockard Channing, a whiz at wielding the
play's weapons of choice: not maces and lances but poisoned
epigrams and piercing sallies.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Ms. Channing is the only person onstage who seems
confident of her abilities to deploy such an arsenal. As directed
by Michael Mayer, with Laurence Fishburne looking mighty and
majestic as Eleanor's husband and foe, Henry II, the production
rarely appears to believe in itself. There's a feeling in the air
that the performers might at any moment doff their medieval velvets
and pelts and head off for a drink to discuss the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to sympathize. Although a favorite of college and
community theaters, ``The Lion in Winter'' isn't easy to pull off
with conviction. The more famous film version of 1968, which
starred Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole, disguised the play's
artificial nature with flashy historical settings and the legendary
shine of its stars. In fact, ``Lion'' is as mannered as Wilde and
just about as self-conscious as Pirandello, which is not to suggest
that it is anywhere near the same league.
</P>
<P>
   In recreating a family feud that changed the map of Europe,
Goldman, who died last year, chose to avoid the thee-and-thou route
as well as the lyricism, fanciful or stately, of Jean Anouilh and
Maxwell Anderson. His template instead appears to have been a
thoroughly modern examination of a destructive marriage, Edward
Albee's ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Albee's George and Martha, Goldman's Henry and Eleanor have
turned emotional vivisection into a savage parlor game, slashing
away in marital disharmony while admiring each other's skills in
doing so. Of course, the stakes of the games are somewhat
different. In ``Virginia Woolf,'' the idea was, among other things,
to ``get the guests''; in ``Lion,'' it's ``get the crown,'' not to
mention such valuable parcels of land as Aquitaine in France.
</P>
<P>
   This anachronistic wedding of style and subject is kind of
ingenious and kind of silly. The biggest problem in the play, which
depicts a royal family reunion at Christmastime in a French castle,
is that Goldman strains for cleverness in every line.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those lines have a ``Private Lives'' worldliness (``I
can't be your mistress if I'm married to your son''); some a
collegiate glee (``Well, what shall we hang, the holly or each
other?''). Still others reek like spoiled Camembert (``Green
becomes you,'' says Henry's mistress, played by Emily Bergl, to
Eleanor). Piled thickly on top of each other, these zingers conjure
the atmosphere of a feudal Friars' roast, lacking only Dean Martin
in chain mail. It is not dialogue that trips naturally off the
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Ms. Channing, rebounding nicely after her misfired
performance in ``The Little Foxes'' two seasons ago, is on hand to
show us that these lines can be made to breathe, though not without
effort. At her best, as in the Broadway productions of ``Joe Egg''
and ``Six Degrees of Separation,'' this fine actress wears wryness
as an armor over vulnerability like nobody else.
</P>
<P>
   Here, looking a bit like a low-calorie, mid-period Elizabeth
Taylor in Michael Krass' standard-issue royal robes, Ms. Channing
delivers Eleanor's fusillade of barbs with a crackle of vengeance
triumphant, while suggesting a genuine sigh of regret underneath.
She occasionally falls into campy cuteness, scrunching up her face
in self-congratulation after delivering yet another witty blow. But
she is also clearly getting off on the pure gamesmanship of the
language, which is essential if the audience is to be won over.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Channing is playing solitaire. There's no denying that
Fishburne, who showed an ease with costume bravado in the recent
film of ``Othello,'' looks every inch a king. Whether standing,
arms folded, or stretching territorially across a bed of animal
skins, he projects a formidable centeredness that extends to his
firm bass voice.
</P>
<P>
   He is strangely detached, though. Even as Henry squabbles
viciously with Eleanor and their three sons over who is to inherit
the throne, he mostly comes across as an affable, ironic host
overseeing a party of misbehaving guests. The wintry lion of the
title, this Henry appears to have withdrawn from the fray already,
and when he raises his voice, it feels more out of irritation than
deep rage or sorrow. This gives Ms. Channing very little to react
to, and the stars' big love-hate scenes might have been spliced
together from different movies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fishburne at least registers as a solid presence, which is more
than can be said for the rest of the cast. In addition to Ms. Bergl
as Alais, Henry's young mistress, there are Keith Nobbs, Neal Huff
and Chuma Hunter-Gault as Henry and Eleanor's three sons, John,
Geoffrey and Richard Lionheart; and Roger Howarth as Philip, the
young King of France and Richard's one-time lover.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Nobbs, who does his usual Generation-X splutter as
the peevish, adolescent John, these performers seem to have made no
definite choices as to what they think their characters are or how
they should behave, and Mayer has offered no discernible guidance
here.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the supporting actors look lost and puzzled
against David Gallo's gloomy black dungeon of a set. The play's
dialogue, when delivered as uncertainly as it often is here, has
all the substance of mauve-colored smoke. And when it's just the
young fellows onstage, they bring to mind a group of listless
patrons in a piano bar, waiting for an electric diva of a performer
to come in and wake them up.
</P>
<P>
   That role falls to Ms. Channing, and she fills it as gracefully
as circumstances allow. In this production, it's undoubtedly mother
who knows best. Now if only someone could find her a family of
equals with whom to play her nasty power games.

   When director Stanley Kubrick died on March 7, he left a
dazzling body of work _ and a legacy of almost total silence.

   In four decades as a filmmaker, Kubrick virtually never agreed
to be interviewed. In 1968, however, shortly after the release of
his seminal science-fiction film ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' the
director was interviewed by Playboy magazine, and talked about
``2001'' and ``Dr. Strangelove'' (1964), his visions of the future
and his philosophy of filmmaking.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When director Stanley Kubrick died on March 7 at age 70, he left
behind a dazzling body of work _ and a legacy of almost total
silence.
</P>
<P>
   In four decades as a filmmaker, Kubrick virtually never agreed
to be interviewed. In 1968, however, shortly after the release of
his seminal film version of Arthur C. Clarke's science-fiction
novel ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' the director welcomed a Playboy
writer to his London home, where he talked about ``2001'' and ``Dr.
Strangelove'' (1964), his earlier black comedy about a deranged
general who ultimately triggers a nuclear holocaust. Together the
two films constituted the first parts of what would become a
future-vision triptych with his next film, ``A Clockwork Orange''
(1971).
</P>
<P>
   The director spoke freely about the films, his work and his
visions of the future in the interview, excerpts from which
follow. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To discover what has made Kubrick so respected _ and so
controversial _ a director, and to plumb both his own complexities
and those of ``2001,'' Playboy interviewed Kubrick at his elegant
mansion outside London, a short drive from MGM's studio at Borham
Wood, where he is working on his latest film.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer Eric Norden found Kubrick _ a slim, relaxed man with
thinning hair, dark beard and intense eyes _ sprawled in a chair on
the spacious expanse of lawn overlooking his elegantly tended
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Kubrick crossed one scuffed shoe over a wrinkled pants
leg,'' Norden writes, ``I began by asking him to decipher the
metaphysical message of `2001.'''
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Much of the controversy surrounding ``2001'' deals with
the meaning of the metaphysical symbols that abound in the film _
the polished black monoliths, the orbital conjunction of earth,
moon and sun at each stage of the monoliths' intervention in human
destiny, the stunning final kaleidoscopic maelstrom of time and
space that engulfs the surviving astronaut and sets the stage for
his rebirth as a ``star child'' drifting toward earth in a
translucent placenta.
</P>
<P>
   One critic even called ``2001'' ``the first Nietzschean film,''
contending that its essential theme is Nietzsche's concept of man's
evolution from ape to human to superman.
</P>
<P>
   What WAS the metaphysical message of ``2001''?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: It's not a message that I ever intend to convey in
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``2001'' is a nonverbal experience _ out of two hours and 19
minutes of film, there are only a little less than 40 minutes of
dialogue. I tried to create a visual experience, one that bypasses
verbalized pigeonholing and directly penetrates the subconscious
with an emotional and philosophic content.
</P>
<P>
   To convolute (Marshall) McLuhan, in ``2001'' the message is the
medium. I intended the film to be an intensely subjective
experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of
consciousness, just as music does. To explain a Beethoven symphony
would be to emasculate it by erecting an artificial barrier between
conception and appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and
allegorical meaning of the film, and such speculation is one
indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep
level. But I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for ``2001''
that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's
missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   I think that if ``2001'' succeeds at all, it is in reaching a
wide spectrum of people who would not often give a thought to man's
destiny, his role in the cosmos and his relationship to higher
forms of life.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the case of someone who is highly intelligent,
certain ideas found in ``2001'' would, if presented as
abstractions, fall rather lifelessly and be automatically assigned
to pat intellectual categories. Experienced in a moving visual and
emotional context, however, they can resonate within the deepest
fibers of one's being.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Without laying out a philosophical road map for the
viewer, can you tell us your own interpretation of the meaning of
the film?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: No, for the reasons I've already given.
</P>
<P>
   How much would we appreciate ``La Gioconda'' (the ``Mona Lisa'')
today if Leonardo had written at the bottom of the canvas, ``This
lady is smiling slightly because she has rotten teeth'' or
``because she's hiding a secret from her lover''?
</P>
<P>
   It would shut off the viewer's appreciation and shackle him to a
``reality'' other than his own. I don't want that to happen to
``2001.''
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Arthur C. Clarke has said of the film, ``If anyone
understands it on the first viewing, we've failed in our
intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should the viewer have to see a film twice to get its
message?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I don't agree with that statement of Arthur's, and I
believe he made it facetiously.
</P>
<P>
   The very nature of the visual experience in ``2001'' is to give
the viewer an instantaneous, visceral reaction that does not _ and
should not _ require further amplification.
</P>
<P>
   Just speaking generally, however, I would say that there are
elements in any good film that would increase the viewer's interest
and appreciation on a second viewing. The momentum of a movie often
prevents every stimulating detail or nuance from having a full
impact the first time it's seen.
</P>
<P>
   The whole idea that a movie should be seen only once is an
extension of our traditional conception of the film as an ephemeral
entertainment rather than as a visual work of art.
</P>
<P>
   We don't believe that we should hear a great piece of music only
once, see a great painting only once or even read a great book just
once. But the film has until recent years been exempted from that
category of art, a situation I'm glad is finally changing.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Some prominent critics _ including Renata Adler of The
New York Times, John Simon of The New Leader, Judith Crist of New
York magazine and Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice _ apparently
felt that ``2001'' should be among those films still exempted from
the category of art. All four castigated it as dull, pretentious
and overlong.
</P>
<P>
   How do you account for their hostility?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: The four critics you mention all work for New York
publications.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews across America and around the world have been 95
percent enthusiastic. Some were more perceptive than others, of
course, but even those who praised the film on relatively
superficial grounds were able to get something of its message.
</P>
<P>
   New York was the only really hostile city. Perhaps there is a
certain element of the lumpen literati that is so dogmatically
atheist and materialistic and earthbound that it finds the grandeur
of space and the myriad mysteries of cosmic intelligence anathema.
</P>
<P>
   But film critics, fortunately, rarely have any effect on the
general public. Houses everywhere are packed, and the film is well
on its way to becoming the greatest moneymaker in MGM's history.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this sounds like a crass way to evaluate one's work, but
I think that _ especially with a film that is so obviously
different _ record audience attendance means people are saying the
right things to one another after they see it _ and isn't this
really what it's all about?
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Speaking of what it's all about, if you'll allow us to
return to the philosophical interpretation of ``2001,'' would you
agree with those critics who call it a profoundly religious film?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I will say that the God concept is at the heart of
``2001'' _ but not any traditional, anthropomorphic image of God.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe in any of Earth's monotheistic religions, but I
do believe that one can construct an intriguing scientific
definition of God, once you accept the fact that there are
approximately 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, that each star
is a life-giving sun and that there are approximately 100 billion
galaxies in just the visible universe.
</P>
<P>
   Given a planet in a stable orbit, not too hot and not too cold,
and given a few billion years of chance chemical reactions created
by the action of a sun's energy on the planet's chemicals, it's
fairly certain that life in one form or another will eventually
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   It's reasonable to assume that there must be, in fact, countless
billions of such planets where biological life has arisen, and the
odds of some proportion of such life developing intelligence are
high.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the sun is by no means an old star, and its planets are
mere children in cosmic age, so it seems likely that there are not
only billions of planets in the universe where intelligent life is
on a lower scale than man but also other billions where it is
approximately equal and others still where it is hundreds of
thousands of millions of years in advance of us.
</P>
<P>
   When you think of the giant technological strides that man has
made in a few millennia _ less than a microsecond in the chronology
of the universe _ can you imagine the evolutionary development that
much older life forms have taken?
</P>
<P>
   They may have progressed from biological species, which are
fragile shells for the mind at best, into immortal machine entities
and then, over innumerable eons, they could emerge from the
chrysalis of matter transformed into beings of pure energy and
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence
ungraspable by humans.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Even assuming the cosmic evolutionary path you suggest,
what has this to do with the nature of God?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Everything, because these beings would be gods to the
billions of less advanced races in the universe, just as man would
appear a god to an ant that somehow comprehended the man's
existence. They would possess the twin attributes of all deities _
omniscience and omnipotence.
</P>
<P>
   These entities might be in telepathic communication throughout
the cosmos and thus be aware of everything that occurs, tapping
every intelligent mind as effortlessly as we switch on the radio.
They might not be limited by the speed of light, and their presence
could penetrate to the farthest corners of the universe. They might
possess complete mastery over matter and energy, and in their final
evolutionary stage they might develop into an integrated,
collective, immortal consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   They would be incomprehensible to us except as gods, and if the
tendrils of their consciousness ever brushed men's minds, it is
only the hand of God we could grasp as an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: If such creatures do exist, why should they be
interested in man?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: They may not be. But why should man be interested in
microbes? The motives of such beings would be as alien to us as
their intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: In ``2001,'' such incorporeal creatures seem to
manipulate our destinies and control our evolution, though whether
for good or evil _ or both, or neither _ remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Do you really believe it's possible that man is a cosmic
plaything of such entities?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I don't really believe anything about them _ how can I?
Mere speculation on the possibility of their existence is
sufficiently overwhelming, without attempting to decipher their
motives.
</P>
<P>
   The important point is that all the standard attributes assigned
to God in our history could equally well be the characteristics of
biological entities who, billions of years ago, were at a stage of
development similar to man's own and evolved into something as
remote from man as man is remote from the primordial ooze from
which he first emerged.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: In this cosmic phylogeny you've described, isn't it
possible that there might be forms of intelligent life on an even
higher scale than these entities of pure energy, perhaps as far
removed from them as they are from us?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Of course there could be. In an infinite, eternal
universe, the point is that anything is possible, and it's unlikely
that we can even begin to scratch the surface of the full range of
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when astronauts are preparing to set foot on the
moon, I think it's necessary to open up our earthbound minds to
such speculation. No one knows what's waiting for us in the
universe. I think it was a prominent astronomer who wrote recently,
``Sometimes I think we are alone and sometimes I think we're not.
In either case, the idea is quite staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Have you ever used LSD or other so-called
consciousness-expanding drugs?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: No. I believe that drugs are basically of more use to
the audience than to the artist.
</P>
<P>
   I think that the illusion of oneness with the universe,
absorption with the significance of every object in your
environment and the pervasive aura of peace and contentment is not
the ideal state for an artist. It tranquilizes the creative
personality, which thrives on conflict and on the clash and ferment
of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The artist's transcendence must be within his own work. He
should not impose any artificial barriers between himself and the
mainspring of his subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that's turned me against LSD is that all the
people I know who use it have a peculiar inability to distinguish
between things that are really interesting and stimulating and
things that are not ... They seem to completely lose their critical
faculties and disengage themselves from some of the most
stimulating areas of life.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps when everything is beautiful, nothing is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Some critics have detected not only a deep pessimism
but also a kind of misanthropy in much of your work.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dr. Strangelove,'' for example, one reviewer commented that
your directorial attitude, despite the film's antiwar message,
seemed curiously aloof and detached, unmoved by the annihilation of
mankind, almost as if the Earth were being cleansed of an
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any truth to that?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Good God, no. You don't stop being concerned with man
because you recognize his essential absurdities and frailties and
pretensions. To me the only real immorality is that which endangers
the species, and the only evil, that which threatens its
annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   In the deepest sense, I believe in man's potential and in his
capacity for progress. In ``Strangelove,'' I was dealing with the
inherent irrationality in man that threatens to destroy him. That
irrationality is with us as strongly today, and must be conquered.
</P>
<P>
   But a recognition of insanity doesn't imply a celebration of it,
not a sense of despair and futility about the possibility of curing
it.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: In the five years since ``Dr. Strangelove'' was
released, the two major nuclear powers, the United States and the
Soviet Union, have reached substantial accommodation with each
other. Do you think this has reduced the danger of nuclear war?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: No. If anything, the overconfident Soviet-American
detente increases the threat of accidental nuclear war through
carelessness _ this has always been the greatest menace and the one
most difficult to cope with.
</P>
<P>
   The danger that nuclear weapons may be used, perhaps by a
secondary power, is as great if not greater than it ever has been,
and it is really quite amazing that the world has been able to
adjust to it psychologically with so little apparent dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly acute is the possibility of war breaking out as the
result of a sudden, unanticipated flare-up in some part of the
world, triggering a panic reaction and catapulting confused and
frightened men into decisions they are incapable of making
rationally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the serious threat remains that a psychotic figure
somewhere in the modern command structure could start a war, or at
the very least a limited exchange of nuclear weapons that could
devastate wide areas and cause innumerable casualties.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, was the theme of ``Dr. Strangelove,'' and I'm
not entirely assured that, somewhere in the Pentagon or the Red
Army upper echelons, there does not exist the real-life prototype
of Gen. Jack D. Ripper.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: You've been accused of revealing, in your films, a
strong hostility to the modern industrialized society of the
democratic West and a particular antagonism _ ambivalently laced
with a kind of morbid fascination _ toward automation.
</P>
<P>
   Your critics claim this is especially evident in ``2001,'' where
the archvillain of the film, the computer Hal 9000, is in a sense
the only human being.
</P>
<P>
   Do you believe that machines are becoming more like men and men
more like machines, and do you detect an eventual struggle for
dominance between the two?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: First of all, I'm not hostile toward machines at all _
just the opposite, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that we're entering a mechanarchy, however, and
that our already complex relationship with our machinery will
become even more complex as the machines become more and more
intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we will have to share this planet with machines whose
intelligence and abilities far surpass our own. But the
interrelationship, if intelligently managed by man, could have an
immeasurably enriching effect on society.
</P>
<P>
   Looking into the distant future, I suppose it's not
inconceivable that a semisentient robo-computer subculture could
evolve that might one day decide it no longer needed man.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard the story about the ultimate computer of
the future. For months scientists think of the first question to
submit to it, and finally they hit on the right one: ``Is there a
God?''
</P>
<P>
   After a moment of whirring and flashing lights, a card comes
out, punched with the words, ``There is now.''
</P>
<P>
   But this problem is a distant one, and I'm not staying up nights
worrying about it. I'm convinced that our toasters and TVs are
fully domesticated, though I'm not so sure about integrated
telephone circuits, which sometimes strike me as possessing a
malevolent life all their own.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Speaking of futuristic electronics and mechanics,
``2001's'' incredibly elaborate gadgetry and scenes of space flight
have been hailed, even by hostile critics, as a major cinematic
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   How were you able to achieve such remarkable special effects?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I can't answer that question technically in the time we
have available, but I can say that it was necessary to conceive,
design and engineer completely new techniques in order to produce
the special effects. This took 18 months and $6.5 million out of a
$10.5 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   I think an extraordinary amount of credit must go to Robert H.
O'Brien, the president of MGM, who had sufficient faith to allow me
to persevere at what must have at times appeared to be a task
without end.
</P>
<P>
   But I felt it was necessary to make this film in such a way that
every special-effects shot in it would be completely convincing _
something that had never before been accomplished in a motion
picture.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Thanks to those special effects, ``2001'' is
undoubtedly the most graphic depiction of space flight in the
history of films. And yet you have admitted that you yourself
refuse to fly, even on a commercial airliner. Why?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I suppose it comes down to a rather awesome awareness
of mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Our ability, unlike the other animals, to conceptualize our own
end creates tremendous psychic strains within us. Whether we admit
it or not, in each man's chest a tiny ferret of fear at this
ultimate knowledge gnaws away at his ego and his sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   We're fortunate, in a way, that our body and the fulfillment of
its needs and functions plays such an imperative role in our lives
_ this physical shell creates a buffer between us and the
mind-paralyzing realization that only a few years of existence
separate birth from death.
</P>
<P>
   If man really sat back and thought about his impending
termination and his terrifying insignificance and aloneness in the
cosmos, he would surely go mad or succumb to a numbing sense of
futility. Why, he might ask himself, should he bother to write a
great symphony, strive to make a living or even to love another
when he is no more than a momentary microbe on a dust mote whirling
through the unimaginable immensity of space?
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: If life is so purposeless, do you feel that it's worth
living?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Yes, for those of us who manage somehow to cope with
our mortality. The very meaninglessness of life forces man to
create his own meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Children, of course, begin life with an untarnished sense of
wonder, a capacity to experience total joy at something as simple
as the greenness of a leaf. But as they grow older, the awareness
of death and decay begins to impinge on their consciousness and
subtly erode their joie de vivre, their idealism _ and their
assumption of immortality.
</P>
<P>
   As a child matures he sees death and pain everywhere about him,
and begins to lose faith in faith and in the ultimate goodness of
man. But if he's reasonably strong _ and lucky _ he can emerge from
this twilight of the soul into a rebirth of life's elan. Both
because of and in spite of his awareness of the meaninglessness of
life, he can forge a fresh sense of purpose and affirmation.
</P>
<P>
   He may not recapture the same pure sense of wonder he was born
with, but he can shape something far more enduring and sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is
hostile but that it is indifferent. But if we can come to terms
with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the
boundaries of death, however mutable man may be able to make them,
our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Will we be able to find any deep meaning or
fulfillment, either as individuals or as a species, as long as we
continue to live with the knowledge that all human life could be
snuffed out at any moment in a nuclear catastrophe?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: We must, for in the final analysis there may be no
sound way to eliminate the threat of self-extinction without
changing human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you managed to get every country disarmed down to the
bow and arrow, you would still be unable to lobotomize either the
knowledge of how to build nuclear warheads or the perversity that
allows us to rationalize their use. Given these two categorical
imperatives in a disarmed world, the first country to amass even a
few weapons would have a great incentive to use them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   So an argument might be made that there is a greater chance for
some use of nuclear weapons in a totally disarmed world, though
less chance of global extinction, while in a world armed to the
teeth you have less chance for some use _ but a great chance of
extinction if they're used.
</P>
<P>
   If you try to remove yourself from an earthly perspective and
look at this tragic paradox with the detachment of an
extraterrestrial, the whole thing is totally irrational. Man now
has the power in one mad, incandescent moment to exterminate the
entire species _ our own generation could be the last on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One miscalculation and all the achievements of history could
vanish in a mushroom cloud. One misstep and all of man's
aspirations and strivings over the millennia could be terminated.
One short circuit in a computer, one lunatic in a command structure
and we could negate the heritage of the billions who have died
since the dawn of man and abort the promise of the billions yet
unborn _ the ultimate genocide.
</P>
<P>
   What an irony that the discovery of nuclear power, with its
potential for annihilation, also constitutes the first tottering
step into the universe that must be taken by all intelligent
worlds. Unhappily, the infant-mortality rate among emerging
civilizations in the cosmos may be very high.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it will matter, except to us. The destruction of this
planet would have no significance on a cosmic scale _ to an
observer in the Andromeda nebulae, the sign of our extinction would
be no more than a match flaring for a second in the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   And if that match does blaze in the darkness, there will be none
to mourn a race that used a power that could have lit a beacon in
the stars to light its funeral pyre.
</P>
<P>
   The choice is ours.

Jacket'' (1987) and a black-and-white photo of Stanley Kubrick in
1984. 
 By ERIC NORDEN  
 c.1968/1996 Playboy  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When director Stanley Kubrick died on March 7 at age 70, he left
behind a dazzling body of work _ and a legacy of almost total
silence.
</P>
<P>
   In four decades as a filmmaker, Kubrick virtually never agreed
to be interviewed. In 1968, however, shortly after the release of
his seminal film version of Arthur C. Clarke's science-fiction
novel ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' the director welcomed a Playboy
writer to his London home, where he talked about ``2001'' and ``Dr.
Strangelove'' (1964), his earlier black comedy about a deranged
general who ultimately triggers a nuclear holocaust. Together the
two films constituted the first parts of what would become a
future-vision triptych with his next film, ``A Clockwork Orange''
(1971).
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from that interview follow. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer Eric Norden found Kubrick _ a slim, relaxed man with
thinning hair, dark beard and intense eyes _ sprawled in a chair on
the spacious expanse of lawn overlooking his elegantly tended
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Kubrick crossed one scuffed shoe over a wrinkled pants
leg,'' Norden writes, ``I began by asking him to decipher the
metaphysical message of `2001.'''
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: It's not a message that I ever intend to convey in
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``2001'' is a nonverbal experience _ out of two hours and 19
minutes of film, there are only a little less than 40 minutes of
dialogue. I tried to create a visual experience, one that bypasses
verbalized pigeonholing and directly penetrates the subconscious
with an emotional and philosophic content.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and
allegorical meaning of the film, and such speculation is one
indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep
level. But I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for ``2001''
that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's
missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Arthur C. Clarke has said of the film, ``If anyone
understands it on the first viewing, we've failed in our
intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should the viewer have to see a film twice to get its
message?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I don't agree with that statement of Arthur's, and I
believe he made it facetiously.
</P>
<P>
   The very nature of the visual experience in ``2001'' is to give
the viewer an instantaneous, visceral reaction that does not _ and
should not _ require further amplification.
</P>
<P>
   Just speaking generally, however, I would say that there are
elements in any good film that would increase the viewer's interest
and appreciation on a second viewing. The momentum of a movie often
prevents every stimulating detail or nuance from having a full
impact the first time it's seen.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Would you agree with those critics who call it a
profoundly religious film?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I will say that the God concept is at the heart of
``2001'' _ but not any traditional, anthropomorphic image of God.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe in any of Earth's monotheistic religions, but I
do believe that one can construct an intriguing scientific
definition of God, once you accept the fact that there are
approximately 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, that each star
is a life-giving sun and that there are approximately 100 billion
galaxies in just the visible universe.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Now, the sun is by no means an old star, and its planets are
mere children in cosmic age, so it seems likely that there are not
only billions of planets in the universe where intelligent life is
on a lower scale than man but also other billions where it is
approximately equal and others still where it is hundreds of
thousands of millions of years in advance of us.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence
ungraspable by humans.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Even assuming the cosmic evolutionary path you suggest,
what has this to do with the nature of God?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Everything, because these beings would be gods to the
billions of less advanced races in the universe, just as man would
appear a god to an ant that somehow comprehended the man's
existence. They would possess the twin attributes of all deities _
omniscience and omnipotence.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   They would be incomprehensible to us except as gods, and if the
tendrils of their consciousness ever brushed men's minds, it is
only the hand of God we could grasp as an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: If such creatures do exist, why should they be
interested in man?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: They may not be. But why should man be interested in
microbes? The motives of such beings would be as alien to us as
their intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Some critics have detected not only a deep pessimism
but also a kind of misanthropy in much of your work.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dr. Strangelove,'' for example, one reviewer commented that
your directorial attitude, despite the film's antiwar message,
seemed curiously aloof and detached, unmoved by the annihilation of
mankind, almost as if the Earth were being cleansed of an

   Is there any truth to that?
</P>

because you recognize his essential absurdities and frailties and
pretensions. To me the only real immorality is that which endangers
the species, and the only evil, that which threatens its
annihilation.
</P>

capacity for progress. In ``Strangelove,'' I was dealing with the
inherent irrationality in man that threatens to destroy him. That
irrationality is with us as strongly today, and must be conquered.

 c.1968 Playboy  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When director Stanley Kubrick died on March 7 at age 70, he left
behind a dazzling body of work _ and a legacy of almost total
silence.
</P>
<P>
   In four decades as a filmmaker, Kubrick virtually never agreed
to be interviewed. In 1968, however, shortly after the release of
his seminal film version of Arthur C. Clarke's science-fiction
novel ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' the director welcomed a Playboy
writer to his London home, where he talked about ``2001'' and ``Dr.

general who ultimately triggers a nuclear holocaust. Together the
two films constituted the first parts of what would become a
future-vision triptych with his next film, ``A Clockwork Orange''
(1971).
</P>
<P>
   The director spoke freely about the films, his work and his
visions of the future in the interview, excerpts from which
follow. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To discover what has made Kubrick so respected _ and so
controversial _ a director, and to plumb both his own complexities
and those of ``2001,'' Playboy interviewed Kubrick at his elegant
mansion outside London, a short drive from MGM's studio at Borham
Wood, where he is working on his latest film.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer Eric Norden found Kubrick _ a slim, relaxed man with
thinning hair, dark beard and intense eyes _ sprawled in a chair on
the spacious expanse of lawn overlooking his elegantly tended
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Kubrick crossed one scuffed shoe over a wrinkled pants
leg,'' Norden writes, ``I began by asking him to decipher the
metaphysical message of `2001.'''
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Much of the controversy surrounding ``2001'' deals with
the meaning of the metaphysical symbols that abound in the film _
the polished black monoliths, the orbital conjunction of earth,
moon and sun at each stage of the monoliths' intervention in human
destiny, the stunning final kaleidoscopic maelstrom of time and
space that engulfs the surviving astronaut and sets the stage for
his rebirth as a ``star child'' drifting toward earth in a
translucent placenta.
</P>
<P>
   One critic even called ``2001'' ``the first Nietzschean film,''
contending that its essential theme is Nietzsche's concept of man's
evolution from ape to human to superman.
</P>
<P>
   What WAS the metaphysical message of ``2001''?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: It's not a message that I ever intend to convey in
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``2001'' is a nonverbal experience _ out of two hours and 19
minutes of film, there are only a little less than 40 minutes of
dialogue. I tried to create a visual experience, one that bypasses
verbalized pigeonholing and directly penetrates the subconscious
with an emotional and philosophic content.
</P>
<P>
   To convolute (Marshall) McLuhan, in ``2001'' the message is the
medium. I intended the film to be an intensely subjective
experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of
consciousness, just as music does. To explain a Beethoven symphony
would be to emasculate it by erecting an artificial barrier between
conception and appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and
allegorical meaning of the film, and such speculation is one
indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep
level. But I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for ``2001''
that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's
missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   I think that if ``2001'' succeeds at all, it is in reaching a
wide spectrum of people who would not often give a thought to man's
destiny, his role in the cosmos and his relationship to higher
forms of life.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the case of someone who is highly intelligent,
certain ideas found in ``2001'' would, if presented as
abstractions, fall rather lifelessly and be automatically assigned
to pat intellectual categories. Experienced in a moving visual and
emotional context, however, they can resonate within the deepest
fibers of one's being.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Without laying out a philosophical road map for the
viewer, can you tell us your own interpretation of the meaning of
the film?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: No, for the reasons I've already given.
</P>
<P>
   How much would we appreciate ``La Gioconda'' (the ``Mona Lisa'')
today if Leonardo had written at the bottom of the canvas, ``This
lady is smiling slightly because she has rotten teeth'' or
``because she's hiding a secret from her lover''?
</P>
<P>
   It would shut off the viewer's appreciation and shackle him to a
``reality'' other than his own. I don't want that to happen to
``2001.''
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Arthur C. Clarke has said of the film, ``If anyone
understands it on the first viewing, we've failed in our
intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should the viewer have to see a film twice to get its
message?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I don't agree with that statement of Arthur's, and I
believe he made it facetiously.
</P>
<P>
   The very nature of the visual experience in ``2001'' is to give
the viewer an instantaneous, visceral reaction that does not _ and
should not _ require further amplification.
</P>
<P>
   Just speaking generally, however, I would say that there are
elements in any good film that would increase the viewer's interest
and appreciation on a second viewing. The momentum of a movie often
prevents every stimulating detail or nuance from having a full
impact the first time it's seen.
</P>
<P>
   The whole idea that a movie should be seen only once is an
extension of our traditional conception of the film as an ephemeral
entertainment rather than as a visual work of art.
</P>
<P>
   We don't believe that we should hear a great piece of music only
once, see a great painting only once or even read a great book just
once. But the film has until recent years been exempted from that
category of art, a situation I'm glad is finally changing.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Some prominent critics _ including Renata Adler of The
New York Times, John Simon of The New Leader, Judith Crist of New
York magazine and Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice _ apparently
felt that ``2001'' should be among those films still exempted from
the category of art. All four castigated it as dull, pretentious
and overlong.
</P>
<P>
   How do you account for their hostility?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: The four critics you mention all work for New York
publications.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews across America and around the world have been 95
percent enthusiastic. Some were more perceptive than others, of
course, but even those who praised the film on relatively
superficial grounds were able to get something of its message.
</P>
<P>
   New York was the only really hostile city. Perhaps there is a
certain element of the lumpen literati that is so dogmatically
atheist and materialistic and earthbound that it finds the grandeur
of space and the myriad mysteries of cosmic intelligence anathema.
</P>
<P>
   But film critics, fortunately, rarely have any effect on the
general public. Houses everywhere are packed, and the film is well
on its way to becoming the greatest moneymaker in MGM's history.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this sounds like a crass way to evaluate one's work, but
I think that _ especially with a film that is so obviously
different _ record audience attendance means people are saying the
right things to one another after they see it _ and isn't this
really what it's all about?
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Speaking of what it's all about, if you'll allow us to
return to the philosophical interpretation of ``2001,'' would you
agree with those critics who call it a profoundly religious film?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I will say that the God concept is at the heart of
``2001'' _ but not any traditional, anthropomorphic image of God.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe in any of Earth's monotheistic religions, but I
do believe that one can construct an intriguing scientific
definition of God, once you accept the fact that there are
approximately 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, that each star
is a life-giving sun and that there are approximately 100 billion
galaxies in just the visible universe.
</P>
<P>
   Given a planet in a stable orbit, not too hot and not too cold,
and given a few billion years of chance chemical reactions created
by the action of a sun's energy on the planet's chemicals, it's
fairly certain that life in one form or another will eventually
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   It's reasonable to assume that there must be, in fact, countless
billions of such planets where biological life has arisen, and the
odds of some proportion of such life developing intelligence are
high.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the sun is by no means an old star, and its planets are
mere children in cosmic age, so it seems likely that there are not
only billions of planets in the universe where intelligent life is
on a lower scale than man but also other billions where it is
approximately equal and others still where it is hundreds of
thousands of millions of years in advance of us.
</P>
<P>
   When you think of the giant technological strides that man has
made in a few millennia _ less than a microsecond in the chronology
of the universe _ can you imagine the evolutionary development that
much older life forms have taken?
</P>
<P>
   They may have progressed from biological species, which are
fragile shells for the mind at best, into immortal machine entities
and then, over innumerable eons, they could emerge from the
chrysalis of matter transformed into beings of pure energy and
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence
ungraspable by humans.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Even assuming the cosmic evolutionary path you suggest,
what has this to do with the nature of God?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Everything, because these beings would be gods to the
billions of less advanced races in the universe, just as man would
appear a god to an ant that somehow comprehended the man's
existence. They would possess the twin attributes of all deities _
omniscience and omnipotence.
</P>
<P>
   These entities might be in telepathic communication throughout
the cosmos and thus be aware of everything that occurs, tapping
every intelligent mind as effortlessly as we switch on the radio.
They might not be limited by the speed of light, and their presence
could penetrate to the farthest corners of the universe. They might
possess complete mastery over matter and energy, and in their final
evolutionary stage they might develop into an integrated,
collective, immortal consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   They would be incomprehensible to us except as gods, and if the
tendrils of their consciousness ever brushed men's minds, it is
only the hand of God we could grasp as an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: If such creatures do exist, why should they be
interested in man?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: They may not be. But why should man be interested in
microbes? The motives of such beings would be as alien to us as
their intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: In ``2001,'' such incorporeal creatures seem to
manipulate our destinies and control our evolution, though whether
for good or evil _ or both, or neither _ remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Do you really believe it's possible that man is a cosmic
plaything of such entities?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I don't really believe anything about them _ how can I?
Mere speculation on the possibility of their existence is
sufficiently overwhelming, without attempting to decipher their
motives.
</P>
<P>
   The important point is that all the standard attributes assigned
to God in our history could equally well be the characteristics of
biological entities who, billions of years ago, were at a stage of
development similar to man's own and evolved into something as
remote from man as man is remote from the primordial ooze from
which he first emerged.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: In this cosmic phylogeny you've described, isn't it
possible that there might be forms of intelligent life on an even
higher scale than these entities of pure energy, perhaps as far
removed from them as they are from us?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Of course there could be. In an infinite, eternal
universe, the point is that anything is possible, and it's unlikely
that we can even begin to scratch the surface of the full range of
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when astronauts are preparing to set foot on the
moon, I think it's necessary to open up our earthbound minds to
such speculation. No one knows what's waiting for us in the
universe. I think it was a prominent astronomer who wrote recently,
``Sometimes I think we are alone and sometimes I think we're not.
In either case, the idea is quite staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Have you ever used LSD or other so-called
consciousness-expanding drugs?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: No. I believe that drugs are basically of more use to
the audience than to the artist.
</P>
<P>
   I think that the illusion of oneness with the universe,
absorption with the significance of every object in your
environment and the pervasive aura of peace and contentment is not
the ideal state for an artist. It tranquilizes the creative
personality, which thrives on conflict and on the clash and ferment
of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The artist's transcendence must be within his own work. He
should not impose any artificial barriers between himself and the
mainspring of his subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that's turned me against LSD is that all the
people I know who use it have a peculiar inability to distinguish
between things that are really interesting and stimulating and
things that are not ... They seem to completely lose their critical
faculties and disengage themselves from some of the most
stimulating areas of life.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps when everything is beautiful, nothing is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Some critics have detected not only a deep pessimism
but also a kind of misanthropy in much of your work.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dr. Strangelove,'' for example, one reviewer commented that
your directorial attitude, despite the film's antiwar message,
seemed curiously aloof and detached, unmoved by the annihilation of
mankind, almost as if the Earth were being cleansed of an
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any truth to that?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Good God, no. You don't stop being concerned with man
because you recognize his essential absurdities and frailties and
pretensions. To me the only real immorality is that which endangers
the species, and the only evil, that which threatens its
annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   In the deepest sense, I believe in man's potential and in his
capacity for progress. In ``Strangelove,'' I was dealing with the
inherent irrationality in man that threatens to destroy him. That
irrationality is with us as strongly today, and must be conquered.
</P>
<P>
   But a recognition of insanity doesn't imply a celebration of it,
not a sense of despair and futility about the possibility of curing
it.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: In the five years since ``Dr. Strangelove'' was
released, the two major nuclear powers, the United States and the
Soviet Union, have reached substantial accommodation with each
other. Do you think this has reduced the danger of nuclear war?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: No. If anything, the overconfident Soviet-American
detente increases the threat of accidental nuclear war through
carelessness _ this has always been the greatest menace and the one
most difficult to cope with.
</P>
<P>
   The danger that nuclear weapons may be used, perhaps by a
secondary power, is as great if not greater than it ever has been,
and it is really quite amazing that the world has been able to
adjust to it psychologically with so little apparent dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly acute is the possibility of war breaking out as the
result of a sudden, unanticipated flare-up in some part of the
world, triggering a panic reaction and catapulting confused and
frightened men into decisions they are incapable of making
rationally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the serious threat remains that a psychotic figure
somewhere in the modern command structure could start a war, or at
the very least a limited exchange of nuclear weapons that could
devastate wide areas and cause innumerable casualties.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, was the theme of ``Dr. Strangelove,'' and I'm
not entirely assured that, somewhere in the Pentagon or the Red
Army upper echelons, there does not exist the real-life prototype
of Gen. Jack D. Ripper.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: You've been accused of revealing, in your films, a
strong hostility to the modern industrialized society of the
democratic West and a particular antagonism _ ambivalently laced
with a kind of morbid fascination _ toward automation.
</P>
<P>
   Your critics claim this is especially evident in ``2001,'' where
the archvillain of the film, the computer Hal 9000, is in a sense
the only human being.
</P>
<P>
   Do you believe that machines are becoming more like men and men
more like machines, and do you detect an eventual struggle for
dominance between the two?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: First of all, I'm not hostile toward machines at all _
just the opposite, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that we're entering a mechanarchy, however, and
that our already complex relationship with our machinery will
become even more complex as the machines become more and more
intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we will have to share this planet with machines whose
intelligence and abilities far surpass our own. But the
interrelationship, if intelligently managed by man, could have an
immeasurably enriching effect on society.
</P>
<P>
   Looking into the distant future, I suppose it's not
inconceivable that a semisentient robo-computer subculture could
evolve that might one day decide it no longer needed man.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard the story about the ultimate computer of
the future. For months scientists think of the first question to
submit to it, and finally they hit on the right one: ``Is there a
God?''
</P>
<P>
   After a moment of whirring and flashing lights, a card comes
out, punched with the words, ``There is now.''
</P>
<P>
   But this problem is a distant one, and I'm not staying up nights
worrying about it. I'm convinced that our toasters and TVs are
fully domesticated, though I'm not so sure about integrated
telephone circuits, which sometimes strike me as possessing a
malevolent life all their own.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Speaking of futuristic electronics and mechanics,
``2001's'' incredibly elaborate gadgetry and scenes of space flight
have been hailed, even by hostile critics, as a major cinematic
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   How were you able to achieve such remarkable special effects?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I can't answer that question technically in the time we
have available, but I can say that it was necessary to conceive,
design and engineer completely new techniques in order to produce
the special effects. This took 18 months and $6.5 million out of a
$10.5 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   I think an extraordinary amount of credit must go to Robert H.
O'Brien, the president of MGM, who had sufficient faith to allow me
to persevere at what must have at times appeared to be a task
without end.
</P>
<P>
   But I felt it was necessary to make this film in such a way that
every special-effects shot in it would be completely convincing _
something that had never before been accomplished in a motion
picture.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Thanks to those special effects, ``2001'' is
undoubtedly the most graphic depiction of space flight in the
history of films. And yet you have admitted that you yourself
refuse to fly, even on a commercial airliner. Why?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I suppose it comes down to a rather awesome awareness
of mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Our ability, unlike the other animals, to conceptualize our own
end creates tremendous psychic strains within us. Whether we admit
it or not, in each man's chest a tiny ferret of fear at this
ultimate knowledge gnaws away at his ego and his sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   We're fortunate, in a way, that our body and the fulfillment of
its needs and functions plays such an imperative role in our lives
_ this physical shell creates a buffer between us and the
mind-paralyzing realization that only a few years of existence
separate birth from death.
</P>
<P>
   If man really sat back and thought about his impending
termination and his terrifying insignificance and aloneness in the
cosmos, he would surely go mad or succumb to a numbing sense of
futility. Why, he might ask himself, should he bother to write a
great symphony, strive to make a living or even to love another
when he is no more than a momentary microbe on a dust mote whirling
through the unimaginable immensity of space?
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: If life is so purposeless, do you feel that it's worth
living?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Yes, for those of us who manage somehow to cope with
our mortality. The very meaninglessness of life forces man to
create his own meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Children, of course, begin life with an untarnished sense of
wonder, a capacity to experience total joy at something as simple
as the greenness of a leaf. But as they grow older, the awareness
of death and decay begins to impinge on their consciousness and
subtly erode their joie de vivre, their idealism _ and their
assumption of immortality.
</P>
<P>
   As a child matures he sees death and pain everywhere about him,
and begins to lose faith in faith and in the ultimate goodness of
man. But if he's reasonably strong _ and lucky _ he can emerge from
this twilight of the soul into a rebirth of life's elan. Both
because of and in spite of his awareness of the meaninglessness of
life, he can forge a fresh sense of purpose and affirmation.
</P>
<P>
   He may not recapture the same pure sense of wonder he was born
with, but he can shape something far more enduring and sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is
hostile but that it is indifferent. But if we can come to terms
with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the
boundaries of death, however mutable man may be able to make them,
our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Will we be able to find any deep meaning or
fulfillment, either as individuals or as a species, as long as we
continue to live with the knowledge that all human life could be
snuffed out at any moment in a nuclear catastrophe?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: We must, for in the final analysis there may be no
sound way to eliminate the threat of self-extinction without
changing human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you managed to get every country disarmed down to the
bow and arrow, you would still be unable to lobotomize either the
knowledge of how to build nuclear warheads or the perversity that
allows us to rationalize their use. Given these two categorical
imperatives in a disarmed world, the first country to amass even a
few weapons would have a great incentive to use them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   So an argument might be made that there is a greater chance for
some use of nuclear weapons in a totally disarmed world, though
less chance of global extinction, while in a world armed to the
teeth you have less chance for some use _ but a great chance of
extinction if they're used.
</P>
<P>
   If you try to remove yourself from an earthly perspective and
look at this tragic paradox with the detachment of an
extraterrestrial, the whole thing is totally irrational. Man now
has the power in one mad, incandescent moment to exterminate the
entire species _ our own generation could be the last on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One miscalculation and all the achievements of history could
vanish in a mushroom cloud. One misstep and all of man's
aspirations and strivings over the millennia could be terminated.
One short circuit in a computer, one lunatic in a command structure
and we could negate the heritage of the billions who have died
since the dawn of man and abort the promise of the billions yet
unborn _ the ultimate genocide.
</P>
<P>
   What an irony that the discovery of nuclear power, with its
potential for annihilation, also constitutes the first tottering
step into the universe that must be taken by all intelligent
worlds. Unhappily, the infant-mortality rate among emerging
civilizations in the cosmos may be very high.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it will matter, except to us. The destruction of this
planet would have no significance on a cosmic scale _ to an
observer in the Andromeda nebulae, the sign of our extinction would
be no more than a match flaring for a second in the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   And if that match does blaze in the darkness, there will be none
to mourn a race that used a power that could have lit a beacon in
the stars to light its funeral pyre.
</P>
<P>
   The choice is ours.

Jacket'' (1987) and a black-and-white photo of Stanley Kubrick in
1984. 
 By ERIC NORDEN  
 c.1968/1996 Playboy  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When director Stanley Kubrick died on March 7 at age 70, he left
behind a dazzling body of work _ and a legacy of almost total
silence.
</P>
<P>
   In four decades as a filmmaker, Kubrick virtually never agreed
to be interviewed. In 1968, however, shortly after the release of
his seminal film version of Arthur C. Clarke's science-fiction
novel ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' the director welcomed a Playboy
writer to his London home, where he talked about ``2001'' and ``Dr.
Strangelove'' (1964), his earlier black comedy about a deranged
general who ultimately triggers a nuclear holocaust. Together the
two films constituted the first parts of what would become a
future-vision triptych with his next film, ``A Clockwork Orange''
(1971).
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from that interview follow. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer Eric Norden found Kubrick _ a slim, relaxed man with
thinning hair, dark beard and intense eyes _ sprawled in a chair on
the spacious expanse of lawn overlooking his elegantly tended
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Kubrick crossed one scuffed shoe over a wrinkled pants
leg,'' Norden writes, ``I began by asking him to decipher the
metaphysical message of `2001.'''
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: It's not a message that I ever intend to convey in
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``2001'' is a nonverbal experience _ out of two hours and 19
minutes of film, there are only a little less than 40 minutes of
dialogue. I tried to create a visual experience, one that bypasses
verbalized pigeonholing and directly penetrates the subconscious
with an emotional and philosophic content.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and
allegorical meaning of the film, and such speculation is one
indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep
level. But I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for ``2001''
that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's
missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Arthur C. Clarke has said of the film, ``If anyone
understands it on the first viewing, we've failed in our
intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should the viewer have to see a film twice to get its
message?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I don't agree with that statement of Arthur's, and I
believe he made it facetiously.
</P>
<P>
   The very nature of the visual experience in ``2001'' is to give
the viewer an instantaneous, visceral reaction that does not _ and
should not _ require further amplification.
</P>
<P>
   Just speaking generally, however, I would say that there are
elements in any good film that would increase the viewer's interest
and appreciation on a second viewing. The momentum of a movie often
prevents every stimulating detail or nuance from having a full
impact the first time it's seen.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Would you agree with those critics who call it a
profoundly religious film?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I will say that the God concept is at the heart of
``2001'' _ but not any traditional, anthropomorphic image of God.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe in any of Earth's monotheistic religions, but I
do believe that one can construct an intriguing scientific
definition of God, once you accept the fact that there are
approximately 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, that each star
is a life-giving sun and that there are approximately 100 billion
galaxies in just the visible universe.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Now, the sun is by no means an old star, and its planets are
mere children in cosmic age, so it seems likely that there are not
only billions of planets in the universe where intelligent life is
on a lower scale than man but also other billions where it is
approximately equal and others still where it is hundreds of
thousands of millions of years in advance of us.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence
ungraspable by humans.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Even assuming the cosmic evolutionary path you suggest,
what has this to do with the nature of God?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Everything, because these beings would be gods to the
billions of less advanced races in the universe, just as man would
appear a god to an ant that somehow comprehended the man's
existence. They would possess the twin attributes of all deities _
omniscience and omnipotence.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   They would be incomprehensible to us except as gods, and if the
tendrils of their consciousness ever brushed men's minds, it is
only the hand of God we could grasp as an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: If such creatures do exist, why should they be
interested in man?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: They may not be. But why should man be interested in
microbes? The motives of such beings would be as alien to us as
their intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Some critics have detected not only a deep pessimism
but also a kind of misanthropy in much of your work.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dr. Strangelove,'' for example, one reviewer commented that
your directorial attitude, despite the film's antiwar message,
seemed curiously aloof and detached, unmoved by the annihilation of
mankind, almost as if the Earth were being cleansed of an
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any truth to that?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Good God, no. You don't stop being concerned with man
because you recognize his essential absurdities and frailties and
pretensions. To me the only real immorality is that which endangers
the species, and the only evil, that which threatens its
annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   In the deepest sense, I believe in man's potential and in his
capacity for progress. In ``Strangelove,'' I was dealing with the
inherent irrationality in man that threatens to destroy him. That
irrationality is with us as strongly today, and must be conquered.
</P>
<P>
   But a recognition of insanity doesn't imply a celebration of it,
nor a sense of despair and futility about the possibility of curing
it.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: You've been accused of revealing, in your films, a
strong hostility to the modern industrialized society of the
democratic West and a particular antagonism _ ambivalently laced
with a kind of morbid fascination _ toward automation.
</P>
<P>
   Your critics claim this is especially evident in ``2001,'' where
the archvillain of the film, the computer Hal 9000, is in a sense
the only human being.
</P>
<P>
   Do you believe that machines are becoming more like men and men
more like machines, and do you detect an eventual struggle for
dominance between the two?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: First of all, I'm not hostile toward machines at all _
just the opposite, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that we're entering a mechanarchy, however, and
that our already complex relationship with our machinery will
become even more complex as the machines become more and more
intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we will have to share this planet with machines whose
intelligence and abilities far surpass our own. But the
interrelationship, if intelligently managed by man, could have an
immeasurably enriching effect on society.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   But this problem is a distant one, and I'm not staying up nights
worrying about it. I'm convinced that our toasters and TVs are
fully domesticated, though I'm not so sure about integrated
telephone circuits, which sometimes strike me as possessing a
malevolent life all their own.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: ``2001'' is undoubtedly the most graphic depiction of
space flight in the history of films. And yet you have admitted
that you yourself refuse to fly, even on a commercial airliner.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I suppose it comes down to a rather awesome awareness
of mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Our ability, unlike the other animals, to conceptualize our own
end creates tremendous psychic strains within us. Whether we admit
it or not, in each man's chest a tiny ferret of fear at this
ultimate knowledge gnaws away at his ego and his sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   We're fortunate, in a way, that our body and the fulfillment of
its needs and functions plays such an imperative role in our lives
_ this physical shell creates a buffer between us and the
mind-paralyzing realization that only a few years of existence
separate birth from death.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: If life is so purposeless, do you feel that it's worth
living?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Yes, for those of us who manage somehow to cope with
our mortality. The very meaninglessness of life forces man to
create his own meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is
hostile but that it is indifferent. But if we can come to terms
with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the
boundaries of death, however mutable man may be able to make them,
our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.

 By ERIC NORDEN  
 c.1968 Playboy  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When director Stanley Kubrick died on March 7 at age 70, he left
behind a dazzling body of work _ and a legacy of almost total
silence.
</P>
<P>
   In four decades as a filmmaker, Kubrick virtually never agreed
to be interviewed. In 1968, however, shortly after the release of
his seminal film version of Arthur C. Clarke's science-fiction
novel ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' the director welcomed a Playboy
writer to his London home, where he talked about ``2001'' and ``Dr.
Strangelove'' (1964), his earlier black comedy about a deranged
general who ultimately triggers a nuclear holocaust. Together the
two films constituted the first parts of what would become a
future-vision triptych with his next film, ``A Clockwork Orange''
(1971).
</P>
<P>
   The director spoke freely about the films, his work and his
visions of the future in the interview, excerpts from which
follow. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To discover what has made Kubrick so respected _ and so
controversial _ a director, and to plumb both his own complexities
and those of ``2001,'' Playboy interviewed Kubrick at his elegant
mansion outside London, a short drive from MGM's studio at Borham
Wood, where he is working on his latest film.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer Eric Norden found Kubrick _ a slim, relaxed man with
thinning hair, dark beard and intense eyes _ sprawled in a chair on
the spacious expanse of lawn overlooking his elegantly tended
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Kubrick crossed one scuffed shoe over a wrinkled pants
leg,'' Norden writes, ``I began by asking him to decipher the
metaphysical message of `2001.'''
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Much of the controversy surrounding ``2001'' deals with
the meaning of the metaphysical symbols that abound in the film _
the polished black monoliths, the orbital conjunction of earth,
moon and sun at each stage of the monoliths' intervention in human
destiny, the stunning final kaleidoscopic maelstrom of time and
space that engulfs the surviving astronaut and sets the stage for
his rebirth as a ``star child'' drifting toward earth in a
translucent placenta.
</P>
<P>
   One critic even called ``2001'' ``the first Nietzschean film,''
contending that its essential theme is Nietzsche's concept of man's
evolution from ape to human to superman.
</P>
<P>
   What WAS the metaphysical message of ``2001''?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: It's not a message that I ever intend to convey in
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``2001'' is a nonverbal experience _ out of two hours and 19
minutes of film, there are only a little less than 40 minutes of
dialogue. I tried to create a visual experience, one that bypasses
verbalized pigeonholing and directly penetrates the subconscious
with an emotional and philosophic content.
</P>
<P>
   To convolute (Marshall) McLuhan, in ``2001'' the message is the
medium. I intended the film to be an intensely subjective
experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of
consciousness, just as music does. To explain a Beethoven symphony
would be to emasculate it by erecting an artificial barrier between
conception and appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and
allegorical meaning of the film, and such speculation is one
indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep
level. But I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for ``2001''
that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's
missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   I think that if ``2001'' succeeds at all, it is in reaching a
wide spectrum of people who would not often give a thought to man's
destiny, his role in the cosmos and his relationship to higher
forms of life.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the case of someone who is highly intelligent,
certain ideas found in ``2001'' would, if presented as
abstractions, fall rather lifelessly and be automatically assigned
to pat intellectual categories. Experienced in a moving visual and
emotional context, however, they can resonate within the deepest
fibers of one's being.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Without laying out a philosophical road map for the
viewer, can you tell us your own interpretation of the meaning of
the film?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: No, for the reasons I've already given.
</P>
<P>
   How much would we appreciate ``La Gioconda'' (the ``Mona Lisa'')
today if Leonardo had written at the bottom of the canvas, ``This
lady is smiling slightly because she has rotten teeth'' or
``because she's hiding a secret from her lover''?
</P>
<P>
   It would shut off the viewer's appreciation and shackle him to a
``reality'' other than his own. I don't want that to happen to
``2001.''
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Arthur C. Clarke has said of the film, ``If anyone
understands it on the first viewing, we've failed in our
intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should the viewer have to see a film twice to get its
message?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I don't agree with that statement of Arthur's, and I
believe he made it facetiously.
</P>
<P>
   The very nature of the visual experience in ``2001'' is to give
the viewer an instantaneous, visceral reaction that does not _ and
should not _ require further amplification.
</P>
<P>
   Just speaking generally, however, I would say that there are
elements in any good film that would increase the viewer's interest
and appreciation on a second viewing. The momentum of a movie often
prevents every stimulating detail or nuance from having a full
impact the first time it's seen.
</P>
<P>
   The whole idea that a movie should be seen only once is an
extension of our traditional conception of the film as an ephemeral
entertainment rather than as a visual work of art.
</P>
<P>
   We don't believe that we should hear a great piece of music only
once, see a great painting only once or even read a great book just
once. But the film has until recent years been exempted from that
category of art, a situation I'm glad is finally changing.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Some prominent critics _ including Renata Adler of The
New York Times, John Simon of The New Leader, Judith Crist of New
York magazine and Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice _ apparently
felt that ``2001'' should be among those films still exempted from
the category of art. All four castigated it as dull, pretentious
and overlong.
</P>
<P>
   How do you account for their hostility?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: The four critics you mention all work for New York
publications.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews across America and around the world have been 95
percent enthusiastic. Some were more perceptive than others, of
course, but even those who praised the film on relatively
superficial grounds were able to get something of its message.
</P>
<P>
   New York was the only really hostile city. Perhaps there is a
certain element of the lumpen literati that is so dogmatically
atheist and materialistic and earthbound that it finds the grandeur
of space and the myriad mysteries of cosmic intelligence anathema.
</P>
<P>
   But film critics, fortunately, rarely have any effect on the
general public. Houses everywhere are packed, and the film is well
on its way to becoming the greatest moneymaker in MGM's history.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this sounds like a crass way to evaluate one's work, but
I think that _ especially with a film that is so obviously
different _ record audience attendance means people are saying the
right things to one another after they see it _ and isn't this
really what it's all about?
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Speaking of what it's all about, if you'll allow us to
return to the philosophical interpretation of ``2001,'' would you
agree with those critics who call it a profoundly religious film?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I will say that the God concept is at the heart of
``2001'' _ but not any traditional, anthropomorphic image of God.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe in any of Earth's monotheistic religions, but I
do believe that one can construct an intriguing scientific
definition of God, once you accept the fact that there are
approximately 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, that each star
is a life-giving sun and that there are approximately 100 billion
galaxies in just the visible universe.
</P>
<P>
   Given a planet in a stable orbit, not too hot and not too cold,
and given a few billion years of chance chemical reactions created
by the action of a sun's energy on the planet's chemicals, it's
fairly certain that life in one form or another will eventually
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   It's reasonable to assume that there must be, in fact, countless
billions of such planets where biological life has arisen, and the
odds of some proportion of such life developing intelligence are
high.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the sun is by no means an old star, and its planets are
mere children in cosmic age, so it seems likely that there are not
only billions of planets in the universe where intelligent life is
on a lower scale than man but also other billions where it is
approximately equal and others still where it is hundreds of
thousands of millions of years in advance of us.
</P>
<P>
   When you think of the giant technological strides that man has
made in a few millennia _ less than a microsecond in the chronology
of the universe _ can you imagine the evolutionary development that
much older life forms have taken?
</P>
<P>
   They may have progressed from biological species, which are
fragile shells for the mind at best, into immortal machine entities
and then, over innumerable eons, they could emerge from the
chrysalis of matter transformed into beings of pure energy and
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence
ungraspable by humans.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Even assuming the cosmic evolutionary path you suggest,
what has this to do with the nature of God?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Everything, because these beings would be gods to the
billions of less advanced races in the universe, just as man would
appear a god to an ant that somehow comprehended the man's
existence. They would possess the twin attributes of all deities _
omniscience and omnipotence.
</P>
<P>
   These entities might be in telepathic communication throughout
the cosmos and thus be aware of everything that occurs, tapping
every intelligent mind as effortlessly as we switch on the radio.
They might not be limited by the speed of light, and their presence
could penetrate to the farthest corners of the universe. They might
possess complete mastery over matter and energy, and in their final
evolutionary stage they might develop into an integrated,
collective, immortal consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   They would be incomprehensible to us except as gods, and if the
tendrils of their consciousness ever brushed men's minds, it is
only the hand of God we could grasp as an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: If such creatures do exist, why should they be
interested in man?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: They may not be. But why should man be interested in
microbes? The motives of such beings would be as alien to us as
their intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: In ``2001,'' such incorporeal creatures seem to
manipulate our destinies and control our evolution, though whether
for good or evil _ or both, or neither _ remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Do you really believe it's possible that man is a cosmic
plaything of such entities?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I don't really believe anything about them _ how can I?
Mere speculation on the possibility of their existence is
sufficiently overwhelming, without attempting to decipher their
motives.
</P>
<P>
   The important point is that all the standard attributes assigned
to God in our history could equally well be the characteristics of
biological entities who, billions of years ago, were at a stage of
development similar to man's own and evolved into something as
remote from man as man is remote from the primordial ooze from
which he first emerged.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: In this cosmic phylogeny you've described, isn't it
possible that there might be forms of intelligent life on an even
higher scale than these entities of pure energy, perhaps as far
removed from them as they are from us?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Of course there could be. In an infinite, eternal
universe, the point is that anything is possible, and it's unlikely
that we can even begin to scratch the surface of the full range of
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when astronauts are preparing to set foot on the
moon, I think it's necessary to open up our earthbound minds to
such speculation. No one knows what's waiting for us in the
universe. I think it was a prominent astronomer who wrote recently,
``Sometimes I think we are alone and sometimes I think we're not.
In either case, the idea is quite staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Have you ever used LSD or other so-called
consciousness-expanding drugs?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: No. I believe that drugs are basically of more use to
the audience than to the artist.
</P>
<P>
   I think that the illusion of oneness with the universe,
absorption with the significance of every object in your
environment and the pervasive aura of peace and contentment is not
the ideal state for an artist. It tranquilizes the creative
personality, which thrives on conflict and on the clash and ferment
of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The artist's transcendence must be within his own work. He
should not impose any artificial barriers between himself and the
mainspring of his subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that's turned me against LSD is that all the
people I know who use it have a peculiar inability to distinguish
between things that are really interesting and stimulating and
things that are not ... They seem to completely lose their critical
faculties and disengage themselves from some of the most
stimulating areas of life.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps when everything is beautiful, nothing is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Some critics have detected not only a deep pessimism
but also a kind of misanthropy in much of your work.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dr. Strangelove,'' for example, one reviewer commented that
your directorial attitude, despite the film's antiwar message,
seemed curiously aloof and detached, unmoved by the annihilation of
mankind, almost as if the Earth were being cleansed of an
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any truth to that?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Good God, no. You don't stop being concerned with man
because you recognize his essential absurdities and frailties and
pretensions. To me the only real immorality is that which endangers
the species, and the only evil, that which threatens its
annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   In the deepest sense, I believe in man's potential and in his
capacity for progress. In ``Strangelove,'' I was dealing with the
inherent irrationality in man that threatens to destroy him. That
irrationality is with us as strongly today, and must be conquered.
</P>
<P>
   But a recognition of insanity doesn't imply a celebration of it,
not a sense of despair and futility about the possibility of curing
it.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: In the five years since ``Dr. Strangelove'' was
released, the two major nuclear powers, the United States and the
Soviet Union, have reached substantial accommodation with each
other. Do you think this has reduced the danger of nuclear war?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: No. If anything, the overconfident Soviet-American
detente increases the threat of accidental nuclear war through
carelessness _ this has always been the greatest menace and the one
most difficult to cope with.
</P>
<P>
   The danger that nuclear weapons may be used, perhaps by a
secondary power, is as great if not greater than it ever has been,
and it is really quite amazing that the world has been able to
adjust to it psychologically with so little apparent dislocation.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly acute is the possibility of war breaking out as the
result of a sudden, unanticipated flare-up in some part of the
world, triggering a panic reaction and catapulting confused and
frightened men into decisions they are incapable of making
rationally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the serious threat remains that a psychotic figure
somewhere in the modern command structure could start a war, or at
the very least a limited exchange of nuclear weapons that could
devastate wide areas and cause innumerable casualties.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, was the theme of ``Dr. Strangelove,'' and I'm
not entirely assured that, somewhere in the Pentagon or the Red
Army upper echelons, there does not exist the real-life prototype
of Gen. Jack D. Ripper.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: You've been accused of revealing, in your films, a
strong hostility to the modern industrialized society of the
democratic West and a particular antagonism _ ambivalently laced
with a kind of morbid fascination _ toward automation.
</P>
<P>
   Your critics claim this is especially evident in ``2001,'' where
the archvillain of the film, the computer Hal 9000, is in a sense
the only human being.
</P>
<P>
   Do you believe that machines are becoming more like men and men
more like machines, and do you detect an eventual struggle for
dominance between the two?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: First of all, I'm not hostile toward machines at all _
just the opposite, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that we're entering a mechanarchy, however, and
that our already complex relationship with our machinery will
become even more complex as the machines become more and more
intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we will have to share this planet with machines whose
intelligence and abilities far surpass our own. But the
interrelationship, if intelligently managed by man, could have an
immeasurably enriching effect on society.
</P>
<P>
   Looking into the distant future, I suppose it's not
inconceivable that a semisentient robo-computer subculture could
evolve that might one day decide it no longer needed man.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard the story about the ultimate computer of
the future. For months scientists think of the first question to
submit to it, and finally they hit on the right one: ``Is there a
God?''
</P>
<P>
   After a moment of whirring and flashing lights, a card comes
out, punched with the words, ``There is now.''
</P>
<P>
   But this problem is a distant one, and I'm not staying up nights
worrying about it. I'm convinced that our toasters and TVs are
fully domesticated, though I'm not so sure about integrated
telephone circuits, which sometimes strike me as possessing a
malevolent life all their own.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Speaking of futuristic electronics and mechanics,
``2001's'' incredibly elaborate gadgetry and scenes of space flight
have been hailed, even by hostile critics, as a major cinematic
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   How were you able to achieve such remarkable special effects?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I can't answer that question technically in the time we
have available, but I can say that it was necessary to conceive,
design and engineer completely new techniques in order to produce
the special effects. This took 18 months and $6.5 million out of a
$10.5 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   I think an extraordinary amount of credit must go to Robert H.
O'Brien, the president of MGM, who had sufficient faith to allow me
to persevere at what must have at times appeared to be a task
without end.
</P>
<P>
   But I felt it was necessary to make this film in such a way that
every special-effects shot in it would be completely convincing _
something that had never before been accomplished in a motion
picture.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Thanks to those special effects, ``2001'' is
undoubtedly the most graphic depiction of space flight in the
history of films. And yet you have admitted that you yourself
refuse to fly, even on a commercial airliner. Why?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I suppose it comes down to a rather awesome awareness
of mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Our ability, unlike the other animals, to conceptualize our own
end creates tremendous psychic strains within us. Whether we admit
it or not, in each man's chest a tiny ferret of fear at this
ultimate knowledge gnaws away at his ego and his sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   We're fortunate, in a way, that our body and the fulfillment of
its needs and functions plays such an imperative role in our lives
_ this physical shell creates a buffer between us and the
mind-paralyzing realization that only a few years of existence
separate birth from death.
</P>
<P>
   If man really sat back and thought about his impending
termination and his terrifying insignificance and aloneness in the
cosmos, he would surely go mad or succumb to a numbing sense of
futility. Why, he might ask himself, should he bother to write a
great symphony, strive to make a living or even to love another
when he is no more than a momentary microbe on a dust mote whirling
through the unimaginable immensity of space?
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: If life is so purposeless, do you feel that it's worth
living?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Yes, for those of us who manage somehow to cope with
our mortality. The very meaninglessness of life forces man to
create his own meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Children, of course, begin life with an untarnished sense of
wonder, a capacity to experience total joy at something as simple
as the greenness of a leaf. But as they grow older, the awareness
of death and decay begins to impinge on their consciousness and
subtly erode their joie de vivre, their idealism _ and their
assumption of immortality.
</P>
<P>
   As a child matures he sees death and pain everywhere about him,
and begins to lose faith in faith and in the ultimate goodness of
man. But if he's reasonably strong _ and lucky _ he can emerge from
this twilight of the soul into a rebirth of life's elan. Both
because of and in spite of his awareness of the meaninglessness of
life, he can forge a fresh sense of purpose and affirmation.
</P>
<P>
   He may not recapture the same pure sense of wonder he was born
with, but he can shape something far more enduring and sustaining.
</P>
<P>
   The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is
hostile but that it is indifferent. But if we can come to terms
with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the
boundaries of death, however mutable man may be able to make them,
our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Will we be able to find any deep meaning or
fulfillment, either as individuals or as a species, as long as we
continue to live with the knowledge that all human life could be
snuffed out at any moment in a nuclear catastrophe?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: We must, for in the final analysis there may be no
sound way to eliminate the threat of self-extinction without
changing human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you managed to get every country disarmed down to the
bow and arrow, you would still be unable to lobotomize either the
knowledge of how to build nuclear warheads or the perversity that
allows us to rationalize their use. Given these two categorical
imperatives in a disarmed world, the first country to amass even a
few weapons would have a great incentive to use them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   So an argument might be made that there is a greater chance for
some use of nuclear weapons in a totally disarmed world, though
less chance of global extinction, while in a world armed to the
teeth you have less chance for some use _ but a great chance of
extinction if they're used.
</P>
<P>
   If you try to remove yourself from an earthly perspective and
look at this tragic paradox with the detachment of an
extraterrestrial, the whole thing is totally irrational. Man now
has the power in one mad, incandescent moment to exterminate the
entire species _ our own generation could be the last on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One miscalculation and all the achievements of history could
vanish in a mushroom cloud. One misstep and all of man's
aspirations and strivings over the millennia could be terminated.
One short circuit in a computer, one lunatic in a command structure
and we could negate the heritage of the billions who have died
since the dawn of man and abort the promise of the billions yet
unborn _ the ultimate genocide.
</P>
<P>
   What an irony that the discovery of nuclear power, with its
potential for annihilation, also constitutes the first tottering
step into the universe that must be taken by all intelligent
worlds. Unhappily, the infant-mortality rate among emerging
civilizations in the cosmos may be very high.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it will matter, except to us. The destruction of this
planet would have no significance on a cosmic scale _ to an
observer in the Andromeda nebulae, the sign of our extinction would
be no more than a match flaring for a second in the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   And if that match does blaze in the darkness, there will be none
to mourn a race that used a power that could have lit a beacon in
the stars to light its funeral pyre.
</P>
<P>
   The choice is ours.

 Includes a color slide of Stanley Kubrick directing ``Full Metal
Jacket'' (1987) and a black-and-white photo of Stanley Kubrick in
1984. 
 By ERIC NORDEN  
 c.1968/1996 Playboy  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When director Stanley Kubrick died on March 7 at age 70, he left
behind a dazzling body of work _ and a legacy of almost total
silence.
</P>
<P>
   In four decades as a filmmaker, Kubrick virtually never agreed
to be interviewed. In 1968, however, shortly after the release of
his seminal film version of Arthur C. Clarke's science-fiction
novel ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' the director welcomed a Playboy
writer to his London home, where he talked about ``2001'' and ``Dr.
Strangelove'' (1964), his earlier black comedy about a deranged
general who ultimately triggers a nuclear holocaust. Together the
two films constituted the first parts of what would become a
future-vision triptych with his next film, ``A Clockwork Orange''
(1971).
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from that interview follow. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Interviewer Eric Norden found Kubrick _ a slim, relaxed man with
thinning hair, dark beard and intense eyes _ sprawled in a chair on
the spacious expanse of lawn overlooking his elegantly tended
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Kubrick crossed one scuffed shoe over a wrinkled pants
leg,'' Norden writes, ``I began by asking him to decipher the
metaphysical message of `2001.'''
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: It's not a message that I ever intend to convey in
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``2001'' is a nonverbal experience _ out of two hours and 19
minutes of film, there are only a little less than 40 minutes of
dialogue. I tried to create a visual experience, one that bypasses
verbalized pigeonholing and directly penetrates the subconscious
with an emotional and philosophic content.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and
allegorical meaning of the film, and such speculation is one
indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep
level. But I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for ``2001''
that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's
missed the point.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Arthur C. Clarke has said of the film, ``If anyone
understands it on the first viewing, we've failed in our
intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should the viewer have to see a film twice to get its
message?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I don't agree with that statement of Arthur's, and I
believe he made it facetiously.
</P>
<P>
   The very nature of the visual experience in ``2001'' is to give
the viewer an instantaneous, visceral reaction that does not _ and
should not _ require further amplification.
</P>
<P>
   Just speaking generally, however, I would say that there are
elements in any good film that would increase the viewer's interest
and appreciation on a second viewing. The momentum of a movie often
prevents every stimulating detail or nuance from having a full
impact the first time it's seen.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Would you agree with those critics who call it a
profoundly religious film?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I will say that the God concept is at the heart of
``2001'' _ but not any traditional, anthropomorphic image of God.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe in any of Earth's monotheistic religions, but I
do believe that one can construct an intriguing scientific
definition of God, once you accept the fact that there are
approximately 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, that each star
is a life-giving sun and that there are approximately 100 billion
galaxies in just the visible universe.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Now, the sun is by no means an old star, and its planets are
mere children in cosmic age, so it seems likely that there are not
only billions of planets in the universe where intelligent life is
on a lower scale than man but also other billions where it is
approximately equal and others still where it is hundreds of
thousands of millions of years in advance of us.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   Their potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence
ungraspable by humans.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Even assuming the cosmic evolutionary path you suggest,
what has this to do with the nature of God?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Everything, because these beings would be gods to the
billions of less advanced races in the universe, just as man would
appear a god to an ant that somehow comprehended the man's
existence. They would possess the twin attributes of all deities _
omniscience and omnipotence.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   They would be incomprehensible to us except as gods, and if the
tendrils of their consciousness ever brushed men's minds, it is
only the hand of God we could grasp as an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: If such creatures do exist, why should they be
interested in man?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: They may not be. But why should man be interested in
microbes? The motives of such beings would be as alien to us as
their intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: Some critics have detected not only a deep pessimism
but also a kind of misanthropy in much of your work.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dr. Strangelove,'' for example, one reviewer commented that
your directorial attitude, despite the film's antiwar message,
seemed curiously aloof and detached, unmoved by the annihilation of
mankind, almost as if the Earth were being cleansed of an
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any truth to that?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Good God, no. You don't stop being concerned with man
because you recognize his essential absurdities and frailties and
pretensions. To me the only real immorality is that which endangers
the species, and the only evil, that which threatens its
annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   In the deepest sense, I believe in man's potential and in his
capacity for progress. In ``Strangelove,'' I was dealing with the
inherent irrationality in man that threatens to destroy him. That
irrationality is with us as strongly today, and must be conquered.
</P>
<P>
   But a recognition of insanity doesn't imply a celebration of it,
nor a sense of despair and futility about the possibility of curing
it.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: You've been accused of revealing, in your films, a
strong hostility to the modern industrialized society of the
democratic West and a particular antagonism _ ambivalently laced
with a kind of morbid fascination _ toward automation.
</P>
<P>
   Your critics claim this is especially evident in ``2001,'' where
the archvillain of the film, the computer Hal 9000, is in a sense
the only human being.
</P>
<P>
   Do you believe that machines are becoming more like men and men
more like machines, and do you detect an eventual struggle for
dominance between the two?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: First of all, I'm not hostile toward machines at all _
just the opposite, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that we're entering a mechanarchy, however, and
that our already complex relationship with our machinery will
become even more complex as the machines become more and more
intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we will have to share this planet with machines whose
intelligence and abilities far surpass our own. But the
interrelationship, if intelligently managed by man, could have an
immeasurably enriching effect on society.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   But this problem is a distant one, and I'm not staying up nights
worrying about it. I'm convinced that our toasters and TVs are
fully domesticated, though I'm not so sure about integrated
telephone circuits, which sometimes strike me as possessing a
malevolent life all their own.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: ``2001'' is undoubtedly the most graphic depiction of
space flight in the history of films. And yet you have admitted
that you yourself refuse to fly, even on a commercial airliner.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: I suppose it comes down to a rather awesome awareness
of mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Our ability, unlike the other animals, to conceptualize our own
end creates tremendous psychic strains within us. Whether we admit
it or not, in each man's chest a tiny ferret of fear at this
ultimate knowledge gnaws away at his ego and his sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   We're fortunate, in a way, that our body and the fulfillment of
its needs and functions plays such an imperative role in our lives
_ this physical shell creates a buffer between us and the
mind-paralyzing realization that only a few years of existence
separate birth from death.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   PLAYBOY: If life is so purposeless, do you feel that it's worth
living?
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK: Yes, for those of us who manage somehow to cope with
our mortality. The very meaninglessness of life forces man to
create his own meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is
hostile but that it is indifferent. But if we can come to terms
with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the
boundaries of death, however mutable man may be able to make them,
our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.

A VAN GOGH ON THE BLOCK  
 TELLING ALL  
 GRACES GO HOME  
 NEW MUSEUM DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Do you remember among the little drawings a wooden bridge with
a washing place, and a view of the town in the distance?'' Vincent
van Gogh wrote his brother, Theo, on June 16, 1888. ``I have just
painted that subject in a large size.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting, ``Canal With Washerwoman,'' was last seen publicly
in 1984 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's blockbuster show ``Van
Gogh in Arles.'' Now Christie's is selling the painting in its May
12 auction of important Impressionist and 19th-century art in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape, 29[ by 23| inches, captures the spot where the
women of Arles did their laundry. Its vivid colors, wide brushwork
and Japanese-inspired perspective epitomize the work van Gogh did
while living in the south of France.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings from this period are the most sought-after by
collectors and are among the most difficult to find. Few ever come
on the market because most of those that are still in private hands
have already been promised to museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The painting belongs to a collector in the United States who
is very private,'' said Franck Giraud, Christie's worldwide
director of 19th- and 20th-century fine art. ``Van Gogh went to the
south of France because he was attracted to the very strong light.
But when he first arrived there it was winter and he was
disappointed by what he saw. This painting was done in June, and it
records the artist's first encounter with the strong light he had
dreamed about. In the top right-hand-corner he actually painted the
sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's expects the painting to sell for about $20 million.
But this could skyrocket if the market for important van Goghs is
still as strong as it was in November, when an 1889 self-portrait
sold for $71.5 million, nearly three times its high estimate. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Museum labels are generally an informative tool meant to gently
explain to museumgoers what they are looking at. But the labels
that appear in the ``Mirror of the Medieval World'' at the
Metropolitan Museum tell all: where an object came from; if it was
through a dealer, the name of the dealer; if it was bought at
auction, which auction house and even the lot number.
</P>
<P>
   The labels also record a work's source of financing, in some
cases gifts but in others what the museum defines as a curatorial
purchase. These were often less expensive but nonetheless
historically important objects that did not require approval by the
museum's acquisitions committee.
</P>
<P>
   Some required approval from the museum director, others were
even less costly and were acquired solely on the prerogative of the
head of a department.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the Metropolitan has given the viewer so
much information. ``We decided to deal with the process,'' said
Philippe de Montebello, the Met's director. ``It's part of the
transparency of sharing with the public that the job of a curator
is not mysterious and objects pass through many hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason the museum decided to write such extensive
labels is that all the objects were acquired over the last 20 years
and are part of the Met's own collections. When an exhibition
includes loans from private collectors or other institutions, the
lender may not want to be so forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for reviewing the provenance of each of the
show's nearly 300 objects was to clarify any issues that could
arise concerning property that might have been stolen by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   De Montebello said that there had been such questions about a
few of the medieval objects in the museum's collection. In one or
two cases, he said, information concerning a work's provenance may
not have been as complete as they would have liked, raising
provenance questions.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances the curators were able to track down the
Jewish families who had owned a work and the dealer who had sold
the objects to them. They were also able to get copies of all the
correspondence regarding the history of the object, thereby
clearing up any doubts.
</P>
<P>
   It took museum officials about three years to review all the
medieval objects in the show. ``Since the show tells the story of
the most recent 20 years of collecting in the medieval department,
it was a good way of reviewing our records and trying to flesh out
our own knowledge,'' said Peter Barnet, the curator in charge of
the department of medieval art at the Metropolitan. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After three and a half years at the National Galleries of
Scotland, where it drew record crowds, ``The Three Graces,''
Canova's much-loved sculpture, has returned to the Victoria and
Albert Museum in London.
</P>
<P>
   The two institutions bought the object together in 1994, after a
five-year effort by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles to
acquire it. Because the sculpture was deemed a national treasure
and the two museums could match the Getty's $12 million offer, the
Getty was denied the right to take the sculpture out of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The two museums agreed to transfer the sculpture between them
approximately every seven years. It moved to the V, and A. early
this time so it could be included in the museum's centenary
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture is on display in the museum's newly reopened
sculpture galleries, near other works by the 19th-century master.
It will remain in London until the end of 2005, when it will return
to Scotland. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles has named its new
director: Jeremy Strick, curator of 20th-century painting and
sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago. Strick will start his
new job on July 1, replacing Richard Koshalek, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Strick has little administrative experience, but his curatorial
accomplishments have been well received. A native of Los Angeles,
he was a curator of modern art at the St. Louis Art Museum and an
associate curator of 20th-century art at the National Gallery of
Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, he oversaw the installation and opening of a new set
of galleries and organized many exhibitions, including ``In the
Light of Italy: Corot and Early Open-Air Painting,'' ``Louise
Bourgeois: The Personages'' and ``The Sublime Is Now: The Early
Work of Barnett Newman.''

ISLAND WHIRL: THERE'S MORE TO GALVESTON THAN BEACHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARILYN BAILEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Galveston has changed identities many times, from Texas' main
business hub in the 19th century to a wide-open gambling and
bootlegging mecca in the middle of this century. Today, of course,
tourism's the thing, as the city has become increasingly
sophisticated about packaging its charms.
</P>
<P>
   The beaches everyone complains about will always attract hordes,
but, more than ever, it's possible to have other kinds of vacations
on the island as well _ one of shopping, strolls through historic
neighborhoods, and bed-and-breakfast luxury, or a family vacation
of kid-friendly museums and theme-park attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The Strand district, which was restored and developed for
tourism in the '70s and '80s, is growing up and getting more
texture. It has even acquired a bit of hipness in the past several
years. Tourist traps and Victorian-themed shops are still thriving,
but young locals hang out here, too, now that there are brewpubs,
coffeehouses, more restaurants than ever and a better variety of
shops.
</P>
<P>
   With the Strand's impressive stock of 19th-century office
buildings and warehouses, and with stately residential
neighborhoods of delicate gingerbreads and castlelike stone houses,
you can spend days touring Texas' best collection of Victorian
residential and commercial architecture.
</P>
<P>
   And away from the historic neighborhoods, the newer end of town
has its own blockbuster attraction: Moody Gardens, a
family-oriented entertainment/educational complex with an eccentric
menu of attractions.
</P>
<P>
   MOODY GARDENS: Its name tells you little about what's in store.
Part amusement park, part botanic garden, the complex is a little
Giza on the Gulf, dominated by three huge pyramids housing a rain
forest, an interactive space exhibit and, soon, an aquarium. But
there's also a white-sand beach with a blue lagoon, a working
replica of an 18th-century paddle-wheel tour boat, two IMAX
theaters and a Vietnam memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-story glass Rainforest Pyramid swarms with beautiful
tropical birds, butterflies, bats and insects under a dense canopy
of greenery. The Discovery Pyramid houses an interactive space
exploration exhibit. The new aquarium, opening this summer, will be
one of the biggest anywhere; there's much ado locally about a
colony of king penguins that arrived months early and is being
refrigerated in a downtown building.
</P>
<P>
   There's also America's first 3-D IMAX theater, where moviegoers
wearing Elton John-sized glasses can see the likes of ``T-REX: Back
to the Cretaceous,'' starring life-size dinosaurs. And in the
separate IMAX Ridefilm theater, you get strapped into a moving seat
and jerked around while viewing a huge wrap-around screen. You'll
feel like you're ``in'' the movie rather than just watching it.
Currently playing are ``Asteroid Adventure'' and ``Dolphins: The
Ride.''
</P>
<P>
   A project of the nonprofit Moody Foundation, Moody Gardens was
opened to provide horticultural therapy and animal-assisted therapy
for people with head injuries. Some patients work at the
greenhouses and Rainforest Pyramid. The whole place is luxuriantly
landscaped with subtropical trees and flowers; the parking lot has
more palm trees than you've ever seen in one place. It's a
therapeutic place for anybody _ a must-see for families.
</P>
<P>
   OLD GALVESTON: Galveston itself is a living museum, with 550
historical landmarks on the National Register of Historic Places.
For residential architecture, the Silk Stocking district and the
East End historical district are well worth driving through for a
sense of what whole neighborhoods were like; there are modern
houses and shabby old houses among the restored gems, but there are
still plenty of glimpses of brick streets, trolley tracks and a few
iron fences.
</P>
<P>
   The first English-speaking settlers came to the island in the
1830s, a few years after pirate Jean Lafitte _ with his village of
2,000 bootleggers, gamblers and carousers _ was run off the island
by the U.S. Navy. And in a few decades, Galveston became a
prosperous port city, with money pouring in from cotton, banking
and shipping. It grew quickly, especially after the Civil War, into
a wealthy city of stately avenues and homes outfitted with all the
fineries that could be imported.
</P>
<P>
   The richest Galvestonians built their showplace houses on
Broadway, today a six-lane avenue with a wide, heavily treed
esplanade. The grandest of the mansions was an imposing sandstone
and granite home built in 1888, now known as the Bishop's Palace,
1402 Broadway Blvd. The American Institute of Architects named it
one of the 100 most significant buildings in the United States, the
only Texas residence on the list. It really does look like a
castle, with turrets and lots of balconies. The interior is famous
for its multiple fireplaces imported from all over the world and
for extensive woodwork of rosewood, satinwood and white mahogany.
This and many other houses are open for tours; get information and
maps at the Strand Visitor's Center, 2016 Strand.

<P>
   The Strand, in its heyday, was known as the Wall Street of the
South. Today, it's the Strand National Historic Landmark District,
with 36 square blocks of shops, restaurants and galleries in an
amazingly intact collection of 19th-century office buildings and
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   The street didn't need much dressing up to become a stand-in for
19th-century Fort Worth a couple of years back during the filming
of one of the wretched ``Gambler'' TV movies. A few modern signs
were removed, and a cattle drive was staged on one of the central
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   One block north of the Strand, on Ship's Mechanic's Row, is the
Tremont Hotel, the city's most elegant. Across the street is a tiny
but wonderful bookstore, Midsummer Books.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery district on Postoffice Street, two blocks farther
south, is a row of art galleries and antiques stores. Check out The
Firm, a funky one-of-a-kind clothing store for women and men. Look
in at the exquisite Grand 1894 Opera house, 2020 Postoffice, where
the likes of Sarah Bernhardt and Lillian Russell performed. Call
(800) 821-1894 for performance information; the theater gets a lot
of the same touring acts as Bass Performance Hall, and no seat is
more than 70 feet from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   For kids, not known for their interest in Victoriana, downtown
has three transportation-themed museums. At the Railroad Museum,
located in the Strand's restored train depot, you can poke through
46 locomotives, Pullman sleepers and cabooses. The Classic Car
Museum, 19th and Mechanic streets, houses 53 vintage automobiles,
including a 1940 Mercury given to Carole Lombard by her husband,
Clark Gable.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Seaport Museum, on the waterfront at Pier 21, one
block south of the Strand, has the 1877 tall ship Elissa, and
exhibits explaining the workings of a 19th-century port and
chronicling Galveston's role as a port of entry for immigrants. The
city claims to have been second only to Ellis Island in the number
of people who came through.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Pier 21, be sure to see the film ``The Great Storm,'' a
27-minute documentary on the hurricane that devastated Galveston in
September 1900. It's a mystery why this event doesn't loom larger
in the American memory. More than 6,000 people were killed, making
it by far the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. Bodies were
weighted and buried at sea but later washed ashore and had to be
burned. The storm flattened one-third of the city and ended forever
its status as a major port and economic center.
</P>
<P>
   After the storm, the city rebuilt and erected a 17-foot-tall
seawall, a protective concrete barrier along the coastline.
Designed to give some protection from storm tides, it also created
a great public space, much like the Atlantic Coast boardwalks. When
the weather's nice, the longest sidewalk in the world is always
busy with in-line skaters, bikers and people cruising. The
refurbished Hotel Galvez (built in 1911) is the street's most
gracious hotel. Another great seawall institution that's not to be
missed is Gaido's, a seafood palace announced by a bathtub-sized
crab on a pedestal out front. Texas Highways readers just voted it
the best restaurant in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the eroded in-town beaches have been replenished
with imported whitish sand from Florida, the best beaches are to
the east and west of the seawall. Galveston Island State Park, west
of the city off Farm Road 3005, is the place to go for camping.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   FYI
</P>
<P>
   Now that spring break is about over, it's safe to ponder
vacationing in Galveston. Here are some more reasons to visit the
island this spring:
</P>
<P>
   Through April 4: IMAX Film Festival at Moody Gardens. Ten films
are showing, most screening at least once daily. For reservations,
call (800) 582-4673.
</P>
<P>
   May 1, 2, 8 and 9: Historic Homes Tour, Galveston Historical
Foundation. Guided tours of 10 restored houses, mostly private
homes not usually open to the public. Tickets: (409) 765-7834.
</P>
<P>
   June 5: The American Institute of Architects sand-castle
competition, at East Beach, attracts entrants from all over the
country; winning creations are always amazingly elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Also in June: Moody Gardens opens its aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston is about 300 miles southeast of Fort Worth on I-45.
Both Southwest and American Airlines offer $100 round-trip fares to
Houston's Hobby airport, a 50-minute drive from Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday Inn on the Beach, 5002 Seawall Blvd., has spring rates
of $99-$199 for doubles. Summer weekend rates at the luxurious
Hotel Galvez, 2024 Seawall Blvd., are $175-$195 per night for
doubles, depending on ocean view.

</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Five best things to do (besides the beach):
</P>
<P>
   1. Ride on the Galveston Island Ferry, a commuter service
connecting the island with the Bolivar peninsula to the east.
You'll get close to supertankers and a shipwreck, and maybe a
dolphin or two. Since they've returned to Galveston Bay, you'll
often see a few dolphins merrily trailing the ferry as its makes
the 20-minute trip across the Houston shipping lanes. It's best to
walk onto the ferry instead of driving. There's an observation deck
above, but it's fun to stand right at the bow, get sea spray on
your face and throw snacks to the seagulls.
</P>
<P>
   2. Stroll the Strand and the wharves district.
</P>
<P>
   3. Eat at Gaido's, just named the best restaurant in the state
by readers of Texas Highways. 3800 Seawall Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   4. Get your glasses fogged up at Moody Gardens' rain-forest
exhibit, a 10-story enclosed re-creation of a tropical paradise.
</P>
<P>
   5. If you have time to tour only one historical building, make
it Bishop's Palace, 1402 Broadway Blvd., the most lavish of
Galveston's old residences.

<P>
   UNDATED _ The real misery comes in sitting through ``The Deep
End of the Ocean,'' which is all over the place. Michelle Pfeiffer
is undeniably the star, and she gets all of her close-ups. But
``Deep End'' is also scrupulous in trying to get everybody's
feelings into the picture. It's so rigidly worked out that it
doesn't seem to be about anything _ it bends over backward in
trying to be fair. Lacking a point of view, the movie is a mawkish

Corruptor,'' sounds anemic. This story of cops who initially can't

she cries, she's blank-faced _ is the center of director Benoit
Jacquot's new film, ``The School of Flesh.'' Jacquot seems her
equal in terms of enigma. They've created a low-blood-pressure tale
about the dirty magnetism of sex. Huppert plays a French fashion
executive who falls for the slinky young package played by Vincent
Martinez. He's younger and morally pliant _ a hustler who plays on

Sweeney's parents moved in with Sweeney during his chemotherapy,
cramping life at her dream house. And in March 1995 _ shortly

MIXED MESSAGES IN CASE OF MISSING TRIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The investigation into the disappearance of a
woman and two teen-agers last seen at a lodge outside Yosemite
National Park has taken two new turns, with a devastating message
from the FBI and the arrest of a lodge employee on an unrelated
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Jens Sund, the missing woman's husband, said Wednesday that the
FBI had briefed him on what he considered a major development in
the 3-week-old case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm devastated,'' he said outside the FBI's command post in
Modesto. ``My worst possible fears have come true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good for my family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Nick Rossi, however, said there were no major new
developments in the case. ``Rumors that the FBI has discovered the
bodies of the victims or their vehicle are false,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Sund, 42, her 15-year-old daughter, Julie, and Silvina
Pelosso, a 16-year-old family friend from Cordoba, Argentina,
vanished Feb. 15 from the Cedar Lodge, a restaurant and motel in El
Portal on the western edge of Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an employee of a restaurant next to the Cedar Lodge
was being held in the Mariposa County Jail at the request of the
FBI and his parole agent on an unrelated charge, the Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Strange, the restaurant's night cleaner, was jailed Friday
night for a parole violation after agents found marijuana in his
cabin a few miles from the lodge, co-workers said. He has been
jailed for domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the Mariposa County sheriff declined to comment on
Strange's arrest, though his colleagues at the lodge said they
doubted he had any role in the trio's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI returned Strange's van and a car belonging to his
girlfriend, after seizing and searching them.
</P>
<P>
   Strange's girlfriend, who works as a desk clerk at the lodge,
has denied any ties to the missing threesome.
</P>
<P>
   Sund declined to disclose details of his discussion with the
FBI, saying he did not want his remarks to taint potential jurors
in any future prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   A family friend who was with Sund during his meeting with the
FBI confirmed that agents had not reported finding the missing
sightseers or their missing rental car.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi said that agents would focus their search around El Portal
for the next few days, because investigators had found no credible
evidence that the threesome went elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The three left the Sunds' Eureka home Feb. 12, flying to San
Francisco where they rented a red 1999 Pontiac Grand Prix. Driving
east, they stopped in Stockton to see a college cheerleading
competition and arrived Feb. 14 at the Cedar Lodge. They were last
seen the evening of Feb. 15, leaving the lodge restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, the FBI recovered Carole Sund's black leather
credit-card holder, with credit cards, about two hours away on a
road leading to the Modesto airport.

`DEVIL'S ISLAND': A LONELY CIRCLE OF HELL IS COLD, BUT NOT ALL
DESPAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Icelandic equivalents of trailer-park trash run rampant
through ``Devil's Island,'' which opens Friday at the Angelika Film
Center.
</P>
<P>
   This small, vividly realized, comic and pungent slice of life is
carved with directorial dexterity by Fridrik Thor Fridriksson out
of the bleak, junk-filled landscape of Quonset huts, mud puddles
and windblown garbage that was once Camp Thule, an American
military base on the edge of Reykjavik in Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the 1950s, ``Devil's Island,'' written by Einar Karason,
tells a tale of sociological dislocation and cultural invasion as
it focuses on four generations of one of the Icelandic families
living in these shabby huts as part of a community populated mostly
by drunken men, unhappy women and miserable or dysfunctional
children.
</P>
<P>
   Reviled or mocked by outsiders and a vexation to the police,
these people are nonetheless a colorful lot whose principal family
includes a witch who curses God; a mother of three who promptly
marries an American pilot and leaves, and her married daughter, two
adult sons and a grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   The sons, Baddi and Danni, played by Baltasar Kormakur and
Sveinn Geirsson, are in sharp contrast. Baddi is nothing but
trouble, a bad-tempered layabout who drinks heavily, brawls, pals
around with an ex-convict and cadges money from his grandfather,
Thomas (Gisli Halldorsson). Danni is a shy, quiet stay-at-home with
a suppressed decency and potential for heroism.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the film's consistently comic touches, Baddi goes off
for a visit to the United States and returns with an Elvis hairdo,
black leather biker's jacket, shades and a red Plymouth with fins,
which catapult him instantaneously into what passes for the local
avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   It is he who christens the community Devil's Island, though its
anarchic, edge-of-the-world isolation appears to suit some of its
inhabitants just fine.
</P>
<P>
   The cast, which includes Sigurveig Jonsdottir as Thomas' wife,
the ghost-plagued witch Karolina; Halldora Geirhardsdottir as the
unhappily married sister of Baddi and Danni, and Pallna Jonsdottir
as the pretty young woman who has the misfortune to marry Baddi,
delivers performances so convincing and unself-conscious that
``Devil's Island'' at times seems to be a documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The picture it presents may not be attractive, but it is created
with admirable skill.

`WING COMMANDER': GEE, COMMANDER, YOU'RE CUTE WHEN YOU FIGHT GREEN
ALIENS

<P>
   ``Wing Commander'' is based on a video game and has roughly the
same degree of character development. That is all most moviegoers
will need to know.
</P>
<P>
   For others, here is the so-called plot: In the year 2564 Earth
is at war with the Kilrathi, who appear to be murky dark green
monsters. (Or is it the lighting on their spaceships?)
</P>
<P>
   Two scrappy young soldiers _ Christopher Blair (Freddie Prinze
Jr.) and Todd Marshall (Matthew Lillard), nicknamed Maniac _ have
to deliver an encoded disk with a message about an invasion.
Afterward they meet two fabulous women: Deveraux (Saffron Burrows),
nicknamed Angel, their stoic wing commander, and Rosie (Ginny
Holden), another fighter pilot. It's good to see that they've got
that women-in-combat thing worked out in the 26th century.
</P>
<P>
   Both men fall in love, as illustrated with dialogue that a
12-year-old might write or believe, but duty calls everyone into
action. Thus the characters spend most of their time risking their
lives jumping quasars and pulsars, trying to determine the
Charybdis jump coordinates and counting the number of enemy vessels
still on their tail.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Vulcan-copycat subplot about an almost extinct group
called the Pilgrims. (Blair's mother was one, so one bigoted
character periodically calls him a half-breed.) Some highly
respected actors, including David Suchet, appear in the film;
everybody's got to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Roberts, who created the video game the film is based on,
directed and wrote the original story for ``Wing Commander.'' The
film is painfully boring and funny in the wrong places. The best
exchange is between Chris and Deveraux, after she gives him a
direct order to leave her for dead. She: ``You disobey my order and
I'll have you court-martialed.'' He: ``Like I care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wing Commander'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).
It contains profanity, metaphor-cloaked sexual situations,
hand-to-hand combat and outer-space explosions.

THE MODERN LOOKS AT ARTISTS LOOKING AT MUSEUMS

   NEW YORK _ Of all the love-hate relationships that roil the art
world, none is more fraught or stimulating than that between
artists and museums. This makes perfect sense, since the two occupy
opposite ends of the art world food chain.
</P>
<P>
   Artists make art; museums select some of that art for their
collections, where it is preserved, elevated and, most of all,
displayed. Once on view, it offers other artists inspiration,
helping them unlock their own talents, which brings the food chain
full circle.
</P>
<P>
   The artist-museum relationship could be called capitalist, a
case of supply and demand, with the consumer (the museum) causing
pain and competition among the producers (the artists). It could be
called Oedipal, with the museum as a parental authority whose
ordering, judgmental nature is anathema to the rebellious
sensibilities of artists, even though they crave its approval. Or
it could be seen as micro versus macro: Artists are individuals and
museums are institutions, but they are driven by a similar passion
for the accumulation, enjoyment and perpetuation of art. The
similarities and differences create a perfectly balanced mutual
fascination.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever it's called, this connection powers ``Museum as
Muse: Artists Reflect,'' a remarkable exhibition that opens Sunday
at the Museum of Modern Art. Organized by Kynaston McShine, the
longtime senior curator in the department of painting and
sculpture, it examines the many ways that artists, mostly in the
20th century, have seen the museum as the subject, rather than
simply the destination, of their art.
</P>
<P>
   This tendency has been on the rise since the advent of
Conceptual Art, when artists became more aware and critical of the
complex context _ esthetic, social, economic _ surrounding art. But
the show also includes a handful of works from previous centuries,
suggesting that this fascination predates modernism. Its 62 artists
range from Roger Fenton (a 19th-century photographer) to Marcel
Duchamp and Joseph Cornell, to Hans Haacke, Daniel Buren, Ed
Ruscha, Sherrie Levine and Fred Wilson. Janet Cardiff, a young
Canadian artist, has provided an amusingly disorienting audioguide,
which takes the viewer into the Modern's permanent collection and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is stronger in big ideas than in profound visual
experiences, ``Museum as Muse'' is an unusually coherent,
well-orchestrated theme show that transcends typical theme-show
fare (as in the cow, nude or machine in art). Part of its power
lies in the simple fact that, to paraphrase Frank Stella, what you
see is where you see it. Its contents and its context are one.
</P>
<P>
   Including painting, video, printed brochure and installation
art, the show's 182 works mix media with a freedom that's unusual
for the Modern, while veering pleasantly between the arcane and the
accessible, the beautiful and the thought provoking, the
celebratory and the critical. The totality examines the museum from
every angle, as a public place, as an accumulator and classifier of
knowledge (natural-history museums are also touched on), as a
colonizer of cultures (so are ethnographic ones), as an exclusive
social club and as a big business with products of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Almost in passing, interrelated smaller themes are encompassed.
The show offers an unusually comprehensible outline of the
development of Conceptual Art, with its emphasis on language and
photography and its influences on subsequent generations. It shows
how photography especially has metastasized throughout the art of
the last 30 years. And, of course, by definition the show also
considers one of 20th-century art's biggest ideas: site
specificity. This is, after all, an exhibition of art about art
museums in the world's pre-eminent museum of modern art. For
contemporary artists, a site can't be much richer with possibility.
</P>
<P>
   This is nowhere clearer than in the works, like Ms. Cardiff's
audioguide, that McShine commissioned specially for the show. The
results are impressive, not least because they show the Modern
being very flexible, uncharacteristically so, some would say. The
museum clearly bent the furthest for a piece by the California
Conceptualist Michael Asher: a brochure listing, as accurately as
records permit, every work of painting and sculpture that the
Modern has ever deaccessioned. Attached to one of the benches
toward the end of the exhibition, it makes fascinating reading and
is also available without charge (but with a museum ticket stub) in
the Modern's bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The French artist Daniel Buren, famous for reducing art to
bright stripes that he applies to all kinds of surfaces, has been
allowed to put his stripes not in the show proper but upstairs in
the permanent collection galleries. To be precise, they appear on
two walls that usually hold four paintings by Giorgio de Chirico.
Meanwhile, the de Chirico paintings are on view in McShine's
exhibition, where they provide an encounter as pleasantly
surprising as Buren's walls of stripes upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   And Wilson was given free rein in the Modern's photo archive,
emerging with ``Art in Our Time,'' a wall of images that evoke the
museum as a bastion of the rich and the white. The central image
shows the museum ``opened up,'' after a fire in 1958, with the
windows of its famous stairwell knocked out by firefighters. It is
typical of the exhibition that Wilson's work faces more traditional
museum pictures of openings by Garry Winogrand and Larry Fink,
which also don't always flatter the powers that be.
</P>
<P>
   McShine rather slyly includes an instance of earlier flexibility
at the Modern, in a work that was created for ``Information,'' his
1970 survey of Conceptual Art. Titled ``Service Piece,'' it is by
Vito Acconci and documents the artist using his allotted space in
the earlier show as a mail pickup. (Other ``Information'' alumni
include Buren, Jan Dibbets, Hans Haacke, Robert Smithson, Dennis
Oppenheim and, surprisingly, Jeff Wall.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Installed with the density of an 18th-century kunstkammer _ the
collections of art, artifacts and natural wonders assembled by
monarchs and aristocrats that is the point of origin of museums _
the show nonetheless moves easily from one idea to the next, while
individual works play off each other well. Organizationally, it
lures viewers in, saves its more difficult works for the middle and
then sets them down gently.
</P>
<P>
   The show's long narrow antechamber, as the first gallery might
be called, concentrates on the museum as a public space that
foments private experience, a stage whose social and visual
dynamics have always attracted artists. Most of the works are
photographs, and most of them show people looking at art. Thomas
Struth's enormous images _ almost big enough to walk into _ show
people gazing at the Modern's big Pollock, ``One: Number 31,
1950,'' or at Gericault's looming ``Raft of the Medusa'' at the
Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, Cartier-Bresson's ``Musee du Louvre,'' with its
clutch of people studying David's ``Napoleon Crowning Josephine,''
is surely an ancestor to the Struths. David Seymour shows Bernard
Berenson contemplating a marble odalisque with self-satisfied calm,
while Cartier-Bresson photographs two small boys homing in on a
sculpture in a museum in Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Erwitt and Eve Arnold capture the sexual puns in chance
juxtapositions of viewers and objects, and Candida Hofer's
photographs of modern museum lobbies reveal antiseptic spaces
devoid of either art or people. A short wall of 19th-century
photographs by Fenton, Gustave LeGray and Charles Thurston Thompson
underscore the point that photographers sought out museums and
their contents as soon as the camera was invented.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Charles Willson Peale, the 18th-century portrait painter
who was also an inventor, zoologist and engraver, literally raises
the curtain on the show. In a large 1822 self-portrait he unveils
America's first museum, which he founded, a place where stuffed
birds and painted portraits are overwhelmingly abundant. Gathering,
selecting and classifying _ the museum's chief functions _ are the
themes here, adapted by artists to their own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the result is highly personal, a museum of the self,
the soul or the artist's work. Examples include Cornell's
``Untitled (Bebe Marie),'' a suitcase full of cards, photographs
and illustrations forming a tender, obsessive dossier, and the
various boxes that Duchamp filled with miniature replicas of his
art, creating portable retrospectives. Herbert Distel's ``Museum of
Drawers,'' created in the 1970s, contains miniatures of, and by,
other artists, 500 of them. Barbara Bloom's ``Reign of Narcissism''
is a portrait of the artist as demure museum display, while
Christian Boltanski's ``Vitrine of Reference (II),'' from 1970,
recalls his childhood in a series of pathetic little artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   And not only art is gathered. Mark Dion amasses animal,
vegetable and mineral specimens in ``Chain of Being,'' a
bookshelf-as-cornucopia and one of the show's commissions. Hiroshi
Sugimoto's eerie photographs of natural history dioramas show how
this material is put to use. And Susan Hiller's ``From the Freud
Museum'' preserves valueless, meaningless little found objects and
texts, assembled into 50 separate boxes in juxtapositions that set
off all sorts of bells, concerning history, myth and memory.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing here is Claes Oldenburg's fabulous
``Mouse Museum,'' a walk-in room in the shape of Mickey's head that
is in fact a portrait of the Pop artist's fertile imagination and
his omnivorous interest in popular culture. Too big for the
exhibition, it is in the museum's lobby, along with works by Allan
McCollum and the Canadian artist-team General Idea.
</P>
<P>
   In the show's middle section, the museum is not so much imitated
as scrutinized, with particular attention to the artwork as
commodity and stolen property. Duchamp is back, with his defaced
reproduction of the Mona Lisa. Haacke traces the provenance of the
small version of Seurat's ``Les Poseuses'' from the artist's studio
in 1888 to the vaults of an investment group nearly 90 years later.
Sophie Calle's ``Last Seen ...'' series dwells upon another sort of
transaction, the theft of three paintings from Boston's Isabella
Stewart Gardner Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Lothar Baumgarten's slide-projection piece '`Unsettled Objects''
considers a more extensive form of theft, in images of the plethora
of non-Western art and artifacts warehoused in the Pitt Rivers
Museum, an ethnographic museum in Oxford, England. These
dense-packed displays, untouched for most of this century, are as
disturbing as they are riveting.
</P>
<P>
   Such cultural presumption echoes in Andrea Fraser's ``Welcome to
the Wadsworth Atheneum: A Museum Tour,'' a 1991 videotape that
never gets to the art, and instead reviews the historical matrix of
prominent individuals and families who created the city and
provided the museum with art, patrons, wings, architects and even
the occasional director or curator.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition's final gallery, the end of the museum is
broached with a lightness that suggests that reports of its death
are greatly exaggerated. A 1966 painting by Ruscha shows the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art, built over the La Brea Tar Pits, on
fire. A maquette by Christo shows the Modern under wraps, and the
artist team Komar and Melamid's paintings depict it and the
Guggenheim in ruins. Quietly optimistic, Wall's illuminated
cibachrome image ``Restoration'' shows a panoramic history
painting, vaguely Napoleonic, being tended to by a team of
conservators.
</P>
<P>
   The last work in this rewarding exhibition is also the oldest,
Hubert Robert's late 18th-century oil study for an imaginary scene
of the Louvre's Grand Galerie in ruins. Like the large version,
this work is in the Louvre's collection, making it an early
instance of site-specific art. As such, it marks the beginning of a
very fruitful relationship.

   FRENCH-FILMS (New York) _ Having to consume the $40 million
buckets of toxic popcorn Hollywood churns out month after month can
throw a film critic into a state of hand-wringing despair. Why has
an industry with the potential to enrich our lives sunk into a
soul-deadening wasteland of cartoonish violence and adolescent
pranks? And where can you go to find a cinematic semblance of
flesh-and-blood people with complicated emotions; where can you
find movies with characters who think as well as act. There is an
answer, and it can be summed up in one word: France. A look at the

GOVERNOR'S EDUCATION PLANS FACE CRITICISM FROM FELLOW DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California Gov. Gray Davis is quickly
learning that family fights, among Democrats at least, often can be
the most contentious.
</P>
<P>
   In a capital dominated by Democrats, the most pointed criticisms
of the governor's education proposals are coming from Sens. John
Vasconcellos of San Jose and Tom Hayden of Los Angeles, both
old-guard liberals who sit on the Senate Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   They have repeatedly asked Davis _ elected in November as the
state's first Democratic governor in 16 years _ and other lawmakers
to look at why California's schools are so mediocre, rather than
rushing through bills they say could ignore children in low-income
families and minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   The problem reached a boiling point Wednesday for Hayden, who
finds himself part of a very small, very vocal minority of
lawmakers savaging Davis' education bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the blank looks when Mr. Vasconcellos tells you what
the deeper problem is,'' Hayden barked at Davis' education
secretary, Gary K. Hart, during a contentious hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you, nothing is going to happen. It's like:
`Comment noted. On we go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his inauguration, Davis called a special session of
the Legislature to urgently approve four education bills. The bills
would require a test in order to graduate from high school, boost
reading improvement programs, install a ``peer review'' system to
root out failing teachers, and require performance standards for
the state's worst schools.
</P>
<P>
   At a state Senate Education Committee hearing Wednesday, during
consideration of two of Davis' measures, Vasconcellos continued to
criticize the administration. But it was Hayden who appeared on the
warpath, even though he voted for the measures by the end of the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Kerry Mazzoni, D-Novato, who is sponsoring Davis'
reading reform measure, shot back at Hayden during the hearing
Wednesday when he repeatedly questioned a $4 million outreach
program to promote reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it comes down to whether you are willing to at least
try something or if you are going to resist constantly,'' Mazzoni
said. ``Yes, we have many, many problems in this state. But we have
to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   The $4 million reading promotion program would include a
television advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden ridiculed a provision that would provide $2 million to
reward schools with $5,000 grants if they get students to read more
books. Hayden said the money should be used for tutoring and
training teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish people would listen because there is going to be a
disaster when you find out there has been no significant
improvement as a result of these programs in four years,'' Hayden
said. ``We are at the bottom. Something is wrong that will not be
fixed by taking to the television to tell kids to read. It only
re-enforces their television fixation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart, defending the reading campaign, said: ``The purpose of
this provision is to advocate that the teaching of reading is more
than just a teacher and a student's responsibility. That parents,
grandparents, that all in the community have a responsibility to
attempt to encourage and nurture reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante described the criticism from
Vasconcellos and Hayden as ``Democracy at its finest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having a dissenting point of view is important to
developing legislation that will have an impact,'' he said.

SCIENCE AND ECONOMICS BLAMED FOR SLOW RESEARCH ON AIDS VACCINES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Soon after the AIDS epidemic exploded in the 1980s,
Dr. Donald Burke, a senior researcher at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins
University, began work on a vaccine against HIV, the virus that
causes the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   Burke made progress but knew he needed the financial backing and
laboratory firepower of a pharmaceutical manufacturer in order to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to all the major companies that were involved in AIDS
work at the time,'' said Burke, now the director of the
university's Center for Immunization Research. ``I couldn't get
anybody interested and I was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke's experience highlights the fact that, with a few
exceptions, the pharmaceutical industry has been reluctant to
commit resources toward such a goal, despite world-wide demand for
a vaccine to protect against a disease that afflicts 35 million
people and infects 16,000 more people daily.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, a trade organization that represents prescription drug
makers, companies are sinking research dollars into 101 new
treatments for people infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   These include new classes of antiviral drugs to suppress the HIV
virus once a person is infected; medications to fight AIDS-related
diseases such as Kaposi's Sarcoma; and drugs to fend off
opportunistic infections that attack when the immune system is
suppressed by HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton has made development of an AIDS
vaccine a top priority and Congress has budgeted nearly $200
million this year alone for the effort, companies are investing in
only 12 experimental vaccine proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years after the disease erupted, only one AIDS vaccine
has received Food and Drug Administration approval for widespread
human testing. That vaccine is under development by VaxGen, a
small, 52-employee biotechnology firm, of South San Francisco,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the world's vaccines against other
diseases are produced by five companies: Merck &AMP; Co., of Whitehouse
Station, N.J., SmithKline Beecham and Wyeth-Lederle of
Philadelphia, Pasteur Merieux Connaught of Swiftwater, Pa., and
Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   All are involved to varying degrees in AIDS vaccine research.
For example, SmithKline Beecham has only a small AIDS vaccine
effort underway. ``At this point it's not one of the major efforts
in our vaccine programs,'' said Richard Koenig, a SmithKline
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Pasteur, on the other hand, has aggressively pursued an
experimental vaccine that is nearing government approval for a
large-scale human study.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies started, but then curtailed, AIDS vaccine
programs. They include Bristol-Myers Squibb, British Biotech and
Immuno AG.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Francis, president of VaxGen and a former AIDS
specialist at the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, said that if VaxGen and Pasteur fail, ``There's nothing
five years behind us. That's it in the AIDS vaccine field.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagging science and drug economics are the two considerations
underlying the modest corporate interest in AIDS vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have made strides unlocking the mysteries of how the
virus operates after it infects a person. While the knowledge has
been key to making new drugs that slow or halt the disease's deadly
progression, it doesn't point to the discovery of a vaccine that
would render a healthy person immune to HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peggy Johnston, the assistant director for AIDS vaccines at
the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said
company officials worry that not enough is known about how HIV
works to warrant a large vaccine investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enormous challenges that AIDS presents that are
unparalleled compared with other viruses,'' said Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   For example, HIV is proving more resilient than other viruses.
Vaccines typically fend off disease by stimulating the body's
production of antibodies which in turn destroy an invading virus.
However, HIV appears to defend itself with a kind of sugar-based
shield to fend off antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that different strains of HIV exist in the
West and in Africa and Asia. So a vaccine to protect against the
North American variety might not work against other strains.
</P>
<P>
   The economics of vaccines also are daunting.
</P>
<P>
   The average vaccine costs about $100 million to develop. But
because the scientific understanding of HIV is murky, a company
could commit the resources and more than a decade of work and still
fail to invent a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Even assuming that a company could develop an AIDS vaccine
effective against all strains, it still might add up to a poor
investment.
</P>
<P>
   In order to make a profit on vaccines, which are typically
priced in the $1 to $5 per shot range, a drug maker must sell
millions of inoculations. While industrialized countries could
easily afford the price, much of the developing world, which is the
largest potential market for an AIDS vaccine, would have
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   The profitability issue is fueling a proposal by the
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), an advocacy group
based in New York, that is pressing wealthy nations to create a $1
billion AIDS vaccine purchase fund for the Third World, effectively
assuring profit to a successful manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the fund would provide a very strong incentive for
industry,'' said Victor Zonana, a vice president at IAVI. ``The
companies would know that in addition to their markets in
industrialized countries, they would have a guaranteed paying
market in developing countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But pharmaceutical executives believe that even with such a fund
in place, a vaccine won't be as profitable as are AIDS therapeutic
drugs, which are taken for the lifetime of a patient as opposed to
only a few times, as are vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, the president of VaxGen, is fairly confident that if
his company's vaccine works, the firm will turn a profit. ``It
ain't going to be great profit, you can bet that,'' he said.

SURE DIRECTION LETS `DEEP END' RISE ABOVE LIMITATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The modern ``family-healing drama'' has become such a staple of
feature and television movies since it was more or less invented by
1980's ``Ordinary People'' that it's hard for one to seem very
fresh and original, or to move us in any new way.
</P>
<P>
   And, as a literary property, Jacquelyn Mitchard's novel, ``The
Deep End of the Ocean,'' has its share of familiar elements and
glaring improbabilities, as well as one huge coincidence as a plot
point that makes it particularly hard to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, under the sure hand of director Ulu Grosbard
(``Straight Time,'' ``Georgia'') and with near-flawless
performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams, the film
rises well above these built-in limitations to emerge as something
special.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchard's story is about a seemingly perfect (maybe too
perfect) Madison, Wis., family that experiences an almost
unimaginable tragedy when the middle of the three children is
snatched one afternoon from a crowded Chicago lobby where the
mother (Pfeiffer) is having her high school reunion.
</P>
<P>
   When the police, lead by a sympathetic woman detective (Whoopi
Goldberg), can find no trace of the three-year-old boy, the agony
of the days and weeks and months of waiting to hear something
exacts a punishing toll on mother, father (Williams) and the
family's older son (Cory Buck).
</P>
<P>
   Cut to nine years later. Somehow the family has survived, and
one day the abducted son comes back into their lives. The rest of
the movie deals with the impact of this miraculous reappearance,
and the way the family finds to heal the many wounds the experience
has created.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 novel was, of course, a monster best-seller, given a
huge boost by the advocacy of Oprah Winfrey. Thus, the filmmakers
have had to stay very close to its proven success formula,
maintaining its shakier elements, as well as an ending that seems
almost too tidy to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stephen Schiff's script does an admirable job of reducing
a long novel into a tight, dramatic line that communicates every
beat of the gut-wrenching experience, while keeping us oriented
with the individual emotional devastation of each one of the
characters.
</P>
<P>
   The movie makes a terrific star vehicle for Pfeiffer. She's
excruciatingly perfect in the role, forcing us to experience all
the guilt, pain and anxiety her character is feeling in every
agonizing scene. If this film had been released in November or
December, she'd be a guaranteed Oscar nominee.
</P>
<P>
   As her husband, Treat Williams is almost as effective. Always an
underrated actor and star, he's never seemed quite so sympathetic a
presence, such an appealing mixture of strength and vulnerability.
If the film is a hit, it should revitalize his somewhat stagnant
career.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, ``Deep End'' works off the sharp eye and
intuitive skill of Ulu Grosbard _ its 70-year-old, New York-based
director who made his first film, ``The Subject Was Roses,''
exactly 30 years ago, but has never come close to the A-list in
Hollywood, and has worked mostly in theater.
</P>
<P>
   By giving a startling verisimilitude to every scene, every
gesture, every nuance, his direction creates an inexorable
precision and honesty that makes us forget all about its creakier
plot elements. The film may not be an instant classic, but it's as
expertly and poignantly directed a family-in-crisis drama as
Hollywood has produced in a while.

A POET WHO MADE AN IMPRESSION ON THE IMPRESSIONISTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)   By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although his writing was more than occasionally
readerproof, Stephane Mallarme (1842-98) was one of the most
influential cultural figures of 19th-century France. An
avant-gardist, a wit, a salon keeper, a fashion commentator, a
translator of Poe's poems, a critic who supported the
Impressionists and a forerunner of the Symbolist poets whose
innovative ways with language had a significant impact on
Modernism, he himself was nothing less than a work of art.
</P>
<P>
   His closest friends were painters: Edouard Manet, Berthe
Morisot, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas and James Whistler. He
defended their work in his critical writings, and they did
portraits of him and illustrations for his books. Paul Gauguin,
Henri Matisse, Edvard Munch, Odilon Redon, Auguste Rodin and Felix
Vallotton, among others, also produced Mallarmean images and
tributes.
</P>
<P>
   More or less pegged to the centenary of Mallarme's death, an
intense but unfortunately short-lived little show, ``A Painter's
Poet: Stephane Mallarme and His Impressionist Circle,'' can be seen
at the Bertha and Karl Leubsdorf Art Gallery of Hunter College
through March 20. The show was organized by Jane Mayo Roos,
associate professor of art history at Hunter, and a team of
graduate students in conjunction with the Bibliotheque Litteraire
Jacques Doucet in Paris. Its informative catalog, with many
scholarly contributions, is an essential part of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Though literary in tone, displaying a slew of books, autograph
manuscripts and letters, this display is also a visual treat,
beguilingly laced with portraits, prints, photographs,
illustrations and rare items like Mallarme's charts for the
teaching of English. There are works relating to Mallarme by Manet,
Morisot, Renoir, Redon, Gustave Dore, Maurice Denis, Whistler,
Raoul Dufy and Matisse. There are a number of Mallarme portraits,
among them a wonderful 1889 oil by the Swiss-born artist Charles
Giron; an 1895 photograph by Degas of Mallarme and Renoir; another
(undated) by Nadar of the aging Mallarme with a little shawl around
his shoulders, and small etchings by Whistler and Gauguin. The
portraits alone are worth a visit to the show.
</P>
<P>
   Mallarme was born in Paris to parents who came from a long line
of civil servants. He wrote poetry early on and studied English so
he could read the work of Edgar Allan Poe, a strong influence on
Mallarme's idol, Charles Baudelaire. His language study paid off in
another way: for all of his adult life Mallarme earned his bread
teaching English in French schools. In his early 20s he began two
of his major poems, ``Herodiade'' (1869) and ``The Afternoon of a
Faun'' (1876). The sensual ``Faun'' inspired the 1894 tone poem by
Debussy and the 1912 ballet by Nijinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mallarme believed that writing should be close to the
abstraction of music, that it should create its effects by enigma
and veiled suggestion rather than description or exposition, and
that conventional syntax could be dispensed with, much of his work
is far from an easy read. In 1866, when 10 of his poems were
published, the school board of the Lycee Imperial in Tournon, where
he was teaching, was scandalized by a teacher's venturing to write
poetry and dismissed him. He had to transfer to another post.
</P>
<P>
   But his writing was hailed by his peers, and in 1873, at the age
of 31, he met Manet, 10 years his senior. A close friendship
developed that lasted until Manet's death a decade later. Manet
agreed to illustrate Mallarme's translation of ``The Raven,'' Poe's
most popular poem. Their collaboration was published in 1875, a
folio containing six black-and-white lithographs by the artist _ on
display here _ sketchy, dark but very legible vignettes much in the
spirit of Poe's haunted rumination.
</P>
<P>
   Manet also did illustrations for ``Afternoon of a Faun,'' and
other Mallarme poems, and in 1876 painted Mallarme's portrait, a
warm, informal view of the poet holding forth in the artist's
studio, cigar in hand. The painting itself _ said to be more of a
likeness than any other image of Mallarme _ is not here, but an
etching of it appears as an illustration in the book ``Les Poetes
Maudits'' (1884) by Paul Verlaine.
</P>
<P>
   Mallarme wrote in praise of Manet's work and in 1874 produced a
clever defense of the artist when the government-chosen jury for
that year's Salon turned down two of four paintings _ three oils
and a watercolor _ he had submitted. After subtly mocking the
jury's conservatism, Mallarme predicted that public taste for
Manet's work would prevail eventually. Two years later he published
a more important discourse, ``The Impressionists and Edouard
Manet,'' an eloquent paean to the new painting and the man he saw
as its master.
</P>
<P>
   Through Manet, Mallarme met such luminaries as Emile Zola,
Morisot (Manet's sister-in-law), Claude Monet, Renoir, Degas and
Mery Laurent, a cultivated muse to many, who would become the
extramarital love of Mallarme's life. A rather jolly undated
photograph of her at the piano in her art-crammed apartment
includes Mallarme and another male friend.
</P>
<P>
   Always intrigued _ like Manet _ by modish matters, Mallarme
tried his hand as a fashion columnist in the mid-1870s, writing
under the nom de plume ``Miss Satin.'' In 1881 he began his
celebrated weekly ``mardis,'' Tuesday evening salons in his tiny
apartment, where his artist and writer friends pontificated in
clouds of smoke while his wife and daughter did needlework at the
dining room table.
</P>
<P>
   In 1897, the year before his death, Mallarme published his last
major poem, ``A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance.'' It
was his most convoluted creation, unpunctuated and unrhymed, whose
typographical idiosyncrasies (as seen here in printer's proofs and
finished book) are part and parcel of the work.
</P>
<P>
   According to an essay by Robin Kaye Goodman in the catalog, the
poem was perceived by the painter Redon, who illustrated it, as an
attack on bourgeois notions of reading, meaning and sense _ if so,
a fitting forecast of the century to come.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, Mallarme is a formidable subject. But this
well-conceived show is a lively introduction.

STYLISH FIRST FILM IS LOCK, STOCK AND BARRELS OF FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's always daunting to jump on board a bandwagon of raves for a
new, small film. It's important not to oversell the movie's merits
because it can cause over-inflated expectations for the audience.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' which has already
taken Britain by storm, has become the biggest thing since
``Trainspotting.'' First-time director Guy Ritchie brings such a
seamless collision of working-class humor, unpredictable folly and
adreneline-rush fury to the film that it's impossible to resist.
</P>
<P>
   This comedic caper might easily be likened to some of the
obscure, gritty '60s English films such as ``The Lavender Hill
Mob'' or anything that starred crime-story regular, actor Stanley
Baker. But Ritchie, who swears he knows very little about proper
cinema history, has a wholly original visual eye. His lack of
pretension enhances the film's charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' is tinged with tobacco
stains, a yellowing, dingy and faded hue, and a wild, careening
camera and it fits perfectly with its East End London locale.
</P>
<P>
   The area is a seedy, slummy part of town and it's here four best
mates _ Eddie (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), Bacon (Jason
Statham) and Soap (Dexter Fletcher) _ rule with a not very assured
iron fist.
</P>
<P>
   They're cocky young lads and they stake Eddie, who is a gifted
card shark, in a big poker game against evil porno and underworld
mob boss, Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty). Everything is going fine
until Eddie is set up and gets taken for everything he owns,
including his friends' money _ and maybe even his dear old dad's
pub, which Harry wants as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   The boys embark on a plan to steal a bundle from the drug thugs
next door to pay off the debt. But every den of thieves has its own
code of honor and soon the East End is blown apart by the rowdiest,
nastiest, craziest bunch of hoodlums, who descend en masse upon the
already roughshod sector.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie manages to infuse a routine scam and counter-scam
scenario with a fresh twist upon the gangster persona.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' ends, we're
exhausted from the wild ride. But it's been fun _ although violent.
</P>
<P>
   The film should make stars (finally) of Jason Flemyng, who was
quite memorable as the gay dancer in ``Alive and Kicking'' and as
an abusive boyfriend in ``Hollow Reed,'' and of Ritchie, who will
have his work cut out in trying to match the crisp, energetic
frenzy of this stylish first film.

SELF-INDULGENT FILMMAKER DOESN'T DESERVE ANY OF HIS `20 DATES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to gauge if fledgling filmmaker Myles Berkowitz
desires a movie deal more than true love. It's the basis of his
quasi-documentary, ``20 Dates,'' which he wrote, directed and stars
in. It's darned incredible he found either.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about self-indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz is a feeling-sorry-for-himself kind of fellow who
laments the fact that it's nearly impossible to find real honesty
and affection in a town as shallow as L.A. To prove the fact, he
decides to make a ``documentary'' chronicling his quest.
</P>
<P>
   He films 20 dates with several young women, but focuses
primarily on what an old-fashioned, willing-to-please guy he is.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that these dates feel staged and phony and the women
are smarter (a fact he acknowledges with smug self-deprecation
that's supposed to pass as a humbling life lesson). And it has
since become public knowledge that one of the women has apparently
slapped poor Myles with a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the film, Myles meets Ms. Right. But he still has
a few dates to go. Should he give up his perfect woman or ditch the
chance to finish his first movie and find fame and fortune?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, who cares? Berkowitz is so full of himself it's hard
to believe he ever found 20 women who would agree to go anywhere.
He wants to be a satirical provocateur, making an astute statement
about the chasm between men and women in the '90s. But this
plodding, styleless, poorly shot documentary fits the place
Berkowitz purports to disdain: It's vain, vacuous and as airheaded
as L.A. itself.

`REPLACING DAD': ANOTHER UNMARRIED WOMAN, NOT BY CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two decades have passed since Jill Clayburgh showed moviegoers
in ``An Unmarried Woman'' how to take it in style when your husband
leaves you for a younger woman and completely disrupts your perfect
if charmingly chaotic life.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mary McDonnell does the same in ``Replacing Dad,'' a CBS
movie that rises above the brave-woman-with-troubles genre.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshes are just beaming with love in the early scenes.
Linda (Ms. McDonnell) laughs as things tumble out of a closet at
the family's idyllic beach house. Life is wacky but wonderful. She
rushes to the school auditorium and stares adoringly at her
husband, George (William Russ), the principal, at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Their elder son, Drew (Eric von Detten), is blond, gorgeous and
just rebellious enough to prove he's normal. Their daughter, Mandy
(Camilla Belle), is adorable but spunky. And their 4-year-old,
Willie (Hayden Tank), is appropriately precious.
</P>
<P>
   But everything changes the day Linda turns up at George's office
wearing a sexy dress and carrying roses only to find George
nuzzling Mandy's fifth-grade teacher behind closed doors. Russ is
no Michael Murphy (whose character treated Ms. Clayburgh so badly
but broke so easily himself in the 1978 movie), but when George
puts his face in his hands after this encounter, saying, ``Oh God,
what have I done?'' it seems awfully familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonnell is the attraction here. She is such a fine actress
and is so beautifully directed by Joyce Chopra that her shock, pain
and intelligence mingle to uncommonly powerful effect.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, a friend admits that she knew about the affair and
confides to Linda that her husband is still not telling the
complete truth. Everything in Ms. McDonnell's face reflects both
her attempt to hold on to hope and the fact that she's too
intelligent to deny reality. Her cry ``He's not coming back!'' is
anguished; if only someone could make it not true.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Hill gives the cast a solid script to work with. The
film doesn't have the sassy charm of its source, Shelley Fraser
Mickle's novel ``Replacing Dad,'' which was narrated by both Linda
and Drew, but neither the characters nor their behavior is
oversimplified.
</P>
<P>
   As Linda adjusts to her new life, looks for a job, tries to get
the roof fixed and meets a man she finds attractive the children
react with varying degrees of maturity. (Little Willie puts on his
Halloween bunny-rabbit suit and refuses to take it off for months.)
</P>
<P>
   Tippi Hedren, who once specialized in characters with trust
funds and circular driveways, does a nice turn as Linda's mother, a
cheerful woman who relishes beauty pageants and goes out in public
with big pink rollers in her hair.
</P>
<P>
   The script occasionally flirts with cliches (does every woman
who ever got depressed turn to painting seascapes? Does a handsome,
recently widowed doctor always move to town?) and veers toward
sentimentality near the end, but it makes a nice recovery.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Replacing Dad'' plays with the audience's heartstrings it
seems to be done with affection.

`BABY GENIUSES':   NOT THE WORST MOVIE EVER, BUT CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One way to get through ``Baby Geniuses'' is to think about
whether it really is the worst movie you've ever seen. Probably
not, but pretty darn close.
</P>
<P>
   Deceptive trailers and television shots may make this
talking-toddler film look competently made, but that proves not to
be the case. Its technical caliber is what you'd expect from ``Look
Who's Talking 12.'' The plotting is dopey and barely
comprehensible. The sound looping is off-kilter. The look is sad
and cheesy, often bordering on the grotesque, so that the badly
lighted faces of the film's adult actors take on a grayish pallor.
</P>
<P>
   And the babies don't fare any better. Ably executed computer
tricks enable these tots to talk like obnoxious adults (they
admiringly discuss ``The Jerry Springer Show''), but this trick is
better suited to piglets than people. The morphed children look
gnomish and strange.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Bob Clark, whose most notable film credits over a
long career remain ``Porky's'' and ``A Christmas Story,'' and
written by him with Greg Michael, this flawlessly unfunny comedy
concerns an evil child psychologist and CEO, Dr. Elena Kinder. She
is played by Kathleen Turner in a performance that says, ``Hey,
it's a living,'' and is abetted by an overlooked sidekick played by
Christopher Lloyd.
 &UR;  &LR;  These two study the language of babies who can secretly say
things like ``jerk!'' and plan to exploit their little laboratory
specimens for evil gain. Meanwhile, nicer baby researchers (Peter
MacNichol and Kim Cattrall) are unselfishly studying the same kind
of data. The film's single weirdest stroke is to cast, as their
assistants, Dom DeLuise and Ruby Dee (the only performer who
escapes unscathed). According to production notes, these two are
meant to be ``an older hippie couple''
</P>
<P>
   The story also involves twin babies (played by triplets named
Fitzgerald) who switch places in ways meant to heighten the fun.
Filmed as awkwardly as they are, they prompt thoughts about how
children in glossier films and commercials are made to look so
right. The babies' clumsy antics in this Tri-Star film often
involve conspicuous use of Sony products. If Sony made diapers they
would be plugged here too.

NEWS OF THE GREAT WHITE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JESSE MCKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may not be the worst decision of the season. (Remember ``More
to Love''?) But the booking of ``Band in Berlin'' in the Helen
Hayes Theater on Broadway over the acclaimed drama ``Wit'' is
looking more and more suspect.
</P>
<P>
   For those just tuning in, last fall the owner of the Helen
Hayes, Martin Markinson, opted to book ``Band in Berlin,'' a
musical based on a Nazi-era singing group, over ``Wit,'' which was
earning stellar reviews in a small theater Off Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   His reasoning, he said, was that the subject matter of ``Wit,''
a literature professor's battle with ovarian cancer, was not
appetizing to audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Spurned, ``Wit'' subsequently reopened on Jan. 7 in the Union
Square Theater, an Off Broadway house that, with 499 seats, is the
same size as the Helen Hayes but is not Tony eligible. The move has
been a rousing success.
</P>
<P>
   This week producers of ``Wit'' announced that they had earned
back the $500,000 it cost to mount the show and were making
approximately $60,000 a week in profit. Weekly grosses have been
running about $145,000, out of a potential $148,000, said Roy
Gabay, the show's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile at the Helen Hayes the producers of ``Band in
Berlin,'' which opened on Sunday to dismissive reviews, reported
sales of a meager $66,283 last week. But Robert V. Straus, the lead
producer, said the figure was low in part because on opening night
most seats are given free to the press, investors, friends and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Straus said he was giving the show two to five weeks to build an
audience. ``If we're at $60,000 in three weeks,'' he said, ``you
know what we're going to have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Markinson said: ``I'm very happy for `Wit,' but I come from a
place where I never look back. To me that's negative energy. Would
I have made the same choice? Probably. But I simply don't allow
myself to take a whip out and beat myself.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Mackintosh was in New York this week laying the
groundwork for what promises to be a coming onslaught on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Mackintosh, the producer of commercial behemoths like ``Les
Miserables'' and ``Miss Saigon,'' spent most days casting for
``Martin Guerre,'' his oft-reworked musical, which will open in
Minneapolis in September and then tour. It is aiming for Broadway
in spring 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But in his spare time _ and there wasn't much _ he turned his
attention to several other shows. The first is ``Putting It
Together,'' a Stephen Sondheim revue, which now looks likely for
the Barrymore Theater in September or October. Mackintosh dined
with Sondheim on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mackintosh also was discussing his forthcoming revival of
``Oliver,'' which will probably try out in Toronto, Chicago and
possibly Boston before landing in New York in early spring. Audra
McDonald and Geoffrey Rush have been mentioned for roles; a
spokesman for Mackintosh, Marc Thibodeau, said he could not confirm
any negotiations. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If any more proof were needed of this season's strange economic
logic, consider this: The only real moneymakers have been straight
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the pack last fall was ``The Blue Room,'' which sold out
a three-month run and returned a tidy $2 million profit, and
``Electra,'' which will conclude a four-month run on March 21 about
$400,000 in the black.
</P>
<P>
   The spring's first major opening, ``Death of a Salesman,'' has
also put up good numbers, regularly selling out and building a $3.5
million advance.
</P>
<P>
   And more winners may be on the way. Emmanuel Azenberg, the
producer of ``The Iceman Cometh,'' opening in April, said this week
that advance sales of his show would likely top $4.4 million this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Producers of ``Amy's View,'' another April entry, declined to
say what their advance was, but a member of the production who had
seen sales figures said they were ``Blue Room-like.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, of the season's musical offerings, only ``Annie Get
Your Gun'' and ``Fosse'' are showing any real box office vigor.
``Footloose,'' which has had good weeks and bad, has slipped of
late. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cast of the Encores concert series' next show, ``The
Ziegfeld Follies of 1936,'' opening on March 25, will include two
alumni of the musical ``Chicago'': Karen Ziemba, who was in the
current New York production, and Ruthie Henshall, who was nominated
for an Olivier Award for ``Chicago'' in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ziegfeld''s cast also includes Peter Scolari and Mary Testa.
Ms. Henshall also looks likely to join the New York ``Chicago'' in
May, playing the role of Velma opposite Sandy Duncan. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Deidre Murray, composer of the music for ``Running Man,''
first proposed a performance piece about her brother's heroin
addiction to her collaborator, Cornelius Eady, he thought the
concept was slightly unwieldy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have had to be an opera,'' said Eady, recalling Ms.
Murray's original 20-page outline. ``With a cast of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murray said, ``I wanted to do a homage to people who never
make it.'' Her brother, Wellington, died in 1991. ``He fell and
kept falling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But over the course of two years the piece was whittled down
into a 75-minute, jazz-infused piece, playing now through Sunday at
the Here performance space in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running Man,'' which has received some critical praise and
subsequent attention from commercial producers, was commissioned by
the Music-Theater Group. Lyn Austin, the producing director of the
group, said negotiations were under way to reopen in a larger
theater this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Eady nor Ms. Murray are accustomed to working in the
theater. Ms. Murray is a accomplished jazz cellist; Eady is a poet.
</P>
<P>
   But both seem to be enjoying their excursion. ``Theater is kind
of like dreaming out loud,'' Eady said. ``I think I'm hooked.''

CHOW'S MERMERIZING PRESENCE NEARLY MASKS FILM'S DEFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hong Kong superstar Chow Yun-Fat is so charismatic in his second
Hollywood outing, ``The Corruptor,'' that he almost makes us forget
that the movie itself is one of the more pretentious, muddled and
incompetent action films to come along in some time.
</P>
<P>
   He plays Nick Chen, a much-decorated New York City cop assigned
to the department's Chinatown-based Asian Gang Unit, who is
actually in the pocket of the ruling tong leaders, and secretly
supporting them in their on-going war with a young upstart gang
called the Fukien Dragons.
</P>
<P>
   The plot point comes when Chen is given an unexpected partner,
Danny Wallace (Mark Wahlberg), a Chinese-speaking, white rookie
detective with what Chen calls ``yellow fever'' _ an affinity for
all things Chinese, including women. A Chinese wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most mismatched cop movies, however, Chen takes an almost
instant liking to Wallace, and most of the movie deals with his
efforts to keep the boy off the payroll of a slimy tong leader
(played with Oscar-worthy unctuousness by Ric Young) _ the
corruptor of the title.
</P>
<P>
   Chow is fairly mesmerizing in the role. Not conventionally
handsome, with a moon face and a curious hook of a nose, he's
nonetheless as commanding a presence as the cinema has produced in
the '90s. With his repertory of scene-stealing mannerisms, he's
strangely reminiscent of Steve McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   Wahlberg, on the other hand, is less impressive here than he was
in ``Boogie Nights'' or even ``The Big Hit'' _ frankly rather dull.
And Robert Pucci's script is both consistently confusing, and
littered with the evidence of his lack of knowledge about all
things Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, director James Foley (``Reckless,'' Madonna's ``Who's
That Girl'') tries to tell his story in a retro-``Miami Vice''
style, with tight close-up shots that often reveal every pimple and
pore of his actor's faces, but make it so difficult to figure out
what's going on that it's ultimately anti-dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   This is never more obvious than in the film's big Chinatown
chase sequence, which has been skillfully choreographed but framed
by Foley in such cramped close-ups that it has almost no thrilling
impact. Too bad he didn't take a closer look at the chases in John
Frankenheimer's ``Ronin'' to see how a real action director does
it.

INNER-CIRCLE ACOLYTE, THEN APPALLED OUTSIDER

  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``All Too Human,'' the awkward title of the new
memoir by President Clinton's former adviser, George
Stephanopoulos, seems meant as a commentary on the author's
famously flawed former boss and on the author himself. The book
depicts Clinton as a man of contradictions, a politician whose very
``shamelessness is a key to his political success,'' a man whose
``capacity for denial is tied to the optimism that is his greatest
political strength.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it creates a sort of Bildungsroman portrait of
the author as a young man whose idealism is tempered by ``raw
ambition,'' a onetime altar boy turned political operative, whose
messianic fervor on behalf on the candidate he helped get elected
gradually gives way to disillusion and doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of ``All Too Human'' _ the title, presumably
taken from Nietzsche, does little to capture the tone of this
candid and highly readable memoir _ has brought much debate on
television talk shows about loyalty and discretion, but the book is
a far cry from the devastating indictments of previous
administrations offered by other insiders.
</P>
<P>
   It lacks the coldblooded voyeurism of H.R. Haldeman's
``Diaries,'' which depicted the Nixon White House as a paranoid
bunker. It eschews the sneering vituperation that has animated such
books as Donald Regan's ``For the Record: From Wall Street to
Washington,'' which depicted a Reagan White House in thrall to
Nancy Reagan's astrologer, and David Stockman's ``The Triumph of
Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution Failed.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Stephanopoulos' memoir in large measure simply
amplifies the portrait of the president and his administration
already offered by insiders like the onetime presidential adviser
Dick Morris and Robert Reich, the former Labor Secretary, as well
as a host of journalists including David Maraniss, Bob Woodward and
Elizabeth Drew, each of whom already has written two books on
Clinton. It is a portrait of a White House riven by infighting and
disorganization, and an indefatigable if often indecisive president
given to volcanic rages and sentimental spasms, a compulsive
politician with a ``natural inclination toward conciliation and a
Panglossian faith in his ability to achieve what he willed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos notes in his prologue that he had intended _
before Monica Lewinsky _ to write the story of how ``an ambitious
and idealistic president of uncertain personal character grew in
office'' and how a group of ``good, talented but fallible people''
tried to use what Vaclav Havel calls ``the art of the possible'' _
that is, political maneuvering, intrigue and deal-making _ to
effect ``the art of the impossible, namely, the art of improving
ourselves and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The revelations of last year changed Stephanopoulos' appraisal
of his former boss. ``I was angry at Clinton,'' he writes, ``for
selfishly risking his presidency on a foolish dalliance and
arrogantly trying to fix it himself, for lying about it and sending
others out to lie for him, for paralyzing his policy agenda and
making his accusers look like prophets instead of fools.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception, however, of a biting picture of Morris (who
is depicted as an egomaniacal buffoon, ``the dark buddha whose
belly Clinton rubbed in desperate times''), ``All Too Human'' is
fueled less by any score-settling agenda than by an insider's
preoccupation with process and a natural storyteller's fondness for
vivid characters and anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos describes Ross Perot as ``the weird little man
who was a ventriloquist's dummy for voter anger,'' Sen. Robert C.
Byrd as ``an elegant, elderly popinjay,'' the former New York
governor, Mario M. Cuomo, as a Hamlet who couldn't make up his mind
whether he would accept a Supreme Court appointment, and Vice
President Al Gore as ``the only person inside the White House who
could really poke fun at the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Stephanopoulos argues that she, like
her health care plan, ``was ambitious, idealistic and highly
logical'' but also ``inflexible, overly complex and highly
susceptible to misinterpretation.'' ``Her often brittle exterior,''
he adds, ``masks a more vulnerable core,'' while the president
``looks soft'' but is cushioned by his ``accommodating nature.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he suggests, Mrs. Clinton exercised a
formidable hold over her husband. He depicts Clinton as agreeing in
December 1993 that the White House should cooperate with reporters
and turn over Whitewater documents until he thought of how his
wife, Hillary, would react.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saying her name flipped a switch in his head,'' Stephanopoulos
writes. ``Suddenly, his eyes lit up and two years' worth of venom
spewed out of his mouth. You could usually tell when Clinton was
making Hillary's argument: even if he was yelling, his voice had a
flat quality, as if he were a high school debater speeding through
a series of memorized facts.''
</P>
<P>
   On the matter of Whitewater, he adds: ``Clinton wasn't commander
in chief, just a husband beholden to his wife. Hillary was always
the first to defend him on bimbo eruptions; now he had to do the
same for her.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Stephanopoulos' relationship with Clinton, he writes that
he had become a ``true true believer'' during the 1992 campaign
and, in retrospect, ``an enabler'' who wanted Clinton to see him
``as his defender, not his interrogator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A dynamic had already started,'' he writes of the fallout from
the Gennifer Flowers episode, ``that would repeat itself many times
in the years ahead _ one explained well by Reinhold Niebuhr.
`Frantic orthodoxy,' he wrote, `is never rooted in faith but in
doubt. It is when we are not sure that we are doubly sure.' I now
had doubts about Clinton, had seen his flaws up close, which caused
me to focus even more intently on his strengths and believe even
more fervently in his ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   How can Stephanopoulos reconcile his willingness at the time to
spin the Gennifer Flowers story with his current anger over the
Monica Lewinsky affair? ``I didn't think I was a hypocrite,'' he
writes, ``because my defense of Clinton against past bimbo
eruptions had been predicated on my belief that he wouldn't create
new ones, but maybe I was complicit because when I worked for
Clinton I had been willing to suspend my disbelief about some of
his more suspect denials.''
</P>
<P>
   Such tortured explanations _ part rationalization, part mea
culpa, part masterful spin, part earnest self-doubt _ are in many
ways characteristic of this book, which one minute has
Stephanopoulos reveling in tactical stratagems and the next moment
worrying that he has become as shameless as his nemesis Dick
Morris; one minute trying to convince himself that his boss'
policies matter more than anything else and the next minute fuming
at Clinton's recklessness and talent for evasion.
</P>
<P>
   They also underscore why Stephanopoulos, who writes that he
began seeing a therapist in 1994 and taking Zoloft for anxiety and
depression, decided to leave the administration after the 1996
campaign to begin a new life teaching at Columbia University and
working as a political analyst for ABC. ``That's the way it was
with the Clintons,'' he writes, ``You were either for them or
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   As Stephanopoulos repeatedly points out in this lively memoir,
he and the president were alter egos of sorts. He was the
pessimistic staffer, constantly worrying about consequences and
fallout; the president was the optimistic star, convinced he could
wing his way through his often self-inflicted troubles. ``I was the
dark one,'' Stephanopoulos writes, ``he was ``Mr. Lucky.''

PAIR OF MISSING SHOES SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT LIFE OF IRANIAN CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's best foreign-language film Oscar nomination for
Majid Majidi's ``Children of Heaven'' puts the official seal of
approval on one of the true phenomenon of international cinema in
the '90s: the renaissance in Iranian filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   The film is virtually a compendium of the style, themes and
sensibility of the New Iranian Cinema. Like so many of them (``The
White Balloon,'' ``And Life Goes On,'' etc.), it's an Islamically
correct, neo-realist parable about a vulnerable child struggling
with a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the child is a schoolboy from a poor family named Ali,
whose ordeal begins in the midst of a shopping trip for his
bedridden mother when he loses his younger sister's shoes, which he
had just taken to a cobbler for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing his family cannot afford a new pair of shoes and already
in the doghouse with his father, Ali devises a scheme with his
little sister, Zahra, to ``share'' his well-worn sneakers: she
wears them in the morning, he wears them in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   From this premise, the film moves along in an episodic manner as
various problems arise both in their family and in each of their
schools as they struggle to live with the one pair of shoes, and it
builds to a grand climax in which Ali's anxiety over the situation
drives him to desperate measures.
</P>
<P>
   The film, reportedly a huge hit in Tehran, operates on several
levels that can't be translated into subtitles. For instance,
though it goes unmentioned, the children are Iranian Turks, a
minority whose accent immediately establishes them as outsiders to
Iranian society.
</P>
<P>
   But what does translate is another lean, uncluttered, totally
engaging look at a brave Iranian child trying to cope with a
seemingly insurmountable problem in a horror-filled world he
doesn't understand, run by adults who are as remote to him as
Martians.
</P>
<P>
   As in other Iranian childhood films, director Majidi has given
much attention to the casting of the children. They're both
adorable, and, as Ali, little Mir Farrokh Hashemian is an
astonishingly good actor, with eyes that seem to carry the sorrow
of the whole world in them.
</P>
<P>
   Also, like so many of the New Iranian Cinema's international
hits, ``Children of Heaven'' is, despite its grimness, ultimately
quite optimistic. Life is hard, it tells us, but people are
intrinsically good, and everything tends to work out in the end.

FRANCE'S CINEMATIC PASSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 3rd take is an optional sidebar with the schedule of film
showings.) 
(js) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having to consume the $40 million buckets of toxic
popcorn Hollywood churns out month after month can throw a film
critic into a state of hand-wringing despair. Why, why, why? Why
has an industry with the potential to enrich our lives sunk into a
soul-deadening wasteland of cartoonish violence and adolescent
pranks? The answer, of course, has something to do with commercial
calculation and least-common-denominator marketing.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the questions: Where can you go to find a cinematic
semblance of flesh-and-blood people with complicated emotions and
bodies that perspire, instead of pose, when they make love? Where
can you find movies with characters who think as well as act,
movies that capture a recognizable sense of life's texture, the
feeling of here and now? Heaven knows America's independent films
are trying to fill the gap, and some are succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a better answer, and it can be summed up in one
word: France. The French cinema, like no other, has a solid
tradition of films that celebrate the realm of the senses: food,
love, air, light, trees and architecture. Those visual delights can
be savored for the next 10 days at the Walter Reade Theater where
the Film Society of Lincoln Center is presenting its annual series
Rendez-Vous With French Cinema Today. But unless they find American
distributors, many of these films _ shown in cooperation with
Unifrance, France's film-export agency; the French Film Office, and
the French Cultural Services _ may never be seen in the United
States again. That would be a shame, since most, if not all, merit
engagements here.
</P>
<P>
   After an immersion in 11 of those 13 films, I came away feeling
the elation of having returned from an unusually stimulating
vacation. None of the films shown at the press screenings may be
outright masterpieces, but most of the 11 delineate complex
characters, finely nuanced naturalistic performances and a
matter-of-fact erotic realism that every Hollywood director could
learn from.
</P>
<P>
   The most quintessentially Gallic of the movies is deliriously
romantic: Claude Lelouch's irresistibly sensuous ``Hasards ou
Coincidences'' (``Luck or Coincidences''), one of many in the
series to have a female protagonist. If Lelouch, who made his name
33 years ago with the ultimate mid-'60s date movie, ``A Man and a
Woman,'' is still trafficking in the same giddy live-for-life
romanticism that infused that breakthrough movie, his vision has
deepened appreciably.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasards'' offers frothier variations on a theme explored in
much darker and more anguished ways by the great Polish director
Krzysztof Kieslowski, who died three years ago. Alessandra Martines
is Myriam, a beautiful and successful dancer, adrift after a failed
marriage and a career that has peaked, who finds a fairy tale happy
ending with a wealthy older man. But when he takes her and her
young son on a euphoric global jaunt, he and the boy die in a
drowning accident, leaving Myriam grief-stricken and suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   The son's video camera, which recorded the trip and the fatal
accident, passes to thieves and ends up in the hands of a
philosophy professor who deduces what happened and becomes obsessed
with finding Myriam. Meanwhile, she is determinedly retracing her
steps and refilming the scenes as an anguished personal memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hasards,'' which moves from France to Canada to Turkey to
Acapulco, is, among other things, a gorgeous travelogue. An
unabashed sentimentalist, Lelouch has a gift for portraying the
beauty of the world and the joy of happy people with an intensity
that almost hurts. And in this film, the philosophical questions
about chance and coincidence that he toys with give his film an
intellectual underpinning that keeps it from spinning off into the
romance-novel ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Tonie Marshall's ``Venus Institute,'' a huge hit in France, has
a similar aura of fairy tale enchantment enriched by wit as well as
a fiercely intelligent portrayal by Nathalie Baye of a 40-year-old
beautician who is so burned by love that she limits her sexual life
to flings with men she picks up. One day a handsome younger
sculptor, observing her breakup with a lover in a restaurant,
becomes smitten with her and embarks on an ardent pursuit that she
furiously resists. The movie may be little more than a modern
Cinderella fantasy for middle-aged women, but it is beautifully
acted and lightheartedly sexy.
</P>
<P>
   Sex, in fact, is so pervasive in this year's Rendez-Vous that
the series might as well have been subtitled Sex and the Single
Woman. Six films _ Catherine Breillat's ``Romance,'' Cedric Kahn's
``L'Ennui,'' Catherine Corsini's ``Nouvelle Eve,'' Laetitia
Masson's ``A Vendre'' (``For Sale''), Philippe Grandrieux's
brilliant, experimental ``Sombre'' and Nicole Garcia's ``Place
Vendome'' _ explore female sexuality with a depth and complexity
that is light-years beyond the sexist caricatures and Puritanical
moralizing that typify Hollywood's view of women.

<P>
   In a witty role reversal, Bruno Poldalydes' ``Dieu Seul Me
Voit'' (``Only God Sees Me'') tells a kind of male Cinderella
story, in which a shy, indecisive sound engineer can't make up his
mind which of three beautiful, strong-willed women he wants. This
light, engaging comedy just won the Cesar, the French Academy
Award, for best first feature.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Breillat's ``Romance,'' one of two films not screened in
advance _ the other is Jean-Philippe Toussaint's ``Patinoire''
(``The Ice Rink'') _ explores in graphic detail the erotic life of
a young woman (Caroline Ducey) who lives out her sexual fantasies
with three lovers, one of whom is frightened by the devouring
intensity of her desire for him. Ms. Breillat has pushed the
boundaries of sexual explicitness in earlier films like ``Sale
Comme un Ange'' and ``Parfait Amour,'' and here she is said to have
gone even further.
</P>
<P>
   In ``L'Ennui,'' adapted from a novel by Alberto Moravia, Martin
(Charles Berling), a philosophy professor separated from his wife
and suffering from an agitated depression, begins an affair with
Cecilia (Sophie Guillemin), a Rubenesque 17-year-old whose previous
lover, a much older painter, suffered a heart attack while making
love to her. Cecilia is as inexpressive as she is sexually
inexhaustible. And as the affair develops, Martin becomes
obsessively jealous of the young woman, who eventually concedes
that she is also involved with someone else.
</P>
<P>
   This brilliant, emotionally harrowing film, which has several
graphic (but simulated) scenes of intercourse, explores not just
the physical and psychological but the philosophical ramifications
of sexual possession, and follows Martin's quest for an elusive and
ultimately unattainable control to the brink of madness. Ms.
Guillemin gives a luminously mysterious performance of the
wide-eyed, milky-skinned love object, who is at once infinitely
available and ultimately unattainable.
</P>
<P>
   Variations of the boredom and aimlessness that motivate Cecilia
also drive the protagonist of ``La Nouvelle Eve,'' an incisive
dissection of a selfish, angry young Parisian. Camille (Karin
Viard) is an attractive, single 30-year-old who becomes fixated on
Alexis (Pierre Loup Rajot), a happily married man at whom she hurls
herself relentlessly until his resistance cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Viard's Camille chillingly embodies a certain kind of sexual
ruthlessness. She wants everything, and she wants it her way or not
at all. Whenever she feels rebuffed or rejected by Alexis, she
carelessly throws herself at the nearest man for comfort and
revenge. When Alexis jokingly calls her a terrorist, he is not far
from wrong. The power of Ms. Viard's performance is that she makes
us understand Camille and even care for her a little.
</P>
<P>
   In the somewhat weaker ``A Vendre,'' a detective (Sergio
Casetllitto), hired by a businessman whose young fiancee
disappeared the day they were to be wed, digs into the past of the
woman (Sandrine Kiberlain) and slowly discovers a restless creature
driven by an inexplicable rebelliousness into prostitution. Like
``La Nouvelle Eve,'' ``A Vendre'' avoids trotting out condescending
pop-psychological truisms to explain her angst, suggesting only
that it stems from some perverse deep-seated longing for an
unattainable independence. What holds this quasi-Hitchcockian yarn
together is Ms. Kiberlain's sullen, spellbinding performance. The
movie really only stumbles in its final scenes set in New York
where the American characters have strong French accents.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of ``Sombre'' is a virginal young woman (Elina
Lowenstein) who falls in love with a serial killer (Marc Barbe) who
in the film's early scenes is shown methodically murdering
prostitutes. Filmed in semi-darkness with a hand-held camera and
sometimes veering into pure visual abstraction, the movie, the most
experimental in the series, is a deeply unsettling, stylistically
audacious mood piece that attempts to enter a psychotic state of
mind.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Sombre'' is the most daring in the series, Nicole Garcia's
``Place Vendome'' is the most conventional. Catherine Deneuve gives
an elegant and subtle performance as the alcoholic widow of an
unscrupulous diamond merchant. After her husband's death, her
effort to sell some valuable stolen gems leads her into a reunion
with another dealer and former lover who betrayed her many years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The sexuality of many of the characters in these films is much
more fluid than it used to be in French movies. Camille's best
friends in ``Nouvelle Eve'' are a lesbian couple, and she enjoys a
casual lesbian fling. One of her boyfriends describes a homosexual
encounter he had. A party she attends is a kinky, drug-infested
bisexual orgy.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``La Poulpe'' (``The Octopus''), an entertaining film
noir set in a grim seaside French town riddled with corruption
stemming from the clandestine smuggling of slave labor, the Nora in
a modern-day Nick-and-Nora couple of amateur sleuths casually
sleeps with women as well as men. Clothilde Courau brings an
irresistible vitality to this tomboyish urchin who in one memorable
scene emerges nude from a bathtub, pointing a gun to fend off a
gang of sadistic thugs.
</P>
<P>
   The erotic shenanigans in ``Ceux Qui M'Aiment Prendront le
Train'' (``Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train'') are
programatically pansexual. The film, by Patrice Chereau, who
directed ``Queen Margot,'' follows a group of relatives, friends,
former lovers and students of a famous painter as they travel from
Paris to Limoges for his funeral. The artist being remembered is
compared to Francis Bacon in both the ferocity of his work and the
tumult of a personal life that crossed all conventional boundaries.
And those who remember him (including Vincent Perez as a
transsexual) reflect the chaotic sexuality in which he reveled.
</P>
<P>
   This extravagantly romantic film, whose rich musical score
ranges from Jeff Buckley to Mahler's 10th Symphony, begins with a
dazzling sequence at the train station in which the camera
crosscuts among the various mourners and their complicated
relationships. Eventually the film loses steam. But before it does,
it offers a provocatively sexy vision of Paris' vie boheme,
late-'90s style.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there is Claude Miller's ``Classe de Neige'' (``Class
Trip''), an eerie tour de force of escalating horror that at
moments suggests a Gallic equivalent of ``The Shining.'' The movie
tells the story of a shy young boy plagued by horrifying
nightmares, many of which originate from the gruesome stories his
overprotective and slightly sinister father has told him.
</P>
<P>
   When he goes on a class ski trip to a lodge in the French Alps,
he experiences familiar childhood terrors, and at first the film
appears to be a conventional rite-of-passage story about a boy
growing up and facing down his fears. As the film proceeds, those
terrors both escalate and seem less fantastic all the time.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``La Classe de Neige'' has the same attractively
high-gloss visual imagination as Lelouch's ``Hasards,'' it uses
scenic beauty to an opposite and diabolical effect by pulling the
rug out from under your sentimental expectations. What if your
worst nightmare _ one that is so horrible that you can't even
describe it _ turns out to be true?

`THE CORRUPTOR': GANG-BUSTING PARTNERS IN CHINATOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the nice throwaway bits in James Foley's bracingly chilly
police drama ``The Corruptor'' finds the two main characters, Chen
(Chow Yun-Fat), a New York City policeman assigned to Chinatown,
and his partner, Danny (Mark Wahlberg), bantering at a neighborhood
fruit stand. When Danny asks for a peach, Chen insists he choose a
plum instead and quotes from a Sinatra song: ``Out of the tree of
life I just picked me a plum.'' Later in the film, a fragment of
that Sinatra song, ``The Best Is Yet to Come,'' rises on the
soundtrack at a particularly dramatic moment and lends the scene,
set in the bowels of a grim freighter packed with illegal Chinese
aliens, an eerie poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Little touches like these lend ``The Corruptor'' a stylish
patina that puts it a cut above much of the competition. The movie
may be a conventional story of police corruption, temptation and
conflicting loyalties, but it never loses its smarts.
</P>
<P>
   The movie tells a story of initiation and duplicity and a
friendship between two men that is carefully built, then strained
to the breaking point. Danny, assigned to a precinct in Chinatown,
finds himself the object of suspicion and scorn at headquarters
where Chen, a much-decorated local hero with powerful connections
to the Asian-American community, has ruled for years. Initially
Danny makes some spectacular mistakes. But as he and Chen
collaborate on one risky gang-busting operation after another, the
two establish a powerful bond, and each ends up saving the other's
life more than once.
</P>
<P>
   The treacherous Chinese-American underworld through which they
move is infested with bloodthirsty rival gangs and mob bosses whose
gambling and prostitution operations mask the more sinister
business of importing illegal Chinese aliens into the United States
at $40,000 a head. Many of the women imported are immediately sent
to work as prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no love lost between the New York police and the FBI,
which are in a nasty competition for crime-busting credit. Danny,
on top of having to cope with Asian-American prejudice, is saddled
with an indigent widowed father, an ex-cop who went bad and served
time in prison and has incurred thousands of dollars in gambling
debts.
</P>
<P>
   As Danny learns the ropes in Chinatown, it becomes obvious that
Chen has compromised his integrity on many fronts. With Chen
leading the way, Danny accepts some of the corrupt perks of his
job, including the free services of prostitutes. A smooth-talking
reptilian mobster, Henry Lee (Ric Young), proves particularly adept
at manipulating both men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Corruptor'' is the second English-language movie,
following ``The Replacement Killers,'' to try to establish Chow, a
Hong Kong action superstar, in the American market, and it is a
much better film than its predecessor. Chow imbues Chen with the
stormy intensity of a man whose mind never stops churning. That
thoughtfulness, in perpetual conflict with his impulse to swing
into action, lends his performance gravity and tension. Wahlberg's
Danny, a pug-faced naif who in the movie's surprise revelation
turns out not to be as innocent as we thought, is an effective foil
for Chow's brooding policeman.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's sleek, smoothly edited action sequences include a
superbly choreographed car chase through the streets of Chinatown
by the end of which so many vehicles are riddled with bullet holes
it looks as though several thousand rounds of ammunition have been
discharged.

RIVALS JOIN FORCES ON DRUG CERTIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A political odd couple, conservative Sen. Phil
Gramm of Texas and liberal Sen. Barbara Boxer of California,
introduced legislation Thursday that would overhaul the
controversial process of certifying other nations as drug-fighting
allies.
</P>
<P>
   The senators are heading a bipartisan drive to revamp the
current process that causes an annual rift between the United
States, Mexico and other countries battling narcotics cartels.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the president must evaluate the efforts of 28 countries
and certify them as partners in the drug war by March 1 of each
year. The law requires Congress to approve or reject the
administration's findings within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirement that the United States certify Mexico's
anti-drug efforts puts Congress in a position of either certifying
something that is clearly untrue or creating a rupture in
U.S.-Mexico relations that would make drug enforcement even more
difficult,'' said Gramm, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, a Democrat, said: ``What we have now in some cases is the
worst of both worlds. Either we ignore serious drug problems and
vote to certify, or we vote to decertify countries that are our
close allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Their proposal would exempt from the certification process
countries that have a bilateral, anti-drug agreement with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   And it would require the administration to report to Congress
twice each year on the progress in meeting mutual goals such as
curbing narcotics production, trafficking and demand.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new proposal, Congress, at any time, could vote to
place a country back in the certification process, Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is ``particularly important to those of us from border
states, which are hit so hard by the traffic in illegal drugs and
want to make progress, not point fingers,'' Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   The current certification process was created by Congress in
1986 and has prompted protests annually from leaders in Mexico and
other countries whose efforts are judged by this country, the
world's largest consumer of illicit narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``America would not be certified under the certification
process,'' said Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm called the judgment of other nations ``arrogant'' because
U.S. demand is fueling much of the production and transit of drugs
through other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The senators said the current process could not be scrapped
altogether because many lawmakers believe certification gives the
U.S. leverage to force cooperation in the drug war from many
smaller nations with limited resources.

</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has
instructed Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., to move forward with a challenge
to Clinton's certification of Mexico. Mica heads the House
Government Reform subcommittee on drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   And Reps. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., and Clay Shaw, R-Fla., have
filed a resolution that would strip Mexico of certification,
although the lawmakers concede the measure is unlikely to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Constantine, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
has testified before Mica's subcommittee that drug kingpins in
Mexico are responsible for smuggling 75 percent of the cocaine
consumed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the kingpins are well known by lawmen on both sides
of the border, ``they have been able to evade arrest and
prosecution'' in Mexico, Constantine said.
</P>
<P>
   Mica called Mexico's certification as an anti-drug ally
``troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite a long and productive relationship with our ally to
the south _ Mexico _ the river of hard drugs are ending up on
America's streets and coming across the Mexican border,'' Mica
said.

`THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN': A CHILD IS GONE, AND THEN HE IS NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to see why ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' became Oprah
Winfrey's first book club selection, the first book she thought
America might read en masse. Jacqueline Mitchard's novel about a
family thrown into turmoil tells a page-turner of a story that hits
a universal nerve.
</P>
<P>
   All Beth Cappadora need do is get caught up in the hubbub of a
high school reunion and take her eyes off her 3-year-old for a
couple of minutes. That's all it takes to explode Beth's
picture-perfect Middle American family life. The boy is gone,
perhaps forever, and all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mitchard sent Beth into a somewhat wilder, angrier downhill
spiral than the glossy film adaptation of ``The Deep End of the
Ocean'' chooses to. But like Ulu Grosbard's previous film,
``Georgia,'' this one summons the kind of family friction that
creates sparks.
</P>
<P>
   With a fine, impassioned performance from Michelle Pfeiffer as
the story's raw-nerved heroine, the film moves beyond the
detective-story aspects of its material to concentrate on what kind
of shock waves batter a family after an event like this. The
aftereffects are keenly observed, and you needn't read further if
you'd like to be surprised by the plot twist behind 3-year-old
Ben's disappearance. It's startling, and I'm glad I didn't know
about it going in.
</P>
<P>
   However: the revelation comes midway through the story, and the
film doesn't reveal the full range of its family conundrum until
its second half. The first part of the film, straightforwardly
adapted and adroitly pared down by the former film critic Stephen
Schiff (whose ``Lolita'' screenplay likewise preserved the essence
of its material), concentrates on fault lines created by Ben's
vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   Relations grow strained between Beth and her Italian-American
husband, Pat, who is played by Treat Williams. (Ethnicity is one of
the rough edges that have generally been smoothed here.) Beth
drifts into a despairing haze and neglects her other children,
baleful 7-year-old Vincent and baby Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she forms an alliance with the female police
detective assigned to the case. Ms. Mitchard may have described
Det. Candy Bliss as looking just like Gloria Steinem, but she's
played sturdily by Whoopi Goldberg here.
</P>
<P>
   Beth eventually leaves Chicago, where she lost Ben, and returns
to her Madison, Wis., home. Then time passes, Pat moves the whole
family to a stereotypically pleasant Chicago suburb and one day a
nice neighborhood schoolboy asks if he can mow the Cappadoras'
lawn. He calls himself Sam (Ryan Merriman), but Beth knows him
instantly. Sure enough, the fingerprints match.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Now what?'' stage of the story may be the one that most
defies credulity, but it's also the one that Grosbard makes most
intriguing. The long-missing child is reunited with his proud
father, still-grieving mother and sullen older brother (played
especially convincingly as a teen-ager by Emmy-winning Jonathan
Jackson).
</P>
<P>
   But he now has another family (John Kapelos touchingly plays his
adoptive father), and he is no longer the same golden-haired child
who rules Beth's imagination. Much of the film's emotional impact
comes from its awareness of how wrenchingly, in any family, real
and idealized relationships can diverge.
</P>
<P>
   Grosbard mercifully avoids melodrama. And he paces the film so
simply and determinedly that its early scenes are like a string of
picture postcards, each one depicting a new phase of the family's
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the film seeks tidy resolution for a tangled set of
problems does this restraint seem overwhelmed by the complexity of
the situation. But the only real false notes are musical ones, from
a score by Elmer Bernstein that turns familiar and trite when the
film does not.
</P>

SINGERS SILENCED BY A SINISTER BACKBEAT

<P>
   Wreathed in melody and suffused with the nostalgic glow of
remembered romance and youthful hope, the fathomless mystery of the
Holocaust and Germany's long struggle with its Nazi past weight
``The Harmonists'' with a compelling gravity.
</P>
<P>
   This handsome and thought-provoking film does more than relate
the story of the Comedian Harmonists, the musical sextet that
achieved enormous popularity in Germany as the enfeebled Weimar
Republic gave way to Hitler and anti-Semitism in the 1930s. It also
grapples with questions of love of country and how the same people
could cherish culture and embrace barbarity. ``The Harmonists,'' in
German with English subtitles, was written by Klaus Richter and
directed by Joseph Vilsmaier.
</P>
<P>
   Vilsmaier's film, opening Friday at the Lincoln Plaza and
Angelika Film Center, tells essentially the same story as is
recounted in the new Broadway musical ``Band in Berlin.''
Skillfully acted and sung and filled with period details, from
pornographic photos hung inside a seller's shabby overcoat to the
Parmelee taxis that roamed New York, it traces the Comedian
Harmonists from their founding through their success, then on to
the Nazi edicts that forced the group's three Jewish members into
exile after a final concert in Munich in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, as a welcome epilogue notes, the original members
reconstituted as two ensembles, one performing in Germany and one
elsewhere. But their heyday was over. By 1941, the Comedian
Harmonists had disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the dark history that colors and shapes its
narrative, ``The Harmonists'' could be a European version of one of
the countless Hollywood musicals that track the rise of some poor
musician who struggles against the odds to realize his vision. The
film is filled with stylish renditions of lively, funny and
sentimental songs like ``Beautiful Isabella From Castile,''
``Creole Love Call,'' ``Auf Wiederseh'n, My Dear'' and ``When Yuba
Plays the Rumba on the Tuba.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, in 1927, the dreamer is Harry Frommermann (Ulrich
Noethen), a comical-looking failure as an actor but a talented
musical arranger who conceives of forming a German equivalent of
the popular American a capella group the Revellers.
</P>
<P>
   Frommermann, a Jew, is conducting auditions in his garret for a
long line of talentless hopefuls when the room is invaded by a
beefy blond bass, Robert Biberti (Ben Becker), who leads him to a
trove of singers, including the lady-killing Bulgarian Ari
Leschnikoff (Max Tidof), as well as a pianist, Erwin Bootz (Kai
Wiesinger).
</P>
<P>
   After months of rehearsals that tax the group's patience,
followed by rejection at an audition, the musicians finally get an
engagement and, with Biberti assuming the role of business manager,
achieve overnight success.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of Champagne, song and women follow, including Erna
(Meret Becker), the gentile student and clerk in a Jewish-owned
Berlin music shop who has won the shy heart of Frommermann as well
as the less-inhibited attention of Biberti.
</P>
<P>
   But before long, Nazi brownshirts are on the rampage, daubing
storefronts with anti-Semitic insults, smashing windows and
visiting violence on those who rouse their rage. ``It's just some
kids,'' says Mrs. Grunbaum (Susi Nicoletti), the white-haired wife
of the music-shop owner. ``When you're out of work, you get into
mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon Frommermann and Biberti are put on official notice that
despite friends in high places, the Jewish component of the
ensemble renders them collectively unacceptable to Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   On a tour that brings them to New York, the Harmonists confront
the question of leaving Germany forever. Biberti, speaking of his
old mother and of love of country, cannot. The Harmonists return,
and just before the concert in Munich are told it is to be their
last.
</P>
<P>
   At its end, the elegant audience members in black tie and gowns,
aware of the circumstances, render a standing ovation and surge to
the stage. In this moment in ``The Harmonists,'' at the end of a
performance in a city deeply resonant with Nazi history, the tide
of yearning for absolution in the generations of post-World War II
Germany sweeps against the rock of historical fact.
</P>
<P>
   In the glamour and entertainment of ``The Harmonists'' lie
questions that will not go away.

CHRISTIAN COALITION STARTS MASSIVE CAMPAIGN FOR 2000 VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Christian Coalition on Thursday unveiled a $21
million effort to bring religious conservatives to the polls in the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are launching, effective today, the most massive effort to
mobilize the (coalition's) grass-roots in our history,''
tele-evangelist and Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson told
a news conference here. ``There's nothing radical about it. We're
just talking about voter participation where there is apathy at
present.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, which claims 2.1 million members, will attempt to
raise $21 million to increase its paid field organizing staff,
according to Robertson. The coalition will recruit and train 1.5
million conservative activists who will then be tasked with getting
out the religious conservative vote.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the coalition also aims to distribute 75 million
of its voter guides in conservative Christian churches nationwide _
19 million more than in 1996. The guides pinpoint the stands of
candidates on such issues as abortion, school prayer and vouchers
for private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition has been buffeted by a series of high-level
departures in recent years, including former executive director
Ralph Reed and former president Donald Hodel, raising the question
of whether the 10-year-old coalition still packs a potent political
punch.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, coalition executive director Randy Tate told
reporters that the coalition ``will continue to be a permanent
fixture on the American political scene.'' The effort in 2000
``will ensure that pro-family voters and pro-family issues will be
front and center in election 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Tate and others blamed Republicans for not putting
forward a clear message on such issues as tax cuts and abortion
that might have yielded more votes. Democrats gained five House
seats in the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   Although technically non-partisan, Robertson and Tate on
Thursday made little secret of their support for Republicans vying
for the presidential nomination, as well as their abhorrence of the
Democratic frontrunner, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any (of the Republicans) are going to be a lot more acceptable
than Al Gore,'' Robertson said. ``I'm quite enthusiastic about the
way (the Republican race) is shaping up.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading GOP prospect, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, angered
some social conservatives by saying in an interview Monday that
while he opposes abortion, ``I'm a realistic enough person to know
that America is not ready to ban abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, however, said he was not troubled by Bush's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush (is) profoundly on the pro-life side,'' he said.
``I'm not going to take issue with a few words.'' Robertson added
he is ``under the impression'' that another GOP possibility,
Elizabeth Dole, also opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's upbeat talk contrasted with the view of some other
social conservatives who have recently proclaimed President
Clinton's impeachment survival as a virtual death knell for their
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent conservative Paul Weyrich raised eyebrows last month
by equating Clinton's Senate acquittal to ``a cultural collapse of
historic proportions, a collapse so great that it simply overwhelms
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Urging a virtual withdrawal from mainstream culture, Weyrich
said conservatives ``need some sort of quarantine'' to protect
their families from a society in which Clinton's poll numbers
climbed despite the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Weyrich's chagrin, Robertson responded: ``I'm an
optimist. Come the next election cycle, the mood of the American
people is going to be vastly different than what the polls showed
during the impeachment proceedings. I'm not discouraged one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the voting strength of religious conservatives
vary.
</P>
<P>
   In exit polls during last November's elections, 13 percent
identified themselves as religious conservatives. But Everett Carll
Ladd, director of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at
the University of Connecticut, said the pool of religiously
oriented voters who could be influenced by the coalition's appeal
may be as large as one-third of the electorate _ 55 million out of
165 million eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 election, however, the coalition's grass roots
stayed home in larger numbers than expected. A coalition survey
found that 28.6 percent of religious conservatives voted, down from
33 percent in 1994.

`WING COMMANDER' HAS SEEN IT ALL BEFORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's said there are few original ideas in movies anymore. If
``Wing Commander'' is an indicator, it's true.
</P>
<P>
   Take one part ``Top Gun,'' mix with a couple of scenes from
``Aliens,'' stir in the tried-and-true formula from ``Star Trek,''
and the result is an uninspired if well-cast cocktail of a film
from first-time director Chris Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Even on paper this project must have looked contrived. And it
doesn't have the humor or over-the-top campiness to make it a cult
classic. So how did it acquire a cast that includes up-and-comers
Freddie Prinze Jr., Matthew Lillard and Saffron Burrows as well as
established actors like Tcheky Karyo, Jurgen Prochnow, David Warner
and David Suchet?
</P>
<P>
   A paycheck has got to be the answer.
</P>
<P>
   It's 2564 and the Confederation is battling the alien Kilrathis
who have managed to steal a navigation device that could allow them
to capture Earth. Then two brash young fighter pilots, Chris Blair
(Prinze) and Todd ``Manic'' Marshall (Lillard), board the
Confederation carrier that's home to an elite group of ace flyers.
They're led by Wing Commander Devereaux (Burrows), a beautiful
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who is shunned by the other pilots because he is half
``pilgrim,'' a race of people who spent too much time ``alone in
space'' and began to lose their humanity, falls for Devereaux.
Ultimately it's up to Blair's half-human, half-pilgrim sixth sense
to lead the final fight against the Kilrathi.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who designed computer games before becoming a director,
erases any sense of character and emotion from his cartoon cast as
well as his film. ``Wing Commander'' is as one-dimensional as a
game of ``Doom'' and the outcome is as predictable.

`DELIVER THE GOODS'  
 WHERE CREDIT IS DUE

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Perhaps the last person to see Stanley Kubrick's
film ``Eyes Wide Shut'' before his death was an unlikely figure.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Kingsley, a top public relations executive who represents
some high-profile movie stars, saw the movie last Friday afternoon
at Kubrick's home in Hertfordshire, outside London. Kubrick was not
at the screening but upstairs in his bedroom because he said he was
coming down with the flu. But after Ms. Kingsley saw the film, she
spent about 45 minutes talking to Kubrick by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday morning the 70-year-old director of ``2001: A Space
Odyssey'' and ``Dr. Strangelove'' had died in his sleep. Among
those scheduled to attend his funeral in England on Friday are the
film's two stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman , as well as Steven
Spielberg and other filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday a 90-second clip from the film was shown to
thousands of theater exhibitors at the Showest convention in Las
Vegas, Nev. The eye-opening excerpts included an explicit nude
scene of Ms. Kidman (who also shed her clothes in ``The Blue Room''
on Broadway) and a passionate interlude between her and Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kingsley, who is based in Los Angeles and is a partner in
the PMK public relations agency with Leslee Dart and Lois Smith,
represents Cruise and Ms. Kidman. She said she had met Kubrick
three times while he was shooting ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' now one of
the most widely anticipated films.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick was characteristically secretive about every aspect of
the movie. By several accounts ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' which is being
released by Warner Brothers on July 16, is a drama about a pair of
married psychiatrists (played by the married Cruise and Ms. Kidman)
and their sexual lives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kingsley, who has been hired by Warner Brothers to promote
the movie, said she watched the 2 hour 17 minute film in a small
screening room at the Kubrick home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect,'' she said. ``But I was stunned.
I was really at the edge of my seat. I was spellbound. It was very
suspenseful.
</P>
<P>
   After the screening Ms. Kingsley was about to walk out of the
house when an associate of Kubrick said the director wanted to
speak to her. Ms. Kingsley recalled: ``He said, `Let me put you on
with Stanley.' I said, `I'll call him when I get to L.A.,' and he
said, `No, no, he wants to talk to you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick got on the phone and told Ms. Kingsley how delighted he
was with the film, which he showed earlier in the week to Cruise
and Ms. Kidman as well as to Bob Daly and Terry Semel, the Warner
Brothers co-chairmen. The film had been hand carried from London to
New York by Kubrick's editor, who returned home on the next flight.
( Kubrick had stopped flying years ago after eavesdropping on
conversations between pilots and controllers at La Guardia
Airport.)
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's conversation ``was all about the work; he was consumed
with the movie and the work and how happy he was that everybody was
reacting the way they did to the film,'' Ms. Kingsley said. ``He
said he made the movie he wanted to make.'' She added: ``He was
very joyous. He sounded great.''
</P>
<P>
   During the conversation the reclusive director told Ms. Kingsley
that he would be happy to talk about the film and his work with a
few interviewers. But he said he would not come to Los Angeles or
New York; he wanted to conduct the interviews near his home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kingsley returned to Los Angeles the next day and began to
make plans for the promotion of the film. On Sunday morning she was
awoken and told that Kubrick was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deliver the goods for this man,'' she said. ``This
will be a major part of his legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Credit Is Due
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty, like numerous others in Hollywood, has ambiguous
but positive feelings about the decision by the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences to present Elia Kazan with an honorary
Oscar on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the guy,'' said Beatty , whose first film, ``Splendor
in the Grass'' (1961), was directed by Kazan, now 89, and made the
actor a star.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan's award for lifetime achievement has touched off
controversy because of his decision in 1952 to inform on eight
friends from the Communist Party before the House Un-American
Activities Committee. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro are set to
present the award, Daily Variety reported.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty appeared on Wednesday at a ceremony at the Los Angeles
headquarters of the Writers Guild of America to read the names of
uncredited blacklisted writers who used pseudonyms and fronts to
write films between 1948 and 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was part of the guild's effort to determine and
recognize the writers who were blacklisted because of accusations
that they had been Communists, sympathetic to Communists or even
strong-minded liberals who signed a petition or two in the '30s or
'40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that American history makes these credit
corrections necessary,'' said Daniel Petrie Jr., president of the
guild's West Coast branch. ``But the guild is proud to ensure the
public recognition these writers and their work deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best known film affected by the guild's research is
the 1961 Anthony Mann spectacle, ``El Cid,'' which starred Charlton
Heston and Sophia Loren; one of the writers, the blacklisted Ben
Barzman, was omitted from the credits.
</P>
<P>
   After extensive research, including interviews with the crew and
the two stars, Barzman's name was restored. The guild also had the
name of Donald Ogden Stewart, who wrote ``The Prisoner of Zenda''
(1952), restored to the credits of that movie.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty, who has involved himself in mostly Democratic and
liberal politics for years, said he had received numerous calls
about the Kazan award but had shied away from talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel it's my place to address myself to his politics
of 50 years ago,'' he said. ``I can only say he is a person for
whom I have tremendous respect and affection and whose work in
movies speaks for itself. He was my first teacher. I learned more
about movies from Kazan than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beatty went on: ``I don't want to be reductive about his
politics. Although you and I might feel he made a mistake, neither
you nor I were around in that period. And although you and I may
think we would not have made that mistake, we didn't have to make
that choice. We all make mistakes. Some of them are mistakes that
everyone knows about. Some of them aren't.'' And then he said, ``I
love the guy.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In the Race
</P>
<P>
   Ian McKellen, nominated for the Academy Award as best actor for
his role in Bill Condon's ``Gods and Monsters,'' has come to Los
Angeles from his London home until the Oscar presentation. Although
obviously buoyed by the nomination, McKellen also seems puzzled and
a bit irritated at the swirl of political-style campaigning for the
award. He is, after all, a serious British stage actor who is
unaccustomed to Oscar fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, I never want to do it again,'' he said. ``It takes up
an enormous amount of time as you throw yourself into it. And the
situation I find myself in is I would very much like to win the
Oscar. But I seem to be in a race, a race I didn't enter. It's got
a course I'm unfamiliar with. And I'm running along, but I don't
know where to run. I'm not complaining about it. It's all a bit
complicated for me.''
</P>
<P>
   McKellen's role in ``Gods and Monsters'' is loosely based on the
final days of the director James Whale, creator of the Frankenstein
movies of the '30s, who lived in Pacific Palisades after suffering
a stroke and committed suicide in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   McKellen is considered a front-runner for the best acting award
with Roberto Benigni, who won the Screen Actors Guild prize last
weekend, for ``Life is Beautiful.'' Also up for the prize are Tom
Hanks for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Nick Nolte for ``Affliction''
and Edward Norton for ``American History X.''
</P>
<P>
   McKellen arrived here the other day from England after
completing appearances in three plays _ ``The Tempest,'' ``Present
Laughter,'' and ``The Sea Gull'' _ at the West Yorkshire Playhouse
in Leeds.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not especially aware that his nomination had made
him a hot property in Hollywood. Far from it, the 57-year-old actor
said with a laugh. ``Most of the scripts I get are not financed and
come straight from the screenplay writers or putative directors,''
he said. ``I read a lot of them. I have a suitcase full of them.''
He said he was unsure of his next project.
</P>
<P>
   McKellen said that he had certain similarities with his
character in ``Gods and Monsters,'' but only up to a point: ``Like
me, he was an actor most of his life. He was openly gay. And he
was, of course, an Englishman who made the journey to Los Angeles,
and that's one I've made myself.''
</P>
<P>
   McKellen grew up in northern England, the son of a civil
engineer, and acted at Cambridge University after spending his
teen-age years working backstage at local theaters.
</P>
<P>
   And what appealed to him about acting? McKellen paused. ``I
think probably the sense of family backstage,'' he said, ``and
belonging to a world one could control more readily than life
outside the theater.''

NOTHING SMART ABOUT `BABY GENIUSES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TriStar's cute-toddler epic, ``Baby Geniuses,'' might more
properly be called ``Look Who's Talking IV.'' It takes roughly the
same premise of that series and moves it up a technological
generation, so we don't just hear the babies deliver one-liners in
voice-over, we actually see their lips move.
</P>
<P>
   It's an impressive effect _ the morphing of baby lips, teeth,
and faces into adult postures _ and the movie does it so
relentlessly, and to such low-humor effect, that it could be a huge
hit. After all, as much as critics hated the earlier films, they
made a ton of money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the novelty of the adult-like babies wears off so fast,
and the movie is so incorrigibly stupid, distasteful, and maudlin,
that it's hard to see how anyone over the age of 10 could possibly
sit through its 94 grueling minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about an evil corporation led by a Cruella De Vil
of a child psychiatrist (Kathleen Turner) who's been illegally
holding and studying gifted babies in its underground laboratories
_ in hopes of deciphering, and profiting by, the ``secret
pre-literate language.''
</P>
<P>
   Havoc breaks out when Sly, the most gifted of all the rugrats,
escapes the institution and somehow gets mixed up with his twin
brother, Whit, who is being raised by the evil psychiatrist's
all-American niece (Kim Cattrall) as part of a comparative
upbringing experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie has Sly fighting and outsmarting the team
of baby-exploiters trying to get him back, and Wit leading a revolt
of the slave babies inside the institution. (Yes, this is a bizarre
combination of ``Baby's Day Out'' and ``The Corsican Brothers.'')
</P>
<P>
   The chief attraction here is the spectacle of seeing barely
ambulatory children not just talking and making the facial
expressions of adults, but also smoking cigars, dancing like John
Travolta, karate-chopping like Bruce Lee and kicking bad-guys in
the testicles.
</P>
<P>
   The level of the humor is so low it makes the Three Stooges look
like Noel Coward. The movie's running gag is the pungent odor of
diarrhea _ or, as the film keeps calling it, ``diaper gravy.'' You
haven't lived until you've seen a big glaring close-up of Dom
DeLuise picking his nose.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Canada's Bob Clark, who previously directed the
near-classic holiday movie, ``A Christmas Story,'' but is working
here more in the spirit of his 1981 trash-a-thon, ``Porky's.''
Except for the always reliable Kim Cattrall (the movie's one
winning presence), his players are so maliciously wasted they might
be able to recover damages in court.

IMMIGRATION POLICY HURTS POOR AMERICANS, PROFESSORS CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 300,000 immigrants with less than a high school
education who come to the United States each year are driving wages
down and pushing unemployment up for unskilled American workers,
particularly blacks and Hispanics, two professors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slight gain in wealth that immigration provides the
country as a whole is being paid for by unskilled, native-born
workers,'' George J. Borjas, a professor at Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government, told the House Subcommittee on
Immigration and Claims.
</P>
<P>
   Borjas estimated that while immigration benefits the country by
$10 billion annually, American workers without a high school
education lose an average of $1,915 a year because of competition
from low-skill immigrant laborers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, immigration, as it stands today, is great for
educated, middle-class consumers and terrible for poor, working
families,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Borjas said, about 900,000 legal immigrants enter the
United States. Of these, 300,000 have less than a high school
education. Nine percent of American workers have less than a high
school education.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who
favors tighter restrictions on immigration, called the nation's
current policy on the issue a ``recipe for disaster'' for American
blue-collar workers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said U.S. policy should be changed to protect the jobs and
wages of unskilled American workers.
</P>
<P>
   He said African-American and Hispanic workers, who are more
likely to be unskilled, have been hurt the most, adding, ``We can't
pretend that the adverse impact of mass immigration on minorities
doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon M. Briggs Jr., a business professor at Cornell University
in Ithaca, N.Y., suggested that U.S. immigration policy should stop
giving preference to foreign relatives of citizens and start
favoring more applicants with higher job skills and educational
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``With perhaps the most high-skill, high-tech economy in the
world, it seems odd that the United States gears its immigration
policy toward attracting the most low-skill, uneducated
immigrants,'' Briggs said.
</P>
<P>
   But others testifying at Thursday's hearing disagreed with the
charge that low-skill immigrant workers are hurting American
laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the CATO
Institute here, a libertarian think-tank, said the large wave of
immigration to the United State over the past 30 years has helped
fuel one of the country's greatest economic booms.
</P>
<P>
   Citing U.S. Census Bureau figures, he said the immigrant
population in the United States has grown from 9.6 million in 1970,
or 4.8 percent of the total population, to 26.3 million, or 9.8
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Moore also argued that the influx has not hurt job opportunities
or wages of minority workers. Citing other Census statistics, he
said the income gap between blacks and whites has narrowed to its
lowest level in history, with blacks now earning 69 percent of what
whites make.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, from 1981 to 1998, unemployment rates for
blacks and women have fallen dramatically, from 15.6 percent to 8.9
percent for African Americans and from 7.9 percent to 4.6 percent
for females.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all the talk of doom and gloom, the evidence shows we
have had record immigration since 1981 and that in that same period
we have had record economic improvements for blacks,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Najar, a spokesman for the National Council of La Raza, the
nation's largest Hispanic rights organization, said immigrants
should not be made the ``scapegoats'' for wage gaps between skilled
and unskilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rep. Smith ignores the great benefits that today's immigrants
have brought to the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, said lawmakers should stop ``attacking'' immigrants and
focus on why black and Hispanic workers tend to have lower skills
and less education than white workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that job opportunities and educational
opportunities are open to African Americans and Hispanics in a
country where racism still exists,'' she said.

IRAN'S PRESIDENT MEETS WITH POPE IN THE VATICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Seeking to improve relations between Christianity and
Islam, Pope John Paul II gave a private audience to Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami on Thursday. It was the first papal
encounter with an Iranian head of state since the shah's regime.
</P>
<P>
   As the pope escorted Khatami, a Muslim Shiite cleric, out of his
study in St. Peter's after a 25-minute talk, he called their
meeting ``very important and promising.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit was particularly important to Khatami, a moderate who
is the first Iranian leader to visit Western Europe since the
Islamic revolution in 1979. He came seeking to improve Iran's
economic and political ties with the West.
</P>
<P>
   As he was leaving, Khatami asked the pope to pray for him and
for the pope's own health and success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is for the final victory of monotheism, ethics and
morality, together with peace and reconciliation,'' he told the
pope through a translator. ``May God protect you.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit was described as cordial and friendly. One member of
the Iranian delegation, also a cleric, was apparently so moved that
as he passed the pope on his way out, he stopped and asked John
Paul if he could do something. He then leaned down and kissed the
pope on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has long stressed the common bonds and beliefs between
Christianity, Islam and other faiths. Since he arrived in Italy on
Tuesday, so has Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the divine faiths are not quintessentially different,''
Khatami said in a speech Wednesday to the European University
Institute at Fiesole, near Florence.
</P>
<P>
   The last meeting between a pope and a top Iranian leader was in
1970, when Pope Paul VI was greeted during an airport stopover in
Tehran by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi. The Vatican did not break
diplomatic relations with Iran after the revolution, and John Paul
has talked with other Iranian officials in the Vatican, but
Thursday was his highest-level meeting. Iran currently holds the
chairmanship of the 54-nation Islamic Conference, and that gave the
audience additional weight.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The meeting with the pope, therefore, assumes capital
importance,'' the papal nuncio in Iran, Archbishop Romeo Panciroli,
said on Vatican radio.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami also met with Vatican City's secretary of state,
Cardinal Angelo Sodano. According to a Vatican spokesman, they
discussed the Middle East, Christian-Islamic dialogue and human
rights in Iran, including the rights of Catholics there.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican is interested in improving conditions for Christians
in Iran, a small community of about 120,000 in a total population
of nearly 70 million. There are only 13,000 Catholics, and they are
allowed to worship in their churches, but according to Fides, the
missionary news agency of the Holy See, Catholics are strictly
watched and denied some civil rights, like serving in the army or
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian government is less tolerant of larger minorities
like the Bahais, followers of a faith that originated in
19th-century Persia and that Iranian clerics consider apostasy.
Rights organizations and Iranian dissident groups say the Bahais
are fiercely persecuted by the more conservative wings of the
Iranian judiciary and by security forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, where security for Khatami was tighter than for any
official visitor since Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989,
about 50 Iranian demonstrators managed to squeeze into a far corner
of St. Peter's Square, but were cordoned off by barriers and a wall
of police officers, who outnumbered the demonstrators almost two to
one.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters waved banners and shouted slogans against
Khatami. ``He is a fascist and a terrorist!'' one protester
screamed. Despite the security, protesters managed to throw
paint-filled eggs at Khatami's motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, Salman Rushdie was in Italy at the same time as
Khatami, receiving an honorary degree Wednesday at the University
of Turin. Rushdie was sentenced to death in 1989 by Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary leader at the time, who
accused the writer of blasphemy against Islam in his novel ``The
Satanic Verses.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September Khatami's government lifted the sentence, known
as a fatwa. But conservative clerics reaffirmed the sentence on the
10th anniversary of Khomeini's decree.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami did not publicly mention Rushdie during his visit, but
Iranian newspapers sharply criticized Italy for acting as host to
Rushdie during the president's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Before visiting the pope, Khatami had a breakfast meeting at the
Italian Foreign Ministry with two dozen top business executives,
including Guglielmo Moscato, chairman of Ente Nazionale
Idrocarburi, the Italian energy conglomerate. ENI and the French
energy group Elf-Aquitaine recently signed a $1 billion contract to
develop an offshore oilfield in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   A Foreign Ministry official said Khatami sought to reassure the
executives that Iranian society is opening up and that foreign
investors could have confidence in the new climate.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who flew back to Tehran on Thursday, told the
pope that he left with ``beautiful memories'' of his visit in the
Vatican.

SIGNATURE NOT REQUIRED (BUT TAX IS STILL DUE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 14)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The signing of income tax returns, an American ritual in its
86th year, is being swept into the dustbin of history.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing those traditional John Hancocks with digital
signatures will ease the electronic filing of returns, but the
method chosen by the IRS will also mean continuing costs for
taxpayers. That is because they must still go through software
vendors and electronic filing agents to send their returns to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, anyone who filed a return electronically also had to
mail in a signed paper form, or jurat, the statement that makes an
individual who files a false return liable for prosecution for
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has directed the IRS to move 80 percent of taxpayers to
electronic filing by 2007, up from 20 percent now, because it will
be cheaper, faster and far less prone to errors. The IRS estimated
that its cost to process an electronic Form 1040 was $5 last year,
compared with $3.85 for a paper return. But once most people move
to electronic filing, the IRS figures, costs should fall to less
than $2 a return, in 1996 dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The cumbersome system for obtaining signatures, however, is seen
as a big obstacle toward meeting the government's 80 percent goal.
Though the number of electronic returns grew by more than 5 million
last year, to 24.8 million, the growth rate must nearly double to
meet the objective.
</P>
<P>
   Because of concerns about computer security, individuals cannot
file electronic returns directly with the IRS. Instead, the IRS has
licensed about 93,000 accounting firms, enrolled agents and other
preparers as their intermediaries. If a taxpayer files a return
over the Internet through vendors like Turbotax, Securetax,
Taxlogic or Taxact, the return first goes to the software company,
which is licensed as an ``electronic return originator.'' The
originators, which have access to IRS computers, make sure the
return meets IRS protocols and, typically, charge fees for the
services.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in a shift in strategy, the IRS has offered to drop
the signature-form requirement for a big group of taxpayers _ 8
million people whose returns indicated that they prepared their own
1997 tax returns by using computer software. A year ago, most of
those taxpayers printed out and mailed in their returns, but nearly
1 million chose electronic filing.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting those filers is a key to rapid growth in electronic
filing, said Robert Barr, the IRS's assistant commissioner for
electronic tax administration, who previously was an executive at
Intuit, maker of Turbotax.
</P>
<P>
   The 8 million taxpayers were sent postcards containing
electronic customer numbers, much like the personal identification
numbers on bank cards. Those numbers can be used to file a return
electronically without having to submit the separate signature form
or mail-in W-2s (but keep them in case of an audit).
</P>
<P>
   Barr said that if taxpayers did not receive or keep their
postcards, they could not get new customer numbers for this year.
But there are two other options.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is allowing 8,100 tax preparers to let their customers
select their own four-digit codes, which can be used instead of a
traditional signatures, Barr said. The IRS does not publish a list
of those preparers, so taxpayers choosing that option will have to
shop around.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, since 1996, taxpayers have been able to use
Telefile, which uses touch-tone phone technology for filing Form
1040EZ, a simplified form for people who make less than $50,000. In
lieu of the signature form, EZ filers can use a code found on tax
materials the IRS mailed to them at the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the IRS focused its electronic-filing strategy
on lower-income taxpayers, who commonly have more money withheld
from their paychecks than is required and then collect big refund
checks. That strategy created a perception problem for electronic
filing, especially among accountants who work with wealthier
clients; many perceived the electronic system as not designed for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Krokus, an accountant in Norwalk, Conn., saw the problem
at a recent tax seminar for fellow accountants whose clientele are
middle- to upper-income taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked how many people in the room filed their clients'
returns electronically, and not one hand out of more than a hundred
went up,'' Krokus said. ``I explained that I have used electronic
filing exclusively since it was first available in Connecticut in
1989, and that it is good for clients because it reduces the chance
that a government clerk will make a keypunch mistake transferring
numbers from a paper return.''
</P>
<P>
   Solving the image problem could mean hundreds of millions of
dollars in annual savings for the IRS in processing and follow-up
work. ``You are far less likely to hear back from us if you use
electronic filing,'' Barr said.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. (STAR) denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings
and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   (STAR)  &UR; ``AFFLICTION,''  &LR; starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn,
Willem Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul
Schrader (R, 114 minutes). Nolte is devastating in the performance
of his career, as Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a
losing battle with demons from his past. Foremost among them:
Coburn, terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who
long ago cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Schrader,
this pure, unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks' novel starts on
a deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury.
Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play
the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (STAR)  &UR; ``ANALYZE THIS,''  &LR; starring Robert De Niro and Billy
Crystal. Directed by Harold Ramis (R, 110 minutes). The title,
concept and teaming of these co-stars are all funny before the
lights go down, so think of this comedy as an offer you can't
refuse. Cast as a mobster whose confidence is shaken, De Niro is
hilarious simply by playing his role halfway straight, in classic
goodfella style. His mobster finds just the right comic foil in
Billy Crystal, as the psychiatrist who utters the immortal: ``When
I got into family therapy, this wasn't the family I had in mind.''
There's a lot more where that came from in this breezy comic treat
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``BLAST FROM THE PAST,''  &LR; starring Brendan Fraser, Christopher
Walken, Alicia Silverstone and Sissy Spacek. Directed by Hugh
Wilson (PG-13, 105 minutes). More amusingly than might be expected,
this comedy tells the story of one very nuclear family that has
been hiding in a fallout shelter since 1962 and emerges into a '90s
world of grunge and attitude. In fact, it's funnier underground,
with Fraser as the strapping son of a cheerfully mad scientist
(Walken) and sherry-sipping housewife (Ms. Spacek), 1962 style.
Once he comes above ground and meets a hard-boiled Ms. Silverstone,
it's clear that Fraser is once again a film's true ingenu, doing
the wide-eyed hunk thing that has become his specialty. He does it
a lot better in ``Gods and Monsters,'' but this comedy is still
lighthearted fun (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (STAR)  &UR; ``CENTRAL STATION,''  &LR; starring Fernanda Montenegro,
Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles
(R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless
older woman crosses paths with an orphaned boy. There's plenty of
room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles' film is all
in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then
embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's
hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings great
tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey.
Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's
very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``EIGHT MILLIMETER,''  &LR; starring Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix,
James Gandolfini, Myra Carter and Catherine Keener. Directed by
Joel Schumacher (R, 120 minutes). This thriller delves into the
perverse underworld of the pornography business, shocking audiences
with the realization that sex and violence can be so dull. Cage,
seriously miscast, plays a private detective and devoted family man
who is suddenly, to his horror, drawn into the realm of porn.
Naturally, this is where the film wanted to be even when its
opening scenes were stuck in suburban Pennsylvania. But the story's
parade of New York and Hollywood sleazeballs fails to deliver
either engaging drama or heartfelt kinks. Phoenix is
scene-stealingly good in a sidekick's role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (STAR)  &UR; ``LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,''  &LR;  starring
Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Sting, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones
and Nick Moran. Directed by Guy Ritchie (R, 106 minutes). Not since
``The Usual Suspects'' has there been such an oversupply of cool
macho schemers in a single film. And they're served up with a
quick, tart economy that bespeaks the filmmaker's background making
videos and commercials _ actually an advantage, for a change.
There's not much beneath the surface here; what's most entertaining
is Ritchie's droll, hard-boiled storytelling and the rogue's
gallery of a cast that he has assembled. All the film need do is
juggle assorted miscreants and four separate gangs who,
figuratively speaking, can't shoot straight (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE,''  &LR;  starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright
Penn and Paul Newman. Directed by Luis Mandoki (PG-13, 110
minutes). Nicholas Sparks' best-selling novel, about a lonely,
sensitive man who sends a message out to sea and the lonely,
beautiful woman who finds it, is now a long and soggy film. Kevin
Costner crosses the line from teasingly laconic to stodgy and seems
as likely to have written ``Bleak House'' as the love letter in
question. Robin Wright Penn makes an appealing heroine, but there's
not much room for real emotion in a film with the tenor of a
commercial for hazelnut-flavored coffee. As the hero's crusty old
father, Newman steals what's left of the show (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``MY FAVORITE MARTIAN,''  &LR; starring Christopher Lloyd, Jeff
Daniels and Ray Walston. Directed by Donald Petrie (PG, 88
minutes). Pixilated pixels and other up-to-the-minute moviemaking
magic manage the neat feat of turning the big-screen, resurrected
``My Favorite Martian'' into an amiable family entertainment. In
this updated version of the 1960s CBS sitcom, Jeff Daniels as Tim
O'Hara (now a television newsman rather than a newspaper reporter)
and Christopher Lloyd as the visitor from another planet take over
the roles played by Bill Bixby and Ray Walston. In one of the happy
and logical little jokes that lend a disarming charm to the comedy,
Walston turns up once again in a welcome guise as government
bloodhounds set out to capture the Martian. But a good deal of the
fun in this tale is provided by Zoot, his high-spirited polymorphic
space suit (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``OCTOBER SKY,''  &LR; starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, Chris
Owen and Natalie Canaday. Directed by Joe Johnston (PG, 100
minutes). By far the most moving scenes here are home movie
snippets, circa 1957, that show the real people on whom the film's
characters are based. Otherwise, despite being closely based on a
best-selling memoir (``Rocket Boys'') by the NASA engineer Homer
Hickam Jr., this earnest, nostalgic film has a way of seeming too
good to be true. The film's simplicity is appealing, as is
Gyllenhaal in the central role of a boy in a West Virginia coal
mining town who becomes obsessed with rocketry. But the story,
filled with father-son conflict and down-in-the-ground versus
up-in-the-sky contrasts, often follows a familiar trajectory
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``PAYBACK,''  &LR; starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry. Directed by
Brian Helgeland (R, 110 minutes). In this inept, excessively
sadistic film-noir spoof adapted from the same Richard Stark novel
(``The Hunter'') that inspired the 1967 genre classic ``Point
Blank,'' Gibson is a thief named Porter who retaliates with a
vengeance after an attempt on his life. Determined to recover
$70,000 that was stolen from him by a double-crossing partner in
crime, he works his way up the pecking order of a crime syndicate,
brutally dispatching all who stand in his way. The hard-boiled
dialogue is ludicrous, the storytelling clunky, the acting fair to
awful, the gore ankle deep. Credit the star with being able to keep
a straight face through this loathsome mess (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (STAR)  &UR; ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,''  &LR; starring Joseph Fiennes,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench.
Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily
literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only
gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as
Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into
razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his ``Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine whatever it likes about
the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad
yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile this
tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater
fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and
has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo and Juliet,''
glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous
duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring
performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (STAR)  &UR; ``TANGO,''  &LR; starring Miguel Angel Sola. Written and
directed by Carlos Saura. Cinematography by Vittorio Storaro
(PG-13, 100 minutes). A thrilling display of tango heat and
virtuosity. And it's no slight to the actors who play lovers to say
that the dancing here is steamier than any kiss. In his most
electrifying dance film Saura offers transfixingly beautiful
glimpses of the dance and the great range of emotions it can
conjure. Storaro's dazzlingly fluid cinematography captures all the
nuances this material demands. Everyone in the film is utterly
consumed by tango fever; audiences will be, too (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE THIN RED LINE,''  &LR; starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin,
Nick Nolte, Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Terrence
Malick (R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge,
drifting war epic loosely derived from James Jones' Guadalcanal
novel, it's viscerally clear that Malick is back. The exquisite,
oddly detached visual style that made ``Badlands'' and ``Days of
Heaven'' the most beautiful films of the 1970s is instantly
apparent here, even if the narrative vagueness and brooding
voice-overs are also familiar. The film sprawls, gets lost and
occasionally delivers visual poetry, the kind that could have been
greatly helped by tighter editing. Bottom line: No one who admired
Malick's early work should miss this. But those expecting anything
simple will not find it here (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``20 DATES,''  &LR; starring Myles Berkowitz. Directed by Berkowitz
(R, 88 minutes). The filmmaker's gimmick is to make a film about
dating. His goal: To go out with 20 different women, get them on
camera by any means necessary and promise to fall in love with one
before the experiment is over. Berkowitz, pesty and proud of it,
has absorbed enough of Jerry Seinfeld and Garry Shandling to create
a diffident, nit-picking, sitcom-ready persona. But whenever his
film establishes a playful mood, it's liable to do something to
make you squirm. Crassness and mock candor aren't all that funny
(unless they're coming from Albert Brooks, whose ``Real Life''
paved the way for this). And discovering that cheese makes
Berkowitz constipated, or that one of his dates disappoints him by
not looking enough like Jessica Rabbit, is more than you need to
know (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``200 CIGARETTES,''  &LR; starring Paul Rudd, Kate Hudson, Ben
Affleck, Janeane Garofalo and Courtney Love. Directed by Risa
Bramon Garcia (R, 102 minutes). This contrived but cheery party
movie marks the feature directing debut of a well-known casting
director. And in making her film, Ms. Garcia does what she does
best: cast. A group of bright young players is brought together for
a largely plotless New Year's Eve, rambling around a colorfully
evoked East Village, circa 1981. Essentially just a set of
interwoven skits, this comedy still makes good use of the actors
noted above, along with Casey Affleck as a nice-guy punk, Dave
Chappelle as a cabbie full of advice and Martha Plimpton as a
hopeless hostess. Ms. Hudson, who is Goldie Hawn's daughter and has
her mother's grin and giggle, makes an adorable debut despite
spending part of the movie with dog excrement on her coat (Maslin).

<P>
   &UR; RICHARD LESTER RETROSPECTIVE. &LR;  Hip, free-wheeling and blessed
with an irreverent comic spirit, Richard Lester burst on the
filmmaking scene in 1959 with ``The Running, Jumping, Standing
Still Film,'' an 11-minute short with Peter Sellers and Spike
Milligan. In the 1960s, Lester made ``A Hard Day's Night'' and
``Help!'' both starring the Beatles, as well as ``The Knack ... and
How to Get It'' and ``How I Won the War,'' with John Lennon. Now
Lester is the subject of a retrospective at the American Museum of
the Moving Image that concludes this weekend with four of his
films. The attractions Saturday are ``The Bed Sitting Room''
(1969), with Rita Tushingham, Milligan, Peter Cook and Dudley
Moore, at 2 p.m; and the autumnal romance ``Robin and Marian''
(1976) with Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn at 4:30. Sunday brings
not only ``Petulia'' (1968) at 2 p.m. and ``A Funny Thing Happened
on the Way to the Forum'' (1966) at 4 but also discussions after
each by Tony Walton, who designed the films for the director.
Admission to the series at the museum, 34-12 36th St., at 35th
Avenue, Astoria, Queens, is $8.50 for adults, $5.50 for people over
65 and students with ID, $4.50 for young people from 5 to 18 and
free to children under 4. Information: (718) 784-0077 (Van Gelder).

OUT OF INDIA: HISTORY AND BEAUTY IN A COLONIAL CONTEXT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By VICTORIA GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before Indian independence, some Britons seemed to
think that Queen Victoria had acquired the subcontinent almost by
default. After all, the East India Company had taken direct control
of 60 percent of India and indirect control of most of the rest by
the mid-19th century. In 1857, the Indians finally rebelled. The
Great Rebellion, also known as the Indian Mutiny, ensued; British
firepower won; the company failed, and what was the Crown to do but
step in?
</P>
<P>
   Victoria was fascinated by the jewel in her crown, and so were
her subjects. Photographs show the Queen at table with Indian
manservants standing by, looking suitably foreign and imposing;
pictures of the Queen being served by representatives of her
largest colony must have been a matter of some pride to the
populace. She also sent British artists abroad to paint the newest
members of her realm.
</P>
<P>
   But photography was the great recorder of the age and the medium
of choice in a land that not only entranced and enriched the
British but also bewildered them by never being quite what it
seemed.
</P>
<P>
   You can see more than 100 photographs, mostly from India,
ranging from daguerreotypes to silver prints to hand-painted
portraits, in ``Re-Orientations: Photography from South Asia,
1845-1920'' at Sepia International and the Alkazi Collection in
Manhattan's Chelsea area. Both shows run through April 24.
</P>
<P>
   This space, which opened last month, is a highly unusual
combination of museum and commercial gallery. The Alkazi
Collection, more than 40,000 photographs of South Asia, belongs to
Ebrahim Alkazi, an Indian who was director of the National School
of Drama and of the Asian Theater Institute in New Delhi for 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 he founded the Center for International Contemporary
Arts in New York, which closed in 1992. His photographs and a
research library are available to scholars at this space, and
lectures, films and publications are planned. The exhibition space,
with close to 2,000 square feet, will have one or two not-for-sale
historical exhibitions drawn from the collection each year, plus
several commercial shows of established and emerging artists.
</P>
<P>
   Photography reached India less than a year after its invention
in 1839. By 1865, an exhibition there attracted thousands of
photographs, both amateur and professional, from all parts of the
country. ``Re-Orientations'' includes superb works by foreigners
and Indians alike, from Samuel Bourne's 1869 photograph of
exuberantly rearing horses on a temple facade to Johnson and
Hoffmann's debonair portrait of the boy Maharajah of Jodhpur to
anonymous hand-painted portraits of men with rambunctious beards.
</P>
<P>
   Not every image reaches this level, and there's a fair amount of
material of more historical than esthetic interest. But the show
has a broader target than mere beauty; the catalog and wall texts
excerpted from it try to place the imagery within the context of
British dominion and domination. This is illuminating, especially
for those not thoroughly versed in Indian history. The ideas are
provocative; the photographs do not always bear them out as
thoroughly as they might.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a wall text reads: ``The rebellion was the first
instance when the camera was used as a political instrument to
assert the authority of the ruling power and to proclaim its
triumph to the world at large. Coming as it did soon after
Britain's loss of its American colonies, the propagation of
imperial success in India was important as a booster of morale.''
</P>
<P>
   If this claim is correct, it makes the British the originators
of one of the more insidious uses of photography. Looking at
photographs of destruction _ Felice Beato's pictures of the dead in
the rebellion, not shown in ``Re-Orientations,'' were the most
grisly images of war victims to date _ as part of a political
program reflects up-to-date thinking about photography. It is
especially intriguing here, for just two years earlier British
pictures of the Crimean War were at least partially designed as
government propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs of destruction during the rebellion and of British
retribution for it may have done exactly what this text suggests,
but it is hard to know how two lovely pictures of an Indian fort,
apparently intact, contributed to the effort. Then, too, pictures
of wartime damage tend to get tangled in double messages of victory
and viciousness. George Barnard's photographs of the South in ruins
after the American Civil War bear, at least in our time, a mixed
message about the Northern conquest.
</P>
<P>
   But today, as images are re-evaluated and the question of who
controls them rethought, it is possible to read many of the travel
photographs of the 19th century as exercises in colonial power. The
attitude is: We own that rich or beautiful or exotic land (or else
we ought to), and we are clearly superior to those people, charming
as they may be, and are providing them the beneficent guidance of
our highly developed civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the photographs of the celebrations of 1877, when
Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India; of 1903, when Edward VII
was proclaimed Emperor, and of 1911, when King George V and Queen
Mary were the first British monarchs to visit the country, were
intended to underline the majesty, pomp and authority of the
sovereigns. That's what coronations and entries into cities always
have been about, and the camera merely has provided an economical
way to record them and distribute the news.
</P>
<P>
   As the wall texts and catalog in ``Re-Orientations'' point out,
ethnography and anthropology were comparatively new sciences in the
late 19th century, and photographers fanned out across the fringe
lands in and around India to photograph the diversity of tribes and
races. The government moved in on this undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Canning, the first Viceroy of India, set in motion the
documentation of all the peoples of the subcontinent, apparently as
a souvenir for officials returning home, but by 1858 the Political
and Secret Department of the government of India had a vivid
interest in this undertaking and would eventually buy half the
published sets. Ethnographers, anthropologists, criminologists and
phrenologists had theories about facial and other physical features
that supported the notion of a superior white race; these kinds of
photographs bolstered such ideas and were sometimes taken with them
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pictures are important historically and sometimes
visually striking. When it came to photographing the local rulers,
some local photographers or at least some local artists may have
had the best of it.
</P>
<P>
   The painted portraits in this show, which can resemble Indian
miniatures much as American painted tintypes can mimic folk
paintings, are delicious, with faces and hands in black and white
and costumes in brilliant colors, or pearl necklaces painted atop
the gentlemen's very Western jackets and ties.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   India's monuments are dizzyingly varied and disconcertingly
breath-taking, and only the flinty-hearted or blind could fail to
admire an anonymous photographer's picture of marble inlays,
delicate as painted porcelain, in the Red Fort in Delhi or Colin
Murray's 1873 image of the Lake Palace in Udaipur, with its lilting
reflections and gentle mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Such photographs, generally made for military families, tourists
and stay-at-home British citizens, also constituted a large,
architectural and archeological survey of the country and
conceivably helped preserve the glories of India's history.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers also trekked into uncharted territories and made
the earliest pictures of the Tibetan Himalayas, including Everest.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot get to India soon, you could do worse than take a
peek at its history in photographs.  &QL;

DEARTH OF SNOW BRINGS A FLURRY OF EXPLANATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, March 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Tom Stoner checks his rain gauges and wind
instruments regularly. Regularly, that is, 50 or maybe 100 times a
day.
</P>
<P>
   What would you do, he wonders, if you were handicapped,
semiretired and an avid amateur weather-watcher? Wouldn't you take
lots of looks at your state-of-the-art digital system? After all,
it automatically records wind speeds and temperatures every 30
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The one phenomenon he needs assistance measuring is snowfall.
Stoner, who lives in Columbia County in upstate New York, uses a
motorized scooter to compensate for what multiple sclerosis has
done to his right leg and hand. Getting outside after a snow storm
is often problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My primary gauge for determining snow totals is known as a
wife, and a ruler,'' he muses, referring to the assistance his
wife, Mary, provides for measuring snowfall. ``Sometimes we have to
wait a couple of days for the snow to melt to read the actual water
content in our rain gauge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stoners were able to determine that a March 7 storm, the
most intense of this decidedly unsnowy winter, left a mere 5.9
inches of snow at his house. ``I pay attention to the weather
reports,'' he says. ``I know other places got a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure. Al Tedeschi, who lives outside the village of
Westerlo in Albany County, measured 12.1 inches of snowfall that
same day.
</P>
<P>
   And Joe Driscoll, near Lake Desolation in northwestern Saratoga
County, recorded 12.9 inches of snow. That increased his winter
total to 73.2 inches of snow, more than twice the 31.1 inches that
Stoner has measured some 75 miles to the southeast in Columbia
County.
</P>
<P>
   Between those two extremes are some undeniable truths:
</P>
<P>
   _ There are numerous microclimates within regions, and
snowstorms wallop some places while they gently massage others.
</P>
<P>
   A microclimate is a localized variation within a region. It is a
term that first came into use in the 1960s and has since been
regularly employed by meteorologists and forecasters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Topography more than any other factor determines and
influences specific microclimates, according to Michael Landin, a
meteorologist who teaches a course in weather forecasting at the
State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   _ There's no sure-fire way to predict where snow falls will be
heaviest, of course, but there are general rules that apply to the
Albany area, according to Richard ``Doc'' Taylor at the state
Department of Environmental Conservation. Taylor officially is an
air pollution meteorologist, but his pet project is keeping track
of regional snowfall accumulations, a task he has monitored like a
mad scientist for the past 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Stoner, Tedeschi and Driscoll are three of 80 volunteers in an
eight-county area who submit detailed daily reports every month to
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snowfall is pretty elevation-dependent throughout the
region,'' he explains. ``The Hudson Valley area almost always
receives the minimum totals for the season, and the Hilltowns and
farther north and west, like in Saratoga County, are where you're
going to get the most snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor loves snow, it should be noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a bum winter, a real bum winter,'' he mutters. ``I
get so sick of hearing people say they hate the snow. If you don't
like the snow, move to Florida or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor attributes this winter's low snow totals to the absence
of nor'easters, the pounding storms that develop off the Atlantic
Coast and move inland with a fury. He points to the storm in late
February that came up the coast and crippled Cape Cod, dumping a
foot of snow or more throughout much of New England, as a good
example of the typical weather pattern for this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no East Coast storms coming our way, plain and
simple,'' Taylor explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can throw out all kinds of climatological claims, La
Nina, what have you, but weather patterns develop and tend to lock
in for a period.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the major storms this winter have been coming out of the
Rockies and going out over the Great Lakes. The storm tracks have
been too far to the west for this area to receive much, if any,
snow, according to Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Eggleston, a regional climatologist at Cornell University
in Ithaca, is in charge of the New York State Snow Survey. Every
winter is unique, according to Eggleston, who believes the Albany
area can't be defined in terms of snow belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albany area gets storms from the west and the south, and
usually a combination of storms coming from those different
directions,'' he explains. ``Buffalo, on the other hand, doesn't
need a large storm to get significant snowfall because of the lake
effect. However, when Albany gets snow, it's usually from a
large-scale storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Eggleston knows firsthand how upstate New York's numerous
microclimates can produce dramatically different results. He was
unable to take calls on March 4 to discuss snow patterns because he
was snowed in at home in Ithaca, coping with a 10-inch dumping the
same day the Rochester area received two feet of snow. That same
day the Albany area received not even a dusting, as the storm moved
north toward Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have been the warmest decade in recorded history, he
noted, and during the past nine years the Albany area has
experienced what meteorologists call ``a lot of weather.'' Two
winters have been among the Top 10 snowiest, and three have been
among the Top 10 least snowy.
</P>
<P>
   Stoner pauses during a conversation to observe his gauges.
``Wow, we just had a 25-mile-an-hour wind gust out of the south,''
he notes.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that the folks at nearby Catamount Ski Center rue the
wimpy snow totals in their section of Columbia County, but he is
not a bit unhappy with how the winter of 1998-99 has unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody that bought a plow or a snowblower is upset because
they're not getting any work, but I don't miss it,'' Stoner says.
``I'm glad there's no frost on the ground; there's robins out here
flying all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it snows I have a hard time getting out. When the ground
is slippery, I don't get too far with MS. You end up on the
ground.''

   NEW YORK _ When Peter Serkin was told during a recent interview
that in a publicity brochure for the Chamber Music Society of
Lincoln Center's performance on Sunday afternoon of ``Des Canyons
aux Etoiles'' (``From the Canyons to the Stars'') by Messiaen, he
is described as the project's ``soloist'' and ``guiding spirit,''
the self-effacing pianist gulped, blushed and said, ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   Soloist, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Though this ecstatic work, inspired by Messiaen's trip to Bryce
Canyon and Cedar Breaks in Utah, is scored for 44 instruments,
including solo trombone and all manner of percussion, the daunting
solo piano part dominates and drives the music. At nearly 100
minutes, ``Des Canyons aux Etoiles'' (``From the Canyons to the
Stars'') is, in effect, the largest work for piano and orchestra
ever written.
</P>
<P>
   But guiding spirit? ``I thought that was the composer,'' Serkin
said, adding, ``All that means is that I approached the society
members and asked them if they would be interested in this very
great work that has such a deep connection to their home, Alice
Tully Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it does. It was commissioned by Alice Tully herself for a
performance at the hall to celebrate the American Bicentennial.
Messiaen wrote it with the hall in mind, right down to the number
of instruments he felt could be accommodated on its stage. The
premiere was given in late 1974 by Musica Aeterna, with Yvonne
Loriod, the composer's wife, playing the piano part. Serkin was
there and decided on the spot that he would play it some day.
</P>
<P>
   Serkin's slightly embarrassed reaction at being called a guiding
spirit is in keeping with his character. The 51-year-old pianist
has always had a keen interest in new music. This is especially
notable given the degree to which he was steeped in the European
classical tradition as a child. His father was the eminent pianist
Rudolf Serkin, and his mother, Irene, who died in December, a
trained string player, was the daughter of the renowned German
violinist Adolf Busch. Both parents expected young Peter to
maintain the family reverence for the great masters.
</P>
<P>
   But for Serkin, his interest in new music is a natural extension
of his interest in all music, and he resists any suggestion that he
is engaged in a mission, or is a champion of anything. The story of
his involvement with Messiaen's music is a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to perform Messiaen's ``Quatour pour la Fin du
Temps'' (``Quartet for the End of Time'') brought Serkin together
in 1973 with three friends _ the clarinetist Richard Stoltzman, the
violinist Ida Kavafian and the cellist Fred Sherry _ to form the
contemporary music ensemble group Tashi, which for many years
commissioned new music, toured and made records, often appearing in
T-shirts, dashikis and other emblems of the counter culture. But
the Messiaen quartet, which they performed over 150 times, Serkin
estimates, was Tashi's signature work.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Tashi's founding, Serkin was immersed in
Messiaen's ``Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant Jesus'' (``20
Contemplations on the Infant Jesus''), a set of 20 pieces for solo
piano of astounding difficulty that oscillate between states of
meditative timelessness and wildly exuberant spirituality. The
pieces were not necessarily intended to be performed complete. But
after working on them individually for four years, Serkin played
the entire two-and-one-half-hour work from memory on a tour in 25
cities during the 1974-75 season.
</P>
<P>
   Most pianists, having mastered such a colossal work, would
continue to play it prominently, milking it for critical kudos and
presenting themselves as advocates of Messiaen. But, having
explored the music extensively, Serkin simply moved on. For over 15
years, he played no Messiaen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't discarding the music,'' he said. ``I still loved it
and respected it immensely. I just wasn't into playing Messiaen's
music as I had been in earlier years. My interest shifted
elsewhere. I can't help that. I'd just as soon be that way, and not
doggedly champion this or that composer.''
</P>
<P>
   Serkin's shift from Messiaen was no different, he said, from
what goes on for him with the standard repertory all the time. For
example, Beethoven was a staple of his musical diet when he was
young. But when he got involved with Tashi, he didn't look at the
Beethoven sonatas for 10 years, he said. Now he is completely
enthralled by them again.
</P>
<P>
   And now Serkin is again engrossed with Messiaen. What brought
him back? ``I must say, his death was part of it,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Messiaen's death in 1992 had initially escaped him.
Serkin was at home in his apartment in Manhattan when Messiaen's
``Transfiguration,'' an enormous work for vocalists and orchestra,
came on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't heard it in years and was very moved,'' he said.
``When it was over, the announcer said that Messiaen had died the
day before. It got me thinking about him again.''
</P>
<P>
   What also rekindled his interest was ``Des Canyons aux
Etoiles.'' In 1994, when Reinbert de Leeuw, the Dutch composer and
conductor who was then the director of contemporary music
activities at the Tanglewood Music Center in Massachusetts, asked
Serkin, who is on the Tanglewood faculty, to perform the work with
the student orchestra under his direction, Serkin readily accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The work is structured in 12 parts, grouped into three large
sections. And it takes the listeners on an ascent from the canyons
to the stars to a vision of heaven beyond. Songs of birds with
leaping, jagged melodic lines are interspersed with sustained
harmonic passages, like celestial chorales, and wildly inventive
instrumental writing.
</P>
<P>
   The piece is scored for 44 individual instruments. To assemble
an ensemble to perform the work is a musical and logistic
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the kind of piece you ask your manager to offer to a
few orchestras,'' Serkin said. ``We actually tried, but, as I could
have predicted, we had no success.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he approached the Chamber Music Society, which is
celebrating its 25th anniversary season and was looking for special
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing to perform this work for 44 players meant expanding the
notion of what chamber music is, said David Shifrin, the
clarinetist who is the society's artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he explained, ``when I'm asked to define chamber music,
I usually say the bottom line is a work with one player per part.
So this one fits.''
</P>
<P>
   Serkin is excited to be playing Messiaen again, and recording it
as well. RCA Victor has just released a splendid disk of two
Messiaen works featuring Serkin: ``Visions de l'Amen'' for two
pianos (with Yuji Takahashi) and a nearly 30-minute solo work, ``La
Rousserolle Effarvatte,'' from Messiaen's catalog of birds, which
evokes and transforms birdcalls into bracingly contemporary piano
music.
</P>
<P>
   Serkin notes some irony in the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of decades ago, when I was so interested in new
music, I couldn't interest anybody in the recording business in
it,'' he said. ``Now that I am coming around and want to record
Beethoven and Mozart sonatas, it's hard to find anyone interested
in that. It's weird.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 EASTON, Pa.: ... status quo.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Leopards never wavered from their objective. They
came out of the gate 6-1, their best start in 13 years. They scared
nationally ranked Purdue until succumbing in the final minute _ at
Purdue. They cleaned up in the Patriot League to the tune of a 10-2
record. And last Friday they scaled the summit, joining George
Davidson's '57 Leopard crew that lost by 4 points to Syracuse in
the NCAA East semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from George Davidson Thursday,'' O'Hanlon told
the press after Friday's game. ``He told me it had been too long,
that it was about time the team goes to the NCAAs. I thought it was
a good omen when he told me his team couldn't use the gym the day
before their big game, just like us, because of a sock hop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, Coach,'' asked Cole, ``what's a sock hop?''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind, kid. All that matters now is getting ready for the
Big Dance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Leopards are in the big time, but they are not of the big
time. The morning after learning of their first-round assignment _
or sentence _ they begin assembling intelligence on Miami. It's
sort of like preparing in a closet with the lights out. No
Hurricane game tape will be available until tomorrow; for the time
being, the coaches have to rely on telephoned reports from their
network of contacts who have seen Miami and on what they remember
from the many TV appearances by the nation's 10th-ranked team.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Hanlon wastes no time lamenting the lack of information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be prepared,'' he promises. ``We've still got three days
to work on the nuances of our own offense. That's just as
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, any little edge is welcome. Scanning the Hurricane
roster, assistant coach Pat Brogan notes that one of the players,
guard Todd Manuel, was recruited by Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can get him to transfer here before Friday,'' says
O'Hanlon, ``and get some information on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Leopards have access to their own floor for their Monday
afternoon practice, their first work in uniform since Friday's
Patriot clincher. The court is ringed by a wagon train of red
canvas rollers so that the track team's practice on the adjacent
oval won't be an intrusion. But clearly, the Leopards are
distracted. Their minds seem to be on the spotlight, not the task
at hand.
</P>
<P>
   During the huddle at midcourt preceding the day's drills,
O'Hanlon announces that they'll be facing Miami at 7:40 Friday _
prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think they'll show much of our game on TV?'' asks one of
the players, mindful that CBS doesn't dwell on blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon turns that fear on its ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Miami is able to stick with us,'' he tells the Leopards,
``then CBS will probably keep showing the game.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, the Leopards are accorded the closest thing
to a coronation Easton has to offer _ a media luncheon at Larry
Holmes' Ringside Restaurant. While the topic at the dais is
basketball, the proprietor of the establishment, still chasing
megafights though years removed from his heavyweight championship
heyday, dines quietly in a back corner with three friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I follow the team,'' says Holmes. ``I watch the games on TV.
And we have the media luncheon for them every Tuesday. I'm happy
for them. It seems like our area never gets much play. People never
think about this itty-bitty place.''
</P>
<P>
   Might he be on hand in Boston when Lafayette _ and Easton _ gets
a piece of the limelight?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not out of town promoting a fight in Vegas or
someplace, I'll probably go up there,'' says Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   One of his dining companions chimes in, ``If somebody doesn't
offer him $4 million or $5 million to fight someplace that night,
he'll be in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Tuesday's practice, the Leopards again cram into
the assistants' office for their first look at Miami on film. This
time the accommodations are a bit roomier; Bieg has an English
test, Klaus a retro deisgn exam in engineering, so neither is here.
</P>
<P>
   Such concessions to academics are standard practice at a
nonscholarship school where the emphasis is on student more than
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time,'' O'Hanlon says of missing players. ``At some
schools, guys can go to sumer school to lighten the load during the
season, but we're a financial aid school, so summer school tuition
isn't picked up. You've got to take care of your workload during
the school year. This weekend will be the first time we've missed a
full day of class all year.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon spends about 15 minutes reviewing the Hurricanes'
fast-break offense and pressure defense, focusing on deadly weapons
such as Hemsley and James. Then he dismisses the Leopards with this
advisory: ``Remember to bring your gear with you tomorrow. We'll be
leaving for Boston right after practice.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't tell them to pack their track shoes, but it might not
be a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon has decided that the team will travel to Boston by bus,
not to spare the expense but the logistical nuisances. He figures
when airport tie-ups are factored in, the scenic route will take
only about an hour longer, ``and this way, we can go door to
door.''
</P>
<P>
   The players' reaction is mixed. Bieg hates to fly, ``so I'm glad
the regional is close enough that we can drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Klaus wouldn't mind a little glamour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see these big-time teams on TV arriving at the site and
getting off a plane,'' he says. ``That would be kind of neat.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a red-carpet sendoff. The players have a half-hour
after Wednesday's practice to hustle into travel mode. Meanwhile,
the assistants handle the catering. Brogan provides the main
course, making an emergency call to Morici's Pizza for ``15 pies _
in 25 minutes.'' Mike Burden and Mike McKee feverishly transfer
12-packs of soda and ice tea from shopping bags into a cooler. They
they scurry off to the WaWa convenience mart for the appetizers,
chips and pretzels. When they return, the players are boarding the
bus, filing past the farewell party _ the bus driver's wife, who
gets autographs as the Leopards climb on. The big contingent of
some 350 supporters won't be with the team until game day.
</P>
<P>
   The local TV station from Allentown does a remote from the
sidewalk outside the bus. When his interview is finished, Bieg _
who at the start of the season caused a bulletin-board commotion
around the league when he was quoted as saying there was no reason
the Leopards shouldn't dominate the Patriot _ announces, ``I told
'em we're going all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the way to Boston,'' says O'Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
   But first comes a stop two blocks into the journey for the
pizzas, which are quickly devoured by the ravished troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ridin' in style,'' guard Mike Homer yells from the back.
</P>
<P>
   In tranquility, too. The 5 1/2-hour ride across New York and
Connecticut is relatively quiet, save for the excited chirping of
O'Hanlon's children, 6-year-old Timmy and 5-year-old Grace. The
players stretch across the aisle to grab some sleep, listen to
headphones, or partake of the evening's entertainment on the
overhead monitors: a ``Seinfeld'' medley, ``What About Bob?'' and
``Kingpin.'' Apparently, ``Hoosiers'' was rented out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we lost?'' Timmy saks as the bus turns on to Interstate 84
in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   No _ until the traveling party reaches Boston, where the bus
pulls onto Commonwealth Avenue instead of Beacon Street. ``He gets
lost in Boston all the time,'' says one passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Once the mistake has been corrected, the Leopards get a look at
the landmark they consider the most revered in this historic city _
Fenway Park, silhouetted against the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   But by now, they're too tired to savor the sighting, and when
they arrive at their hotel at midnight, most decline Brogan's offer
to drop by O'Hanlon's room for more pizza, the foodstuff of
champions.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon carries his sleeping daughter, wrapped in a blanket, up
to their room, and most of the players head directly to theirs. But
they can still muster some enthusiasm for the new surroundings. ``I
like Boston,'' says Klaus. ``It's a city town. That Beantown aura
and attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, after a team breakfast buffet at the hotel, the
Leopards are off for a two-hour workout at their designated
practice site, Boston College. They are immediately awed by an
exotic sight. ``Hey, look at this,'' Guy yells from the balcony.
``It's a hockey rink.''
</P>
<P>
   But their focus is on the main stage _ the FleetCenter, which
they won't see until later in the night, and then only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a 7:10 practice for 50 minutes,'' says McKee. ``Then a
20-minute shootaround Friday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That' it?'' says Brogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very efficient,'' says O'Hanlon, the NCAA veteran.
``They don't waste time. After 20 minutes, it's `OK, time's up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the players are thrilled just to step onto the court,
especially when they find out it's the fabled parquet, sans rats,
transferred from the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something special just knowing all the great players
who've been out there,'' says Ehlers. ``It's the most famous floor
in basketball history. Maybe we can make a little history on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafayette, you are here.

LEOPARDS CLAW THEIR WAY TO FIRST TOURNAMENT SINCE 1957 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTON, Pa. _ The three Chinese tattoos scrolled along Tyson
Whitfield's right arm proclaim that he fears no man. No such
announcement is necessary to reveal that shooting a basketball
doesn't bother him, either.
</P>
<P>
   His utter lack of inhibition _ or conscience _ is on implausible
display just before the halftime buzzer in the Patriot League final
last Friday at Kirby Field House. Bucknell's Jake Ramage has just
drilled a 3-pointer, and favored Lafayette, host Lafayette,
regular-season champion Lafayette, seems destined to carry a
deflating 5-point deficit into the locker room, the nadir of a half
littered with mistakes and jitters.
</P>
<P>
   But as the clock approaches zero, Whitfield pulls up with the
ball in front of press row, three-quarters of the court from the
Bucknell basket, and lets fly a jumper. His apparent afterthought
of a missile banks in smartly off the glass, and Whitfield turns to
the Zoo Crew, the Lafayette loons overflowing the stands behind the
press table. He stands there motionless, expressionless, as if to
say, ``Well, what else did you expect?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he casually joins the parade of his revivified teammates
exiting the court.
</P>
<P>
   When they return, the Leopards are a new breed of cat. They claw
their way to a 67-63 victory that triggers a stampede onto the
court by the Zoo Crew, which threatens to engulf the ESPN cameras
on hand for the occasion and officially trumpets Lafayette's first
trip to the NCAA tournament since 1957, back before Larry Holmes
bought up Easton.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield's 71-foot bomb is immortalized as one of ESPN's Shots
of the Week and CNN's Play of the Week. It also serves as the
launching point for one of the longest shots in the 64-team NCAA
field, Lafayette, and the greatest week in Leopard basketball
history.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest men on campus are fighting a losing battle for elbow
space in one of the smaller rooms in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Contorting themselves into forms they perhaps didn't think the
human body was capable of assuming, the Leopards are shoehorned
onto every desktop, into every chair, along every centimeter of
carpet available. You couldn't fit another big toe in the room; the
three assistant coaches who have territorial rights to this office
are forced into the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Hoops are big on campus; egalitarianism is bigger. This is a
tiny school of some 2,000 students who are here at the confluence
of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers to partake of Lafayette's
reputation for academic excellence. There is no such thing as an
athletic scholarship; even if you can stick the J, you're entitled
to no more financial aid than a fellow freshman who can read a
blueprint. The philosophy was set forth by the school's namesake,
the Marquis de Lafayette, in his landmark 18th-century treatise,
``Declaration of the Rights of Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The marquis probably was thinking of the Lafayette gym when he
wrote it, because it seems everyone has equal rights to this place.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Leopards may be the toast of College Hill _ and are
less than two hours from bringing the school another sliver of
national attention when the NCAA brackets are announced _ they
don't have dibs on the facilities. When a Rusted Root concert was
booked onto the Kirby floor the previous Thursday, it meant there
was no room for the basketball team to practice on its court on the
eve of its biggest game to date.
</P>
<P>
   And since a volleyball tournament has commandeered Kirby for the
weekend, that means Mack Lounge _ with spacious seating that could
accommodate even a basketball player's physique _ is off-limits to
the team this Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   So the Leopards crane their necks to see the small television
perched in a corner and listen intently as head coach Fran O'Hanlon
gently brings them back to earth from Friday's magic carpet ride.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking barely above a whisper, O'Hanlon dissects the errors
that marred the early going against Bucknell.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon, 50, is a teacher, not a tyrant. This film review,
while emphasizing the negative, is a dialogue, not a harangue.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the profile of the team we're going to face Thursday or
Friday?'' O'Hanlon asks. ``Ross?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Up-tempo,'' says senior forward Ross Harms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' says O'Hanlon. ``So how do we control the game? On
offense or defense?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both,'' ventures guard Brian Ehlers, the Patriot Player of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, obviously,'' says O'Hanlon. ``But especially offense. We
set the tempo of the game by controlling the ball. Our shots, our
decision-making, have to be better than they were at the start
against Bucknell.''
</P>
<P>
   That's enough of this tutorial. The Leopards are about to learn
their NCAA fate, and O'Hanlon believes they've absorbed as much as
they're going to, given the distractions at hand. So he dismisses
the class, sending them off to the student union for the pizza
party that will serve as the appetizer for the tournament selection
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll practice at 4 tomorrow,'' he says as the players depart.
``If we can get the court.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Leopards are justifiably proud about ending the
second-longest NCAA Tournament drought in history, leaving
Harvard's 53-year record of futility unchallenged. They take great
satisfaction in knowing that they have resurrected the program from
the 2-25 shambles that preceded O'Hanlon's arrival four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But they are also realists. They know that despite a 22-7 record
and league championship, they are bottom-feeders in the NCAA pool.
CBS's ``Selection Show'' Sunday evening reveals as much. The
Leopards are Boston-bound, seeded 15th and last in their East
subregional, would-be first-round fodder for No. 2 seed Miami
Friday night at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon betrays no emotion when the seedings and pairings are
announced; he doesn't want this to be the zenith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some teams are just happy to get there,'' he says. ``I
don't want to stop playing after one more game.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. O'Hanlon won't be overwhelmed by the NCAA
trappings, and he'll make darn sure his team isn't, either.
</P>
<P>
   He is the quintessential gym rat, a Philadelphia kid from Wilt
Chamberlain's neighborhood who was a flamboyant guard on
Villanova's 1970 NCAA quarterfinalist, played a year with the ABA
Miami Floridians, then followed the bouncing ball around the world.
By his rough count, he has played or coached in more than 55
countries.
</P>
<P>
   He has coached a high school champion in Philadelphia. He has
coached women at Temple. He has coached NCAA tournament teams at
Penn, where he spent six years as an assistant to boyhood buddy
Fran Dunphy.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, he has been sustained by a puckish sense of
humor and a decided lack of pretension or panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``His coaching style is not to rant and rave,'' says Lafayette
athletic director Eve Atkinson, who four years ago entrusted
O'Hanlon with a program that ranked 305th among 306 Division 1
schools, a sad demise since the days when Pete Carril played here
and Butch van Breda Kolff, Tom Davis, and Gary Williams coached
here. ``His style is thought-provoking. There is not a better
professor of X's and O's.''
</P>
<P>
   Even during the dark days, the 7-20 debut season stigmatized by
a loss to Division 3 Swarthmore, the Leopards began to come
together under O'Hanlon. The lunch-bucket frontcourt _ Ted Cole,
Harms, and Dave Klaus, who refused to be dissuaded even when the
coaches discouraged him from trying out _ arrived and set a
gut-busting tone that has become the Leopards' trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers, the big gun, came aboard a year later. And last year
O'Hanlon found the missing link, Tim Bieg, the point guard he
needed to distribute the ball and hit the open shot.
</P>
<P>
   There were supplementary ingredients, too. Whitfield, last
season's Patriot League Rookie of the Year, brought his bravado and
microwave scoring bursts from Yakima, Wash. Reggie Guy supplied
relentless defense in the backcourt. Frank Barr, a 6-foot-11-inch
stringbean, transferred from Hofstra and gradually took over in the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   It became a 12-man ensemble, and O'Hanlon utilized every piece.
The Leopards went 11-17 in his second year, shared the Patriot
League regular-season title in 1998 before losing to Navy in the
tournament final, and this year ignored what could have been a
debacle.
</P>
<P>
   It began with the loss of 6-11 Romanian import Stefan Ciosici,
the 1998 Patriot Player of the Year, who wrecked his knee during
the summer. Rather than concede disaster, O'Hanlon chose to
downplay Ciosici's absence. ``We've got a system,'' he preached to
his team. ``And the system works.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were impediments. While two of the Leopards' Patriot
brethren, Holy Cross and Lehigh, chose to exercise the new league
option allowing athletic scholarships, Lafayette steadfastly
resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to dwell on what we don't have,'' shrugs O'Hanlon.
``That's a built-in excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he admitted to ``a lot of sleepless nights'' caused by
the administrative guillotine that threatened to come down on the
season: the possibility that Lafayette would downgrade to Division
3 in all sports. Not until halftime of the Jan. 16 game against
Army was it announced that an infusion of alumni dollars would
maintain the status quo.

EVANS BRINGS MATURITY TO GEORGE MASON ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Don't expect George Evans to be intimidated by anything
Cincinnati tries to throw his way today. Somehow the spector of a
full-court press or a double-team isn't quite as threatening as
facing the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been shot at,'' he shrugged. ``It's going to be kinda
hard to be intimidated (today).''
</P>
<P>
   The Colonial Athletic Association's Player of the Year and
postseason tournament MVP just completed his second season at
George Mason. He's also 27 years old and, among his basketball
credentials, is a listing on the All-Army team from 1996-97. He
averaged 40 points and 18 rebounds a game playing for a club team
in Aberdeen, Md., while finishing up what proved to be a seven-year
hitch for Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just took a different route than everyone else,'' shrugged
teammate Jason Miskiri. ``He jokes and plays around, probably more
than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has been around more than they have. This is a guy who
drove generals around in Belgium and who served in Somalia, Haiti,
and in Operation Desert Storm. He's got more than a few war
stories.
</P>
<P>
   There was the time at the end of Desert Storm when he was on
patrol with four others. Eight Iraqi soldiers, guns loaded, came up
from behind. The Iraqis didn't shoot. They surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hungry,'' Evans said. ``They wanted food. But to
have been that close to death. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   He also talked about serving in Haiti, where he saw people jump
into fires for food and living in cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had it bad,'' he said. ``It just goes to show you,
it's not as bad (here) as it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   He has perspective that no one else has. He has responsibilities
few have; his wife and 7-year-old daughter live in Florida, where
the mother has a job. They saw each other during vacations breaks.
It's not the way he'd like to live, but he understands the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about goals, and she's been supportive of me,'' Evans
said. ``It's kinda hard to ask her if I can get a couple (more)
weeks to play basketball in the tournament. She don't understand
that. But it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I thank God for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans is a native Virginian, having attended high school in
Portsmouth, where he once went navel-to-eyeball with a hot shot
named Alonzo Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was '88 or '89,'' Evans said. ``He was 6-10. I was 6-1 1/2
and played center. I still had to guard him. He dunked it every
time. So our strategy was to hold the ball. I think the final score
was 15-14. We lost.''
</P>
<P>
   He went into the service after high school and, playing at
Aberdeen, where the competition is mostly other Army bases, prep
schools, and junior varsity teams, he caught the eye of Paul
Westhead, then the coach at George Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Evans had never even heard of George Mason, founded 42 years ago
and located in Fairfax, Va. But Westhead, using persuasive powers
he was later unable to transfer to on-the-court success, convinced
Evans to come. Evans had never set foot on the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Westhead was relieved of his position _ he's now an
assistant to P.J. Carlesimo with the Golden State Warriors _ and
Jim Larranaga arrived from Bowling Green. One of the first phone
calls Larranaga made was to the 26-year-old Evans, who had signed a
national letter of intent with George Mason the previous fall.
</P>
<P>
   The question: Was Evans going to honor the letter of intent?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: No.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt there was a sign from God not to attend George Mason
because of the change,'' Larranaga said. ``We simply asked him if
he would give us some time to talk with him, get to know him, and
see if it was still a workable situation. So my staff and I
basically went about the task of re-recruiting him.''
</P>
<P>
   Larranaga saw Evans play while at Aberdeen and was impressed
with his ability and size. (Evans no longer was the 6-1 runt from
high school. He was now 6-7, 225.) He got Evans to visit the
campus, talk to the players, mingle with the students. Evans
decided he'd stay after all, with one provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me, `will I be treated the same as everybody else?'
He wanted to be an equal member of the team,'' Larranaga said. ``We
said, `yes, you'll live in the dormitory as a freshman and hang out
with the guys and other college students.''
</P>
<P>
   That was all Evans needed to hear. He was the conference rookie
of the year as a freshman, averaging 13.1 points and 8.1 rebounds.
George Mason won only nine games, but that was still more than
predicted. This year, they were picked to finish fourth in the CAA
by the Blue Ribbon Yearbook, but instead won the CAA title and
postseason tournament. The Patriots, 19-10 overall, bring a 10-game
winning streak into Friday's game with Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Evans averaged 17.8 points and 8.6 rebounds during the regular
season and then was a force in the tournament, averaging 15.3
points, 11.7 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks as the Patriots beat
American, UNC-Wilmington, and Old Dominion to continue their
magical run.
</P>
<P>
   They're big underdogs against Cincinnati, but they're used to
such status by now. After what Evans has been through, mere numbers
hardly faze him.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moderate to heavy rains will douse parts of the southern Plains
and lower Mississippi Valley Friday as a potent jet stream
disturbance, which Thursday spawned moderate rains over Southern
California, lifts increasingly moist air streaming rapidly
northward from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms will erupt near the Gulf Coast, where the warmest,
most humid air gathers during the day. Thunder will also occur in
the cooler air mass across northern Texas and the lower Mississippi
Valley, with a few of these storms producing hail.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate to heavy snows will fall along the Front Range of the
central Rockies as the developing low pressure system over the
southern Plains draws moist, cold winds up the sloping terrain.
Moderate to heavy snows will spread eastward across the central
Plains, with the heaviest accumulations likely falling on the high
plains across western Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   A batch of steady rain will fall in Oklahoma south of this area
of steady snow, with a narrow corridor of ice separating the snow
and rain areas. Precipitation will gradually spread eastward during
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, clouds circulating around a stalled low-pressure
system off the coast of Maine will spread across much of the
Northeast Friday, with patchy light snows and narrow bands of
accumulating snows in the mountains of Vermont, New Hampshire and
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some snow will spread southward toward the Catskills of New York
and the Berkshires of western Massachusetts. Patchy, light snow
will also occur over parts of the New England seaboard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Wrong-way Warm Front
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday morning, the National Weather Service at Gray,
Maine, canceled a winter weather advisory for snow and ice across
the state's northern tier as temperatures climbed above 32 degrees
in the wake of a wrong-way warm front. Unlike traditional warm
fronts which move from south to north, Thursday's warm front moved
southwest from the Canadian Maritimes as mild ocean air circulated
counterclockwise around a stalled low pressure system over the
Atlantic Ocean. The low had been stalled since the weekend after
its path was blocked by a high pressure system east of
Newfoundland. &QL;

UNDERDOG MIAMI RELISHES THE ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. _ His office is half the size of his
counterpart in football, Butch Davis. If he looks out the window,
he has a nice view of . . . the football practice field.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life at a school that has four national championships in
football and is re-tooling for another run.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not bother Leonard Hamilton. No, his vision goes
beyond the lush grass of the practice field. It goes beyond the
fence to a quadrant of two-story buildings that have housed
University of Miami students for the last couple of generations,
but will be torn down this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Hamilton sees what most people cannot. At least not
without some prompting.
</P>
<P>
   What the University of Miami baketball coach sees is the future.
He sees a state-of-the art $35 million arena called the Ryder
Center. He sees a building that will have 81 skyboxes, which he can
point to with pride when he brings recruits to a campus that keeps
adding first-class facilities.
</P>
<P>
   He also sees a challenge that would seem to be mind-boggling to
anyone who has paid even the slightest attention to Miami
basketball over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Hamilton, sitting in his office earlier this week,
can only laugh when someone talks about ``Cinderella Lafayette vs.
Miami'', which is the prime-time game in Friday tonight's first
round of the NCAA East Regional at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cinderella?'' said Hamilton, shaking his head. ``That's still
us. We have a long way to go yet. A long way.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the No. 2 seed in a region that contains top-ranked Duke,
the Hurricanes, who bring a 22-6 record into the game, can only
play that underdog card so long.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hamilton doesn't have the right to feel that way. When
he came to South Florida nine years ago, Miami was only five years
removed from a return to basketball after a 14-year absence.
University officials had dropped the program in 1971 for a variety
of reasons, the primary one being lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone noticed. Fewer people seemed to care.
</P>
<P>
   One person who did was former athletic director Sam Jankovich,
who knew that if Miami was to be regarded seriously by its peers,
it needed not only a basketball program, but a league to play in as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Using the power of the football team, which was just starting a
dynastic run that would include four national titles in 10 years,
Jankovich played power politics. Miami would be the foundation of a
newly formed Big East football league, if the Big East would take
the basketball team as a new member.
</P>
<P>
   When the Big East blinked, Miami was in and Jankovich was on his
next mission, getting an on-campus arena.
</P>
<P>
   Even in its best days, Miami basketball was an orphan. ``Some
games were played at Coral Gables High School,'' said AD Paul
Dee.``Others were at the Miami Beach Convention center. Some were
at Miami-Dade (Community College).'' Dee was able to push through
the last bit of funding, which should allow the ground to be broken
on the Ryder Center next fall.
</P>
<P>
   When Hamilton arrived in April 1990, the 'Canes were slowly
reestablishing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich, who had gone to Oklahoma State to find a football
coach in Jimmy Johnson, went back to Stillwater to hire Hamilton,
whose pedigree included 12 years as an assistant at Kentucky, as
well as a revival of the Oklahoma State program in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always dreamed about being a head coach,'' said Hamilton.
``But not at a well-heeled school like Kentucky or Duke. I needed
to be at a place that hadn't had a whole lot of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State had not had that in recent years, and Miami
certainly was hardly more than a blip on the radar screen in the
world of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton had all the ingredients Miami needed. He was young and
hungry. He was also comfortable at Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked it there,'' he said. ``I was starting to get
the kids I wanted and I was building something.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hamilton liked challenges. Always had. He was the first
black player at Gatson (N.C.) Community College. He was the first
black player at Tennessee-Martin. He was the first black coach in
the Ohio Valley Conference. He was the first black assistant coach
at Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   When Jankovich called, Hamilton and his wife, Claudette, took a
trip to Miami. ``My wife said that it was nice, but she knew I
wouldn't take the job,'' said Hamilton with a laugh. ``She took an
earlier flight back to Oklahoma. When she got home, she turned on
the television set, and I was accepting the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton says the building process, which has come from the
depths of an 0-18 season in the Big East in 1993-94, continues.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his protests that Miami is still the underdog, the
achievements of the past few years, including this year's
remarkable 15-3 run in the Big East (which included a pair of wins
over St. John's and a victory against the University of Connecticut
in Storrs) indicate an upward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw anyone able to clear as many hurdles as Leonard
and do it without getting discouraged,'' said Big East commissioner
Mike Tranghese. ``He's always focused on what he has, rather than
what he doesn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee, who rewarded Hamilton with a five-year extension after the
0-18 season, says he sees the progress not only in the basketball,
but in the quality of people Hamilton has brought in. ``No Prop
48's (Miami does not take them),'' said Dee. ``And Leonard is on
top of them on everything, from going to school to staying out of
trouble. We've got the right guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton feels he is in the right job. ``We've got a belief in
what we are doing,'' said Hamilton, who has recruited overacheivers
who came to Miami not as McDonald's All-Americans, but as
All-America wannabes. ``We feel we're doing things right, so why
change? The kids we get are working harder and doing good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton knows the next few weeks will be crucial in the
perception of Miami basketball. Win a few games and suddenly the
Hurricanes move to a higher level. Lose early and the 'Canes
quickly fade from view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he says with a smile and shrug, ``we haven't
accomplished a thing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hamilton came back from practice the other day, a note was
pinned on his office door. ``ESPN satelite feed, 7:30, John
Saunders, Dick Vitale. Don't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was this after Davis was asked about the 'Canes'
success in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we want,'' said Davis with a straight face, ``is a
football team our basketball team can be proud of.''

   KOSOVO-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Over the fierce objections of the
Clinton administration, the House moved ahead on Thursday with
debate over whether U.S. troops should be sent to Kosovo as part of
a NATO peacekeeping force should a settlement be reached in the
Balkan conflict. By Alison Mitchell
</P>
<P>
   NATO (Warsaw, Poland) _ When Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic formally join NATO on Friday, it will be the return of
three nations, and not merely their militaries, to the center of
European civilization. At the start, these three countries will not
add much to NATO's military capacities. In fact, they have just
managed to meet the alliance's minimum military requirements for
integrated air defense, security procedures and language-training.
By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-MINISTER-RESIGN (Bonn, Germany) _ Germany's left-wing
finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, resigned Thursday after
apparently losing a power struggle with Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder. Lafontaine, who had become the bete noire of the
financial markets in less than six months in office, also stepped
down as chairman of the governing Social Democrat party, clearing
the way for the pragmatic Schroeder to assert control. (Early
summary by wires.) By Edmund L. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-EDUC (Washington) _ The House and Senate handily
approved legislation Thursday to give states and schools more
flexibility in how they spend $11 billion in federal money, and to
give each party a claim on being in tune with the public's interest
in education. But after a week of partisan squabbling in the Senate
over amendments, a Democratic measure pushed by President Clinton
to authorize the hiring of 100,000 teachers failed to muster a
majority. By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   TRADES-SHORTAGE (Chicago) _ Faced with a shortage of
tradesworkers to meet the voracious demand for new construction in
the United States, desperate builders and eager unions have kicked
off aggressive campaigns to court new workers, attracting women and
members of racial minorities to the traditional bastion of white
men, a world where a coveted union card was handed from father to
son. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   LOS-ALAMOS-SECURITY (Los Alamos, N.M.) _ As modern science
becomes an overwhelmingly international enterprise, a clash has
intensified between the scientific value of sharing information and
the national security need to keep secrets _ including advanced
designs of nuclear weapons. Scientists and engineers who have
watched their world evolve from a small club of male elites into a
yeasty mix of men and women from every continent say that the
balancing act has grown extraordinarily difficult. By Sandra
Blakeslee.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-NETS-MARBURY (Undated) _ On the day of the NBA trading
deadline, the New Jersey Nets appear poised to make a big trade,
acquiring Stephon Marbury, one of the league's premier point
guards, from Minnesota. By Chris Broussard.

ELIZABETH DOLE'S TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As she took the first official step toward a
presidential bid, Elizabeth Dole had yet to figure out how to solve
her unique problem: what to do about Bob?
</P>
<P>
   She clearly understands that to be taken seriously she must run
in her own right, stressing her public service credentials and
management experience rather than her famous married name. That is
what she did Wednesday in an expert performance in Iowa in which
she outlined her aspirations and her job achievements, which are
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   As a female pioneer at the highest level of national politics,
she cannot escape the cultural double standard that treats men as
instinctive leaders and women as natural followers. That barrier
has been increasingly overcome by talented, determined women in
statewide campaigns. But Elizabeth Dole is also burdened by the
fact that most people know her merely as Bob's capable wife and
that she has had a habit of ducking issues by saying she agrees
with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Her initial solution to handling their partnership was silly.
She didn't even mention her husband or just why it was that ``I
know a lot about running in a presidential campaign.'' The former
senator was conspicuously not at her side staring raptly at the
candidate in the customary fashion of other spouses at such
momentous events. For these purposes, he was a nonperson.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole was testifying before Congress halfway across the
continent, reinforcing the image of two independent political
leaders who live together but follow separate careers. Sitting next
to Elizabeth, he would have been a distraction, a center of
interest competing with her own appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But better a distraction than a transparent political pretense
that he doesn't exist, which will be exposed as fiction the first
time he makes a fund-raising call for her.
</P>
<P>
   This hands-off act is an unrealistic position to maintain for
nearly two years in a high-visibility presidential campaign. How
often are they to be seen together? Is he to be so absent that
rumors start about the state of their marriage? The level of his
support?
</P>
<P>
   Or is he to be so often at her side that they become
indistinguishable, in a pale rerun of the losing 1996 campaign? Is
he to be the new Hillary Clinton, about whom the president once
said if voters bought one, they would get two?
</P>
<P>
   It is not possible for the female Dole to ignore forever the
most recent Republican presidential nominee, the titular head of
her party. They have had independent careers, but they have not
been equal.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he lost the White House to the incumbent Democrat,
Bob Dole remains a formidable, well-liked GOP stalwart whose name
has repeatedly been on the ballot, as senator in Kansas, the 1976
GOP vice presidential nominee and presidential candidate. The
shadow of his presence looms over her candidacy, no matter how she
may pretend otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of her other qualifications, Elizabeth Dole has never
before stood for elective office and would not be a hot prospect
for the GOP nomination if her name was still Elizabeth Hanford.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at how much attention Lamar Alexander, also a former
Cabinet officer as well as a duly elected governor and presidential
candidate, is getting. Hardly anybody knows him despite his
campaigning in Iowa, which holds the first caucuses, for more than
two years. A new CNN poll there says he's favored only by a measly
7.7 percent of likely GOP caucus participants.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity through surrogate name identification also helps
President Bush's son, Texas Gov. George W Bush, just as it has
helped Sen. Edward Kennedy and other candidates who inherited
famous names through history. There is nothing wrong with this. It
indicates, if nothing else, a sense of continuity in politics,
which is not to be lightly dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole has long been rightfully admired for her
leadership, her professional ability and her charming Southern
manner. Frequent remarks that the ``wrong Dole'' ran in 1996 were
made only half in jest. And it is not fair that she be judged on a
different standard of political qualification than her male GOP
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact remains that no male candidate has the problem of
what to do with a more prominent spouse. Bush, Pat Buchanan and the
others can look good displaying their ``family values'' by
campaigning beside mostly muted wives who are at best sidekicks and
at worst irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   When Bob ran for president, the Doles solved the problem of
Elizabeth's independent stature by having her campaign separately,
visiting smaller groups and less crucial states than those he
personally wooed. But can this work in reverse? Would Bob Dole
really play second fiddle on the road to his wife, even to have a
shot at becoming First Husband and a permanent secondary role?
</P>
<P>
   The female Dole described herself in her Iowa appearance as a
public servant who was ``not a politician.'' This is meant to
explain away the fact that as a political wife she does not enjoy
the hard-core insider status flaunted by Bush, as evidenced in his
impressive array of endorsements from prominent GOP establishment
figures.
</P>
<P>
   But she cannot distance herself from Washington, where she and
her husband have spent their careers. Nor is she trying. She is
neither insider nor outsider, a strange but potentially promising
position in which many ambitious women in other fields also find
themselves.

during the Korean War based on information from Gen. Charles
Wilhelm, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Southern Command.

KEADY HOPES HE HAS PURDUE UP TO CELTICS STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene Keady does not want you to know this, but . . . ``I grew up
a Yankees fan,'' the Purdue basketball coach says, laughing. ``I
don't want people in Boston to know that, because then they might
start booing me.'' But he quickly points out that, as a lad growing
up in Larned, Kan., he also passionately rooted for the Celtics.
``Everyone during my time rooted for the Celtics, Packers, and
Yankees, because they all won championships,'' he says. ``They were
winners.''
</P>
<P>
   And everyone loves a winner, be it in Boston, New York, Green
Bay, Wis., or even Larned, Kan. That's why Keady should have no
such worries about an inhospitable response from the FleetCenter
crowd _ unless, of course, he plans to be ushered onto the court by
Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette _ when he arrives with his No.
10 seed Boilermakers for their first-round matchup Friday night
against No. 7 seed Texas in the NCAA East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Purdue's season will start anew. At the FleetCenter.
Beneath the championship banners and upon the famed parquet floor
of Keady's beloved Celtics. And Gene Keady cannot wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for us to get on the right track again,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   How often does a basketball team, coaching staff, and program
get the opportunity to erase a season of lowlights _ of which there
were many for the Boilermakers _ and start again in the NCAA
Tournament with a fresh, white canvas?
</P>
<P>
   When Purdue got off to a 12-2 start in November and December,
the season took on the look of a carefully crafted work. With a
dash of color here. A bold sense of style there. And very broad
brushstrokes throughout. It was a work in progress, no doubt, but
one that Keady nonetheless hoped to put on display in March along
with the rest of the gallery of teams in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But it was all very nearly ruined by a 7-10 finish in which the
Boilers lost five of their last six games. Add to that the
lingering specter of an ongoing NCAA investigation into allegations
of improprieties involving arranged loans for Luther Clay _ then a
freshman recruit looking to enroll from Maine Central Institute _ a
chemistry problem on the team, and an unforgiving Big Ten schedule,
and the season began to look less like a masterpiece and more like
a jumbled mess.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the 62-year-old Keady, considered one of the most
successful coaches never to reach the Final Four, was questioning
himself: (itals)Did I do a good job motivating the kids? Did I do a
good job getting the right players? Did I handle that right? Am I
handling this right?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   ``I blamed myself when things didn't go right,'' Keady says.
``The buck stops here. You go back and reevaluate and see what
happened. All of our players are very proud of what they did here,
and the thing that hurt me the most was ex-players calling up and
asking me, `Why aren't you guys playing better? What the heck's
going on?' I'm glad they're calling, because they built it up and
we don't want to let everybody down.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem on the team. And it didn't become
apparent to Keady until after the Christmas break when the Boilers
lost four of their first seven conference games.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we got into the season I don't know exactly what happened,
but I think there was some selfishness and maybe some
self-centeredness that kept us from being totally focused like the
previous Purdue teams,'' says Keady, who after 20 seasons ranks as
the school's all-time winningest coach with a 413-179 record
(.698), six conference titles, and 16 NCAA Tournament berths. ``We
didn't build and get better like we had in previous years, and I
think it caught the coaches off guard a little bit, because we'd
always gotten better and when it started caving in on us, I don't
think that we probably handled it in a proper manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Keady has endured tougher years, to be sure. He ranked the
1989-90 season, one in which he had two starters go down with
injuries and an insurrection of ``very immature children''
undermine the team, among his most difficult. Still he wound up
going 22-8 and advanced to the second round of the tournament
before losing to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But this season? ``It's probably one of the toughest,'' he
acknowledges. ``I don't think people realized how good the Big Ten
was going to be. It was probably one of those situations where the
players probably didn't work at their game like they should have
last summer to maintain the tradition we have here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little slippage there, and when we started slipping
our attitude started slipping and we started losing, and it was not
much fun here for a while,'' he adds. ``But this is new life for
us, and I hope we can get it on the right course again. If you
coach long enough, you're going to have those years where it
doesn't go smooth. We've been pretty spoiled here at Purdue for
five years. We've had a lot of great kids that won pretty big
games. So, not to do that, our fans were not very happy about that
this year and the coaching staff was really unhappy about it, so we
didn't handle it too well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Selection Sunday had a redemptive effect on Keady, his
staff, and his team. When Keady huddled in front of a TV set with
his staff to watch the ``NCAA Selection Show,'' they were stunned
to see ``Purdue'' in the East Region bracket as a 10th seed, the
lowest in school history. ``To tell you the truth, I didn't even
notice who we were playing, I was so happy,'' Keady says. ``It was
one of the best moments of the season. We gave more high-fives
around the office than we did in those years when we got the No. 1
seed.''
</P>
<P>
   There was favorable change in attitude three weeks before a
gut-wrenching overtime loss to Michigan in the Big Ten tournament,
but Keady was bouyed when he noticed a definite snap, crackle, and
pop in practice that evening after Purdue earned its NCAA berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down the stretch, we were as not good, didn't play with as
much fire in our belly; we really weren't having a lot of fun,''
Keady says. ``But I can tell you that the last couple of days of
practice the kids have practiced hard and seem to be having a lot
more fun, like they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, too, is their coach _ deservedly so. After the
tumultuous season he's had to endure, no one in Boston can begrudge
Gene Keady that inalienable right.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he is a Yankees fan.

REALITY FROM THE MID-AMERICAN CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following does not constitute a major news bulletin: Kent
University will not be winning the national championship this year.
</P>
<P>
   Or any other year.
</P>
<P>
   There are schools with the resources to get the ultimate job
done, but Kent is not one of them, nor is anyone else in the
Mid-American Conference. This is the reality of life in what is
referred to in the trade as a ``mid-major'' conference (not that
anyone ever 'fesses up to residing in a ``low'' major conference).
</P>
<P>
   So let's be honest about it. Kent has not come to the Fleet
thinking it is the first step toward cutting down the nets March 29
in St. Petersburg, Fla. Kent has come here trying to win one game
and maybe, if the sun, moon, stars, and all needed planets are
properly aligned, another. Get to an East Regional semifinal, and
Kent will have achieved all that any mid-major could hope ever hope
for. Get to the regional semifinal, and the players will be Kent
heroes forever. Get to the regional semis, and they will have
something to be proud of for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Kent coach is Gary Waters, and he understands. He knows the
MAC turf. He knows what is and isn't possible. He has actually seen
the sun, moon, stars, and planets cooperate. He has also seen Brian
Tolbert and Earl Boykins rain threes on someone's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can compare us with Eastern Michigan,'' he
says, ``but when I was an assistant at Eastern Michigan one year we
got to a Sweet 16 and another year we beat Duke. But I can tell you
how hard it is for a mid-major to get to a regional (semifinal),
especially if you are seeded higher than 10th.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mid-American Conference-champion Golden Flashes _ and don't
you just love that nickname? _ are seeded 11th in the East. They
will be playing sixth-seeded Temple in the second game of Friday
afternoon's doubleheader. If they should figure out a way to combat
both Temple's legendary zone defense and its major height
advantage, the likely reward will be a matchup on Sunday with
third-seeded Cincinnati, a scary team that was good enough to
defeat supposedly omnipotent Duke.
</P>
<P>
   We world-weary observers give Kent a slight chance against
Temple (which did, after all, lose by 30 to West Virginia in a
first-round game last year), but we give the Flashes no, as in
z-e-r-o, chance against Cincinnati, which is a lot closer to being
a No. 1 seed than it is to being a No. 4. Fortunately for Kent, the
kids who will actually be playing the game pay no, as in z-e-r-o,
attention to things we world-weary commentators have to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play as good ball in the MAC as anywhere in the country,''
maintains Kent center John Whorton. ``It doesn't really matter to
us what people say or how they rate things. You still have to play
the game on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just look at it as another challenge,'' shrugs senior guard
Ed Norvell. ``We're just going to play basketball, and we're going
to play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Whorton is 6 feet 8 inches and 250 pounds. He will be going up
against a 6-10, 6-9, 6-5 front line, the likes of which is simply
not seen in the MAC, which, by nature, features somewhat undersized
and underrecruited players.
</P>
<P>
   What Temple will find is that Whorton will be presenting himself
for the Owls' perusal with great authority. ``I like contact,'' he
explains. ``I like for the game to bump and grind a little. There
aren't too many players who enjoy playing in the low post nowadays,
but I think it's something we need to get back to. You shoot a
better percentage down there. If more players got down there, the
scores would go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Whorton leads the wonderfully balanced (five guys between 8 and
12 points per) Golden Flashes with 12.8 points a game. He practices
what he preaches by shooting 57 percent from the floor. He's been
in double figures 20 times, with a high of 23 against Eastern
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   You often hear about mid-major players swearing vengeance on the
snobby power conference teams that would not recruit them. Such
thinking is irrelevant in the Whorton scheme of things. ``I don't
hold grudges,'' says the Columbus, Ohio, native. ``If teams didn't
want me, they didn't want me. Someone did, and that someone was
Kent State.''
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, life will go on for Temple, which will operate as a
major-major, the way it always has. Temple's legacy includes
winning the first National Invitation Tournament back in 1938.
Temple has been to the Final Four. Temple has seen itself ranked
No. 1 in the country. Coach John Chaney has a major national
profile.
</P>
<P>
   But one win in this tournament can have enormous repercussions
for both Kent and the Mid-American Conference. It would mean, for
example, another day of television exposure, and Waters is very
passionate on that topic. ``More than anything else,'' he says,
``that is what our conference needs. We have got to get on TV more.
That is something our new commissioner has got to address. I look
at certain conferences on TV, and I am concerned that we don't have
as good a TV package. We play some good ball in this conference,
and we've beaten some good teams. We didn't do it by holding the
ball, either. We went head to head with people and won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   There it is: no trickeration, no deception. Kent comes at you
with aggressive, honest basketball. Win it all? Not reasonable. Win
a game? Why not?
</P>

BEARCATS BRING WIN OVER DUKE TO EAST REGIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, it was months ago and things have changed a lot since then.
One team, Duke, hasn't lost since and is the people's choice to win
the NCAA Tournament. The other team, Cincinnati, has lost five,
including the last one it played. It is the people's choice in,
perhaps, Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bearcats remain living proof that, yes, Duke can be
beaten, which of course will mean little or nothing when they play
George Mason Friday afternoon in the first round of the East
Regional at the FleetCenter. If the Bearcats do see Duke again, it
will mean they will have made it to the regional final, but that's,
well, down the road.
</P>
<P>
   But beating the Dukies does have its advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get that same attitude back,'' says Melvin Levett, ``no
one will stop us.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Pete Mickeal, a highly recruited junior college transfer
from Indian Hills (Iowa) who led the team in scoring, ``If we can
get back to the point where we practiced that hard and were focused
that hard, we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   You almost feel compelled to talk in the past tense about
Cincinnati. The Bearcats did, indeed, beat Duke in the Great Alaska
Shootout with a terrific end-of-game play (a dunk by Levett). At
the time, no one thought it would be as significant as it was. But
they've also lost twice to North Carolina-Charlotte and thrice to
teams not even deemed worthy of the tournament: DePaul (a referee
robbery), St. Louis, and Marquette. The latter two had losing
records.
</P>
<P>
   So which Cincinnati team will we see, the one that started the
season 15-0, was ranked as high as third in the country, and beat
Duke, or the one that finished 11-5 and didn't win its conference
tournament? Either might be good enough to beat George Mason, but
while the Bearcats have higher goals, they aren't taking the
Patriots lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled in the first round last year against Northern
Arizona,'' said coach Bobby Huggins, referring to a 65-62 victory.
Cincinnati, the No. 2 seed in the West last year, then lost to West
Virginia in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our practices have been pretty good,'' Huggins said. ``If we
don't fare well, it will be because they played better. We've never
had a problem taking it seriously. I understand those teams (low
seeds) are good enough to win, and our guys understand that. We've
lost games to teams we probably shouldn't have lost to.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Levett, who averaged 14.3 points a game, ``I think we just
hit a wall in the second half of the season. Every team experiences
them. We tried to work as hard as we could to get over it. I think
the loss to UNC-Charlotte opened up a lot of eyes. It's one and
out. We're ready to play ball now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati has drawn the No. 3 seed in the East, the fourth
straight year it has been either a No. 2 or a No. 3. In only one of
those years, 1996, did the Bearcats get past the second round. They
like to play fast and furious, also the preferred pace of George
Mason, but they also take pride in their defense. Cincinnati's
opponents this season shot 38.4 percent from the field and averaged
an NBA-ish 61.5 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats also are tournament-tough, having been here every
season since their surprise Final Four run in 1992. They are 8-2
this season against tournament teams, the only losses coming to
UNC-Charlotte. They did win their fourth straight regular-season
Conference USA title, their sixth in the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns Huggins entering the tournament is his club's
shooting. Cincinnati is coming off a 16-of-45 performance against
UNC-Charlotte, including a jaw-dropping 1 of 17 on 3-pointers. In
their last five games, the Bearcats are 16 of 82 from international
waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make shots,'' the coach said, matter-of-factly.
``We have to shoot it better than we did the last month. I know
we're going to guard people and rebound. We'll be consistent there.
But we've got to make the shots. When we've been successful, we've
shot the ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   Huggins also said he'd like to get the ball inside more, and
that makes sense given the team's physical front line of Mickeal,
Kenyon Martin, and Jermaine Tate. Levett, too, is chiseled. A
freshman, Steve Logan, is the starting point guard. He moved into
the position in the second game of the season and, Huggins said,
``has come a long way, especially defensively.'' He's also the
team's best perimeter shooter.
</P>
<P>
   When they have their game faces on, the Bearcats are terrific.
They are athletic, strong, and active. They create havoc and feast
on mistakes. They may not be the nation's favorite _ they've had
their share of thugs and ``incidents'' over the years; Nick Van
Exel, after all, went there _ but they remain a potent force in the
regional.
</P>
<P>
   They have George Mason Friday, and that's the team on their
minds. But they also have expectations to play a few more before
it's all over.

`STAR WARS' PREVIEW TO APPEAR ON APPLE COMPUTER'S WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `e' code) 
(bl) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a promotional coup, Apple Computer Inc. said
Thursday that it had joined with Lucasfilm Ltd. to present a
preview of the new ``Star Wars'' movie on its Web site. The preview
began appearing on the web site Thursday, the day before its first
appearance in theaters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder and interim chief executive, said
in a telephone interview that the company had added network
capacity to accommodate an anticipated 10 million downloads of the
two-and-a-half-minute film clip. It is accessible at www.apple.com
or www.starwars.com and is offered in several different resolutions
so that viewers can pick a download suitable to the speed of their
connection to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're incredibly thrilled and honored to be selected by
Lucasfilm,'' said Jobs, pointing out that the film company had
chosen Apple's Quicktime video technology over Real Player from
Real Networks Inc. or Media Player from Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be the biggest download in history,'' Jobs said.
Apple is expecting ``an order of magnitude'' more downloads of this
trailer than the one presented by Walt Disney Co. for ``A Bug's
Life,'' the animated film co-produced by Disney and Jobs' other
company, Pixar Inc., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ward, Lucasfilm's director of marketing, said the trailer
was longer than the so-called teaser clip that began appearing in
theaters last November. While the teaser focused on the story of
Anakin Skywalker, a major character in ``Star Wars, Episode I: The
Phantom Menace,'' directed by George Lucas, the new trailer tells
more of the full story, offering a glimpse at the movie's scope.
Many fans bought tickets to theaters just to see the first
two-minute trailer and then left without watching the feature film
that followed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the home stretch, this is the last trailer for the
film,'' Ward said. The film will open in theaters May 21. ``We
wanted something that would both blow the fans away and sustain
them during the last stretch before the movie opens,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is difficult to draw a direct line between such a
promotion and increased Macintosh sales or Quicktime use, it is
still a victory for both Apple and Lucasfilm, said Tim Bajarin,
president of Creative Strategies in Cupertino, Calif. ``Apple gets
great cross-promotion and Lucas gets great promotion,'' he said.
``This is Steve calling in the chits from his Hollywood pals. It's
Steve Jobs at his promotional best.''

EVER-FOCUSED CHANEY BRINGS HIS OPINIONS TO THE FLOOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An entertaining and always opinionated John Chaney spent most of
his alloted press conference time speaking about his 16-year pet
peeve, the Proposition 16 and 48 rules that were overturned this
week in a federal court, but Chaney is also quite focused on his
Temple team, concerned about the sore hand of guard Quincy Wadley
as well as how to go about beating what he considers a
``well-coached ballclub'' in underdog Kent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor has taken a look at him,'' said Chaney. ``I'm
concerned. I don't know if I want to risk playing him. He said he's
all right, but this morning that hand was a little bit stiff. I'll
play it according to how he feels. We'll see if that hand loosens
up. He means a lot to our offense. He's perhaps one of the two guys
in terms of outside shooting that we would miss a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadley, who injured the bone in the back of his hand in the
Atlantic 10 Tournament, had the hand heavily wrapped as he shot
during the team's walk-through at the FleetCenter Thursday
afternoon. Chaney has already lost sophomore guard Lynn Greer for
the season, and has had to play without freshman Alex Wesby, a
victim of the Prop 16 ruling, but is expected to return next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prop 48 never should have taken place; never,'' said Chaney,
wearing a green overcoat over a nylon sweatsuit and sporting a
black Nike hat. ``First of all it destroys the mission of every
college in this country. Every university has a different mission.
The guy who headed up that (NCAA) commission _ Derrick C. Park _
who was right here at Harvard at the time, headed a committee with
43 white presidents from all the big football schools over the
country back in 1983. It's 16 years old now. It should never have
happened. He said no one should tell him who enters his school
because he has blacks, he has kids from disadvantaged backgrounds,
entering Harvard right here in this city. So this should never have
come about.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney emphasized that in no way should SAT scores be the sole
instrument for deciding whether a kid gets into school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish you guys would get it right,'' he said. ``This judge
only made this judgment based on the fact that the NCAA was asked
to present them data _ to present to him information _ `show me
some evidence as to why you came up with this ruling.' They
couldn't do it. They showed no evidence at all. None.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use writing essays, you can have resumes presented
with all kinds of recommendations, and you can have other types of
testing in addition to SATs. But it should not be the sole
instrument of not allowing kids to get into school. That was
unfair. Since when does an athletic entity tell the university and
academic environment how it should admit students?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need everybody educated. That's why my gradation rate is
low. It's low because I will try my best to get every Tom, Dick,
and Harry in school that I can. If you're driving down the street
with your family, don't you want the guy coming across that stop
sign to be able to read `Stop'? I want him to be educated because
it might save my life and my families' life. But people are so
pompous to suggest we shouldn't let these kids in school. So what,
they come back home after two years? Let them shoot themselves in
the foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney doesn't envision the NCAA changing its mind and expects
there will be appeal after appeal on the ruling. While
acknowledging he was pleased with decision, ``The damage has been
done,'' he said. ``You've destroyed the aspirations of so many
youngsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite Chaney topic is his matchup zone defense, which
he says has been much maligned in the Philadelphia area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very fortunate in that I really don't care what people
think,'' Chaney said. ``But the people in our city talk about the
way we play basketball as the worst basketball in the country. I
only get applause when we win championships. Our city hates the way
we play basketball.''

CHINESE WOMEN HOLD US TO SINGLE GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANTAA, Finland _ That the Chinese women's hockey team has a
strong defense is hardly news: at the Olympics, it held the
gold-medal United States team to five goals and silver medalist
Canada to two. If its offense ever catches up, the No. 4 finisher
in Nagano is going to be a dangerous team.
</P>
<P>
   Led by goaltender Lina Huo, the patient Chinese held the US to a
single goal on 12 shots in the first period Thursday before Karyn
Bye (hat trick) and Jenny Schmidgall (a goal and four assists)
sparked the Americans to a 6-0 victory. Laurie Belliveau, of
Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., via Yale, got the shutout with eight
saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rely on their defensive game and they were right in it
for the first half,'' said US coach Ben Smith. ``They were a very
difficult match for us and I didn't expect anything less. The
Chinese goalie is very hard to score on.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Canada barely survived a scare by Finland to win,
1-0, thus keeping hopes alive for an Olympic rematch with the US in
Sunday's final. Canada hung on to win even after Caroline Ouellette
was called for hooking with 1:01 remaining, giving Finland a 6-on-4
power play when it pulled its goalie.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the US clinched first place in Group A, advancing
to the medal round in which it will meet Finland, the runner-up in
Group B, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way (Finland) played . . . , we will probably be ready for
them in the final,'' said Canadian coach Daniele Sauvageau.
</P>
<P>
   In its semifinal game, Canada, winner of Group B, will face
Sweden, the runner-up in Group A.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, China kept the US quiet until 12:15 in the first
period, when Katie King of Salem, N.H., penetrated a scrum in front
of the net to put the US on the board, 1-0. The Americans weren't
heard from again until 5:59 had passed in the second, when Huo made
a nice save on a shot by Cammi Granato only to have Schmidgall poke
in the rebound. Bye got the first of her three goals with a
bull's-eye shot up the middle from six feet out 16:52 into the
second, which ended 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Dorchester's Stephanie O'Sullivan came alive in the third,
assisting on all three goals.

INDUSTRY DISPENSING PROFITS, WITH BIG CHAINS LEADING THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CONSTANCE SOMMER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ That Bartell Drugs down the street may look like a big
box of a store. But don't be fooled _ it's really one of the little
guys.
</P>
<P>
   From Syracuse to Seattle, the nation's drugstore retailers are
waging campaigns of individual expansion and industry
consolidation. Nearly every day brings a new report of a drugstore
giant gobbling up another regional chain such as Seattle-based
Bartell. Meanwhile, the nation's top four chains continue to pump
out sales increases so strong that last year Wall Street giddily
bid up the stock of No. 1 Walgreen by 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As staid as the drugstore business may seem, with its cluttered
aisles, awash-in-white pharmacies and garish cosmetics displays,
this is a hot retail sector where ever-bigger players are learning
how to squeeze nice profits from the low-profit-margin operation of
prescription drug dispensing. The increased competition _ though it
drives out the smaller operators _ can also mean good news for
customers, as stores woo time-pressed shoppers with amenities such
as ample parking at corner locations, drive-through pharmacies,
film-processing services and even the sale of grocery staples such
as milk and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drugstore industry is on a roll,'' wrote analyst Sandra
Skrovan in a 1998 report for PricewaterhouseCoopers. ``And the big
are poised to get bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1990, the top 10 drugstore chains generated 42.6
percent of industry sales, according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers'
report. Seven years later, the top four companies alone _
Illinois-based Walgreen Co., CVS Corp. of Rhode Island,
Pennsylvania-based Rite-Aid, and Eckerd Corp., the Florida-based
subsidiary of J.C. Penney _ accounted for nearly half of all
industry sales, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Two distinct trends are pushing these changes: the aging of the
baby boomers and the continued rise of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby boomers are starting to get on medications,'' said
Don Downing, pharmacy care coordinator for the Washington State
Pharmacists Association. ``Retailers are filling far more
prescriptions per store than they ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is only the beginning of the wave. The baby boom
generation is just barely edging into its 50s. Retail experts say
drug store companies are racing to position themselves for an
explosion in prescription business over the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   In any other industry, this population shift would be good news
for all comers, large and small. But thanks largely to managed
care, the drugstore business has morphed into a unique creature
seemingly only capable of survival on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care companies encourage doctors to treat patients with
drug therapy rather than more costly surgical procedures, and in
that way they're a boon for drug sales. They also, though, drive
hard bargains on pharmaceutical reimbursement, pushing down what
was formerly a high-profit-margin business into one that now can
only eke out, in many cases, 1 percent to 2 percent profits on
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bartell Drugs decided to fight back _ and in a
telling incident, lost. The company had to backpedal. The then
41-store chain (it has since added three stores) refused to fill
prescriptions for Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska members,
citing the health plan's new low reimbursement rates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Washington State Pharmacists Association estimated
that an independent pharmacist had to earn an average gross profit
of $6.79 per prescription to break even with expenses. The gross
profit under the Blue Cross rates came to $3.80.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no way we can justify doing business with the
plan under their most recent proposal,'' Bartell's director of
pharmacy, Dan Connolly, told the Post-Intelligencer in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bartell stopped filling the prescriptions Oct. 1 of that year.
But no other chain store followed its lead, and six weeks later the
company reversed course after shoppers complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that drove us hardest to go back (to Blue Cross) was
our customers,'' said Mike McMurry, Bartell's director of
marketing. ``It's the kind of commitment we have to our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   With barely more than three dozen stores, Bartell wielded no
clout with Blue Cross in its efforts to punch up reimbursement
rates. A company such as Walgreen, boasting nearly $16 billion in
annual sales and more than 2,500 stores nationwide, is a different
story.
</P>
<P>
   The company dropped a half-dozen insurance plans last year
because of low reimbursement rates and is getting tough with the
many more managed care plans it continues to serve, Walgreen
spokesman Michael Pulvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing (profit) margins leveling off now'' after a few
years of decline, he said. ``We're using our leverage as the
nation's largest pharmacy chain to say, `Look, we can't continue to
provide the services your patients need at these rates.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chains also respond to the price pressures by trying to become
more efficient in their pharmacies, investing in technologies that,
for instance, can let machines fill common prescriptions or at
least take automated refill orders over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Some have begun pushing the pharmacists themselves to do more,
faster, said Jann Hinkle, a spokeswoman for the American
Pharmaceutical Association, which represents the nation's
pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're working at such a high volume that not only is it
potentially dangerous for patients, but these pharmacists are
working 12, 14 hours at a stretch without being able to take a
lunch break,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the State Board of Pharmacy recently fined Rite-Aid
$50,000 for what the board termed an unacceptable amount of
mistakes in filling prescriptions. Understaffing may have
contributed to the problem, the board's executive director said.
</P>
<P>
   So with all the pressure to contain costs, why are big companies
such as Walgreens opening so many new stores? It's not just drugs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, a
bit less than half of the industry's sales are prescription drugs.
Obviously, drugs didn't account for an 18 percent rise in
fourth-quarter earnings recently at CVS, the nation's No. 2 drug
store chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to do it (make their money) in the front end,'' said
analyst Philip Muldoon III of McDonald Investments Inc. in
Cleveland, using the industry jargon referring to everything in a
drugstore that's not the pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it _ who looks for bargains at a drugstore? They're
the places that serendipitously offer motor oil, mascara, diapers,
board games and scented candles in the narrow aisles between the
pharmacy counter in the back and the cash registers in the front. A
thriving drugstore gets shoppers buying things they only dimly knew
they needed, at full retail price to boot, during an errand they
ran to pick up something else.
</P>
<P>
   This is what allows Bartell Drugs to stay alive and even,
slowly, expand despite its inability to twist tough deals out of
the managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had terrific sales gains last year,'' said President and
Chief Executive George Bartell. ``We get offers to buy us from time
to time, but basically, we're not interested.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's also what's killing the nation's remaining small,
independent pharmacies who traditionally have relied on the
prescription drug business to pay the bills each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make me feel better if I could make money at the end
of the year,'' said Doug Hendrecks, owner of the Greenwood Medicine
Man pharmacy, who says he's hanging on waiting for the financial
tides to turn in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrecks points out that he can't stock one of every item under
the sun. He simply doesn't have the room. And because he doesn't
have the room to stock every random good on the market, he can't
make enough money to pay for a 24-hour staff or even one that stays
on into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he tries to keep his prescription drug prices
competitive for the customers who pay for their medications
themselves _ about 20 percent of the national market. He also
stocks a wide variety of herbal and other natural remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any independents who are still around, my hat's off to them,''
he said. ``They are doing something right.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are about 20,000 independent drugstores left in
the country, according to United Drugs Cooperative. But the trend
is definitely toward the chains.
</P>
<P>
   In such a skewed marketplace, everything ultimately turns on
convenience, and that's what today's chain drugstores are after in
their push to increase market share.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstores not so long ago sought locations in strip malls,
separated maybe by a dry cleaner and a little photo shop from a
major supermarket. But today, with the supermarkets opening their
own pharmacies and the drugstores doing film processing, that's not
the kind of competition anybody wants. Plus, customers couldn't
always find convenient parking spots in the strip malls.
</P>
<P>
   So the chains are striking out on their own. Generally, they
want to replace their old stores with new ones at high-traffic,
corner locations with ample parking and room for that ultimate in
convenience items, a drive-through pharmacy, said Rolland Jones, a
local commercial real estate broker who has looked for sites for
major chains.
</P>
<P>
   In the financial short run, drive-through pharmacies make no
sense. They allow a customer to use only the most expensive part of
the drugstore business while avoiding the higher-margin temptations
inside.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long run, drugstores see the drive-throughs as just
one more ploy to make loyal customers out of fickle shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're willing to believe that people aren't going to do that
(the drive-through) every time,'' said Bert Hambleton Jr., an
Issaquah-based retail consultant. ``The idea is get you locked into
coming to that location. When you have time, you'll come into the
store.''

IT'S THE PEDRO AND RAMON SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Allman Brothers. Brothers Karamazov. Sutter
Brothers. Wright Brothers. Smothers Brothers. Hendricks Brothers.
Righteous Brothers. Flying Burrito Brothers. Doobie Brothers. Smith
Brothers. Everly Brothers. Baldwin Brothers. Brothers Gibb.
Menendez Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Martinez Brothers _ Pedro and Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez officially joined the Boston baseball family
Thursday, signing a contract that will reunite him with his younger
brother, Pedro. The Martinez Brothers pitched together with the
Dodgers for the entire 1993 season and should comprise 40 percent
of Jimy Williams's starting rotation when Ramon returns from
shoulder surgery sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers on the Red Sox. Sweet.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a first for the Sox. Baby Boomer fans remember 1969
and 1970 when Tony and Billy Conigliaro patrolled the outfield for
the Red Sox. It was an interesting time. Reggie Smith and Carl
Yastrzemski were the other two Boston outfielders and they hated
the Conigliaros. It was a daily soap opera with Yaz and Reggie
ripping Tony and Billy.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years earlier, Rick and Wes Ferrell played three seasons
together with the Sox. They were battery brothers. Rick was a Hall
of Fame catcher and Wes won 25 games in 1935 and 20 more in '36.
The Ferrells would be the Sox' best brother tandem.
</P>
<P>
   And now we have Pedro and Ramon, a former Cy Young winner
(Pedro) and his big brother who won 20 games for the Dodgers in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have made a considerable investment in Ramon. It is
believed they'll pay him $2 million this year and $5 million next
year even though there's no guarantee he'll come back from last
June's shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be money well spent. Maybe the Ramon dough will go
into that giant shredder that swallowed the contracts of Robinson
Checo and Butch Henry. But the Sox are to be applauded for trying.
It's not our money and if Ramon returns to form, this brother combo
is going to be fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it Red Sox fans: Pedro and Ramon could be the
Dominican Deans. When the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Detroit
Tigers in the 1934 World Series, all four games were won by the
Brothers Dean. Old Diz won Game 1 and Game 7, and brother Paul won
Game 3 and Game 6. Now close your eyes and try to imagine Pedro and
Ramon winning all four games of the 2000 World Series for the
Boston Red Sox. Heady stuff, no?
</P>
<P>
   Ramon is four years older than Pedro. Ramon says when they were
kids, he and youngest brother, Jesus, would take on middle brothers
Pedro and Nelson. The competition extended to the major league
level when Pedro pitched for the Expos while Ramon hurled for the
Dodgers. They faced one another once in a big league game with
Ramon winning, 2-1, even though Pedro went the route and struck out
13. They also sqared off once in a spring training game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struck him out the first time I faced him,'' said Ramon. ``I
hit a ground ball to short off him. After that, I didn't hit him.
He struck me out three times. In spring training once I got up and
pointed to the fence. I called a home run. He didn't know what to
think. Then I put down a perfect bunt. In my second at-bat, I got a
base hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers are excited about being teammates. Wearing Dennis
Eckersley's old No. 43 (Ramon wore 48 with the Dodgers, but that
belongs to Sox coach Dave Jauss), Ramon threw 40 pitches Thursday
morning. He will work out with the Sox Friday, return to the
Dominican Republic until March 22, then come back to Fort Myers and
work there until he's ready to join the Red Sox. Boston general
manager Dan Duquette said he expects Ramon to help the Sox this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro's only making $12.5 million per year. Living together
would allow them to split the utility bills. Will Ramon crash at
Pedro's pad when he reports to Boston?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I have a wife and two children,'' said Ramon, a handsome
man with an easy smile. ``It's different when you have a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro and I talked about a lot of things,'' he said. ``He
pitched in the American League last year and he's got to help me
with scouting reports. I can learn a lot from him. We're going to
help each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro and Ramon. The Brothers Martinez. The Dominican Deans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good story. It makes the Red Sox less boring. And maybe
more competitive.

INVESTMENT BANKS WALK A TIGHTROPE IN ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Investment banks have always struggled to reconcile
their roles as tough-minded analysts and smooth-talking
salespeople. Nowhere is this truer than in Asia, where the lines
between government and business can be blurry and the opportunities
to offend both are legion.
</P>
<P>
   The regional division of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. has become the
latest to stumble in this minefield. The investment firm recently
felt obliged to apologize to Thailand after one of its reports
drove down the shares of the nation's largest bank and angered the
finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us at Goldman Sachs deeply regret the controversial
media attention that our `Market Flash' dated February 8th
subsequently generated in the Thai press,'' said the president of
Goldman Sachs Asia, Philip Murphy, in a letter last month to
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda.
</P>
<P>
   In that report to clients, Goldman's chief Asian banking
analyst, Roy Ramos, said that Tarrin viewed Bangkok Bank as the
``biggest risk factor in Thailand's banking system.'' After Tarrin
denied saying that, Ramos conceded that the characterization was
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of its competitors, Goldman has hastened to make
amends, rather than risk losing business from either the government
or private companies, which are loath to use a bank that is in
disfavor.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene K. Galbraith, former head of research at ABN Amro in Hong
Kong, remarked, ``Since the nexus of government and business is so
much closer in Asia than in Europe or the U.S., the consequences of
offending the government are much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   While officials can be thin-skinned in any Asian country,
bankers feel this most acutely in dealings with China. Almost every
major firm here can tell of a chill wind from Beijing after they
published reports critical of the economy or of politically
connected companies.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most prominent examples, Morgan Stanley ran afoul
of Beijing when the firm's chief strategist, Barton M. Biggs,
advised clients in October 1997 to steer clear of the Hong Kong
stock market. (He had unkind words for some other Asian markets,
too.)
</P>
<P>
   The report outraged Wang Qishan, who was then chairman of the
China Construction Bank, which was co-managing the sale of shares
in China Telecom. Wang is now the executive vice governor of
Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Shandong International Power Development, a
government-controlled company, dismissed Morgan Stanley as its
investment banker. A spokesman for the investment bank said he
doubted that there was a direct link between the Biggs report and
the bank's action, though he confirmed China's hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the head of China research at HSBC Holdings
resigned after clashing with his superiors over his forecast for
economic growth in China in 1999. The researcher, Joe Zhang, had
projected that China's gross domestic product would grow only 3
percent this year. Recent Chinese growth has approached 10 percent
in some years, and this year's official projection is for 7 percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The subdued forecast angered officials in Beijing, who expressed
their objections to HSBC's group chairman, John Bond, according to
two executives at the banking group. When Zhang refused to endorse
a more optimistic outlook, these people said, he was forced out. At
the time, HSBC's investment banking unit was helping to underwrite
a $1 billion bond issue by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC has declined to discuss Zhang's departure. But in an
interview late last month, the group chief executive, Keith R.
Whitson, said: ``We are in 79 countries around the world. By
definition, that means we are a guest in 78. And we believe in
behaving as guests should behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a gentlemanly approach comes more easily to commercial
banks like HSBC than to investment banking firms like Goldman. As
lenders of capital rather than wooers and deal financiers, they
rely less on their research to market themselves. Goldman, by
contrast, uses star analysts like Ramos to lure clients.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, who joined Goldman in 1984, was ranked as the No. 1
banking analyst in Asia by Asia Money magazine in 1998. A
soft-spoken former executive at Mellon Bank, he enjoys easy access
to finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
   That access may have landed him in trouble. It was after a
meeting with Tarrin on Feb. 5 that Ramos issued a downbeat report
on Bangkok Bank. The remarks attributed to Tarrin scared investors,
and the bank's shares plunged 8.1 percent after the report became
public.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Goldman said Ramos' report had been scrutinized by
lawyers, compliance officers and the head of research before it was
released. But they said the reviewers would not generally question
a senior analyst on the substance of talks with a government
official.
</P>
<P>
   In Goldman's letter of apology, Murphy said Ramos admitted that
he had, in effect, put his words in Tarrin's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos was traveling in the United States and did not return a
telephone call. Murphy also did not respond to requests for
comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Peter Rose, a Goldman spokesman in Hong Kong, said, ``We deeply
regret the mischaracterization.'' But he added, ``We were never
asked to, nor did we, alter our conclusions on the Thai banking
sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Goldman is so eager to resolve this dispute is
that it may have inadvertently fed ammunition to Tarrin's critics.
Opposition leaders have seized on the report as grist for their
accusations that the government wants to sell Thailand's troubled
banks to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Thai Parliament members are now considering whether to ask the
government to sever its relationship with Goldman. E. Gerald
Corrigan, a Goldman partner and former president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, advises Tarrin. The firm also handled an
$850 million stock offering for the Thai Farmers Bank.
</P>
<P>
   If Goldman hopes to win more such assignments, it needs to
convince Thailand's business elite that it has not lost its friends
in high places.

EUROPEAN FARM MINISTERS REACH AGREEMENT TO REDUCE SUBSIDES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ European farm ministers reached a broad
agreement Thursday to reduce the European Union's $45 billion
program for agricultural subsidies, a potentially important
breakthrough on one of Europe's most divisive political problems.
</P>
<P>
   If the agreement holds up, it could pave the way for European
heads of state to rebalance what is now a lop-sided budget that
channels billions of euros to countries like France and Spain.
European leaders are scheduled to hammer out that budget at a
meeting in Berlin on March 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also would allow the European Union to open its
membership to Central European nations like Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic. Those countries sell meat, grains and dairy
products at much lower prices than allowed in Western Europe, and
their admission to the European Union's free-trade zone would
either bankrupt the subsidy system or cause havoc with farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But it remained unclear Thursday whether the agreement would
hold together. For one thing, the proposed farm budget is about 7
billion euros, or $7.7 billion, higher than the overall limit that
European leaders had originally established. Beyond that, the deal
infuriated farmers in several countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the work remains unfinished,'' Jean Glavany, France's
agricultural minister, told reporters in Brussels Thursday. ``There
is a risk that the accord will founder on the financial aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the deal marks a major breakthrough in what had
been a bitter deadlock. Germany, which is by far the biggest net
loser under the so-called Common Agricultural Program, has been
pushing for big cuts across the board. France, the biggest net
winner, had been fighting to retain as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations stalled two weeks ago, but German leaders revived
efforts by offering an unexpectedly tame compromise. Thursday's
deal, which came after an 18-hour bargaining session in Brussels
among Europe's 15 farm ministers, is in some ways tougher than the
German compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the support prices for cereal grains would be
cut by 20 percent between the year 2000 and 2003. Beef prices would
be cut by 20 percent, while milk prices would be cut by 15 percent.
But in a concession to dairy farmers, milk prices and milk
production quotas would only start to be rolled back in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, the agreement remains a modest one that
would essentially freeze farm spending at current levels. Advocates
of more radical reform, like Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain,
said they were still not satisfied.

MICK FLEETWOOD SEEKS TEEN HELP IN `MR. MUSIC' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mr. Music'' isn't much of a movie, but it does point to a
pressing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Which is that a whole generation's rock music icons are a few
years older than their fans. And led, shall we say, accelerated
lives.
</P>
<P>
   So now they're creaky and a wee bit embarrassing, the more so
because they still insist on wearing T-shirts, leather pants and
ponytails.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these ancient rockers might want to consider an
overcoat, a wool cap, a thermos and a nice spot on a park bench.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Showtime's ``Mr. Music,'' premiering Sunday, Mick
Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac has that weathered look. But at least he
seems capable of chuckling at his own state of affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, the cable movie is for teenagers. Fleetwood,
who is more of a presence than an actor, plays Simon Eckstal, head
of Tone Records.
</P>
<P>
   Tone Records is a label that supposedly peaked in the early
1970s and is now withering. Simon figures that a jolt of publicity
might attract a big-name band or two, and he has an idea. He picks
15-year-old Rob Tennant (Jonathan Tucker), practically at random,
and appoints him vice president for talent at Tone Records.
</P>
<P>
   Teen gets big job at record company. If most successful TV
really amounts to fantasy fulfillment, this movie ought to be a
magnet for the intended audience.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mr. Music'' is promptly mired in a by-the-numbers formula.
Rob's enthusiasm wanes when he learns that he was hired solely to
generate publicity, but he finally eclipses the corruptive schemes
of grown-ups and saves the company. Hurrah.
</P>
<P>
   It's absolutely, totally predictable. But when you get to be
Fleetwood's age, surprises can be a strain.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Darklings,'' on the Fox Family Channel (also showing
Sunday), is targeted for nearly the same audience and itself is
hardly original. It makes better use of its formula, though. In
this instance, it's an adolescent variation of Alfred Hitchcock's
``Rear Window.''
</P>
<P>
   Infected with mononucleosis and confined to a bedroom at his
grandmother's small townhouse, 14-year-old C.J. Jackson (Ryan De
Boer) thinks he witnesses a murder through his window one night.
</P>
<P>
   The supposed killer is a former baseball star (Timothy Busfield)
who has just moved in across the street, and the apparent victim is
a town resident (Suzanne Somers).
</P>
<P>
   The ``supposed'' and ``apparent'' are because the investigating
cop (Martin Sheen) finds no evidence of a crime. In fact, the
victim materializes in fine fettle as C.J. and two young chums (Ben
Johnson and Meghan Ory) begin to pry into the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Darklings'' strains on the creepy front _ spiders, a rat,
a closeted corpse, an over-the-top performance and maniacal laugh
from Busfield _ and its efforts aren't wasted.
</P>
<P>
   The movie requires modest expectations. But it skips along
agreeably as a kind of nonthreatening thriller. Think ``Hardy
Boys.''

 &HT;    JUDGE URGES SETTLEMENT IN FLORIDA DREDGING SUIT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The federal judge who has temporarily halted a U.S.
Corps of Engineers project to ``renourish'' an eroded south Florida
beach agreed Thursday to hear lawyers' arguments in the case next
week -- but appealed to them to save him the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Henry H. Kennedy set a hearing for Wednesday
on complaints that the South Beach project in Fort Pierce has
illegally endangered a group of obscure single-celled ocean
creatures known as bryozoans.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with an appeal that lawyers in the case settle the dispute
among themselves, he walked out of the courtroom, leaving them to
talk about the dispute and the marine bryozoans whose welfare has
blocked work on pumping sand onto the beach from offshore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're evaluating things. I really don't want to talk about
it,'' said Lawrence R. Liebesman, a Silver Springs, Md., lawyer
hired by St. Lucie County to represent its interests in what
initially was a dispute between the Corps of Engineers and marine
scientists and environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The groups' lawsuit last week resulted in a temporary
restraining order by Kennedy, bringing the dredging to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs in the case are Judith Winston, a Martinsville, Va.,
biologist; North Beach resident Brian Killday, who works at Harbor
Branch Oceanographic Institution; the St. Lucie Audubon Society;
the Conservation Alliance of St. Lucie County; and the St. Lucie
Waterfront Council.
</P>
<P>
   They complained in the suit that the Corps of Engineers had
ignored concerns it was required to address the impact the $5.3
million project would have on several new bryozoan species
identified by Winston in sand near the spoil used to renourish a
section of South Beach. They say the creatures have never been
found anywhere else, although they appear to be related to other
bryozoans that have made important contributions to cancer
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether there's a way we can come up with a compromise that
would allow the project to go forward without endangering these
species remains to be seen,'' Eric R. Glitzenstein, the attorney
for Winston and the other plaintiffs, said following a brief
meeting with Liebesman and Justice Department lawyers representing
the corps.
</P>
<P>
   Before work was suspended, the project was being financed
jointly by St. Lucie County, the Corps of Engineers and the State
of Florida.

   &UR; PASTA ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE SPEAKS UP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Wednesday's Personals mention of a 1939 Life
magazine article asserting _ in a positive tone _ that  &UR; Joe &LR; 
 &UR; DiMaggio &LR;  preferred chow mein to spaghetti, pasta-defending
baseball fan  &UR; Jack Breibart &LR; , owner of the authoritative two-volume
``DiMaggio Albums,'' submits a number of citations:
</P>
<P>
   - A 1936 clipping from the New York World Telegram said, ``Joe
likes movies, but hasn't much use for books. He also likes
spaghetti.''
</P>
<P>
   - A 1938 clip from an unknown newspaper said DiMaggio ``goes
strong for spaghetti. Says his favorite dish is chippino (check)
which is an Italian concerto composed of cracked crab and spaghetti
sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   - According to the United Press in 1939, ``Joe likes movies and
spaghetti and hasn't much use for books.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no mention of whether he liked books &LR;  about &LR; 
spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY MATT GROENING HATES HOLLYWOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Matt Groening, &LR;  creator of ``The Simpsons'' and now
``Futurama,'' told Mother Jones magazine that working on the new
series ``has been by far the worst experience of my grown-up
life.'' He said it seemed to him typical of how people are treated
in Hollywood, ``but I thought I would have a bit more leeway since
I made Fox so much money with `The Simpsons.'''
</P>
<P>
   Groening said that ``any time I've been gracious, it's been seen
as a sign of weakness. And every time I've yelled back, I've been
treated with respect.''
</P>
<P>

`STAR WARS' PREVIEW TO APPEAR ON APPLE COMPUTER'S WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `f' code) 
(bl) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a promotional coup, Apple Computer Inc. said
Thursday that it had joined with Lucasfilm Ltd. to present a
preview of the new ``Star Wars'' movie on its Web site. The preview
began appearing on the web site Thursday, the day before its first
appearance in theaters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder and interim chief executive, said
in a telephone interview that the company had added network
capacity to accommodate an anticipated 10 million downloads of the
two-and-a-half-minute film clip. It is accessible at www.apple.com
or www.starwars.com and is offered in several different resolutions
so that viewers can pick a download suitable to the speed of their
connection to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're incredibly thrilled and honored to be selected by
Lucasfilm,'' said Jobs, pointing out that the film company had
chosen Apple's Quicktime video technology over Real Player from
Real Networks Inc. or Media Player from Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be the biggest download in history,'' Jobs said.
Apple is expecting ``an order of magnitude'' more downloads of this
trailer than the one presented by Walt Disney Co. for ``A Bug's
Life,'' the animated film co-produced by Disney and Jobs' other
company, Pixar Inc., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ward, Lucasfilm's director of marketing, said the trailer
was longer than the so-called teaser clip that began appearing in
theaters last November. While the teaser focused on the story of
Anakin Skywalker, a major character in ``Star Wars, Episode I: The
Phantom Menace,'' directed by George Lucas, the new trailer tells
more of the full story, offering a glimpse at the movie's scope.
Many fans bought tickets to theaters just to see the first
two-minute trailer and then left without watching the feature film
that followed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the home stretch, this is the last trailer for the
film,'' Ward said. The film will open in theaters May 21. ``We
wanted something that would both blow the fans away and sustain
them during the last stretch before the movie opens,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is difficult to draw a direct line between such a
promotion and increased Macintosh sales or Quicktime use, it is
still a victory for both Apple and Lucasfilm, said Tim Bajarin,
president of Creative Strategies in Cupertino, Calif. ``Apple gets
great cross-promotion and Lucas gets great promotion,'' he said.
``This is Steve calling in the chits from his Hollywood pals. It's
Steve Jobs at his promotional best.''

   &UR; PASTA ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE SPEAKS UP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Wednesday's Personals mention of a 1939 Life
magazine article asserting _ in a positive tone _ that  &UR; Joe &LR; 
 &UR; DiMaggio &LR;  preferred chow mein to spaghetti, pasta-defending
baseball fan  &UR; Jack Breibart &LR; , owner of the authoritative two-volume
``DiMaggio Albums,'' submits a number of citations:
</P>
<P>
   - A 1936 clipping from the New York World Telegram said, ``Joe
likes movies, but hasn't much use for books. He also likes
spaghetti.''
</P>
<P>
   - A 1938 clip from an unknown newspaper said DiMaggio ``goes
strong for spaghetti. Says his favorite dish is chippino (check)
which is an Italian concerto composed of cracked crab and spaghetti
sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   - According to the United Press in 1939, ``Joe likes movies and
spaghetti and hasn't much use for books.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no mention of whether he liked books &LR;  about &LR; 
spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY MATT GROENING HATES HOLLYWOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Matt Groening, &LR;  creator of ``The Simpsons'' and now
``Futurama,'' told Mother Jones magazine that working on the new
series ``has been by far the worst experience of my grown-up
life.'' He said it seemed to him typical of how people are treated
in Hollywood, ``but I thought I would have a bit more leeway since
I made Fox so much money with `The Simpsons.'''
</P>
<P>
   Groening said that ``any time I've been gracious, it's been seen
as a sign of weakness. And every time I've yelled back, I've been
treated with respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother Jones asked Groening what it was like working for
 &UR; Rupert Murdoch &LR; , and Groening said his boss had treated him

DANGEROUS OR CAMP, PROPAGANDA GOES INTO RERUNS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Peter S. Green is the East Europe correspondent of The
International Herald Tribune. 
 By PETER S. GREEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Major Jan Zeman was a Czech Communist
Columbo, Peter Falk in immaculately pressed fatigues, a savvy
television cop whose tough questions and dogged detective work
unraveled the greatest mysteries of the Czechoslovak Socialist
Republic and always got the party's man.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 to the mid-1980s, ``The 30 Cases of Major Zeman'' was
one of Czechoslovakia's greatest television hits, avidly followed
by party members and counter-revolutionaries alike.
</P>
<P>
   The premise was simple. Introduced in honor of the 30th
anniversary of Czechoslovakia's Communist police force, the show
took its plots from celebrated crimes, each reworked to turn party
members into heroes and the capitalists, kulaks (well-to-do farmers
who profited from the work of poorer peasants) and hippies into
enemies of socialism.
</P>
<P>
   When Vaclav Havel and the Velvet Revolution swept
Czechoslovakia's ossified Communist regime from power in 1989,
Major Zeman turned in his badge, and reruns of old American police
shows like ``Miami Vice'' and ``Hill Street Blues'' patrolled Czech
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   But now Major Zeman has been recalled to active duty. The public
service broadcaster Czech Television has decided to rebroadcast the
series sometime later this year, outraging some of the Communists'
real victims.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Czech Television's plans to show each episode alongside
a documentary telling the real story behind it, the victims fear
that reinstating ``Major Zeman'' will whitewash the crimes of
communism.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Confederation of Political Prisoners say they and
others like them were described as criminals in the show, and
events were distorted. Their fear is that if people are misinformed
about the events _ again _ they will never understand what really
happened.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the organization, who spent 10 years in Communist
prisons and the uranium mines as an enemy of the working class,
said he did not set much store by the idea that the documentaries
would rob ``Major Zeman'' of its power. For one thing, after the
episodes are over, many viewers may turn off their television sets,
never watching the documentaries that set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is acute because a decade after throwing out the
Communists, the Czechs remain deeply troubled by their past, yet
virtually silent. Efforts to try former Communist officials and
secret police officers have repeatedly been stymied by courts,
prosecutors and ambivalent government ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Three top Communists served short jail terms for oppressing
dissidents, but no senior officials were ever tried for inviting
the Soviet Army to lead the 1968 invasion that crushed the Prague
Spring Communist reform movement, and only late last year was the
first officer of the STB, the Communist secret police, convicted
for torturing a prisoner in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Last December the new interior minister, a longtime Communist
Party member, threatened to dismantle a special police unit that
had been slowly investigating Communist crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Many Czechs think, with some justification, that much of the
post-Communist elite owes its success to Communist-era old boy
networks. And a sense of national shame, because few Czechs dared
to resist the Communist regime while millions of Poles openly
backed Solidarity against Poland's Communist rulers, has left the
country uneasy about pursuing collaborators, but quick to denounce
anyone already publicly linked to the Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Banning the rebroadcast of ``Major Zeman,'' says Vladimir
Brabec, the actor who played the title role, would hardly help the
country come to terms with its past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like closing the door on something that the entire
Czechoslovak society went through,'' he said. ``We tend to want to
improve the past, but we were that way. We collaborated. We
couldn't all emigrate abroad; some of us had to live here and raise
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   At Czech Television, Martin Bezouska, director of programming,
agrees and dismisses the arguments over ``Major Zeman'' as ``a
media storm in a glass of water.'' (Czechs don't drink much tea.)
</P>
<P>
   `The Communists had this idea that when they wanted to hush
things up, they erased them from textbooks, locked them in safes
and thought they could be made to be forgotten,'' said Bezouska.
``But if things are left locked up, ultimately they are glorified
and acquire a mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   He argues that the show's dramatic appeal _ and its propaganda
power _ will wither when it is broadcast and viewers compare it
with the sophisticated American and British police series of the
late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political prisoners should be glad we are demythologizing
the whole business,'' said Bezouska.
</P>
<P>
   But the show does attract a following. When ``Major Zeman'' was
shown last year on a station in neighboring Slovakia, Czechs near
the border taped episodes and the show became a minor cult hit,
fueled by a mixture of nostalgia and pure camp.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasting the documentaries alongside the show also gives
Czech Television an opportunity that its new 30-something
management team believes it needs to atone for the station's past
as a Communist mouthpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to say that television worked as a part of the
Communist regime and that many things created here were merely lies
to support the regime,'' said Bezouska, ``There's no denying that,
and we have to face this fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Communist-era series have been shown without much fuss.
``The Hospital at the Edge of Town,'' for instance, showed an
idyllic Czech hospital and a country doctor, filmed at a time when
Czechs were dying because the government refused to spend hard
currency on imported drugs and when heavy pollution had given the
country's industrial heartland one of the highest infant mortality
rates in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Lacina, 28, a producer working on the documentaries, says he
understands the political prisoners' concerns but he, too, believes
they are misjudging the show's appeal. ```Major Zeman' is more
comic than dangerous for me,'' he said, ``and I think that it will
make that same impression on everyone from 0 to 40.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not shooting counterpropaganda, but in a very British
way we are simply saying this is how it was,'' said Lacina.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the show 20 years later, it's clear that Zeman fever is
not about to sweep the country. The films are well shot, but much
of the acting is wooden, the dialogue forgettable and the plotting
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come to preach; I came to investigate,'' Zeman tells
a group of peasants who fear a reactionary is plotting to destroy
their new Communist cooperative in an episode about recalcitrant
kulaks in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In Zeman's world, priests betray beautiful women, rock musicians
are all drug addicts and part-time garbage collectors, and Zeman's
own teen-age daughter is successfully recruited to fight the
omnipresent class enemy.
</P>
<P>
   A teen-ager when the show was first broadcast, Anastazie
Kudrnova, now 34 and editor of the Czech edition of Cosmopolitan
magazine, said the political prisoners had little to fear from the
return of the show. ``Major Zeman'' probably did more to undermine
communism than to glorify it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a source revealing things about things you never heard
of on socialistic television,'' she explained. ``Drugs _ God, we
had no clue about them. When we watched this show, it made us more
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Czechs lead a much less sheltered life than under
communism and are unlikely to be taken in by the show's simplistic
propaganda. And even if the show does become a national cult
classic (the polyester lapels and bell-bottoms of the 70s are the
latest retro craze among Prague's teen-agers and 20-somethings),
says Ms. Kudrnova, it won't bring back communism.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that especially for young people who barely
remember the old days and who are unlikely to hang around watching
the documentaries, rebroadcasting ``Major Zeman'' will doubtless
create a too-pretty picture of communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``History taught at school is simply not absorbed as easily as
pictures,'' said Adela Gjuricova, a political scientist at Charles
University in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Mejla Hlavsa, a rock guitarist whose band, Plastic People of the
Universe, is the villain in one of Zeman's last cases (and is
himself a one-time political prisoner), says he doesn't see any
real danger in broadcasting the show.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic People were portrayed in one episode as a
heroin-addicted, child-abusing gang of dissolute murderers who
hijacked a plane to West Germany, when in fact, all they wanted was
to be free to play their music and smoke a little marijuana. ``If
it contributed to the overthrow of communism, then that's good,''
Hlavsa says of the episode. ``But we had no ambition to overthrow
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hlavsa spent six months in jail for anti-Socialist agitation but
was released because unlike the rest of the band he hadn't gone to
college and was therefore a member of the working class.
</P>
<P>
   While the show may give viewers a distorted image of his band,
he says, he doesn't fear they will be duped into thinking communism
was all that great.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't really bother me,'' he said, ``because I think
there's a fair amount of intelligence out there.''

 KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the new speaker of the
House, may be trying to shed all comparisons with his mercurial
predecessor, Newt Gingrich. But he cannot avoid one of the central
problems that Gingrich faced in trying to run the House _ his party
appears hopelessly split, and with just a 10-vote majority, Hastert
has even less room to maneuver than Gingrich had.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert was overruled by party conservatives last week on aid to
help Central America rebuild from Hurricane Mitch. The party
conservatives held that foreign aid should be offset by cuts in
domestic programs, like food stamps. The week before, the speaker
signaled a compromise with moderates after they complained about
the proposed tax cut of 10-percent across the board, which had
become the party line, saying they wanted narrower tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert even seemed to be compromising with Democrats, who have
been pushing for an increase in the minimum wage. He suggested that
he did not have the power to stop it, only to shape the final
package.
</P>
<P>
   Two months into his accidental speakership _ he was chosen after
Robert Livingston of Louisiana renounced the post, admitting to
having had extramarital affairs _ Hastert has shown himself to be a
pragmatic and cautious politician, mindful that he needs to cement
the political center if he hopes to pass any legislation and keep
control with his whisker-thin majority.
</P>
<P>
   He is also more comfortable behind the scenes than on stage.
This has made it difficult for many outside of House Republicans to
get to know him and has raised the inevitable question: Are his
initial steps toward compromise the unintended result of an
inexperienced and tentative leader? Or are they the deliberate
strategy of a shrewd negotiator who knows how to piece together
legislation and will ultimately undercut Democratic accusations
that this is a do-nothing Congress?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too soon to say,'' said a Republican House member who
supports Hastert. The congressman said the new speaker was slowly
consolidating his power, vote by vote. ``Unlike Newt, who got up
every day and told us how to save the world, Denny is calmly trying
to stake out a position where 218 will agree on taxes, 218 will
agree on health care, 218 will agree on education. It's not
glamorous, but he is dealing with congressmen one on one.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day, Hastert must confront the cold reality that five of
his 222 Republicans could abandon him on a vote and, assuming
Democrats hold together, his party's legislative agenda could
collapse. Then the Republicans could lose control of the House.
They could lose the House anyway, of course, but some legislative
achievements would help gird against becoming forever known as the
party of impeachment, the party that could not govern.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes could not be higher. And the calculus _ to balance so
many competing interests and hold the majority _ must be precise.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this is bean counting, not vision,'' said Marshall
Wittmann, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
research group. ``Denny Hastert is meeting with everyone and going
over the schedule and counting heads. `How many do we have for this
rule? How do we calibrate this?' It's a green-eyeshade form of
legislating. You can't spare a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   This plays to Hastert's strength. His previous role in the
House, as deputy whip, was to take the temperature of his
colleagues on bills coming to the floor and round up votes by
applying pressure points to his colleagues and tinkering with the
bills to bring them into alignment. He used these skills most
notably on health care legislation in 1996, when Republicans got an
experiment in Medical Savings Accounts added to the
Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation allowing workers to keep their
health-care coverage if they change jobs. This took endless
meetings and a careful, member-by-member attention, a modus
operandi that Hastert has brought with him to the speaker's office.
</P>
<P>
   He has also brought with him the instincts of the coach he once
was. By design and temperament, he shuns the limelight, preferring
to promote his team, not himself. Toward this end, he has
reinvested authority in his committee chairmen, defusing and
decentralizing the power that Gingrich had amassed.

<P>
   ``He will restore the speakership to the traditional mold,''
said Rep. J.D. Hayworth, a conservative Republican from Arizona.
``That means using the tools of the institution which over time
have worked rather than try to reinvent the process. Using
committees. Spending time on the floor. Reaching out on the
telephone. Being accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has been accessible not only to members but to
fund-raisers. He has been hobnobbing with Republican donors across
the country and lobbyists in Washington in a coordinated attempt to
keep dollars flowing into the party's congressional campaign
committee, which plunged into debt in last year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   All of this private activity leaves little time for developing a
public persona, and Hastert remains relatively anonymous. This,
combined with his conciliatory style and his continued role as a
vote counter, has contributed to a perception that he has no
specific agenda of his own, beyond his oft-stated desire to make
the trains run on time. That, in turn, has raised some concerns
within the House that he has ceded big-picture decision-making and
pre-eminence on Capitol Hill to the Senate, particularly on tax and
budget matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is getting up to speed every day,'' said Rep. Thomas Ewing,
a fellow Illinois Republican and long-time friend of Hastert's from
their roommate days in the state Legislature. ``When you're working
with such a slim majority, you really have to keep some
flexibility. If he had a 20- or 30-vote majority and a little more
experience, he would probably have more definite ideas, but his
strength right now is not being hamstrung by feeling `it has to be
my way.'''
</P>
<P>
   He is operating with virtually no margin for error, a task
complicated by the rift in his party. The moderate Republicans in
the House _ 30 to 40 members, most of them from the Northeast _ are
flexing a new-felt power. It stems from their near-party-line vote
on Dec. 19 to impeach President Clinton, even though a majority of
constituents in their districts supported the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's next to impossible for leaders to go to the moderates and
say `You've got to cast a hard vote for me,''' said Wittmann of the
Heritage Foundation. ``They've already cast it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they need to assert their independence, and Hastert appears
sensitive to their needs. After they protested the 10-percent tax
cut as too steep and proposed alternatives, Hastert all but
conceded it would not fly.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, the moderate Connecticut Republican who led
a dozen of her colleagues against the 10-percent tax cut, praised
him later. ``He's a good strategist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert must satisfy the moderates while not antagonizing
the Southern-dominated conservative wing of his party. There is a
large reservoir of goodwill toward Hastert on both sides. But
privately, some conservatives say they are worried that he is
making tactical blunders by ceding conservative goals too quickly
and that his conciliatory instincts will give them little with
which to distinguish themselves from Democrats in next year's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need definitional bills that pass but that Clinton vetos so
we can say, `Here are the differences between us and Gore,''' said
one conservative, anticipating the presidential candidacy of Vice
President Al Gore. ``That was the beauty of the 10-percent cut. Now
Hastert has undermined it without even making an effort to sell
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing his own majority is fragile, Hastert has been diligently
seeking Democratic support for various bills on taxes, education
and missile defense, hoping that for every Republican vote he might
lose, he can gain a Democrat vote. ``Quite frankly,'' he has said,
``with the margin of votes that we have, we need to do as much
stuff as we can on a bipartisan basis.''
</P>
<P>
   But he cannot for a moment forget that the Democrats are
determined to retake the House and replace him with Democratic
leader Dick Gephardt. Despite Hastert's friendly public overtures _
he has met not just with Democratic leaders but with the various
Democratic factions _ the Democrats smell blood.
</P>
<P>
   And many in the House expect that as election-year politics come
into focus, the Democrats will decide that they have little to gain
by helping Hastert and the Republicans look good.

COMMENTARY: THE DIPLOMATIC TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Falsehood, withholding critical information, distortion,
cover-up. Diplomacy, a branch of government that often makes the
difference between war and peace, uses these tools at least as
often to deceive its own people as a potential enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats working for dictatorships or for democracies often
share a common operational philosophy _ what we do or say is good
for the country and our leader, in power by election or force. So,
utterly content with their wisdom, they believe that what they
choose the people should not know is exactly what the people have
no business to know.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Citizens of dictatorships take this for granted. I have never
met one foolish enough to be surprised that his government was
routinely misleading him. The diplomats and their master barely
ever trouble to deny it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in the democracies diplomats pretend indignation at the
idea. Americans by the million announce their mistrust of
government. But even though they know that their government is
unlikely to execute or torture them for protesting concealments
that could lead to war or military weakness, they remain passive
and unquestioning.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many tell themselves that the government is simply guarding
national security or counterintelligence. Sometimes that is true.
But often it is not security interests that are being protected but
the political interests of the existing administration, and the
embarrassment of seeing policy failure revealed _ or seeing no
policy at all.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Emphasis: This attitude is not true of all U.S. diplomats. At
home and abroad, I have found diplomats risking their careers to
fight cover-ups. But there is enough pressure and self-interest in
going along so that some form of deliberate governmental distortion
is almost always taking place, at the moment at least three that
should shake American public apathy.
</P>
<P>
   1. Since 1995, high government officials knew of evidence that
China had stolen one of the top secrets in the U.S. armory _ the
ability to make small nuclear weapons that could be launched
simultaneously at multiple targets. Incredibly, virtually nothing
was done until The New York Times broke the story last week.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In two highly touted summit meetings with China, President
Clinton said nothing to the Politburo, or the American and Chinese
publics. To tell the story would have exposed as sickeningly false
the myth he prattles to Americans _ appeasement of China is making
it a ``strategic'' partner of America.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, his silence made him a different kind of partner for
China _a party after the crime.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Clinton inherited President George Bush's historic error _
allowing Saddam Hussein to rule after the Iraqi defeat in the gulf
war. He also inherited the most important arms inspection machinery
of our time _ the U.N. commission preventing Iraq from making
weapons of mass destruction.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saddam rules after six years of Clinton's presidency. And the
commission is dead.
</P>
<P>
   It was killed by such friends as France, Russia, China and U.N.
officials. All the while it was dying in closed U.N. meetings,
Washington kept saying that behind those doors was a strong
consensus to keep the commission strong. Simply untrue.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. The NATO treaty was drawn up, and signed by the United
States, to protect Western Europe against the Soviet Union. Now the
United States and other NATO members use the alliance to bomb or
threaten countries involved in a civil and religious war, as in
Bosnia, or a movement for relief and independence, as in Serbia's
Kosovo province.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At what point were the new NATO responsibilities created, and at
what point did Americans agree to sign up? Americans do not ask,
nor do they ask how the disarmament commission died while it was
supposed to be under U.S. protection, or how long U.S. forces will
remain in Bosnia or Serbia, whether Clinton has the faintest idea,
or what the criteria for further local interventions will be, and
what other spots might be selected _ if Clinton and his diplomats
have the faintest idea. Do Americans get to choose? And what are
his plans for Saddam's exit? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. public does not care about what they are told and
when, if they are told at all, shouldn't Congress demand the
answers? Or would that be considered nervy rudeness toward
diplomats, their working habits and our elected leader?

JUSTICE OFFICIAL SAYS DEPARTMENT NOT TRYING TO HAMPER STARR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. on Thursday
bluntly dismissed allegations that the Justice Department has begun
to examine Kenneth Starr's tactics solely to hamper the independent
counsel's investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He was reacting to claims leveled by Robert J. Bittman, a former
top deputy to Starr who helped lead the investigation of Clinton's
unsuccessful efforts to conceal his extramarital affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Bittman, in a televised interview earlier this week, said he
believes the department's examination of Starr is intended to
distract the investigator as he continues to weigh whether Clinton
broke the law during the Lewinsky scandal and in a failed Arkansas
land deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as the closer we get to the president, and that the
investigation gets to the president, that they have all of a sudden
insisted on conducting a very intrusive investigation into the
heart of what we have been doing since the Lewinsky scandal broke
in January of 1998,'' Bittman said Wednesday on ABC's ``Good
Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Feb. 12 acquitted Clinton of House impeachment
charges following Starr's report that the president lied to a
federal grand jury and obstructed justice in his failed attempt to
keep his White House trysts with Lewinsky secret. Bittman left
Starr's office the week before the Senate vote to take a job with a
Richmond, Va., law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Holder disputed Bittman's allegations against the Justice
Department, saying Attorney General Janet Reno's motives for
examining Starr's conduct are not political. Rather, the attorney
general's inquiry is part of her legal obligation to examine
credible allegations of wrongdoing by an independent counsel, said
Holder, Reno's second in command.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me ... that we have a duty that's laid out pretty
clearly in the independent counsel statute to investigate matters,
or at least to consider whether or not to investigate matters that
have been raised with regard to the conduct of independent
counsels,'' Holder said. ``And I'll stand on the record of this
department as to whether or not we have the ability to do those
kinds of things. That should not be read as meaning that we are
conducting an investigation, but we certainly take the allegations
that we have received seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department disclosed last month that it was
examining whether Starr violated the agency's ethics rules in
several matters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the allegations brought against Starr is the claim that
the independent counsel's office in January 1998 offered Lewinsky
immunity from prosecution in return for her testimony without her
lawyer present. Department rules require that lawyers be on hand
when immunity deals are discussed.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also is examining whether Starr himself
had improper contact with lawyers for Paula Jones, whose sexual
harassment lawsuit against Clinton led investigators to Lewinsky.
Starr, a veteran Supreme Court advocate, consulted with Jones'
lawyers before they successfully argued before the justices in 1997
that presidents may be sued while in office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who has denied any wrongdoing in his continuing
five-year-old investigation of the president, has met with Reno and
Holder to discuss how an examination of his office would be handled
and whether an outside attorney should be brought in to conduct the
inquiry. The attorney general has not reached a decision on these
matters, Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, an attorney general can dismiss an
independent counsel for ``good cause.'' That statutory provision
gives the attorney general the authority to examine an independent
counsel's conduct to determine if there is sufficient cause to fire
him, Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Senate's acquittal of the president, Starr could
still bring criminal charges against Clinton in the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Starr is continuing to investigate whether the
president committed perjury when he told a jury he knew nothing
about a fraudulent loan that helped fund Whitewater, an Ozarks land
deal in which Clinton and his wife, Hillary, were partners. Starr's
investigation of that $300,000 federally backed Small Business
Administration loan has resulted in the 1996 fraud conviction of
Clinton's partners, Susan McDougal and her ex-husband James
McDougal, and former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker.

FLEET WEIGHING IPO FOR ITS INTERNET BROKERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Seeking to capitalize on the explosive growth in
on-line investing, Fleet Financial Group Inc. said Thursday that it
was considering a public offering for its Internet brokerage,
Suretrade.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, which also said it was pondering joint venture
opportunities for Suretrade, could earn upwards of $600 million
from a sale, according to Bill Burnham, an on-line analyst at CS
First Boston in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, which acquired Suretrade last year when it paid $1.6
billion for its owner, discount stock brokerage Quick &AMP; Reilly
Group Inc., joins others looking to tap into investor enthusiasm
for on-line investment shops. Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc., a
New York investment bank and brokerage, and Toronto Dominion, a
Canadian bank, have been exploring ways to take their Web-based
brokerages public.
</P>
<P>
   Suretrade, launched in October 1997, is a no-frills,
fast-growing shop that caters to traders who buy and sell
securities on line frequently. The company offers top-notch
investment research, interactive charts, and, with a rock-bottom
charge of $7.95 per transaction of 5,000 shares, some of the lowest
prices around. Suretrade customers can also trade Treasury bills,
corporate bonds, and options.
</P>
<P>
   The price for such cheap trading is bare-bones service.
Suretrade has little customer service or technical support for
investors who need handholding and advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are unusual in that they have focused on the pure
Internet user and very active traders,'' Burnham said. ``It's a
very lean, no-frills service at a very low price.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic retail trading, in which ordinary investors buy and
sell securities via the Web, is one of the investment world's
fastest growing areas. By various estimates, Internet brokerages
now account for one quarter to one third of all stock trades made
by individual investors. Fleet said Suretrade, whose technical
offices are in Lincoln, R.I., would turn its first profit this
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 12 months, Suretrade's accounts and trading volume
have tripled. Now with 250,000 accounts, including 45,000 opened in
the last quarter, the company does 11,500 trades a day, and
accounts for 2.9 percent of the on-line brokerage market. The
company, with customer assets of $1.1 billion, will record revenue
of around $60 million this year, Burnham said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts speculate that Fleet, New England's largest
bank, wants to spin off Suretrade to focus more on Quick &AMP; Reilly,
the nation's third largest discount brokerage. While a Fleet
spokesman declined to say when Suretrade might be spun off,
analysts predicted a sale sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the way the market is, you'd want to take it public as
soon as possible,'' Burnham said, adding that he saw an offering in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Web-only brokerage stocks are hot. The biggest online-only
brokerage, E(asterisk)Trade, has seen its stock soar since going
public in 1996, and now has a market capitalization of around $6
billion. Next in line is Ameritrade, which issued shares in early
1997 and is now worth around $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   How much Fleet might earn from selling Suretrade will depend
upon how those two top brokerage stocks perform in coming months,
according to Burnham. On a day in which Wall Street hit new highs,
Fleet shares were lukewarm to the prospect of a sale, edging up
only 11/16 to close at 44 5/8 Thursday on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Suretrade has drawn most of its customers from outside Quick &AMP;
Reilly, which has its own Internet investing service, called Quick
&AMP; Reilly Internet. The average Suretrade customer is 34 years old,
has investable assets of $48,000, and trades 26 times a year,
compared to the average Quick &AMP; Reilly Internet customer, who is 43
years old, has investable assets of $168,000, and trades 21 times a
year, according to company data.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors Inc., an online brokerage consulting firm in
Concord, Mass., noted that Suretrade had customer margin debits _
interest-bearing loans that clients take out from Suretrade to
finance their stocktrading _ of $225 million. That hefty figure,
Gomez said, is a big income-earner for Suretrade, and could make
the firm ``an attractively priced play for any firm interested in
entering the online brokerage business.''

`THE RAGE: CARRIE II': UNINSPIRED UPDATE, UNINTENTIONAL LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Nobody is expecting much from the sequel to ``Carrie.'' The only
star from the original 1976 film who's back for ``The Rage: Carrie
2'' is Amy Irving _ but, of course, the other major characters died
in that unfortunate conflagration at the prom. The director is new;
the screenwriter is new, and Stephen King, whose early novel was
the basis of the first film, is nowhere to be found. The film
itself is an uninspired update with video cameras, sexual
frankness, margaritas and tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel, the teen-age outcast who doesn't know she has
telekinetic powers, although things are always rattling and shaking
whenever she's upset, is played by Emily Bergl, who looks like a
cross between the young Ms. Irving and Christina Ricci. This is a
pretty interesting cross. Ms. Bergl is also appearing in New York
in the Roundabout Theater's new production of ``The Lion in
Winter,'' with Stockard Channing and Laurence Fishburne, so she
probably won't end up typecast.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Irving plays Sue Snell, her original character two decades
later, now a guidance counselor at Bates High School. Sue comes to
Rachel's emotional aid right after Rachel's best friend, Lisa,
jumps to her death from the school roof. Sue soon notices Rachel's
ability to make objects explode and fly _ just like Carrie! _ and
tries to help before the power gets out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Rachel is falling for the good-looking Jesse (Jason
London), who is a football player and part of the popular crowd,
but nice. And the other football players, the kind of guys who keep
a log of how many girls each of them has seduced, assigning points
according to difficulty and desirability, are planning a nasty
surprise for Rachel. Most of the entire student body of the high
school end up in one place, a party at a rich boy's house,
completely oblivious to what lies in store if Rachel gets really
upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rage'' is the kind of film that gets unintentional laughs.
They happen when Sue takes Rachel to the site of the burned-out old
high school, where nobody has even cleaned up the rubble after 20
years, and every time there's a flashback to the original movie,
mostly showing Sissy Spacek covered in blood.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, this is typical B-movie making. The actors are
attractive and do credible jobs, and in the tradition of the
original film, there's one really good scare at the end.
</P>
<P>

LABOR TO WAGE POLITICAL INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The AFL-CIO will spend $40 million over the next two
years on political campaigns aimed at raising public awareness of
such issues as Social Security funding, Medicare, and the minimum
wage, AFL-CIO president John Sweeney said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who spoke to reporters after a private meeting at the
Federal Reserve Board in Boston, said the union federation would
endorse any Democrat or moderate Republican who supports policies
that help working families.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the AFL-CIO money goes to political candidates or
parties,'' Sweeney said. ``It goes to educate and teach working
people how to be good consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials are hoping to register 2.8 million new voters by
the year 2000, and put some 2,000 union members on election ballots
in political races across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said the AFL-CIO, a federation of 79 unions, is
considering a proposal by moderate Republicans that would increase
the minimum wage by $1 over three years and adjust wages
automatically to changes in the cost of living. Democrats have
proposed increasing the minimum hourly wage by $1 over a two-year
period only.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on his speech before the Federal Reserve,
Sweeney said it was prompted by ``a strong interest in monetary
policy and how it affects working families . . . Productivity is
up, chief executives' pay is up, but workers' wages are only
moderately improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, in a statement made earlier Thursday, also criticized
General Dynamics' proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of Newport News
Shipbuilding as a ``bad deal for the American shipbuilding industry
and for tens of thousands of high-skilled workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Newport News, Va., disclosed last month it had received an
unsolicited $38.50-a-share bid from Virginia-based General
Dynamics. A merger of the two firms would bring together the
industry's only two makers of nuclear-powered submarines. The new
company would control more than 70 percent of all US Naval spending
on ships and submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said the AFL-CIO had commissioned an economic study that
shows there would be a dramatic decline in competitiveness within
the markets for military and commercial ships if General Dynamics
acquires Newport News.

TEXAS DEMOCRATS SEEK TO ALTER BUSH TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAIME CASTILLO  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Democratic leaders in the Texas Senate vowed
Thursday to fight any effort to reduce property taxes until the
Legislature addresses the needs of public schools, health care and
other areas affecting children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some to whom a tax cut is the number one priority,''
said Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos, D-Austin, chairman of the Senate
Democratic Caucus. ``We say that's approaching things backwards.
Let's take care of the needs of our kids first and then talk about
a fair tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, attended by about a dozen Democrats, takes
dead aim at one of Republican Gov. George W. Bush's initiatives: a
$2 billion property tax cut to be funded from the state's $5.6
billion budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also supports sending an additional $1 billion to
local school districts to be used at their discretion, possibly for
teacher pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democrats, who up to now have provided little
resistance to other items on the governor's agenda, said they are
ready to make a stand.
</P>
<P>
   They fear a $2 billion tax cut would eat up most of what is
going to be left from the surplus once lawmakers account for issues
such as increased enrollment in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Budget specialists have said about $3.3 billion will be needed
to keep up with the growth in schools and other items in the
budget, leaving $2.3 billion for discretionary spending.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats want to see a greater commitment to pay raises for
teachers, college scholarships and day-care programs before they
will support tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're becoming frustrated,'' Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston,
said. ``We've been very cooperative with the leadership in the
Senate and the governor's office. But we cannot continue to allow
the leadership to not make children our highest priority.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bush spokesman said education was the governor's priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor believes we must first meet basic needs, dedicate
the lion's share of new money to public education and then send
money back to the taxpayers,'' said Scott McClellan, a Bush
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's events came just days before Sen. Teel Bivins,
R-Amarillo, is expected to introduce a school finance bill that is
reported to include pay raises for teachers and a property tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Greg Luna, D-San Antonio, said he understood the package
earmarks $1.5 billion for property tax relief and $1 billion for
teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, I don't find it acceptable,'' said Luna, the
vice chairman of the Senate Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said he was taken off guard by the criticism,
particularly after he shared aspects of the plan with his
Democratic colleagues to get their input.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply regret the organized, partisan response,'' he said.
``This is a work in progress that I still hope will receive
bipartisan support in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said he had no intention of filing the school-finance
plan until it had widespread support.

SNOW GOOSE OVERPOPULATION PITS PROTECTIONISTS, GOVERNMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Canada and the United States are priming to wage
all-out war on the migratory snow goose, arguing that an Arctic
ecological disaster may be in the offing unless hunters can shoot
half the species, or millions of birds, from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   But a coalition of anti-hunting groups in both countries, led by
the Humane Society of the US, is seeking to stop a controversial
spring hunt already under &UR;  &LR; way in the American South, one expected
to be extended to Canada next month as millions of the graceful
white waterfowl with black-tipped wings beat their way north. As
they return to their nesting grounds, the birds eat a swath through
the grain farmlands of the Midwest and Canadian prairies.
</P>
<P>
   The animal rights groups go to US District Court in Washington
Freiday for an injunction to block what they describe as
indiscriminate slaughter. A similar suit is being readied in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disturbing effort on the part of the US and Canada
to destroy millions of birds,'' said Lesli Bisgould, a Toronto
lawyer representing Canadian animal rights activists and Dene
Indians angered by the hunt. ``We are talking about wildlife
destruction on a scale not seen in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   But many wildlife experts and environmental organizations
support the expanded hunt, arguing that an abundance of food and
reduced pressure from hunters has caused populations of snow geese
to explode to dangerous levels, with disastrous results for the
fragile Arctic coastal marshes where the birds hatch their goslings
in late spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers of snow geese have gone out of control,'' said
Bruce Batt, chief biologist with Ducks Unlimited, the world's
largest waterfowl conservation group. ``The birds, when they reach
the breeding grounds, are feeding voraciously, stripping vegetation
and destroying a fragile ecosystem at an alarming rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Batt is chairman of the Arctic Goose Habitat Working Group. That
international team of biologists and other scientists has been
studying the problem for years, and has concluded that only a
massive hunt over several years _ one meant to reduce the numbers
of snow geese in North America by half, or about 2.5 million birds
_ represents the best way to save a narrow strip of marshland that
runs for 1,200 miles along the westen edge of Hudson Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a serious and potentially catastrophic ongoing loss of
habitat in the Arctic, one that could affect a large variety of
species, not just snow geese,'' said Steve Wendt, chief for
migratory birds for the Canadian Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Audubon Society, hardly a pro-hunting organization, has
come to agree with that assessment. ``Audubon's concern goes beyond
that of the snow geese themselves to the other species that are
tied to this ecosystem,'' said Genevieve Thompson in a statement
from the Society endorsing the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Snow geese were nearly wiped out by over-hunting and habitat
destruction earlier in this century. But populations of the three
snow goose species _ the greater snow goose, the lesser snow goose,
and the Ross's goose _ have tripled since the 1960s, to more than 5
million birds.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason, according to wildlife specialists, is that a
dramatic post-World War II expansion of cropland in Louisiana,
Texas and northern Mexico _ winter home of the snow geese _ has in
effect created huge new feeding grounds on which the birds can
gorge on leftover rice, sorghum, corn and soybeans. So much
easily-obtained food is available that the geese are waxing fat,
sassy and physically far more capable of surviving the long
migration back north to Canadian nesting grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Millions more snow geese arriving back in the Arctic marshes
means millions more serrated beaks grubbing away at the
nutrient-loaded roots of grass and sedge, upon which the waterfowl
survive upon reaching the nesting grounds. But as the grasses are
gobbled away, the narrow strips of marsh along the northern shore
are eroding away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans caused the problem by altering the birds' habitat, and
now it's up to humans to fix the problem,'' Batt said. ``Increased
hunting is the most efficent, most humane way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The spring migration of snow geese is just getting underway down
south.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Migratory Birds Convention between the US and Canada,
goose hunting is forbidden in both countries beginning March 10
until early fall to permit waterbirds safe passage back to breeding
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   But the US Interior Department last month gave approval to the
first spring hunt for snow geese across 28 states in the South and
Midwest in the hopes that hundreds of thousands more birds will be
bagged before making it back to the threatened shorelands. Canada
is readying to legalize a spring hunt beginning April 15, about the
time the snow geese start flocking north across the prairie
provinces and on to the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   Even more controversial are new rules allowing snow goose
hunters to spread bait, use taped goose calls to trick unwary
birds, and to allow hunters to pack their shotguns with more
cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights groups are aghast at the prospect, comparing the
hunt to wholesale slaughters of bird and mammal species undertaken
by commercial hunters in the 19th century. Aside from their
opposition to hunting, they claim that the massive cull represents
bad ecological practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy to think that taking a huge whack out of the
population of just one species will somehow correct an imbalance,''
said Liz White, director of the Toronto-based Animal Alliance of
Canada, one of the groups going to court to fight the hunt. ``All
it is going to do is carve out another hole in the ecosystem. Snow
geese have been doing just fine for millenia. It's arrogant for
humans to suggest we can save geese only by slaughtering geese.''

 &HT;    Forsyth County to list of fast growing counties
 &HT;    By Lucy Soto
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Forsyth County, making perhaps the final step from
metro Atlanta's Northside outpost to booming suburb, was named the
nation's fastest-growing county in a report issued today by the
U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 2,426 U.S. counties, four of the top 10 fastest-growing
were in Georgia, two each were in Colorado and Texas, and one each
was in Nevada and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Forsyth has hit the top spot, although
it's made the fastest-growing list before. The county's population
soared 13 percent over the year, from 76,213 to 86,130. The ranking
comes as the county struggles to cope with the phenomenal growth.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, Paulding and Dawson counties ranked fourth, sixth and
seventh, respectively, in population growth from 1997 to 1998. And
while Henry and Paulding have made the Census' annual list of top
growers, this was Dawson's first time.
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth grew a staggering 95.4 percent from 1990 to 1998,
followed by Henry at 78.2 percent and Paulding at 76.7 percent,
according to the Census.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Forsyth's new residents have come from Fulton and other
metro counties. Mark Vitner, a vice president and economist with
First Union National Bank, says Forsyth's growth is an extension of
the tremendous development boom in north Fulton.
</P>
<P>
   People rushed to neighboring Forsyth County when land became
scarce and expensive in north Fulton. Highway access on Ga. 400 and
the opening of North Point Mall made the area attractive to
homebuyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had to travel all the way to Perimeter Mall or Lenox
to go shopping or work, then Forsyth would not be so attractive,''
Vitner said. ``Now there's North Point Mall and all sorts of office
parks, so that people can work and shop in the North Point area and
easily commute to and from Forsyth County.''
</P>
<P>
   Steady growth has been a fixture in the metro area for several
years and some of the larger counties continued to make big gains
over the year. Gwinnett, for example, added 21,677 people from 1997
to 1998. Cobb added 14,889 and Fulton 13,516.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that the Atlanta metropolitan area is the
second-fastest growing in the country after L.A.,'' said University
of Georgia demographer Doug Bachtel. ``So, it's really no
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was a bit of one for Larry Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm, we knew we were growing fast, but I guess we didn't know
what the comparison would be,'' said Robertson, the soft-spoken
county manager in Dawson, the county just north of Forsyth
straddling the end of Ga. 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's people wanting to get up here to get larger
tracts of land, to get one to five acres. People that don't want to
be in the cramped subdivisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Quality of life is the name of the game. And while that might
mean different things to different people, Bachtel says most
newcomers talk about it in terms of schools, taxes and open space.
Ironically, those are the first things to change when growth comes
to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge part of this growth is new people moving in,'' Bachtel
said. ``Those people have kids in school, and they have dogs and
cars. They make this huge immediate impact on a community, and they
sort of begin to suck up services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local officials are always playing catch up because they
can't make ends meet on just residential property taxes,'' he said.
``Then, all these new people move in and say they don't want any
industrial development because they want to keep the county as they
found it.''
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy of development in Forsyth is pretty clear outside
Pappy Red's BBQ on Ga. 20 near Ga. 400. Cars slow to a crawl every
morning and evening. And just try making a ``quick'' run to the
nearby Wal-Mart or the Home Depot on a Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing pretty good, but nothing like we used to,'' said
Chip Garner, who opened up his restaurant six years ago. ``Five
restaurants opened up near us. We were the only one there for a
while. ... What's happening is a good thing I guess. I'm not sure
if the county has planned for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth County commissioners hope not to make the top 10 list
again next year. They imposed a 16-month rezoning moratorium in
November because the county was overwhelmed with traffic and was
hitting its sewer capacity limit. Still, they already have enough
property being developed to keep workers busy well past that
deadline. County officials also are exempting some projects from
the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth hopes to complete a 10-million-gallon-a-day water
treatment plant next year, and is trying to persuade the state to
give it a permit to build a wastewater treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that being at the top puts a lot of pressure on
our infrastructure,'' said County Manager Stevie Mills, who was
born and raised in Forsyth. ``We have virtually no sewer capacity
to offer for commercial and industrial growth, much less the
residential that's going on.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, CENTRAL AMERICAN LEADERS AGREE FOR MORE COOPERATION
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTIGUA, Guatemala _ Wrapping up the most extensive trip to
Central America by any U.S. president, Bill Clinton joined 13
leaders from seven countries here Thursday to adopt a regional
agreement for a future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The nonbinding agreement sets out a series of principles related
to promoting free trade, restraining drug and human smuggling,
calling for equal treatment of all immigrants and promoting human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's four-day visit to Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and
Guatemala -- viewing damage caused last October and dispensing tens
of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid -- highlighted the
transformation of the United States' role in the region.
</P>
<P>
   From the role of ``Big Brother'' and financier of militaristic
authoritarian regimes -- which resisted communist advances at the
expense of human rights -- Clinton said the United States was now
part of a ``new partnership'' with Central America based on shared
democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still face daunting challenges,'' Clinton said at the
beginning of the summit here in a converted 17th-Century monastery
in the old Guatemalan colonial capital in the Guatemalan highlands.
``But now we face them with a unique sense of solidarity and common
commitment to freedom, to democracy, to open markets and to meeting
the demands of our people for better schools, safer streets and
wider opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Clinton here were the presidents of Guatemala, El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica and the Dominican
Republic and the prime minister of Belize.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was committed to lowering trade barriers to
establish a free trade zone which eventually would encompass the
entire western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has asked the U.S. Congress to reform the
Reagan-era Caribbean Basin Initiative, or CBI, to eliminate tariffs
on non-textile exports and textile exports using materials from the
United States assembled in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed by the administration as a critical tool for the
rebuilding of Central America, Caribbean countries already received
certain preferential trade privileges under the terms of the CBI.
Those countries have complained, however, that Mexico got an even
better deal under the provisions of the five-year-old North
American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. The Caribbean countries
have been seeking new terms that would put them on parity with
Mexico. However, such a change was resisted by Congress during the
last congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the regional leaders he was committed to reforming
U.S. immigration policy to treat refugees from all countries
``equitably,'' while giving special attention to the needs of
countries that suffered most from Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is working on regulations to make it easier
for immigrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to seek
permanent residency status. But Clinton said congressional action
probably will be needed to equalize the treatment of those refugees
with that of Nicaraguan refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the law provides more favorable treatment to
immigrants from Nicaragua and Honduras than from El Salvador and
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States supports greater debt relief for
Central America. In their final communique, the leaders said debt
relief was critical _ particularly for Nicaragua and Honduras _ to
sustain development.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders muted their disappointment at Clinton's failure to
get swift congressional approval for $956 million in reconstruction
aid, freer access to U.S. markets and a suspension of the
deportation of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in virtually every stop on this goodwill tour, Clinton
called for a ``common struggle against violence and drug
trafficking and drug abuse, to shared responsibility for the care
of our environment, with education of our children and for the
health of our people.''

US DEBT TO UN PORTENDS TROUBLE, GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID BEARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States may lose its vote in the UN General Assembly
at year's end because the world's only superpower has refused to
relinquish its status as the body's biggest deadbeat, the head of
the independent United Nations Foundation said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in an increasingly bad situation with the United
Nations in New York. US credibility is declining significantly,''
Tim Wirth, a former US undersecretary of state and Democratic
senator from Colorado, said at a meeting of Globe editors.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, created last year by media billionaire Ted
Turner, is seeking to build grass-roots support to erase
Washington's $1 billion-plus debt in unpaid dues and assessments to
the world body.
</P>
<P>
   Wirth says an aggressive effort is needed to counter opposition
among some Republican lawmakers and to emphasize to Democrats and
the Clinton administration the urgency of payment. A sticking point
for years for many Republican lawmakers has been the world body's
funding for female reproductive programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard work. It's really pushing uphill,'' said Wirth,
acknowledging the lack of a US ambassador to the United Nations for
nearly a year and the administration's focus on issues such as
Kosovo and Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the United States barely retained its seat on the UN
General Assembly by making a token payment of some back dues, but
it must make a significantly greater payment by the end of the year
to maintain its voting status in the assembly, Wirth said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of 1996, the United States has been without a spot
on the UN budget committee, which is akin to a congressional
appropriations committee. Washington still has a permanent seat on
the 15-member Security Council, which makes most of the world
body's important day-by-day decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Washington owes nearly two-thirds of the total amount of dues in
arrears to the United Nations. In turn, the body has been unable to
pay some countries who have sent peacekeepers to world hotspots,
most notably Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the Brits are carrying us,'' Wirth said. ``A lot of
the best friends of the United States are getting very angry with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation will administer Turner's 10-year, $1 billion gift
to help carry out UN programs and tackle world problems, and it is
joining with business leaders and the United Nations Association to
push for payment of the UN debt. The issue has the support of all
former US presidents and secretaries of state, Wirth said, and the
group has hired former US representatives Vic Fazio and Vin Weber
to lobby their former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The group also has conducted polls that show broad American
support for UN funding, which has gone toward peacekeeping,
eradication of infectious diseases, and children's issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy at a focus group said, `I really like the UN. It keeps
things at a simmer instead of a boil,' '' Wirth said. ``That's a
nice way of saying it.''

</HEADLINE>

   AUSTIN, Texas _ As Gov. George W. Bush declared a potential
wildfire emergency in 167 of Texas' 254 counties Thursday,
Agriculture Commissioner Susan Combs said the persistent drought
may drive up to 15 percent of the state's agricultural producers
out of business this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture, which is the second-largest industry in the
state, is truly in peril by drought,'' Combs said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with Bush and Combs, state officials said
Texas' drought conditions currently are at the stage they were last
year in May and June. Bush said Texans need to conserve water,
reduce fire risks and prepare firefighting equipment for an
expected outbreak of wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drought has a head start on Texas this year,'' Bush said.
``All this adds up to a drought that could be as bad or worse than
the devastation we experienced last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Combs said the drought caused by the weather system known as La
Nina has combined with low commodity prices to deal a probably
fatal blow to even well-run agricultural businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Combs said Louisiana Agriculture &AMP; Forestry Commissioner Bob
Odom expects 15 percent of his state's producers to go out of
business this year, and she said she expects the Texas toll to be
between 10 percent and 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Combs said she is hearing anecdotal Texas stories about farmers
and ranchers who have been unable to renew bank loans to begin
their spring production. She said she also has heard that the
managers of Falcon and Amistad reservoirs likely will cut off
irrigation May 1 if a major rainfall does not occur.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton is in trouble, Combs said, as well as every crop in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley. Ranchers are in danger of losing what
little grass they have to wildfire, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is asking President Clinton for an emergency
declaration for counties along and west of Interstate 35 and
Interstate 37 to help the state to position firefighting teams and
gear. A declaration would allow the state to apply for federal
matching funds that would pay for up to half of the costs of such
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that at present the state is spending $167,000 a week
on special wildfire teams.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hull, director of the Texas Forest Service, said last summer
the cost of fighting wildfires rose to $5 million a week.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said a big fear this year is that Texas may have difficulty
getting out-of-state help. He said drought was mostly localized
last year in Texas and along the Gulf Coast, with most of the
United States being wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the southwestern United States, where we received
90 percent of our out-of-state help, is in the same condition Texas
is,'' Hull said. ``This year, instead of having an abundance of
people we can bring in, we will be competing for resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull said that last year Texas brought in 5,000 firefighters
from other states, along with 193 air tankers and helicopters and
430 firetrucks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he also is writing all Texas mayors and water
suppliers, asking them to prepare water conservation plans and to
consider burning bans. He noted that the Legislature also is
considering a $25 million emergency appropriation bill that
includes $3.5 million to connect to community water supplies 20
small, at-risk water supply systems in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Combs complained that drought disaster assistance for Texas
farmers that was approved last October is being held up by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and probably will not reach producers
until June.
</P>
<P>
   Combs said she already is contacting neighboring states about
providing hay to Texas if a feeding emergency develops later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked whether he believes the state's drought
conditions have been caused by global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to pray for rain,'' Bush said. ``The science is still
out on issues like global warming. We need to gather enough data
that if there are any public policy decisions we base them on
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have criticized Bush, a likely contender for
the GOP presidential nomination, as not having done enough to stop
air pollution from grandfathered industrial plants. Pollution is
considered by many to be a cause of global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, a leading contender for the Democratic
presidential nomination, has said he believes ``global warming is a
real and serious problem.''

WORKPLACE FUN IS THE NAME OF THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Steve Riley worked in strollers. Not exactly the spot
where Disney's famous ``magical moments'' are made.
</P>
<P>
   Wanna bet?
</P>
<P>
   Riley these days is a leadership and customer-service trainer.
He goes around the country giving seminars on the Disney way. In a
training session Wednesday, Riley told of post-visit correspondence
he received _ by name _ from visitors delighted with their
stroller-station moment.
</P>
<P>
   Disney World figures their typical theme park guest has 60
interactions a day with ``cast members,'' the only words the
organization uses for its employees. Any one of those encounters
can blow the magic built by the other 59.
</P>
<P>
   You might argue that a place selling fun and memories has an
easier customer-service challenge than a place peddling tires or
tomatoes. Riley urges you to think otherwise. The same customer
demands, the same customer emotions apply.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, brought to Kansas City by the Greater Kansas City Chamber
of Commerce, said an organization that earns customer-service stars
does so because its leaders and workers remember to see its
products or its services as the customers see them.
</P>
<P>
   He no longer shops at his most convenient grocery store, for
example, because the checkers never looked at him, never greeted
him, never did anything but scan his groceries and stick out their
hands for his money.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he simply decided his money wasn't going to pay their
salaries any more, and it certainly wasn't going to the manager or
organization who allowed their behavior to exist.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney strategy for delivering customer service starts with
hiring people who are either naturally people- and service-oriented
or trainable. It continues with classroom and on-the-job training
that sets clear guidelines, procedures and expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Then it cultivates an environment where rewards and recognition
flow to those who deserve it, and makes it clear that work is a
place where fun is expected _ not just for guests but for cast
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Backstage'' in strollers, cast members had a non-stop party
going, Riley revealed. Their boom box was cranked. They celebrated
birthdays and milestones. They had fun. When they went through the
door to deal with guests, they found it easier to deal with even
the cranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to keep the cast members happy,'' Riley warned
attendees. ``If they're not happy, it spills out into their work,
and it affects your turnover.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney has strict rules about grooming, costuming and behavior
for cast members on the job. Yet, Riley said, there's an overlying
permission to be creative, to take individual ownership of their
jobs, to take certain risks in the name of good customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lead and get out of the way,'' Riley exhorted.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from Disney folk, it didn't seem all that hokey to hear
Mary Poppins offering one secret to customer-service success:
</P>
<P>
   In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun.
</P>
<P>
   You find the fun and _ snap _ the job's a game.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, theme parks don't have sole claim to workplace fun.

TELEPHONE PROTOCOL REMAINS A PROBLEM AT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Once again I have failed to win the company's customer
satisfaction award, and I am doing my best to come to terms with
the possibility that it may never happen.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, prizes aren't the whole measure of a writing life.
Quickly, name if you can the Nobel laureate for literature in 1968.
You see what I mean?
</P>
<P>
   But it stings all the same. So I sought out a member of the
selection committee, hoping to learn the reason for this
career-long disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a purely stylistic issue,'' said the committee person.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean I've been splitting infinitives again?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That, too. But the real problem is that you don't follow the
telephone protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the phone rings, you just pick it up and say `Hello.' We
have it on tape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you telling me my phone is bugged?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but we do fairly regular spot-checks. A simple hello is
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I supposed to say?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd read your employee manual, it's all in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me, though.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to greet the caller in an alert and cheerful
voice and give your name, the name of the company, then say
something ingratiating, like `Please be kind enough to tell me how
I may be of help.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never say such a thing _ not in a million years!''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, and that's why you come up short.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, one of the best newspaper men I ever knew, when his
phone rang he yanked the instrument off its hook and yelled `Go
ahead!' into the receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll bet he didn't get very far either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He did all right,'' I said. ``He was the publisher of that
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing out on the award was bad enough. But a few days after
that I couldn't even get in the building.
</P>
<P>
   To gain entrance at the paper's side door _ the one used by most
employees _ you hold a photo-ID badge up to a camera, and a guard
sitting at a desk somewhere else, watching a remote monitor,
presses a button to undo the lock.
</P>
<P>
   The ID badges were issued 15 years ago, maybe longer. I mislaid
mine the next week. What I have done since the new security system
was installed is to pause in the foyer, look up at the camera and
pray to be admitted on the strength of a good reputation and an
honest face.
</P>
<P>
   Probably because I am small, inoffensive and have been employed
here since before the age of powered flight, it has always worked.
Until this recent day, that is, when I stood peering up at the
camera, foolishly, for many long minutes, and nothing at all
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Finally I walked around to the main entrance, guarded by a live
person whom I happen to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get in,'' I told my uniformed friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you show your badge?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a badge. I showed my mug.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably didn't recognize you.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out the man operating the button was a new man. Or he
may even have been a temp.
</P>
<P>
   It goes to show you can work a lifetime at a place, but if you
can't produce your badge and haven't won any of the big prizes,
you're still just another face in the crowd.

BILL BRADLEY OFFERS CONTRASTS WITH AL GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The latest national polls have Bill Bradley
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have a nominee who can win,'' the former
Democratic senator from New Jersey said Wednesday in Kansas City.
``I think I can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid were Bradley's sentiments on whether Vice President
Al Gore, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination,
could win. The latest polls suggest that Gore faces an uphill
struggle for the presidency, trailing potential GOP nominee George
W. Bush by about 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, considered a long shot for the nomination, much less
the presidency, contrasted himself to Gore in other ways during a
news conference at the Ritz-Carlton, Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   He described Gore as cautious and suggested that during
Bradley's own three terms as senator, he took on such issues as
race and international trade.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also described Gore as a Washington insider. The former
Rhodes Scholar said his resume was more varied because it included
stints as a professional basketball player, a writer, a speaker, a
politician and a businessman who had traveled the country the last
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a life before I got into politics and a life after
I left the Senate'' in 1996, Bradley said. ``I'm like a lot of
Americans who go out every day and do their work and don't think of
the federal government. I think the vice president has spent most
of his life in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   He said other contrasts would emerge during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a native of Crystal City, Mo., was in Kansas City to
jump-start fund raising. By his own estimate, He must raise up to
$25 million to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, Bradley said:
</P>
<P>
   - Social Security should be taken off-budget so that Americans
could get a truer accounting of federal spending. He said he was
``very skeptical'' about President Clinton's proposal to invest a
portion of Social Security funds in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   - He wanted more information before commenting on an apparent
security breach at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   - European nations should play a larger role in safeguarding
Kosovo.

MERGER BORN OUT OF FRIENDSHIP, BUT NOT UNIVERSALLY APPRECIATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn., Pa., Fla.)  (rk) 
 By   MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jones Apparel Group Inc. and Nine West Group Inc., the two
fashion companies that plan to waltz down the aisle soon, have much
more in common than aiming to sell chic clothing and shoes to the
same high-spending career women.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Kimmel, the chairman of Jones Apparel, and Jerome Fisher,
the chairman of Nine West, are friends. And both have spent some of
the millions of dollars they have made from their companies on the
construction of large waterfront mansions in Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kimmel, 70, and Fisher, 67, built their giant companies
with the idea that if they could imitate the top fashion designers
but sell their apparel and footwear for less than designer prices,
they could woo business from middle- to upper-class women who have
money to spend but not enough for an Armani suit.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, though both men sold most of their companies to the
public in the early 1990s, in many respects they still run their
businesses as if they were privately held.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in similar insider deals that are not viewed
favorably by some investors, until recently both men owned a stake
in the buildings where each company had its corporate offices. In
that way, both chairmen were able to earn extra money in the form
of rental payments on top of their lucrative salaries and other
perquisites.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies say that the terms of the building leases were
fair and based on market rates. Jones Apparel has since bought the
building, in Bristol, Pa., and although Nine West moved to White
Plains, it continues to pay rent on the building in Stanford,
Conn., where Fisher has a stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any transaction between a company and its management will
raise scrutiny from some institutional shareholders,'' said Robert
Newbury, a deputy director for corporate governance services at the
Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington. Even if the
terms are proved to be fair, he said, ``some shareholders will
still say this is an inappropriate relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the same investment banker at Merrill Lynch helped take
both companies public. The banker, Mark J. Schwartz, who left
Merrill Lynch a few years ago to start his own Wall Street firm,
Palladin Capital Group Inc., recently became a director on the
Jones Apparel board. And Schwartz's ties to Kimmel go deeper,
including a deal unrelated to Jones in which the two men created a
partnership that invested $10 million in an Illinois music company.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the planned merger, Schwartz stands to earn even more
money in two ways: Jones will pay his firm for advising the company
on the Nine West acquisition, and if the deal goes through,
Schwartz stands to get another job by becoming the chairman of Nine
West, which will be a subsidiary of Jones Apparel. Jones has
disclosed neither the fee it will pay his firm nor the salary it
plans to pay him.
</P>
<P>
   Securities law experts say that Schwartz's many roles create
possible conflicts of interest. John C. Coffee Jr., a securities
law professor at Columbia University, said the Jones Apparel board
would most likely want to get an opinion from its investment banker
_ in this case, Schwartz _ on whether the company was paying a fair
price for Nine West.
</P>
<P>
   But with Schwartz expected to become Nine West's chairman,
Coffee said, it is not clear that he could provide independent
advice. ``Becoming chairman is an offer that will affect his
judgment,'' Coffee said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Jones Apparel, Anita Britt, said she could not
immediately comment on whether the company planned to hire another
investment banker for an opinion on whether the price was fair.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies defend the proposed merger by saying that it
will make them stronger and allow them to dress women from top to
toe in Jones' popular clothing brands such as Jones New York and
Nine West's footwear lines like Easy Spirit. In short, the two
companies say, a merger will lift sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, have their doubts. Since the companies
announced their intentions on March 2, at least four lawsuits have
been filed on behalf of Nine West shareholders. The suits contend
that Nine West did not search widely for a buyer willing to make a
better offer and instead, simply settled cozily with Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, Jones offered to pay cash and stock that was then
worth about $900 million for Nine West and said it would assume the
shoe company's $500 million of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West executives did not return calls asking for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The deal did not please Jones Apparel's shareholders either.
Shares of Jones fell 12.2 percent the day after the merger was
announced, to $22.75, causing the value of Jones' stock-and-cash
offer for Nine West to fall by about $50 million. The stock has
since recovered a bit, closing Thursday at $24 a share, down 50
cents. Nine West rose 18.75 cents, to $23.1875.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two businesses are entirely different,'' said Josephine
Esquivel, an apparel and footwear analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, who last week lowered her rating of Jones stock.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Esquivel says that unlike some companies, Jones Apparel and
Nine West do not have many duplicate expenses to cut for cost
savings when they merge. By Ms. Esquivel's estimates, the combined
earnings of the companies will decline by about 8 percent this year
and then begin rebounding the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Jones Apparel nearly went bankrupt when it
misjudged another acquisition: The company bought the license for
the hot-selling Gloria Vanderbilt jeans just as they were losing
their mass appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Kimmel is nothing but bullish about the purchase of Nine
West. ``Nine West meets all of our acquisition criteria,'' Kimmel
said in a statement last week. ``The addition of Nine West is an
excellent example of our stated strategy at Jones of identifying
new opportunities and building a dynamic market presence.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Jones Apparel said the company would make no
further comments on the Nine West acquisition until it files more
information with securities regulators in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For Nine West shareholders, one thing is clear. Any investor who
bought the shoe company's shares when it went public in 1993 and
held them until today has received almost no return. At $23.1875,
Nine West's stock is little changed from $22 a share that investors
paid when the shares began to trade. In those six years, the value
of Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index nearly tripled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though Nine West shares reached a high of $57 in October 1996,
that was before the company misjudged some fashion trends, ran into
trouble with federal regulators over its reporting and pricing
practices and began paying millions of dollars in interest on a
growing pile of debt.
</P>
<P>
   But as the stock price has fallen over the last two years, Nine
West's top two executives, Fisher and his longtime partner, Vincent
Camuto, the company's chief executive, each continued to be paid
more than $1 million a year in salary.
</P>
<P>
   Some Nine West shareholders may have noticed in the company's
public filings that its employment agreements with Fisher and
Camuto expired on Feb. 9, just a few weeks before Jones Apparel
made its bid. The company has not disclosed whether the agreements
were extended or whether the terms and salaries were changed.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the proposed merger, Kimmel has offered to let Fisher
stay on and work for the combined apparel-and-footwear company as a
consultant.

   If that happens, and the two men become close associates at
Jones Apparel, they might continue to have things to talk over as
neighbors in Palm Beach.

CITY PREPARES FOR OPENING OF NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   HAYS, Kan. _ Even if the roaring, 17-foot animatronic
tyrannosaur that lives under the four-story dome might not act like
it, the people at the new Sternberg Museum of Natural History are
glad to have you stop by.
</P>
<P>
   They hope you'll stay a couple of hours on your way to Colorado,
grab a bite to eat and maybe even spend the night in what could
become the prehistoric capital of the Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the museum's grand opening this weekend are gone,
but regular public hours begin Monday. Officials at Fort Hays State
University, which operates the museum, think at least 250,000
people will visit in its first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be very, very pleased to see the faces of young
and older folks in the museum when they see what we have,''
university President Edward Hammond said. ``They don't have
foggiest idea what's there. It will be a wonderful surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   What's there, in addition to the lifelike dinosaurs, is one of
the finest fossil collections in the country. The most famous
fossil is the ``fish within a fish,'' a large predatory fish that
died soon after ingesting a smaller fish. It was discovered in 1952
by George F. Sternberg, for whose family the museum is named.
</P>
<P>
   Only 1 percent or 2 percent of the collection of 3.75 million
artifacts is on display in the 100,000-square-foot building. About
one-third of the building's space is used for displays.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble Bookstore will operate the museum's gift shop,
and a full-service restaurant is to open in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was housed in cramped space on the Fort Hays
State campus until 1995, when the museum was closed to prepare for
the move. The new building, along Interstate 70, formerly housed a
recreation complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outside, it doesn't look all that spectacular,''
museum Director Jerry Choate said. ``The dome, for some reason,
creates an illusion that it's not that big.''
</P>
<P>
   The university acquired the building for $1 in 1992 after the
former owner went bankrupt. Most of the money for remodeling came
from private contributions, including $1 million from Ross and
Marianna Beach of Hays. Some money came from federal and state
grants and state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond had a vision for what he wanted the Sternberg to be, and
he didn't want to do the project until enough money had been raised
to match his expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the least bit worried that this is not a traditional
thing for a university to be doing,'' Choate said. ``He could see
the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   What visitors will see is an attraction like few in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A cast of a woolly mammoth skeleton greets visitors at the
entrance, but the greatest treasures lie under the dome within a
walk-through diorama. The tour begins on the top level, with
visitors stepping into a setting designed to resemble western
Colorado 80 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Under a tall palm tree, a baby plant-eating dinosaur called a
hadrosaur champs on plants as an adult towers overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Around the first corner is the T-rex, which turns its neck and
roars at visitors. Pteranodons hang in the air over a short-necked
plesiosaur, a creature with flippers that looks like a sea lion
with a long, toothy snout.
</P>
<P>
   In the undersea portion lies a 14-foot xiphactinus, which is the
big fish in the ``fish within a fish'' fossil. Emerging from the
sea area, visitors see a lifelike replica of Sternberg himself,
brushing off the famous fossil.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a video presentation made from film of Sternberg
and his crew excavating the fossil in the chalk beds of Gove County
in western Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Also on display are several detailed fossils of the sea
creatures that inhabited prehistoric Kansas. Visitors can ask
questions of professors and graduate students as they work in an
operating fossil preparation laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Sternberg is a terrific museum,'' said Leonard
Krishtalka, director of the University of Kansas Natural History
Museum. ``Its collections...are world-class in terms of
representing much of the animal life that lived in Kansas in the
Cretaceous Period'' from 60 million to 90 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this collection is in Hays can be attributed to
the Sternberg family.
</P>
<P>
   George Sternberg's father came to the area in 1866 when he was
stationed at Fort Harker, near Ellsworth. A fossil collector, he
passed along his passion to his three sons, who became renowned
fossil hunters themselves. Sternberg family findings are on display
in museums throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   George Sternberg established his headquarters at what was then
Kansas State Teachers College of Hays in 1927. He retired in 1961
and died in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 free tickets for museum tours this weekend were
distributed at a Dillon's supermarket in Hays. Other than invited
guests and public officials, no other visitors will get inside the
museum before Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we not done what we did with the Dillon's tickets, we
could easily have had 20,000 people waiting outside,'' Choate said.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond compared the excitement around town to 1996, when Fort
Hays State finished an undefeated men's basketball season by
winning the NCAA Division II championship.
</P>
<P>
   Hays, with a population of nearly 19,000, has long been a stop
for travelers along I-70. More than 300,000 people a year spend the
night in the city's motel rooms, according to the Hays Convention
and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are hoping the Sternberg museum makes them want to
stay around a little longer. Already, tour groups have shown
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's given us a whole new niche,'' said Jana Jordan, director
of the Hays visitors bureau. ``You just don't run into dinosaur
museums in the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants hired by Fort Hays State think the museum will have
a $39 million annual economic impact on Hays. That's based on
250,000 visitors a year, a figure Hammond thinks is conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years, he thinks annual visitation will reach
350,000, which would make the Sternberg the second-largest tourist
attraction in the state, based on 1997 figures supplied by the
state Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will come here to spend a couple of days or all day,
not just an evening or afternoon as they're traveling down I-70,''
Hammond said. ``It will be a site of destination.''

KANSAS CITY'S CROWN CENTER UPDATING ITS LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Thirty-five years ago, the overseers of
Hallmark Cards Inc. looked at what was outside their offices and
saw a bleak sight _ Signboard Hill, a scattering of billboards
jutting out of a limestone outcropping, and not much more.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't do, so they planted the seeds that would become
Crown Center, which today has stores, restaurants, movies,
theaters, hotels, offices, condominiums and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hallmark's redevelopment arm is ready to take the center to
the next level by spending $8 million over the next nine months to
jazz up its look and add more shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual addition could be the Crayola Cafe and Store,
which will serve sandwiches on brightly colored bread and dispense
drinks from crayon-shaped dispensers. Crayola is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Hallmark Cards.
</P>
<P>
   And the most eye-catching could be two colorful 30-foot-tall
towers to be built just inside a redesigned entryway and atrium.
One tower will reflect the heritage of Hallmark, the other that of
Crayola.
</P>
<P>
   The completion of the renovations in mid-November will dovetail
nicely with the Christmas retailing season and, more importantly,
the opening of Science City at Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hallmark officials had questioned plans to redevelop
Union Station as a retail center, they've fully embraced its use as
a science museum.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hall, president of the Hall Family Foundation, is
co-chairman of Union Station's private fund-raising campaign, and
the foundation is one of the project's two largest donors, along
with the Kauffman Foundation. Also, Hallmark Cards has contributed
money and volunteers to ensure the success of Science City.
</P>
<P>
   To solidify Crown Center's link to the museum, which is expected
to draw a million visitors its first year, an elevated walkway is
being built to join the two.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lucas, president of Crown Center Redevelopment Corp., said
other elements that would make the area a destination for in- and
out-of-towners were the refurbishment of the Liberty Memorial and
Museum and the flowering of the nearby Freight House District.
</P>
<P>
   Add new development on the Country Club Plaza and the
slow-to-progress proposed Power &AMP; Light District downtown, and the
whole area between the River Market and the Plaza could become a
draw for tourists from cities such as Wichita, Omaha and Des
Moines, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Power &AMP; Light District hasn't progressed as quickly
as planned, a co-developer may be named on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things give Kansas City more top-of-mind awareness
for the so-called feeder markets,'' Lucas said. ``This isn't
Chicago, but it becomes more and more attractive for visitors from
the smaller cities in our region.''
</P>
<P>
   Other changes taking place at Crown Center include the addition
of Morton's, a Chicago steakhouse; a doubling in size of the toy
store Zoom; the expansion of Naturally Salon and Day Spa; and an
enlarged Hallmark Live, a showcase for Hallmark products.
</P>
<P>
   To make way for the Crayola Cafe and Store, Crown Center will
take over the space housing Saguaro Grill, the Limited, Franklin
Covey and Function Junction.
</P>
<P>
   Saguaro Grill will be closed, the Limited is pulling out of
Crown Center, Franklin Covey will move to a larger space on the
third level, and Function Junction closed last month because of a
bankruptcy reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   To make way for Zoom, Crown Center has closed the Museum
Collection store.
</P>
<P>
   Halls, Crown Center's upscale anchor store owned by Hallmark,
had taken over that space while the bigger Zoom lease was
negotiated, Lucas said. ``We don't like empty storefronts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Crown Center, using the tremendous resources of its
parent company and Halls, fills empty spaces with unusual retail
ideas. If the ideas don't work out, Crown Center can go shopping
for new tenants while keeping the space occupied.

the Senate over amendments, a Democratic measure pushed by
President Clinton to authorize the hiring of 100,000 teachers to
reduce class sizes failed along party lines. In fact, Senate
Republicans pushed through an amendment that could jeopardize the

BROOKLYN NEIGHBORS APPALLED BY VIOLENT END TO AMY WATKINS' LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STACY DOWNS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When she saw a man beating a woman at the St.
Louis airport last Christmas, 26-year-old Amy Watkins acted quickly
and without any apparent thought for her own safety.
</P>
<P>
   As the man screamed threats at her, Watkins led the woman into a
restroom and comforted her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how she was: She tried to make a difference in
everyone's lives whether or not she knew them,'' said her aunt,
Judy Gehm of Roeland Park, Kan., who on Wednesday recounted the
story of the airport incident.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, a 1996 University of Kansas graduate, was killed Monday
night in New York after leaving a community center where she worked
with battered women.
</P>
<P>
   Police found Watkins with a 10-inch kitchen knife stuck in her
back and sacks of groceries surrounding her in the freezing
weather, about two blocks from her Brooklyn apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe robbery was the motive. They have no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins' death devastated her family and friends, who said her
life was about helping other people. Her goal was to be a champion
for battered women, and she had been working with victims of
domestic violence for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to promote ways where society could end the
situation, rather than bandage it,'' said her friend and her former
teacher, Leslie Reynard, director of communications at the KU
School of Business in Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins was born in Chicago and raised in Topeka, Kan., said her
mother, Margy Tafoya of St. Louis. Watkins enrolled initially as an
art and design major at KU in 1990, but after volunteering at a
shelter and Community Living Opportunities in Lawrence, she changed
her major to social work.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Larry Watkins, also attended KU as a graduate
student and taught medieval history there while she was in school.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall semester of 1995, Watkins worked as an intern for
the Hope House for Battered Women in Independence, Mo. Her duties
included helping women in court and answering hotline calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very passionate person, easy-going and very
comfortable with people _ she drew them to her,'' said Mary Anne
Metheny, vice president of operations at Hope House.
</P>
<P>
   After Watkins graduated, she moved to Boston, where she
counseled mentally ill people, Reynard said. She applied to several
graduate schools for social work, including Hunter College in New
York, near her father, who now teaches at the Dominican Academy.
She also applied to Washington University in St. Louis, near her
mother. Watkins' parents divorced while she was at KU.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, David Watkins, lives in Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   Reynard wrote letters of recommendation for Watkins and helped
her with essays.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very clear about what she wanted to do, and was
already doing it in her work,'' Reynard said. ``Hunter College
offered the policy studies, which is what she wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins was scheduled to receive her master's degree from Hunter
in June. As part of her studies, she spent more than 20 hours a
week as an intern for a community center in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins also worked with children and battered women in her
Brooklyn neighborhood, a heavily blighted area that is being
renovated. Almost 900 families live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to bring an infusion of new life, energy and
hopefulness into the area, and Amy was very taken with that,'' said
Jack Doyle, director of community services.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Watkins led a vigil of 200 women to protest domestic
violence. Before Valentine's Day, she set up workshops with
teen-agers to discuss relationships that didn't involve verbal or
physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In her spare time, Watkins drew and painted, but her causes were
her hobbies and her life, friends said. In the days before her
death, she was planning a 50-foot community mural to be painted
this spring in the apartments where she worked.
</P>
<P>
   Her death is ``a tragedy,'' Metheny said. ``We as a society will
suffer because she is gone.''

   CONGRESS-EDUC (Washington) _ The House and Senate handily
approved legislation today to give states and schools more
flexibility in how they spend $11 billion in Federal money, a vote
that gave each party a claim on being in tune with the public's
interest in education. But, after a week of partisan squabbling in
the Senate over amendments, a Democratic measure pushed by
President Clinton to authorize the hiring of 100,000 teachers to
reduce class sizes failed along party lines. In fact, Senate
Republicans pushed through an amendment that could jeopardize the
$1.2 billion already allocated to the program, a move that angered
Democrats. By Lizette Alvarez.

HOUSE, SENATE OK SCHOOL FLEXIBILITY PLANS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House and Senate gave overwhelming approval
Thursday to rival bills that would give local school districts more
control over how they spend federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The House version contains no new funding for programs, but
would cut the red tape attached to $15 billion in federal education
money doled out to the states. Republicans say it fulfills their
pledge to free up more money for special needs programs because it
allows local authorities to spend it as they choose.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Senate version of the bill, which also is aimed at
improving student achievement by providing states with greater
flexibility to use federal dollars in more innovative ways,
includes $3 billion in new money for after school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats had hoped to attach another $11 billion to the
measure to help pay for 100,000 new teachers sought by President
Clinton, but their amendment failed because of solid Republican
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans dealt another blow to the Clinton hiring plan by
voting over Democratic opposition to allow states to shift $1.2
billion earmarked last year for new teachers into special needs
programs if they choose.
</P>
<P>
   The latter amendment offered by Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., drew fire from the National Education Association,
which had lobbied forcefully for more money for new teachers and
special needs programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate is asking America's schools to make a false choice
between smaller class sizes and additional funding for special
education. Both are important priorities and both need additional
funding in order to best serve our students,'' said NEA President
Bob Chase. ``Forcing school districts to choose between smaller
class sizes and special education will only dilute the effort to
strengthen programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The separate House and Senate bills will be merged into one
later this month and could be on the president's desk by the time
Congress adjourns on March 26 for a two-week Easter recess.
</P>
<P>
   Passage in the House by a vote of 330-90 and in the Senate by
98-1 ended two weeks of political squabbling by Republicans and
Democrats as both parties sought to stake out positions on
education that they believe voters will warm to in next year's
presidential and congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   The bills would expand a pilot program in Texas and 11 other
states to the entire country, allowing state governments to grant
waivers of federal guidelines attached to some funding to encourage
greater student performance in reading, math and other skills.
</P>
<P>
   The money would have to be spent on the neediest of students,
but it could be used for a wide range of purposes, including hiring
new teachers to reduce class size, modernizing facilities,
experimenting with new programs and shifting dollars from one
program to another to help boost student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans and Democrats clashed over various
amendments, especially the measure calling for teacher-hiring
money, the underlying ``ed-flex'' bill drew bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides hailed it as a step forward in the effort to achieve
better student performance nationwide in grades kindergarten
through twelve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's action clearly puts progress ahead of partisanship,''
boasted House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to guarantee results, the bills contain provisions
calling for tougher accountability standards. It essentially adopts
procedures set up in the Texas pilot waiver program that requires
local districts to lay out specific objectives for shifting funds
or financing other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Once the waivers are granted, the districts are monitored
closely to ensure that the achievement results promised are indeed
delivered.

DEBATE IN IRELAND RENEWED AFTER ANTI-ABORTION MILITANTS OCCUPY
CLINIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ A group of anti-abortion militants, including
about 40 Americans, have reignited the highly emotional issue of
abortion in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country by forcing
their way into a Dublin family-planning office and occupying it for
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The occupation happened Saturday, and Thursday a judge extended
indefinitely an order prohibiting the militants, including the
leader of the American group, from picketing or trespassing at the
Irish Family Planning Association office in the center of the city,
which does not perform abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The militant groups were not represented in court, and the
prohibition, first granted on Monday, was ordered for an indefinite
period.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of the planning association, Tony O'Brien,
welcomed the decision of Judge Imelda Macken. The order includes
leaders of the Irish group, Youth Defense, which also had about 40
people in the office, and the Christian Defense Coalition, a
Washington-based group headed by the Rev. Patrick Mahony.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said the occupation of the office raised fears that
violence and killing by abortion opponents would spread to Ireland
from the United States. ``The involvement of extreme American
militants is probably the most sinister development in Ireland's
long-running abortion controversy,'' O'Brien said, ``given the
unfortunate history of the issue in America.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1992 ruling by Ireland's Supreme Court, abortion
is constitutionally permissible in cases of danger to a mother's
life. But there are no legal centers for abortions in Ireland and
no legal exception in cases of rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 Irish women go to Britain each year for abortions.
In a 1992 referendum, voters rejected a proposed revision of the
abortion law, some feeling the proposal was too liberal, some
saying it was too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   The family-planning association may legally distribute
information on the availability of abortions in foreign countries,
but it is not allowed to advise women to undergo one.
</P>
<P>
   The incident led to scores of phone calls to radio talk shows.
Many callers defended the right of the intruders to enter the
clinic as a valid tactic to thwart the staff, whom they called
murderers.
</P>
<P>
   Others said, in effect, that the Americans should go home. Pat
Kenny, the moderator of the main morning talk show on national
radio, upbraided the leader of the American group, Mahony, a
Protestant evangelist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what we want to happen in Ireland,'' Kenny said.
``That's not the way we do our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny said many people feared that violent attacks, including
killings, by anti-abortion militants could spread from the United
States to Ireland. He noted reports that staff members at the
association office said they had been frightened, and had to lock
themselves in a back room during the incident.
</P>
<P>
   And that the intruders told callers to the office that no
officials would be allowed come to the phone because they were
murderers. Several of the intruders made videotapes of staff
members, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony told Kenny that he deplored violence by the small number
of Americans who have used it to advance their campaign.

US, CENTRAL AMERICAN LEADERS SIGN COOPERATION PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTIGUA, Guatemala _ Marking a new chapter of democracy, peace
and economic alliance in Central America, President Clinton and
regional leaders signed a declaration Thursday to work more closely
on issues ranging from hurricane recovery to lowering trade
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   At a summit with Central American presidents in this colonial
town, Clinton said the United States also remained committed to
helping &UR;  &LR; improve the environment in the region, reduce drug
trafficking and create fairer immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton promised to continue to help nations recover from
the widespread destruction caused last fall by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come together in this old capital to find new
solutions,'' he said. ``Our challenge is to consolidate the
remarkable achievements of Central America in the last decade, to
build on them and accelerate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping up a four-country tour, Clinton met with the presidents
of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and the
Dominican Republic as well as with the prime minister of Belize in
a former convent in the heart of this cobblestone town. He flew
back to Washington Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders signed an agreement that broadly pledges to improve
human rights, fight crime and strengthen the region's economic
base. The document required 37 drafts before Thursday's signing
because some Central American leaders reportedly were unhappy that
the United States did not commit to more generous policies on
immigration and trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has submitted an emergency aid bill
to congress that would provide $956 million in reconstruction funds
and debt forgiveness and to amend the Caribbean Basin Initiative to
lower tariffs on textile exports from the region. Both measures
require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Many Central American leaders, however, were hoping for more,
such as a free-trade type agreement like the one Mexico currently
has with the US and Canada. Clinton aides acknowledged that the
countries have demonstrated a need for more capital and investment,
but that the measures Clinton offered were the best given
Washington's resistance to removing trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also asked for more liberal immigration policies in
the United States that would treat all Central American immigrants
the same, something Clinton agreed to do. They expressed gratitude
that a US president had given so much attention to their region and
had supported their efforts to strengthen their emerging
democracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want democracy to remain forever, we must be sure it is
translated into evident and tangible benefits for everyone,'' said
Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu.
</P>
<P>
   A few protests failed to disrupt Thursday's meeting. About 100
demonstrators temporarily blocked the main mountain road into
Antingua demanding that American-owned banana companies in the
region re-hire workers laid off because of hurricane-damaged
harvests.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the goal of this visit was to protray the United States
as a more cooperative partner rather than the giant Cold War
battler against leftist insurgencies during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton visited hurricane-ravaged areas in Nicaragua and
Honduras, met with a newly elected president in El Salvador and
participated in several round-table discussions with community
activists. At one such session in Guatemala on Wednesday, Clinton
apologized for US support of the former right-wing government
during the country's 36-year civil war that killed 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Although a United Nations-sponsored truth commission confirmed
the CIA's role in the war, Clinton's remarks were the first time an
American president had directly addressed the country's role in
those killings.
</P>
<P>
   The administration announced it would double its commitment to
support environmental initiatives signed during a previous summit
in Miami in 1994. The funds, totaling $25 million over five years,
would be used for improving forest conservation and reducing air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   US officials also said funds would be provided for disaster
mitigation, eliminating child labor and helping street children.

MEETING OF POPE, IRANIAN LEADER SEEN AS HOPEFUL SIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, who has made improving relations among
religions a cornerstone of his papacy, held a historic meeting
Thursday with the president of Iran, a move observers said could
mark a watershed moment in Christian-Muslim relations.
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami is the highest-ranking Islamic
official to visit the Vatican and the first president of Iran to
meet with John Paul. The meeting capped Khatami's three-day visit
to Italy, the first by an Iranian leader to the West since the 1979
Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter was a hopeful sign in a period of tense relations
between Muslims and Christians in several parts of the world,
including Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic nation,
where bloody battles in recent months have caused dozens of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The private talks took on added significance because Khatami _
considered a key voice of democratic reform in the Islamic world _
is the head of the Islamic Conference, an alliance of 55 Islamic
nations with populations totaling about 1 billion, equal to the
number of the world's Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is for the victory of monotheism, of ethics, of
morals together with peace and reconciliation,'' Khatami told the
pontiff during the public part of their encounter. ``This was a
truly beautiful day. I am returning to my home full of hope for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, in an official statement, called the 25-minute talk
a warm discussion based on ``a spirit of dialogue between Muslims
and Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   During his pontificate, John Paul has repeatedly extended a
cordial hand to Muslims, and the Vatican has strived to open lines
of communication with moderate Islamic leaders. Last year, the
pontiff opened a Vatican office to promote Christian-Muslim
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The pope and his theological advisers are reportedly working on
a landmark statement to be delivered by John Paul next year in
which he is expected to deliver a sweeping apology for mistakes the
Roman Catholic Church has committed over the centuries. That might
include the medieval Crusades, when European armies, backed by the
church, mounted a series of campaigns to try to wrest control of
the Holy Land from Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, elected president of Iran two years ago, has called for
progressive political and social changes, and is seeking to
establish improved lines of communication between Islamic nations
and the west.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vatican, Khatami, in an unusually conciliatory statement
from such a high-ranking and influential Islamic cleric, called for
a ``dialogue of civilizations'' and closer ties between Islam and
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   In a particularly warm gesture, a member of Khatami's party took
the pope by surprise when he asked _ and was granted _ permission
to kiss John Paul on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials, however, denied speculation that John Paul
and Khatami discussed a possible papal stopover in Iran during a
planned pilgrimmage to Asia this year.
</P>
<P>
   While no one felt confident predicting where this new effort at
rapprochement might lead, some analysts say the meeting augurs well
for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khatami is a new kind of educated and intellectual Islamic
leader who wants to open a window to the west,'' said Shaykh
Muhammad Hisham Kabbani, chairman of the Islamic Supreme Council of
America, an educational organization based in Washington. ``In the
holy Koran there is no compulsory religion, so everyone is free to
choose their own faith. Khatami is trying to show that sitting down
and talking with the pope is not a betrayal of Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate talks with Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican's
secretary of state, Khatami discussed Iran's human rights record,
the Middle East, and the situation of Catholics in Iran, which has
improved in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with the pope, which triggered protests from Iranian
opposition activists, also is a signal from Khatami that he is
trying to create a ``kinder, gentler Islam,'' said Denis Sullivan,
associate professor of politics at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's meeting with the pope, Sullivan added, could set the
stage for meetings with European leaders. ``The meeting has
important political overtones that go beyond a religious
statement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And although the pope generally agrees to meet with any heads of
state seeking an audience with him, some Muslim activists hailed
what they viewed as the Vatican's more respectful tone toward
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really shows the evolution in thinking by the Catholic
Church,'' said Salam Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public
Affairs Council, an advocacy group with offices in Los Angeles and
Washington. ``For many centuries, quite frankly, the church
regarded Muslims as barbarians. In this era, and with this pope,
there has been a decided push for better understanding, mutual
trust, and harmony. The meeting reinforces the need to extend your
hand and get to know and respect other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Islam, unlike Catholicism, has no central administrative
structure, but Khatami is considered a crucial figure because he is
trying to seize the initiative from orthodox clerics in Iran who
believe Islam should having nothing to do with the west.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khatami is trying to separate the majority of Muslims who tend
to be moderate from a minority who have a tendency toward extremist
ideology,'' Kabbani noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW _ When Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic formally
join NATO on Friday, it will symbolize the return of three nations
to the center of European civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish foreign minister, Bronislaw Geremek, a soulful
historian of the medieval world, compares the importance of NATO
accession to nothing less than Poland's conversion to Christianity
nearly 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   President Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland said enlarging the
alliance brings an end to a divided Europe. ``This is the most
important moment in our history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Vaclav Havel, the Czech president, who was in jail in the
Communist regime, membership means that ``we will have a solid
security anchoring for the first time in our history, and an
anchoring in the democratic world, in the world of protection of
democratic values.''
</P>
<P>
   By their history and geography, these new members will help to
protect and even promote those values. But NATO tenure requires
high defense spending and difficult choices at home just as the
regional economy is cooling off, with the Czechs now in negative
growth, a yawning Hungarian budget deficit and Polish growth
expected to drop this year to 3.5 percent of its economy.
</P>
<P>
   As the reality of membership looms _ together with the prospect
of NATO bombing Yugoslavia _ popular enthusiasm for the alliance
has dropped in all three countries. Recent polls say some 60
percent of Poles and Hungarians favor membership now, down from
over 80 percent a year ago, and just over 50 percent of Czechs,
down from about 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But all three governments remain enthusiastic about the alliance
and committed to increased defense spending. They are already
contributing with peacekeepers, logistics and intelligence to the
West's complicated efforts in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   At first, these three countries will add little to NATO's
military capacities. In fact, they have just managed to meet the
alliance's minimum military requirements for integrated air
defense, security procedures and language training.
</P>
<P>
   But few doubt that they will bring real military benefits to the
alliance over the next five to 10 years, as they make the slow
shift from heavily armored forces top-heavy with officers, to more
mobile, flexible and smaller armies.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks before the alliance's 50th anniversary summit in
Washington _ where the champagne and the rhetoric will overflow _
members continue to argue about the alliance's future.
</P>
<P>
   But these three countries also bring a fresh dose of support to
Washington's aims for redirecting NATO's mission, officials of all
three countries suggest. It was the United States, after all, that
pushed their membership the hardest, a Polish official said. ``We
want to be good Europeans,'' he said. ``But more than anyone except
perhaps the British, we understand how important it is to keep the
Americans involved in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   For the militaries of all three nations, NATO membership is also
a chance to pacify, if not bury, some ghosts. While some officers
feel they are simply exchanging the language of one empire for
another, most recognize that it is a voluntary alliance that works
by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Petr Vlcnovsky, who commands a Czech air defense brigade,
said that membership in the Warsaw Pact meant a depressing
servility to Moscow's orders. A military career, he said, commanded
little social respect. ``We had no opportunity to make decisions as
a sovereign state,'' he said. ``Now we can decide for ourselves, as
a full partner in NATO committees.''
</P>
<P>
   In Poland, the military, like the Roman Catholic Church, is at
the center of its national identity, and the Hungarians, too, have
an important military tradition that dates predates the
Austro-Hungarian empire. While there is some truth to ``The Good
Soldier Svejk'' notion of the Czech military man _ survival despite
apparent bungling in 300 years of occupation _ Czech soldiers have
served with distinction alongside the British in Bosnia and the
Americans in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such successes _ like Poland's peacekeeping efforts around the
world and Hungary's engineering battalion, which has rebuilt 84
bridges in four years in Bosnia _ will go a long way to raise the
stature of the military within society, says Tamas Wachsler, the
young state secretary of the Hungarian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to rebuilding the overall character and prestige of
the military is to give it teeth,'' he said. ``NATO helps, not just
by providing world standards but by opening up international
careers to officers.''
</P>
<P>
   By insisting on civilian control over the military, the alliance
makes it easier to reform these armies and subordinate them to the
popular will, a senior Polish official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poland has never before had a modern democracy, and the
military, like the church, has never been a democratic institution
in Poland,'' he said. ``The real test for NATO _ and for Poland _
is how to deal with undemocratic institutions and make them
compatible with democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   That process has started. Of Poland's 130 generals, fewer than
10 had the rank before 1989. ``But it will also take time,'' the
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in a bunker under the Czech town of Stara Boleslav, there
is a sophisticated Warsaw Pact air defense command headquarters
that has been transformed with American aid into an alliance
facility that keeps watch over Czech airspace.
</P>
<P>
   There are similar centers in Poland and Hungary, and the
American ambassadors to all three countries talk enthusiastically
about their ``Dr. Strangelove'' quality, with their huge overhead
screens and sophisticated computers. The facilities will also help
make commercial air travel safer for civilians.
</P>
<P>
   All three centers opened only last month, but they were the most
crucial military requirement for joining NATO. The new members
could hardly be defended without an integrated air defense system,
coupled with 24-hour patrols and jet fighters with a rapid reaction
capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``That said,'' noted a senior military attache for a western
country, ``all the air crews need better tactics, training and
doctrine.'' Officials in all three countries expressed concern that
while defense spending is increasing, the funds going to operations
and training, especially for combat pilots, is insufficient or
dropping. Except for the immediate front-line pilots, training
hours are well below NATO standards.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary, for instance, gives 27 pilots it must have for air
defense NATO's standard of 100 hours of training, while other
pilots currently get only one hour; last November, some 40 Polish
pilots quit over insufficient training.
</P>
<P>
   While all three countries have met the minimum military
requirements, the training issue is a good example of the
significant work that remains to be done to make membership less
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the alliance's choice, argues a senior Hungarian
official. ``NATO rightly decided to invite key countries to join,
provide them minimum requirements to reach in a short term, and
work with them to bring them up to speed,'' the official said.
``The chances of a significant NATO military operation are very
small so it's OK to have some countries below NATO standards now,
under the assumption they will reach them in five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Other minimum requirements the three countries worked to meet
include sometimes humdrum issues like the compatibility of
communications equipment, adapter nozzles for fuel lines and
security procedures, so Western intelligence can be shared.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Poland's sprawling old Defense Ministry headquarters,
for instance, there are new gates and electronically controlled
turnstiles, while new locks, safes and procedures have been
installed in all three countries for handling NATO secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Even here, the past intercedes, but in an ironic way. The Czechs
were slow to vet enough officers to take up positions in the
alliance's headquarters in Brussels or to handle NATO papers. The
reason was a recent Czech security law requiring psychological
exams and other queries that go beyond the alliance's standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs were so scarred by the misuse of security and the
extent of collaboration with the secret police under the Communist
regime that they set very high standards. ``In the long run, that
will benefit us,'' said Petr Necas, chairman of Parliament's
Defense and Security Committee, reflecting lingering concerns
within NATO about intelligence-sharing with former Communist
militaries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Hungary, similarly, two-thirds of those elected to Parliament
must vote to allow Hungarian troops to operate outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even for Friday's celebration for joining the alliance,
Parliament had to vote to allow British Grenadiers to bring their
ceremonial swords into the country.
</P>
<P>
   These laws make it more complicated, but hardly impossible, to
participate in NATO exercises, Wachsler said. An effort to amend
the constitution recently fell apart over internal political
wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   Another important requirement is training in English, NATO's
lingua franca. While they have met initial quotas, such training
has gone slowly in all three countries.
</P>
<P>
   Vlcnovsky, the Czech commander, was interviewed in his advanced
English class in an exquisite 14th-century castle in Komorni
Hradek, near Brno. The castle was originally seized from a Nazi
collaborator in 1945, and later served as a school for political
commissars.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs have restored the baroque chapel where uniforms used
to be stored and now use the classrooms for some 90 students taking
basic and advanced English. In one classroom, the words ``body
odor'' were on the blackboard _ an indication, the teacher
explained, that preparation for service abroad covered ``many
aspects of life.''
</P>
<P>
   For Vlcnovsky and his classmates, better English is a
career-builder. ``The chances of us fighting a war on our own
territory now are very small compared to the possibility of serving
abroad, in Bosnia or elsewhere,'' he said. ``English is simply
necessary for our future careers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the problems of transition, all three countries have
worked with the alliance to ensure that they are providing
immediate resources and capabilities to the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarians, for instance, have long provided Western access
to the big Warsaw Pact airbase at Taszar where several hundred
American and other foreign troops handled Western deployments into
Bosnia. They also permit NATO troops to be stationed there and to
fly over Hungarian territory for surveillance of Serbia, Kosovo and
the Albanian border, even though there is a Hungarian community in
the Balkans and patrols could lead to bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary will also provide two brigades for NATO's rapid reaction
force and a medical team with a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs specialize in defense against chemical and biological
weapons and are providing a chemical defense company of about 140
people for immediate NATO service.
</P>
<P>
   The Czechs sent similar forces to the Gulf War, and have worked
alongside British troops in Bosnia ``at a high level of
competence,'' a British official said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Poles are providing an excellent
anti-terrorist unit, some of whom already protect William Walker,
the U.S. diplomat who runs the international observers in Kosovo.
They are providing an air assault brigrade of paratroopers and some
armored units, as well as some 10,000 troops as part of a
German-Danish-Polish mechanized corps headquartered in Szczecin.
The Poles have been reluctant, however, to reduce their armor as
quickly as the West would like.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest tasks are yet to come. All three countries need
to modernize a Warsaw Pact structure that contained too many
officers without enough initiative. They need to train a corps of
noncommissioned officers, reduce the number of colonels by half and
teach soldiers to make decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that changing mentality will be as difficult as
finding the economic resources over the next five and 10 years to
keep modernization on track. ``The real question is staying power
over time,'' a senior NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Jaroslav Hudec, who directs Czech defense
modernization, said bluntly: ``We've done our minimum requirements.
Some will complain on March 12, but hourly it will be hard work for
us, not just before joining NATO but afterwards. We must all _
military officers and politicians _ continue to persuade everyone
what must be done. We must move from a Warsaw Pact force to another
kind, and it must be done for ourselves, for our nation, not just
because of NATO.''

 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HARTFORD, Conn. _ For more than 150 years, the story of
Colt guns has been entwined with the history of America. Colt
sidearms were the weapon of choice among frontiersmen and outlaws,
Texas Rangers and Army rangers. Colt's M-16 is known to every
Vietnam veteran. The company is best known for the Colt .45 _ the
``Peacemaker'' that won the West and was celebrated in John Wayne
movies.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no peace these days at Colt's Manufacturing Co.,
which has suffered from a boom-and-bust history and is just now
rebounding from a 1994 bankruptcy. Handgun sales are falling. A
wave of liability lawsuits and legislation, similar to those
against the tobacco industry, are hitting Colt's and other gun
makers, threatening to put a severe dent in their business.
</P>
<P>
   In this difficult environment, Colt's new owners and new
managers are bringing fresh capital and ideas they say will reverse
the company's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is, how do we make money and do well given
the current legal environment?'' Donald Zilkha, who heads a
family-run investment firm that owns a majority of Colt's, said in
an interview in his New York office. ``Colt's is trying to be a
different animal.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Colt's hopes to capitalize on a global brand name
and diversify away from consumer handguns and toward military
small-arms sales. To blunt criticism and find new customers, it is
pushing forward on new technologies it says will make handguns
safer.
</P>
<P>
   But Colt executives say they are prepared to abandon the handgun
business entirely if it becomes impossible to make them profitably.
Colt's is backing its business plan with a heavy dose of hard-line
Washington and statehouse lobbying, intended to thwart courtroom
attacks and gain new financial support for research into handgun
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's has brought in a new chief executive, Steven M. Sliwa, a
44-year-old former Silicon Valley aeronautical engineer who has
helped develop and take one company public. More recently, he
brought Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach,
Fla., once financially troubled, onto sound footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We operate with a great brand name; we've got a great
tradition,'' Sliwa said in an interview in his office here. ``We
want to operate this company into the 21st century. We're trying to
modify, thrive and survive in a new environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Colt's must confront some hard realities. Domestic production of
consumer handguns, rifles and shotguns has fallen to 3.5 million in
1997, according to the most recent government data, from a high of
around 5 million a year in the mid-1990s. In 1994, 85 percent of
the company was bought by the Zilkha family of New York, once one
of Iraq's richest banking dynasties, for $12 million. But since
then, the company barely has eked out a profit _ just $2 million on
sales of $96 million in 1997, the most recent numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the gun industry, Colt's has stepped up its
spending for lawyers and lobbying. In February, in a verdict hailed
by gun-control advocates as breaking new ground in defining gun
makers' responsibilities, a federal jury in Brooklyn found Colt's
and other gun makers liable and negligent in three shootings _ two
fatal _ that involved the use of stolen weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Five cities, including Miami and Chicago, have sued gun
manufacturers and more lawsuits are expected _ all aimed at holding
the manufacturers at least partly responsible for the violence
caused by those who use their products.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, legislation was introduced this month in Congress to
toughen federal safety regulations on handguns. Military purchases
of small firearms, which represents about half of Colt's business,
is shrinking, as the number of soldiers continues to decline.
</P>
<P>
   So both Sliwa and Zilkha have been spending lots of time in
Washington, and the company has been writing large checks to
support industrywide efforts to counterattack anti-gun measures.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's is also supporting efforts led by the National Rifle
Association, one of the nation's most powerful interest groups, to
get bills introduced in state legislatures across the country to
prohibit municipalities from suing gun makers. Already, one such
measure has been passed in Georgia; similar ones are now being
considered by eight other state legislatures. In Congress, Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga, who is a member of the NRA's board, introduced federal
legislation on Tuesday to bar anti-gun lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's strategy, though, is more multifaceted than other gun
makers'. The company is working, for example, to have lawmakers
push for government financing to develop a ``smart gun'' _ one that
can be fired only by its owner. That effort puts Colt's executives
at odds with many others in the industry, who are skeptical that
reliable technology can be developed.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's is pressing the Pentagon and Congress to maintain a
small-arms industrial base through contracts to gun makers, even as
it pitches its firearms to foreign governments. Profit margins on
gun sales to the Pentagon, while small, are steady. Once a weapon
is selected by the Pentagon, it often becomes the weapon of choice
for other nations willing to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're writing a lot of checks, and I predict that we will be
writing a lot more,'' Sliwa said of these efforts. ``We want to win
the lawsuits or use politics to make them irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Colt's does not disclose how much it is spending on lobbying.
But the NRA and gun makers _ including Colt's _ spent more than $3
million between January 1997 and June 1998 to lobby Congress and
contributed roughly $4.3 million to federal candidates in the
1997-98 midterm elections. That was a 22 percent rise from the
previous midterm races, and easily eclipsed the $220,000 spent by
handgun control groups on Congressional lobbying and the $155,000
those groups gave to federal candidates in the same periods,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington
nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's political strategy is intertwined with its business
agenda. By making the development of a smart gun its No. 1
priority, the company is in part trying to make itself less
vulnerable to lawsuits should its legislative actions fall short.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's has made two acquisitions beyond handguns. Late last
year, it bought Saco Defense of Maine, a maker of grenade launchers
and light military weapons, for an undisclosed price. It also
acquired for an undisclosed price Ultra-Light Arms, a small West
Virginia maker of expensive hunting rifles. These purchases came
after Colt's stumbled last summer trying to buy F.N. Herstal of
Belgium, the maker of Browning and Winchester firearms, when the
Belgian government blocked the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's also has built legal firewalls to try to separate
potential liability from Colt's handgun business from its military
operations. The company says, it will leave the handgun business if
the political environment becomes too hostile.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they banned handguns, we'd still have a way to
survive,'' said Sliwa, who showed off his own gun during the
interview. ``We have adopted corporate strategies to make us less
dependent on the outcome of lawsuits. We want to win the lawsuits
and the political debate and conduct our business to survive no
matter what the outcome is. And we are doing everything to get
there as fast as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   At a company where the factory walls are plastered with
paintings of John Wayne and the Old West, Colt's view is that new
technology will be the ticket out of its current squeeze. More than
any other gun maker, Colt's is betting that developing a ``smart
gun'' will not only protect it from lawsuits and silence critics,
but will also open new markets among those who now hesitate to buy
a handgun out of fear of accidental shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's says that it could produce a version of a smart gun for
law enforcement officers within two years and a commercial model
two years after that, if not sooner. With corporate resources slim,
it is trying to get federal money to support its research beyond a
$500,000 grant it already has received. Colt's estimates that it
will take as much as $40 million to develop a commercial smart gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount we've invested in our legal bills is more than what
we've invested in our smart-gun research,'' Sliwa said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Ezell, executive director of the Institute for Research
on Small Arms in Alexandria, Va., said that ``Colt's is pretty
independent in the way it operates.''
</P>
<P>
   As one sign of Colt's independence, Zilkha came under criticism
when he contributed $2,000 to the 1998 campaign of Sen. Charles E.
Schumer, the New York Democrat, and $10,000 to the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee _ two of the gun industry's
least-favorite causes. This led several gun owners to set up World
Wide Web sites and call for a boycott of Colt's products.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Walker, president of the Center to Prevent Handgun
Violence, a Washington nonprofit group, said: ``Colt's was one of
the first companies to take seriously the lawsuits and potential
regulations. They were the first manufacturer to begin developing a
type of high-tech product that some call smart guns. They've been a
leader and more forward-looking with respect to how to change the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, in spite of all the work they are doing, we are concerned
that they, and others, still have a long ways to go in meeting
their corporate responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Zilkha says that if his strategy works, he can produce
compounded rates of return of 60 to 100 percent for the investor
group through a merger or recapitalization.

US DEBT TO UN PORTENDS TROUBLE, GROUP SAYS

   The United States may lose its vote in the UN General Assembly
at year's end because the world's only superpower has refused to
relinquish its status as the body's biggest deadbeat, the head of
the independent United Nations Foundation said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in an increasingly bad situation with the United
Nations in New York. US credibility is declining significantly,''
Tim Wirth, a former US undersecretary of state and Democratic
senator from Colorado, said at a meeting of Globe editors.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, created last year by media billionaire Ted
Turner, is seeking to build grass-roots support to erase
Washington's $1 billion-plus debt in unpaid dues and assessments to
the world body.
</P>
<P>
   Wirth says an aggressive effort is needed to counter opposition
among some Republican lawmakers and to emphasize to Democrats and
the Clinton administration the urgency of payment. A sticking point
for years for many Republican lawmakers has been the world body's
funding for female reproductive programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard work. It's really pushing uphill,'' said Wirth,
acknowledging the lack of a US ambassador to the United Nations for
nearly a year and the administration's focus on issues such as
Kosovo and Chinese espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the United States barely retained its seat on the UN
General Assembly by making a token payment of some back dues, but
it must make a significantly greater payment by the end of the year
to maintain its voting status in the assembly, Wirth said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of 1996, the United States has been without a spot
on the UN budget committee, which is akin to a congressional
appropriations committee. Washington still has a permanent seat on
the 15-member Security Council, which makes most of the world
body's important day-by-day decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Washington owes nearly two-thirds of the total amount of dues in
arrears to the United Nations. In turn, the body has been unable to
pay some countries who have sent peacekeepers to world hotspots,
most notably Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the Brits are carrying us,'' Wirth said. ``A lot of
the best friends of the United States are getting very angry with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation will administer Turner's 10-year, $1 billion gift
to help carry out UN programs and tackle world problems, and it is
joining with business leaders and the United Nations Association to
push for payment of the UN debt. The issue has the support of all
former US presidents and secretaries of state, Wirth said, and the
group has hired former US representatives Vic Fazio and Vin Weber
to lobby their former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The group also has conducted polls that show broad American
support for UN funding, which has gone toward peacekeeping,
eradication of infectious diseases, and children's issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy at a focus group said, `I really like the UN. It keeps
things at a simmer instead of a boil,' '' Wirth said. ``That's a
nice way of saying it.''

EAST TIMOR TO GET CHANCE TO VOTE ON INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Indonesia has agreed in principle for the first
time to allow the people of the former Portugese Colony of East
Timor to vote whether to become independent, according to UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   The UN-brokered accord with Portugal ended more than two decades
of Indonesian refusal to grant the Timorese a say in their own
future. Annan said the UN would arrange a ``direct ballot'' that
would let more than 800,000 Timorese at home and abroad decide
whether to remain an autonomous province of Indonesia or set off on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 following Portugal's
withdrawal from its former colony. The bloody annexation of the
island territory, which has never been recognized by the United
Nations, resulted in the death of nearly 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The pact leaves many questions unanswered, which could
complicate matters down the road. For instance, there is no
agreement on the voting rules, the date for an election, or even on
whether the voting would take place on a single day.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said further talks between Portgual and Indonesia will
begin in New York on April 13. The two countries' foreign ministers
would probably arrive on April 22, hopefully to close the deal. His
chief negotiator, Jamsheed Marker of Pakistan, said the agreement
was a ``very, very large step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want autonomy, fine; if they want independence,
fine,'' Indonesian foreign minister Ali Alatas said following talks
with his Portuguese counterpart, Jaimie da Gama. ``We are relaxed.
We have no more fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally then we will know if it is true that 90 percent are
for for independence and only 10 (percent) for integration.''
</P>
<P>
   After prodding from Annan, Alatas also pledged to release the
celebrated Timorese independence rebel leader Xanana Gusmao from
house arrest once a final deal has been struck.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainty, observers said the vote marked an
important turning point following a year of UN-brokered autonomy
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a real breakthrough,'' said Joao Viegas
Carrascala, a leading Timorese independence politician. ``Now, it
is only a question of details.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrascala said there was no doubt that a vote would lead to
independence. And he said he was satisfied that the United Nations
can pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining moment,'' added David Phillips, a political
analyst with Columbia University's International Conflict
Resolution Program, ``because it is an agreement on the principal
of one-man, one-vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the United Nations is to devise an election
that is conducted democratically but allows the Indonesians to
maintain that it does not constitute a formal referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said that he would send a UN team to the region to begin
exploring how to conduct such a vote. He said there are also plans
to have balloting for exiled Timorese in Australia, Portugal, the
US, Canada and Macao.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia first offered East Timor's 800,000 people a degree of
autonomy more than a year ago. It began negotiations with Portugal,
internationally recognized as East Timor's administrative power, in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would provide the Timorese with broad control over
their lives in most areas but defense and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes less than a week after Indonesian Prime
Minister B.J. Haibibie voiced anxiety over the UN autonomy plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian leader is alarmed that the agreement would
encourage other Indonesian separatist groups to demand similar
agreements. Only two weeks ago, representatives of the province of
Iryan Jaya, on the eastern reaches of Indonesia, appealed to
Haibibie to grant it the same status as East Timor. Aceh and the
Mollucan islands, two smaller independence-minded regions, may
follow suit.

HOUSE DEFIES CLINTON AND DEBATES KOSOVO 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House defied a request from President Clinton
to delay debate on Kosovo, taking up several resolutions Thursday
that would put Congress on record as opposing or supporting
deployment of U.S. troops to the Serbian province as part of a NATO
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton, backed by former GOP senator Bob Dole, pleaded
with Congress not to push ahead with a vote until a peace agreement
is completed between the Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo, Republican leaders said they were determined to hold the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Taking to the floor, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
called the ethnic conflict in Kosovo ``a great human tragedy,'' but
said it was important for Congress to grapple with it before the
Clinton administration decides to commit forces as part of any
peace plan. He dismissed concerns expressed by Clinton and Dole
that a vote by Congress against deploying troops could undermine
any chance for a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by Democrats, who warned the Republican
leaders that a vote against deployment would give a green light to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to continue his ethnic
cleansing in the region.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said Hastert's
decision to go ahead with the debate was a clear signal that the
Republican leadership had chosen partisanship over a united U.S.
front that could encourage the ethnic Albanians and Serbs to sign a
Washington-brokered peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans opposed to committing U.S. forces argued that
any peace plan between the two warring sides likely would fail,
leaving U.S. soldiers in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is not a hopeful nation aspiring to democracy. It is a
big, dangerous quagmire,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas,
told his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Calling U.S. soldiers ``warriors'' and not ``baby sitters,''
DeLay criticized Clinton for having no clearly defined mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has no plan to do anything but go to
Kosovo, hold hands with the two sides and hope they behave when we
leave. But of course they won't. The killing and the mayhem will
continue as soon as NATO pulls out,'' said DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   He joined with Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., in offering his own
resolution to bar the deployment of U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay used his floor statement to address the broader issue of
U.S. foreign policy and NATO's role in Europe. Referring to the
possible deployment of troops to Kosovo, he suggested that it would
amount to ``meddling in the internal affairs'' of a sovereign
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the historic mission of the alliance as defensive,
he declared, ``NATO is starting to resemble a power-hungry
imperialist army.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally designed to defend member nations from attack, it
is now setting itself up to be the attacker,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   While DeLay's comments struck a chord with a large number of GOP
colleagues who rose to applaud, some Republicans, who also oppose
sending troops, sided with Democrats in their support of the
administration's efforts to negotiate a deal between Milosevic and
the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him the authority to be the commander-in-chief and we
cannot deny him the authority granted to him in the Constitution,''
said Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala. ``It is irresponsible for Congress
to be debating this at this time while they are in negotiations
trying to negotiate an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go ahead with the debate marked a setback for
the administration, which has failed so far to get Milosevic and
Kosovo Albanian separatists to sign an agreement that would invite
NATO forces onto Serbian soil to help keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration has yet to lay out a specific
deployment plan, Pentagon officials say the U.S. commitment to the
peacekeeping mission would comprise about 4,000 troops in a total
international force of 20,000-30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, traveling in Central America, reiterated Thursday that
U.S. and NATO forces would be deployed only if a peace agreement is
signed by Serbs and the Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   He said the deployment plan would include a ``clear'' exit
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Although nonbinding, the resolutions offered in the House on
Kosovo gave members a chance to vent their frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed horror at the
``slaughter and massacre'' of innocent civilians in Kosovo at the
hands of Milosevic, whom they referred to repeatedly throughout the
debate as ``a bloodthirsty ... brutal killer'' who should be be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But they disagreed on the best approach to ending the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to take up a resolution next week that
would authorize the deployment of forces. But several senators are
expected to offer amendments that would lay out specific conditions
governing any commitment of forces.

 &HT;    Ferris lends Southern touch to humanities
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Unlike Teddy Roosevelt with his big stick, Bill
Ferris drawls softly and carries a steel-string guitar. Since his
appointment to the chairmanship of the National Endowment for the
Humanities in 1997, William R. Ferris is the only government
official ever to distinguish himself by incorporating a solo
rendition of ``Be Bop a Lula'' into a Washington speech on public
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of dancing across this enormous state is in many ways
an appropriate image for the humanities,'' said Ferris, the keynote
speaker at Saturday's daylong celebration of the 25th anniversary
of the Texas Council for the Humanities. Held at the LBJ School of
Public Affairs (a fitting site, for it was the administration of
President Lyndon Johnson that provided the initiative for national
support of the humanities in 1965), the event is free and open to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris additionally will pay a visit today to the magnet program
at Johnston High School, reinforcing the NEH's commitment to public
education. From its sponsorship of summer teacher seminars to the
seed money it has provided for the documentaries of Ken Burns to
the preservation of historical papers, photos and documents that it
helps subsidize, the NEH has extended its cultural province from
the grass roots to the university archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to serve the American people, and as a folklorist I
believe in that very deeply,'' continued Ferris, who was the
founding director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture
at the University of Mississippi, where he spent 18 years before
his NEH appointment. ``It's a good Texas tradition, with J. Frank
Dobie and the Lomaxes (the family of musical folklorists) all part
of that legacy that we're calling `Rediscovering America.' Looking
at the roots of your culture in Texas, the ranching communities,
the Hispanic and ethnic worlds, the blues and country music, the
rich tradition of your writers, that's all part of what we're
trying to do around the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1973, the Texas Council for the
Humanities has issued more than 1,500 grants, primarily from funds
provided by the NEH. In addition to speeches by Ferris and former
TCH executive director James F. Veninga _ from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. at
the Bass Lecture Hall of the LBJ School of Public Affairs _ the
celebration will feature screenings from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. (also
at Bass) of three award-winning documentaries that received TCH
grants: ``The Orphan Trains,'' ``Divided Highways: The Interstates
and the Transformation of American Life'' and ``The Death of Davy
Crockett.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an occasion for us to look at our own history, to take
stock of what it is we've achieved,'' said Richard T. Hull, who
succeeded Veninga.
</P>
<P>
   Since the national appointment of Ferris, a Southern populist as
well as an esteemed academic, there has been less criticism of the
endowment from some conservative Southern sectors, where the NEH
had earlier been stigmatized as the liberal-minded province of
ivory-tower elitists. Among the terms of Newt Gingrich's ``Contract
with America'' was an end to federal funding for the NEH and the
even more controversial National Endowment for the Arts. Shortly
after naming Ferris to the chair of the NEH _ an appointment that
passed without even a confirmation hearing _ President Clinton
tapped the Country Music Foundation's William Ivey, another
Southern folklorist, to head the NEA.
</P>
<P>
   Though the appointments proved politically expedient in
garnering Southern support, they sparked suspicion in some media
circles that civilized culture was going to seed. The New York
Times wondered whether Clinton was ``installing a sort of Southern
folklore Mafia inside America's cultural institutions,'' while
columnist George Will decried the ``depressing embrace of cultural
democracy,'' claiming that Ferris considered William Faulkner,
Elvis Presley and Goo-Goo Clusters candy equally venerable as
cultural icons. Since assuming his office, Ferris has been careful
to shake the hay from his cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep the horses here, but they're well-bred horses,'' he
said with a laugh. ``I think those concerns have been totally
dispelled. We're working carefully with all of our traditional
institutions _ the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Newberry Library
in Chicago, the National Trust for Historical Preservation all just
received $600,000 challenge grants (which must be matched by grants
from the private sector) for their work. But we're also connecting
the agency to worlds that traditionally have not been a significant
part of it. We're reaching out to the American people, seeking to
make the humanities a part of every American's life.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is particularly acute in such a varied and rapidly
changing state as Texas, which must decide how support for the
humanities might best serve so many cultural constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful challenge,'' said Hull, formerly a philosophy
professor at the State University of New York in Buffalo. ``I have
a number of friends back East who think of Texas as hats and spurs,
and who would be amazed at East Texas or South Texas, or at what
Dallas and Houston and Fort Worth and Austin and San Antonio have
become in terms of urban centers.''
</P>
<P>
   The current NEH budget is $110 million (from a peak of $172
million in 1995), or 42 cents from each American taxpayer. Where
this country's entire governmental subsidy of the arts and
humanities is $3 per capita, Germany spends $39 per capita, France
$35. Deriving 90 percent of its budget from the NEH, the TCH has
seen its granting drop from $900,000 in 1989 to $300,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this says that we're still a young nation that has yet
to learn the value of its own culture,'' said Ferris. ``The fact
that we spend so little on our own rich heritage is a sad
commentary that we're trying to correct here. We've won the Cold
War and the economic battles, but we are forgetting the stories of
who we are. We are fighting for the souls of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that fight gives Ferris a chance to eat a little barbecue
and hear some music, so much the better. He long has been a
frequent visitor here, through his Austin connection with his
sister, Hester Magnuson (her novelist husband, Jim, is the director
of UT's Michener Center for Writers) and his academic ties to the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin is like my second home, and any excuse I have to come
there I jump on it,'' he said. ``I just love the university and the
city, and that whole culture of music and food is something I
consider rare and special.''

 &HT;    SXSW Interactive returns to Internet roots
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Examining the origin of a successful event is
always amazing. The study makes it possible to catch a rare glimpse
of something as it churns, as life is breathed into a concept and
the idea grows into reality. To see the birth of genius.
</P>
<P>
   Take SXSW's Interactive Festival 1999. What _ on the surface _
appears to be the best, most organized Interactive festival to date
began as a cacophonous meeting of the minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first meeting was crazy; it was this totally unfocused,
nonlinear thing,'' says co-founder Hugh Forrest as he throws back
an iced coffee and runs his hand through his hair in recalled
frustration. ``When I think back on it, it really was reflective of
the Internet at the time. No one knew what the Web was going to be
and we sure didn't know what this festival was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The way everyone in that meeting saw it _ the group included
multimedia gurus Chipp Walters, Human Code's Lloyd Walker and the
late Dewey Winburne _ Austin's film scene was growing, as was this
multimedia thing. If they could just find a way to make these
burgeoning elements of Austin into a festival, they could help
their city grow and become an all-encompassing entertainment
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   What came out of that blustery brain trust was the first spark
for the inaugural SXSW Film and Multimedia Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting SXSW F/M was discombobulated at best. Organizers
of the multimedia section of the conference were arguing in the
halls, panelists were confused and seeking information along with
their audiences and the trade show was bereft of trade. The only
truly successful part was a room called ``The Internet Theater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were actually teaching people how to use the Internet,''
says Forrest, director of this year's festival. ``It was like `and
then you click here to see the page.' The funny thing is the room
was packed, standing room only.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to 1999. The SXSW film and multimedia festivals are
now separate conferences and Forrest and his staff are far from
``unfocused.'' In fact, 1999's SXSW Interactive Festival looks
leaner and meaner than ever.
</P>
<P>
   With panels like ``The Austin Interactive Scene'' and ``Click My
Lit: The Literate Web,'' the festival has laser-focused itself on
the Internet. SXSW Interactive will also have keynotes by muy
importante Internet leaders like Mark Cuban of the record-setting
IPO, Broadcast.com. All this adds up to the festival finally being
the informative, trend-setting event it set out to be when Forrest
and the rest of his think tank sat down to plan themselves a
celebration of Austin's technological cutting-edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really remember the early years,'' says Bob LeVitus,
author of a number of Macintosh books and the victim of a
lambasting at last year's ``Mac vs. Windows'' panel (``It wasn't a
good year for Macs,'' says LeVitus defensively). ``SXSW Multimedia
or whatever it's called this year always had these rough edges that
never got smoothed out. This year it actually looks like a real
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrest winces at the mention of this year finally being a
``real conference.'' But the evidence clearly supports LeVitus'
contention that SXSW Interactive didn't quite know what it was in
the beginning. After a well-attended, if unorganized, first year,
the founders kept the second year's Multimedia Fest centered on
CD-ROMs. To Hugh's delight, registration grew 300 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring they were on to something, in 1996 they moved the
conference to Austin Convention Center and kept the multimedia
focus with panels such as ``So you want to make a CD-ROM?'' and
``The Web is dead?'' Registration grew by only 5 percent. Not
keeping pace with the sonic speed of technology _ which was clearly
moving toward the Internet _ provided a bit of a wake up call.
</P>
<P>
   This epiphany led to a name change _ SXSW Multimedia/Interactive
_ and to a menu of panels more on the perceived fringe, plus a
smattering of Internet technology panels. Panels like ``The Future
of Sex,'' with UT cybersex guru Sandy Stone taking the audience
through a ``cyberorgasm,'' dominated the conference. Again, the the
public buzzed with low ratings for the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a progression, like they've been drawing tighter,''
says Nikol Lohr, creator of Disgruntledhousewife.com and former
designer of the now re-formed Texas Monthly site.
</P>
<P>
   One of those tightening the festival is Axel Ronsin, an eager
SXSW music volunteer who defected and joined Forrest last year.
Ronsin made it a life's goal to help turn around the festival. On
his way there, he wanted to build the trade show up and focus the
panels. He came up with three words he wanted the festival to
center on: Internet, (new) technology and games. The result _ a
tremendously improved trade show, but miserably attended gaming
panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to SXSW Interactive very motivated and felt I could
really make it successful in my first year,'' says Ronsin. ``This
year, I was a lot more savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to SXSW Interactive Festival 1999, a conference
totally devoted to the Internet _ which, in hindsight, is what it
should have been from the moment organizers saw crowds packing in
to ogle over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest says they are well on their way to booking a record
2,000 registrants, and digerati from media oracle Michael Wolff to
music maverick Phillip Glass have signed on to speak and perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I want people to feel like they're getting a huge
amount of information and making a lot of contacts,'' says Forrest.
``At its most basic level, SXSW Interactive is one big party. I'm
hoping to bring all these people together and next year they come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   SXSW INTERACTIVE BEST BETS
</P>
<P>
   With a stellar lineup of speakers and panels, it's hard to pick
the ``must-sees'' of SXSW Interactive '99. So here's our best shot.
All speeches and panels are at the Austin Convention Center:
Sunday, 10 a.m. _ Marc Cuban's keynote speech. This should be an
absolute hoot. After his Broadcast.com audio site set an IPO
record, he's the hottest celebrity in the Internet universe.
Sunday, 3:30 p.m. _ Building Women's Community Online for Fun and
Profit panel. Aliza Sherman (Cybergrrl), Heather Irwin (Estronet)
and Heidi Swanson (ChickClick) are a few of the stars that make up
this panel. The group is sure to touch on the growth market of
women on the Web and fulfill SXSW Interactive's ``spirited female''
quota. Monday, 1:30 p.m. _ ''Amazing Successes, Amazing Failures''
panel. It's always more interesting to hear a panel that talks
equally about the successes and failures of the hi-tech business.
Sit in on this one before you plan that Internet startup. Tuesday,
3:30 p.m. _ ''I Want My MP3'' panel. The new music technology for
the Web that has music industry execs quaking will be the topic of
discussion. It was moved to Tuesday to accommodate SXSW platinum
badge holders who also are here for the music festival. The music
guys will be the ones with looks of horror on their faces as
Michael Robertson (www.MP3.com) explains why they will soon be
obsolete.

PRIVATE CHARITIES, UNICEF CLASH OVER BUYING BACK SLAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Private charities that are buying freedom for
enslaved children and young women in Sudan have reacted angrily to
recent criticism of them from UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to understand why UNICEF should say our
activities are intolerable,'' said John Eibner head of Christian
Solidarity International, of Zurich, Switzerland, which since 1995
has bought and set free 5,942 Sudanese children, spending about $50
a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is intolerable is to leave these women and children in
the hands of brutal captors,'' said Charles Jacobs of the American
Anti-Slavery Group in Boston, which helps raise money to support
Christian Solidarity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing in Geneva in early February, a UNICEF
spokeswoman, Marie Heuzer, described the slave redemption program
as ``intolerable'' after Christian Solidarity raised the topic by
appealing to Secretary General Kofi Annan to condemn slavery in
Sudan and to create a special program to trace and free enslaved
women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a UNICEF spokesman, Peter Crowley, said the agency
still has ``genuine concerns'' about buying freedom for children,
adding that they were shared by some human-rights organizations,
including Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   He said that buying back slaves did not offer ``a lasting
solution'' to the problem, which he said can only come through
bringing about an end to Sudan's on-again, off-again 30-year-old
civil war pitting the Muslim north of the country against the
Christian and animist south.
</P>
<P>
   The children were also being returned to villages that remain in
the war zone and were subject to future slave raids.
</P>
<P>
   Another objection was one of principal, he said, because the
buy-back program implicitly accepts that human beings may be bought
and sold. This could also encourage slave-taking for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley argued that buying freedom does nothing to change the
underlying ``social attitudes'' of a people who are used to owning
slaves and regard doing so as perfectly normal.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF has also contended that redeeming slaves for money helped
prolong the civil war by giving combatants extra cash for buying
arms and ammunition. But Christian Solidarity insists it pays for
the slave it buys with Sudanese pounds to avoid introducing dollars
into the region because they could be used for purchasing arms.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch emphasized that its own position on the slave
buying issue is ``nuanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed Brody, the organization's Advocacy Director, agreed that
buying back slaves creates a ``real danger of fueling a market in
human beings'' in a country as desperately poor as Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   He called slavery there a ``very troubling issue'' but said that
the real challenge it raises is that of finding an end to a long
war which he said neither side can ever hope to win.
</P>
<P>
   Brody pointed out that human-rights organizations and the U.N.
Human Rights Commission have long been calling for international
monitors to be sent to Sudan to trace children taken into slavery
and secure their liberation. But no action has been taken.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 report on slavery in North Africa, a representative of
the Human Rights Commission accused Sudan's government forces of
regularly abducting and transferring women and children from
southern conflict zones to the north, where they disappeared.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14)

 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Patrick J. Fant acknowledges that the designs on his
coffins may not be for everyone. But for some people, they are the
only way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Standing recently in a Houston mortuary, Fant gazed at one of
his favorites, which depicts a golf course with mountains in the
background. ``For a golfer, that's pretty much heaven right
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That design, ``Fairway to Heaven'' is one of 16 that Fant's
company, White Light of Dallas, sells to families that want to add
some originality to the business of sending loved ones to their
eternal rest.
</P>
<P>
   One model glimmers with faux stained glass; another portrays Our
Lady of Guadalupe with her hands folded in prayer. A third coffin
bears the design of an AIDS ribbon, and a fourth resembles a
package wrapped in brown paper, complete with a stamped message,
``Return to Sender.''
</P>
<P>
   Fant, who worked in the radio industry for 30 years, first as a
broadcaster and then as a general manager, said he came up with the
idea after noticing an advertisement for a coffin distributor. ``I
thought, `How odd, they're all so impersonal,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he was contemplating switching careers, and the
idea of personalizing funeral farewells appealed to him. So he
teamed up with a graphic designer in Houston to figure out the best
way to decorate the coffins. They developed a method for applying a
high-resolution photo-laminate mural to steel; a patent is pending.
</P>
<P>
   To keep his prices competitive, he starts with a white coffin
made of lower-end, 20-gauge steel. Then comes the laminating work.
Basically, he says, ``we're a van conversion company.''
</P>
<P>
   Fant has sold 30 caskets so far, about two-thirds of them to
funeral homes. He sells a casket that costs him about $1,000 at a
30 percent markup, he said. The caskets retail for under $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great concept,'' said Cynthia A. Jones, a vice
president at Mabrie Memorial Mortuary in Houston, which plans to
offer the caskets for sale. ``What better way of expressing a
person's life than through their going-home vehicle?''
</P>
<P>
   Fant believes that his coffins will appeal to the ``maturing Me
Generation and the free-thinking Gen X crowd'' looking for ways to
create an unforgettable final statement.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some potential customers might cringe at the
concept, fearing that it could trivialize a solemn occasion. But
Fant is betting that enough people will overcome such inhibitions
to make his business thrive _ people like June O'Donnell of Hot
Springs, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. O'Donnell and her husband, James, an Irish-American who was
dying of cancer, were shopping for a casket earlier this year when
Ginger, their 30-year-old daughter, spotted a Fant creation that
bore the green, white and orange bands of the Irish flag. She asked
her parents to take a look.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I had a difficult time with it,'' Mrs. O'Donnell
said. But O'Donnell, who had always wanted to retire to Ireland,
saw it as ``the only way to go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After his death in early February, his service was marked by
orange and green floral arrangements and the sounds of Irish music.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after her husband's death, she heard from friends about
the funeral of a car-wash owner who had been an avid fan of the
University of Arkansas Razorbacks: The 500 mourners demonstrated
their flair for the grand gesture by breaking into the school's
famous hog call. One thing led to another and Mrs. O'Donnell passed
along the concept of a Razorback coffin to Fant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had so much fun,'' Fant said. ``Either this is
totally crazy or we've come across a product whose time has come.''

MICK FLEETWOOD SEEKS TEEN HELP IN `MR. MUSIC' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mr. Music'' isn't much of a movie, but it does point to a
pressing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Which is that a whole generation's rock music icons are a few
years older than their fans. And led, shall we say, accelerated
lives.
</P>
<P>
   So now they're creaky and a wee bit embarrassing, the more so
because they still insist on wearing T-shirts, leather pants and
ponytails.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these ancient rockers might want to consider an
overcoat, a wool cap, a thermos and a nice spot on a park bench.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Showtime's ``Mr. Music,'' premiering Sunday, Mick
Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac has that weathered look. But at least he
seems capable of chuckling at his own state of affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, the cable movie is for teenagers. Fleetwood,
who is more of a presence than an actor, plays Simon Eckstal, head
of Tone Records.
</P>
<P>
   Tone Records is a label that supposedly peaked in the early
1970s and is now withering. Simon figures that a jolt of publicity
might attract a big-name band or two, and he has an idea. He picks
15-year-old Rob Tennant (Jonathan Tucker), practically at random,
and appoints him vice president for talent at Tone Records.
</P>
<P>
   Teen gets big job at record company. If most successful TV
really amounts to fantasy fulfillment, this movie ought to be a
magnet for the intended audience.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mr. Music'' is promptly mired in a by-the-numbers formula.
Rob's enthusiasm wanes when he learns that he was hired solely to
generate publicity, but he finally eclipses the corruptive schemes
of grown-ups and saves the company. Hurrah.
</P>
<P>
   It's absolutely, totally predictable. But when you get to be
Fleetwood's age, surprises can be a strain.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Darklings,'' on the Fox Family Channel (also showing
Sunday), is targeted for nearly the same audience and itself is
hardly original. It makes better use of its formula, though. In
this instance, it's an adolescent variation of Alfred Hitchcock's
``Rear Window.''
</P>
<P>
   Infected with mononucleosis and confined to a bedroom at his
grandmother's small townhouse, 14-year-old C.J. Jackson (Ryan De
Boer) thinks he witnesses a murder through his window one night.
</P>
<P>
   The supposed killer is a former baseball star (Timothy Busfield)
who has just moved in across the street, and the apparent victim is
a town resident (Suzanne Somers).
</P>
<P>
   The ``supposed'' and ``apparent'' are because the investigating
cop (Martin Sheen) finds no evidence of a crime. In fact, the
victim materializes in fine fettle as C.J. and two young chums (Ben
Johnson and Meghan Ory) begin to pry into the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Darklings'' strains on the creepy front _ spiders, a rat,
a closeted corpse, an over-the-top performance and maniacal laugh
from Busfield _ and its efforts aren't wasted.
</P>
<P>
   The movie requires modest expectations. But it skips along
agreeably as a kind of nonthreatening thriller. Think ``Hardy
Boys.''

COMMENTARY: LOYALTY, SHMOYALTY! 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My colleague William Safire recently wrote a much-noted column
that began by asking: ``What inspires the phenomenal loyalty to
Bill Clinton?'' Safire wondered aloud how everyone from the public
to the Democratic Party to presidential aides could remain so
``loyal'' to Clinton, despite all his perfidies. Safire's column
got me thinking. But the more I thought about it _ particularly in
the wake of George Stephanopoulos' insightful memoirs _ the more it
struck me as exactly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For my sins, I actually covered the first year of the Clinton
White House. And looking back, what impresses me now is the
profound lack of loyalty at the core of that White House, compared
with President George Bush's. There was an unspoken sense conveyed
by Clinton officials that, if they ever got in trouble, this White
House could not be counted upon to come to their defense. And vice
versa. Before the Clintonites had even figured out where the
bathrooms were, both Bob Woodward and Elizabeth Drew were out with
excellent inside-the-White-House books, with administration
officials freely criticizing the president, and some even doing it
on the record!
</P>
<P>
   All I could think was that while Woodward needed ``Deep Throat''
to break the code of loyalty in the Nixon administration, when it
came to the Clinton administration he had ``Deep Chorus'' or ``Deep
Choir'' _ half the White House wanted to talk about their boss. It
has been downhill ever since. The number of not only kiss-and-tell
books but kiss-and-kill books about Clinton by former aides _ from
Robert Reich to Dick Morris _ is astounding to me. And those who
have not written books have provided the audio version on ``Larry
King.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty? Say what?
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Why the absence of loyalty? I posed that to a
Harvard University political philosopher, Michael Sandel. To begin
with, answered Sandel: ``Loyalty breeds loyalty and disloyalty
breeds disloyalty. It was clear early on in this administration,
particularly with the dumping of Lani Guinier, that loyalty was not
in season.'' Clinton reaped what he sowed.
</P>
<P>
   A second factor, argued Sandel, is a decline in the dignity and
sobriety that surrounds the presidency. ``During the Cold War,'' he
argued, ``with the president's finger always on the nuclear
trigger, leaks from the inner circle could imperil national
security. These days, the Oval Office is not the place of sobriety
and dignity it once was. Revelations about the president are now
the stuff of entertainment and titillation, not a threat to
national security. The national security presidency has given way
to the celebrity presidency. And in such a world, the rewards for
disloyalty include TV shows and book contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. Monica treated the Oval Office like a singles bar,
and the hot line as something you use for phone sex. And so did her
boss. That is not exactly an approach that breeds loyalty and
discretion. National security is out, National Enquirer is in.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, said Sandel, ``the revolving door between government
and media is spinning faster than ever, and the faster that door
spins, the more powerful the incentives to quickly tell all, and
the more people out there telling all.'' So commentators are out,
and what White House calls ``commentraitors'' are now in.
</P>
<P>
   That no Clinton official resigned in protest _ over the fact
that the president had spun them all by denying any liaison with
Monica _ was not a sign of intense loyalty to Clinton. It was a
sign of people either sticking it out because they were loyal to
his agenda, or people simply being loyal to themselves. What
cabinet official would be so foolish as to resign over being spun
by the president, in an administration built around spin? That
would be a one-day story.
</P>
<P>
   In this age, when the line between entertainment and news has
disappeared, it is not what you do on principle that matters. It is
simply how famous _ or even better, how infamous _ you are. That's
why so many ``news'' shows are now hosted by the likes of Johnnie
Cochran, Oliver North, G. Gordon Liddy, Dick Morris, etc. Infamy,
not fame, disloyalty, not integrity, is how you get ahead in an era
that will surely one day bring us ``The Charles Manson News Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't want to resign from this administration, you want to
get convicted. You don't want to fall on your sword, you want to
put it in your boss' back.
</P>

OIL MINISTERS DISCUSS CUTTING EXPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oil ministers from five major oil producing nations met in the
Netherlands Thursday to discuss cutting crude oil exports in an
effort to further bolster the recent modest recovery in crude oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions were taking place outside The Hague and included
oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela and Algeria, which
are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
as well as from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers broke up Thursday without issuing a statement and
will meet again Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico joined Saudi Arabia and Venezuela last spring in an
alliance to push through production cuts of 2.6 million barrels a
day in the face of a 40 percent wholesale price decline last year.
The glut of crude oil helped keep down gasoline prices, which
normally rise in the spring as demand increases. Without the
efforts of the producers, some analysts said, crude oil prices
would have plunged even further.
</P>
<P>
   Ali ibn Ibrahim Nuaimi, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, has
said that the ministers would seek to hammer out a new accord
between OPEC and non-OPEC producers that would result in
substantial new cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of crude oil, which have rebounded by about $3.30 cents a
barrel since mid-February, fell Thursday after surging on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brent crude oil for April delivery fell by 9 cents, closing at
$12.37 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil for April delivery fell 38 cents, or 2.6
percent, to close at $14.31 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   World demand has been rising slightly and production in such
countries in the United States has dropped as wells have been shut
due to low prices. The high level of inventories has also begun to
drop.
</P>
<P>
   But Ann-Louise Hittle, the director of international petroleum
at Cambridge Energy Associates, an energy consulting group in
Cambridge, Mass., cautioned that if further cuts were not made
inventories would again begin to build in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be some downward pressure on prices,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   One problem had been that OPEC and the countries cooperating
with them had failed to reach last year's goal of cutting 2.6
million barrels a day. In February they had achieved only about 79
percent of the pledged cut, according to a survey made by
Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   The current effort to cut production further is being led by
Saudi Arabia, which is the world's largest oil exporter. Like many
other major oil producers, its economy has been hit hard by the
falling prices.

<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ At the gala inauguration of the Center Party
Wednesday night, before the balloons dropped from the rafters and
the official party jingle debuted, Mimran Yaakov, a businessman,
presented his political credentials to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen,'' Yaakov said, waving his Turkish cigarette for
emphasis, ``I am what you would call a classic Likudnik. I was born
in Morocco. I immigrated here at the age of 5. I went through all
the melting pot. And the last time around, I was Likud Party all
the way, rah, rah Bibi Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now I represent the people who are very disappointed with
the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu. And people like me, we
believe it's time for an authentic candidate, someone like Yitzhak
Mordechai, who made his career despite all the hardships of
prejudice and poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Iraqi-born Mordechai at its head, the new Center Party
is banking on all the Mimran Yaakovs of this country to prove that
it is not just a quixotic venture. Barely hatched, it has taken on
an ambitious task. By election day on May 17, it seeks to break the
traditional Israeli voting allegiances to the two major parties,
Labor and Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the crowd at the Cinerama Theater, the Center Party
is most readily siphoning votes from the Likud's core constituency
of Sephardim _ Jews from North Africa and the Middle East. Many
participants Wednesday night proclaimed themselves both fed up with
Netanyahu _ ``Bibi, go home!'' they chanted _ and thrilled with the
barrier-breaking candidacy of Mordechai, the former defense
minister and first Sephardic immigrant to run for the top office in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yitzhak Mordechai pulled himself up to a position of power,
and it would be a very powerful lesson to this country if he could
be elected _ not appointed, and not given a favor,'' Yaakov said.
</P>
<P>
   But the party needs tens of thousands of Labor supporters, too,
if it is to conquer its chief conundrum. Early polls show that
Mordechai would be the sure victor over Netanyahu in a runoff
election, which would be held June 1 if no candidate wins a
majority on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   But the same polls indicate that Mordechai is unlikely to get
past the first round of voting; he trails the incumbent and the
Labor Party candidate, Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stage amid whistles and cheers from thousands of
supporters, Mordechai spoke passionately and in a hoarse voice
about the need for unity. Yet at the same, he took swipes not only
at Netanyahu but, for the first time, at Barak, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is incapable of healing the social ills, like I can,''
Mordechai said of Barak. ``He cannot unite left and right; he is
inept at talking to religious people; he cannot understand either
the Sephardic mentality or that of Arab leaders.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of break-away political parties, the Center
Party began with a group of defectors. They are Mordechai, who was
dismissed as defense minister by Netanyahu in January; Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, a former army chief of staff; Dan Meridor, a former
finance minister under Netanyahu; and Roni Milo, the former mayor
of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four came from the conservative Likud; Shahak, who
is liberal, had no party affiliation when he resigned from the army
this winter.
</P>
<P>
   A disparate group, the leaders were brought together by their
desire to oust Netanyahu. Israel, they say, must be rescued from a
political stalemate between right and left that aggravates
dangerous divisions in the country _ between doves and hawks,
religious and secular, immigrants and native-born Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``These conflicts are very bitter, and neither Likud nor Labor
can bridge them,'' Shahak said in an interview. ``Each of them
represents half the people in Israel, and each of them are totally
unable to represent the other half. We feel that we are an
emergency measure. Without us, there will be no change.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Center Party leaders faced pressure to join
forces with Labor, which also seeks to dislodge Netanyahu. Haim
Ramon, a Labor member of Parliament, has renewed the call, saying
that together the two parties could beat Netanyahu in the first
round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Center Party have mocked the leaders for what
they see as their hubris in daring to create a party overnight.
Others have ribbed them for presenting themselves as a unifying
force for the nation when they cannot seem to agree on a party
platform or a ticket of candidates for Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The party gathering , while well-choreographed with a laser
show, a balloon drop and a video montage of Mordechai, suffered
because the platform and the ticket were not ready. There was,
simply, nothing to unveil other than the jingle; the candidate was
chosen in January by the other three leaders, because he is the
most popular among them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is not easy to grow a new party from scratch, and
Mordechai, using his military vocabulary, said that 85,000 Israelis
had enlisted so far. Polls already predict an impressive
accomplishment for the Center Party _ that it will capture more
than a dozen seats in the Parliament, making it the third-largest
party.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, it will move past Shas, an ultra-Orthodox
Sephardic party that took a decade to come into its own. Even if it
fails to win the prime minister's post, the Center Party is likely
to become a force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   Shahak said he believed it was too early to make any predictions
about the prime minister's race. ``It is only five weeks since we
started, and people don't know us well enough yet,'' he said. ``I
believe this election will be decided in the last few days, or the
last few hours, or the last few minutes before people put their
votes in envelopes.''
</P>
<P>
   While the crowd at the Cinerama was diverse, there appeared to
be few Russians present, which reflected what Shahak said was a
problem: ``We have no known Russian figures.'' But there were many
Israeli Arabs, who said they were impressed by the relationships
Mordechai as defense minister developed with Arab leaders. Israeli
Arabs, who usually vote for the Labor Party, are seen to be a
crucial bloc of potential swing votes.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mordechai declared his candidacy, Netanyahu and Barak have
largely refrained from even mentioning his name, much less
attacking him. Their advisers suggest that Mordechai does not have
the intellectual depth or vision to lead the country. But
Mordechai, who proved himself shrewd and pragmatic as defense
minister and army chief of staff, is reputed to be astute about
surrounding himself with good advisers.

 &HT;    Two more plants join power rush in Georgia
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two more companies have announced plans to build
electric power plants in Georgia, and more are expected in a rush
to meet the state's growing energy demands for the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Sonat Inc., a Birmingham, Ala.-based natural gas pipeline
company, said it would build a $230 million plant in Thomaston, 60
miles south of Atlanta, in Upson County.
</P>
<P>
   Dynegy Inc., a Houston-based energy marketing company, plans to
build a $100 million plant in Heard County, 60 miles west of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Both facilities would be fueled by natural gas and designed as
``peaking plants'' to provide electricity when demand is the
highest, during the hot summer months. Gas plants are much cheaper
to build than the state's current inventory of coal and nuclear
facilities, and burn a relatively clean fuel.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the capacity from the 680-megawatt Sonat plant is
under contract to Georgia Power Co., the state's No. 1 utility.
Dynegy said it would sell electricity from its 500-megawatt
facility in wholesale markets to Southeastern utilities.
</P>
<P>
   This week's announcements are the latest in a series of natural
gas-fueled power plants being built in Georgia and across the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for electricity in Georgia has been growing at an annual
rate of 3.5 percent. That is expected to taper off to 2.5 percent
as economic growth slows.
</P>
<P>
   But the generating capacity of Georgia Power and other utilities
will be strained, particularly during the summer, without
additions.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power is now soliciting bids to purchase between 800 and
1,200 megawatts of electricity to meet new demand in 2002 and 2003
beyond its current capacity of 16,000 megawatts, said Fred
Williams, senior vice president for resource policy and planning.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that process, the company is also preparing a
proposal to build its own 800-megawatt, natural gas-fired plant at
an undisclosed site.
</P>
<P>
   Under state Public Service Commission rules, the utility must
accept the lowest cost and most reliable proposal, either its own
or from an outside company. Capital requirements for such a plant
would likely figure in the utility's next rate hearings, which are
scheduled for 2001 and could affect consumer rates.
</P>
<P>
   A July bid selection will intensify the scramble to add power
plants, which is already under way:
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia Power is building a $100 million peaking plant in
Jefferson, in Jackson County, that will provide power for wholesale
customers. LG&AMP;E Energy Corp. has agreed to purchase electricity
from the plant. LG&AMP;E supplies electricity to Tucker-based
Oglethorpe Power Corp., which in turn serves 39 Georgia electric
membership corporations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oglethorpe is building a $70 million plant in Forsyth, in
Monroe County, that will produce 217 megawatts of electricity for
peak demand.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sonat's plans to build a $235 million plant in Cataula ran
into a roadblock late last year when the Harris County Board of
Commissioners revoked its construction permit following local
opposition. Georgia Power had contracted to buy power from the
plant. Sonat is contesting the action in court.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Young, a Sonat spokesman, said the company's project
announced Thursday for Thomaston would meet the company's contract
obligations to Georgia Power, but Sonat intends to build both
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Sonat already operates a co-generation plant in Kathleen, near
Macon, that supplies a Frito-Lay food processing plant and Georgia
Power.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dynegy, which is a partner in Georgia Natural Gas Services,
the marketing affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light Co., has no contracts
for power from its planned ``merchant plant'' in Heard County, but
is confident of demand in wholesale markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Southeast is one of the fastest-growing markets in the
country for power sales,'' said Chuck Watson, chairman and chief
executive of the Houston-based company.
</P>
<P>
   _ Omaha, Neb.-based Tenaska Inc. has also announced plans for a
plant of comparable size near Franklin, in Heard County.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Adams, chairman of the Heard County Board of
Commissioners, said his West Georgia county welcomes both projects.
``They won't overload our infrastructure or schools, and it's clean
energy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each project will employ 150 construction workers and eight
permanent workers, and generate $13.5 million in tax revenue during
the next 20 years, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Heard County is desirable for the projects because it is
crossed by both the Trancontinental interstate natural gas
pipeline, which brings in fuel for the plants, and high-voltage
electric wires, which transmit electricity to power grids.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, of Georgia Power, said 10 or 15 sites across Georgia
have the same advantage and guessed that options are being taken by
investors hoping to cash in on the building boom.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the announced projects will be able to attract
customers and financing, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not all be built,'' Williams said.

 &HT;    Work's on track for Atlanta arena
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The new downtown Philips Arena is already
three-quarters complete and on track to be finished Sept. 3 for the
next pro basketball and hockey seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The first ticketed event is scheduled to be an exhibition hockey
game about two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take two weeks to put the hot dogs in,'' quipped
Janet Marie Smith, president of Turner Sports and Entertainment
Development.
</P>
<P>
   From the 90 luxury suites that are all stacked on one side of
the arena so the nonsuiteholders on the other side are closer to
the action, to the 8-foot-tall shower heads in the Hawks locker
room, few details appear to have been forgotten in this $213
million project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about some big people,'' said Hawks coach Lenny
Wilkens, who toured the facility Thursday with reporters. The door
frames in the locker room are about a foot taller than normal and
the shower heads are nearly 2 feet taller.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's new nest for the Hawks and its hockey team, the
Thrashers, already has sold out the luxury suites for an average
annual price of $180,000 each. That's a total of $16.2 million _
about $3.5 million more than the annual debt service on the
building.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the beginning of the revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there's Turner Broadcasting System's $180
million-plus deal with Philips Electronics for the arena's naming
and sponsorship rights over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Also, about half of the 1,800 premium club seats, where waiters
will serve food, have been sold for either $8,000 or $9,500 apiece.
The tickets are good for both basketball and hockey games.
</P>
<P>
   Individual tickets for next season's Hawks and Thrashers games
aren't on sale yet. The Thrashers will be charging from $10 to $70
for individual seats, with an average price of $45. The Hawks have
not set next season's prices.
</P>
<P>
   The arena will house both a Hawk Walk and a Thrashers Nest. The
Hawk Walk is an indoor street of retail shops and interactive games
that will connect the arena to the Georgia World Congress Center.
Overlooking the walk is Thrashers Nest, a showcase of products and
technology that Philips is developing.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens said a state-of-the-art facility, such as the new 20,000
seat arena, is key to recruiting top basketball talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players want to play in a new, nice building,'' Wilkens said.
``It's part of the recruiting package.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the Hawks will have their own practice
facility inside their home arena. They have been practicing at Life
University in Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Thrashers are expected to announce a multi-year
lease agreement to practice at the IceForum in Duluth. The deal
also will provide offices for the Thrashers' coaching and training
staff.

 &HT;    Births, income increases stimulate remodeling craze
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bringing a new baby home is cause for a family to
celebrate. It's also good news for home remodeling companies. A new
addition to the family can mean an addition to the house, too.
</P>
<P>
   According to a three-year study released by the Joint Center for
Housing Studies at Harvard University, home remodeling now accounts
for about $150 billion a year, an amount that rivals new-home
construction and represents 2 percent of the nation's gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta probably does as well as any market in the nation, said
Bob Sokol, sales manager for Architectural Construction Renovations
by Paul Reardon. ``The (authors) expect activity to rise 2.4
percent in 1999, and I think we will see that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the study found more affluent people remodel their
older houses when family size changes or when household income
rises. Related spending trickles through the economy in the form of
furniture, floorings, appliances and technology that consumers buy
to jazz up the remodeled homes.
</P>
<P>
   There were 34 million such people in 1994-1995, the last year
for which data were available. They updated kitchens and bathrooms,
built additions and alterations, and made general improvements _
including disaster repairs _ to their property.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that money goes just to maintain and update aging
houses. The rest, though, goes to projects designed to suit the
house to the personality of its owners.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is expected to grow in the coming years because of
the rising level of homeownership, growing incomes and an aging
housing stock.
</P>
<P>
   An offsetting trend, however, is a projected decline in spending
as baby boomers start moving out of their peak remodeling years.
Even that trend has a silver lining for remodelers, though. Those
same boomers are increasingly likely to hire professional
contractors for their projects instead of doing it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The housing center's study is based on data from the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, from Commerce
Department research and from its own activity indicators. The
report does not include money spent by landlords on rental units or
have data broken down by region.
</P>
<P>
   The report foresees consolidation in the remodeling business as
retailers such as Home Depot expand their installation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Larger established companies are more likely to survive in an
industry dominated by one-person operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a high fallout rate,'' said Sokol, so much so that
customers are now as interested in warranty as in price because
they want to be sure the contractor will be around to fix problems
that might crop up later.

WILLIAM WRIGLEY, CHIEF OF HIS FAMILY'S GUM EMPIRE, DIES AT 66 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Conn., Wash., Calif., Ariz.)   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ William Wrigley, chief executive of the Wm. Wrigley
Jr. Co. and the heir of the chewing gum family that once owned the
Chicago Cubs baseball team, died Monday after a brief bout of
pneumonia. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The Wrigley company announced the death in a one-sentence
statement, in keeping with Wrigley's private and understated
approach during the 38 years he ran the company.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley's 35-year-old son, William Wrigley Jr., was named acting
president earlier on Monday, the fourth generation of the family to
head a company that was founded in 1891 by an earlier William
Wrigley Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The intensely private William Wrigley had headed the company
since the age of 28 in 1961, guiding it through a time of eroding
market share in the 1970s. Today, as in the 1920s, the Wrigley
company remains the world's largest chewing gum maker, with about
50 percent of the U.S. market and more than $2 billion in sales in
1998. (In the 1920s, however, the company had about two-thirds of
the market.)
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Wrigley _ who inherited an $81 million estate from
his father, Philip Knight Wrigley, in 1977 _ was worth more than
$2.7 billion at the time of his death, ranking him 64 in the latest
Forbes 400 survey of the richest Americans. Wrigley owned about 25
percent of the company's stock, and the Wrigley family together
owns more than 50 percent of the voting shares. Over a period of
several years, he donated a total of $15 million to the University
of Southern California to establish the Wrigley Institute of
Environmental Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley rarely granted interviews and kept a low profile, even
here in Chicago, where the company's headquarters, the Wrigley
Building, a majestic white skyscraper, is a city landmark, and the
Cubs still play at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   When other companies were diversifying, often borrowing to do
so, Wrigley shunned debt and maintained a singular focus on chewing
gum, relying on marketing skills to increase sales.
</P>
<P>
   William Wrigley was born on Jan. 21, 1933, in Chicago. His
father had succeeded his own father, William Wrigley, as the head
of the company. The founding William Wrigley Jr., a former soap
salesman who arrived in Chicago with $32 in his pocket, turned to
selling chewing gum in the 1890s, and created his own brand,
Wrigley's gum.
</P>
<P>
   When the founder, who was the majority owner of the Chicago
Cubs, died in 1932, he was succeeded by his son, known as P.K., who
in turn ceded the company to his son William Wrigley. After
graduating from Yale University in 1954, William Wrigley served in
the Navy on active duty in the Pacific until 1956, when he went to
work at the Wrigley company.
</P>
<P>
   He was named president and chief executive in 1961. In 1977,
both of his parents died within two months of one another, giving
Wrigley a controlling interest in the company. To meet a large
estate tax burden, Wrigley sold the family's 80 percent stake in
the Chicago Cubs to the Tribune Company in 1981 for $20.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley was married three times. All three of his children came
from his first marriage. He is survived by his wife, Julie Ann; two
sons, William Wrigley Jr. of Lake Forest, Ill., and Philip K.
Wrigley of Arizona; a daughter, Alison Rusack of California, and a
sister, Ada Schreiner of Seattle.

BELL ATLANTIC REGIONAL PLAN BEHIND SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bell Atlantic Corp. chairman Ivan Seidenberg conceded
Thursday that his company's plans to become the first regional Bell
company to offer long-distance telephone service have continued to
slip behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based company is seeking federal and state
regulatory permission to offer long-distance service in New York
state. While the company had earlier predicted it would complete
its applications by late 1998, Bell Atlantic now expects to file
the paperwork within the next six weeks, said Seidenberg before
speaking at the Boston College Chief Executives Club.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has said it plans to enter the long-distance
market in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New Jersey after New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when Bell Atlantic would start offering long distance in
the Bay State, Seidenberg, whose company has predicted a variety of
dates ranging from this past January to next December, now has
stopped forecasting a specific time. ``Frankly it is out of our
control,'' said Seidenberg, referring to the experience in New York
that has taken longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, the regional Bell companies are required to
first prove their local markets are open to competition before they
are allowed to sell long-distance services.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, as part of demonstrating it has opened local
markets, Bell Atlantic is reportedly struggling to meet the
technical requirements of an independent testing group which wants
to make sure that the company can quickly switch business and
residential customers to alternative local providers.
</P>
<P>
   While focusing on New York, Bell Atlantic has done comparatively
little of the technical work needed in the Bay State to make it
easy for customers to switch to alternative local providers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Seidenberg also responded to charges leveled by AT&AMP;T
on Monday that Bell Atlantic was signficantly behind schedule in
the required testing for quickly switching telephone customers in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Seidenberg dismissed AT&AMP;T's latest comments as ``self serving.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``MCI and AT&AMP;T have tried to put roadblocks in our
way. That's OK. They'll lose.''
</P>
<P>
   In his comments to the business community, he said that Bell
Atlantic's announced merger with GTE Corp., expected to close later
this year, will give Bell Atlantic the capabilities to expand
globally while serving the rapidly-growing long-distance and data
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our merger will give us the resources we need to invest in the
technology infrastructure that's so vital to the
information-intensive technology, financial and academic
institutions of Boston and the Bay State,'' Seidenberg said. He
said that Bell Atlantic has invested more than $8.8 billion in its
Massachusetts phone network in recent years.

CLINTON TO DEDICATE FIRST BOYHOOD HOME IN HOPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton returns only selectively to his
southwestern Arkansas roots _ as in the 1992 campaign when he
wanted to be ``the man from Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   He makes one of those infrequent pilgrimages Friday to dedicate
the modest white clapboard home where he lived until he was 4.
</P>
<P>
   The day after returning from a Latin American trip, Clinton will
fly to Hope, Ark., where he was born, for a three-hour nostalgic
dip into his earliest years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will get his first look inside the house at 117 S.
Hervey, near the Union Pacific tracks, in more than 40 years, said
Clinton Birthplace Foundation project manager Beckie Moore.
</P>
<P>
   The restored 1917 three-bedroom house has been outfitted with
period furniture and knickknacks, including a blue-tasseled Evening
in Paris perfume like the ones used by Clinton's mother, Virginia
Clinton Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly advised decorators on details such as color and furniture
placement shortly before her death in 1994. None of the furnishings
are original, Moore said, but some Clinton kin recently supplied
family pictures that have been added to the display.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to greet a large group of Hope residents when he
arrives at the airport, before going on to the house for an
invitation-only ceremony and tour, where the president will make
formal remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was preoccupied with national affairs _ and the Monica
Lewinsky scandal _ when the restored house was unveiled last
summer. His stop Friday also will mark the opening of a garden on
the site in memory of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is Clinton's first to his home state since the House
impeached him as a result of his affair with Lewinsky and the
Senate acquitted him.
</P>
<P>
   Even political opponents of the president concede the yearlong
scandal inquiry did little to dim Clinton's aura back home.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to vote for two of the articles of impeachment
last December, the U.S. House member from the area, Republican Rep.
Jay Dickey said: ``So many people in my district have their own
self-esteem intertwined with the well-being of their friend, Bill
Clinton. So while they have reason to be embarrassed, disappointed
and even disgusted, they are in large part in denial of the
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many enterprises involving the nation's 42nd chief
executive, the $1.5 million restoration of his boyhood home has
been touched by multiple controversies. The latest is the refusal
of the Arkansas Legislature to appropriate $500,000 to help fund
the final development of the site.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Sandra Rodgers, D-Hope, was reduced to tears as
fellow House members refused this week to have the president's home
state chip in.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, congressional committees subpoenaed foundation records
to determine whether wealthy foreigners _ such as Hong Kong real
estate tycoon Nina Wang, who gave $50,000 to the project _ were
seeking to curry favor with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy, at least initially, dampened contributions,
sources familiar with the foundation said.
</P>
<P>
   The home is where Clinton's mother was living with her parents,
Edith and Eldridge Cassidy, when she got the call in late spring
1946 _ three months before the future president's birth _ that her
husband, William Jefferson Blythe, had been killed in an auto
accident in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was born Aug. 19, 1946, in Julia Chester Hospital, which
was torn down years ago, but the site got a historical marker in
1992 as the most famous native son was headed to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The young Clinton made many friends in Hope who have played a
role in his political life, including Mack McLarty III, the former
energy company official who became Clinton's first White House
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton lived in the house on Hervey, his mother was
mostly in New Orleans studying to be a nurse. When she returned to
Hope, she married Roger Clinton, the local Buick dealer, and they
moved to another house in Hope. In 1953, the family moved about 70
miles away to Hot Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Her burial was one of the four times Clinton has returned to
Hope since the 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Clinton was in Hope for the burial of Vincent W. Foster
Jr., a White House counsel who committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped in Hope again to visit a sick relative, Henry
Oren ``Uncle Buddy'' Grisham, and then to attend the man's funeral
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton-sparked tourism and trade has been a modest boon for the
Hempstead County seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's given our town a chance to rebound,'' said Hope native
Gary Johnson, manager of a visitors' center set up in the
refurbished train station.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 tourists a day stop at the center during the
summer, Johnson said, with visits dropping off in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's impeachment had little effect on the tourist traffic,
Johnson said, although he noted ``a good crowd'' on the day the
president was acquitted by the Senate.

 Column: Forget the Dow, Traders Were Watching S&AMP;P 500 Flirt
With  1,300   By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
With the Dow Jones industrial average toying with 10,000 and the
first round of the national collegiate hoops tourney tipping off,
how much work do you suppose got done yesterday?
</P>
<P>
   Between water-cooler wagers on the Dow and office pools on the
Big Dance, my bet is that gross domestic product declined
profoundly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what might have been lost amid all of these worthy
distractions was the fact that the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 busted the
1,300 barrier, which is its own short-term psychological barrier.
The S&AMP;P 500 index hit a high during yesterday's trading session of
1,306 before running out of gas and closing at 1,297.
</P>
<P>
   For most Wall Street investors, the rise and fall of the broader
S&AMP;P 500 is far more meaningful than the trials and tribulations of
the Dow. (Of course, that's no revelation to the many mutual fund
investors who have been winning and grinning with index funds that
mirror the S&AMP;P.)
</P>
<P>
   But the Dow, with its 30 stocks, simply doesn't reflect what's
going on with the 500 listed in the S&AMP;P and the thousands traded on
the broader market. The S&AMP;P showcases such sexy, high-octane names
as Cisco, Microsoft, Dell, Gap and Pfizer, which are not to be
found on the dowdy Dow.
</P>
<P>
   So, when it came to what was grabbing the attention of traders
and money managers on Montgomery Street yesterday, it was the S&AMP;P's
flirtation with 1,300 ... not the Dow's dalliance with 10,000.
That, and Stanford's nailbiter with Alcorn State.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; DELAYED GRATIFICATION: &LR;  With the stock market testing new
milestones and the Russian ruble crisis a mere memory, it would
come as little surprise that Goldman Sachs is antsy to float its
shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   While earlier news and wire services speculated that the
long-awaited initial offering was slated for this summer, people
familiar with the situation say the IPO is likely to happen much
sooner: the second week of May.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these things are subject to change as we learned from
Goldman's first postponement in the wake of last summer's market
meltdown. But after having the issue hanging over the partners'
heads for the better part of a year, the investment bank is anxious
to get on with its new life as a publicly held concern, says former
Goldman Sachs trader Lisa Endlich, who is author of a new book on
the bank: ``The Culture of Success.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET12 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``They've been living in limbo,'' Endlich says.
</P>
<P>
   Endlich, who insists that the timing of her book and the IPO are
a pure coincidence, says there was no turning back once Goldman
decided last year to go public. Once the emotional decision was
made, it was an institutional admission that private partnership
was not the best business model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've said that you are not operating in the most
optimal way, then you have to go forward with those changes'' that
have already been approved, says Endlich, who lives in London and
started writing her book about three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And while Goldman ``will change into a completely different
organization'' after the IPO, the firm isn't likely to buy a retail
brokerage business such as Morgan Stanley did with Dean Witter,
Endlich notes.
</P>
<P>
   However, the former trader says that Goldman soon will open its
exclusive doors to Main Street via the Internet. Goldman, which
requires its clients to invest a $5 million minimum with the firm,
plans to develop an online brokerage strategy that caters to ``mom
and pop'' investors.
</P>
<P>
   You don't suppose that Goldman will charge under 10 bucks a
trade do you?

PRIVATE CHARITIES, UNICEF CLASH OVER BUYING BACK SLAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add comma in second graf and correct spelling of
``principle'' in 8th graf.)  
(rk) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Private charities that are buying freedom for
enslaved children and young women in Sudan have reacted angrily to
recent criticism of them from UNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to understand why UNICEF should say our
activities are intolerable,'' said John Eibner, head of Christian
Solidarity International, of Zurich, Switzerland, which since 1995
has bought and set free 5,942 Sudanese children, spending about $50
a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is intolerable is to leave these women and children in
the hands of brutal captors,'' said Charles Jacobs of the American
Anti-Slavery Group in Boston, which helps raise money to support
Christian Solidarity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing in Geneva in early February, a UNICEF
spokeswoman, Marie Heuzer, described the slave redemption program
as ``intolerable'' after Christian Solidarity raised the topic by
appealing to Secretary General Kofi Annan to condemn slavery in
Sudan and to create a special program to trace and free enslaved
women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a UNICEF spokesman, Peter Crowley, said the agency
still has ``genuine concerns'' about buying freedom for children,
adding that they were shared by some human-rights organizations,
including Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   He said that buying back slaves did not offer ``a lasting
solution'' to the problem, which he said can only come through
bringing about an end to Sudan's on-again, off-again 30-year-old
civil war pitting the Muslim north of the country against the
Christian and animist south.
</P>
<P>
   The children were also being returned to villages that remain in
the war zone and were subject to future slave raids.
</P>
<P>
   Another objection was one of principle, he said, because the
buy-back program implicitly accepts that human beings may be bought
and sold. This could also encourage slave-taking for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley argued that buying freedom does nothing to change the
underlying ``social attitudes'' of a people who are used to owning
slaves and regard doing so as perfectly normal.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF has also contended that redeeming slaves for money helped
prolong the civil war by giving combatants extra cash for buying
arms and ammunition. But Christian Solidarity insists it pays for
the slave it buys with Sudanese pounds to avoid introducing dollars
into the region because they could be used for purchasing arms.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch emphasized that its own position on the slave
buying issue is ``nuanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed Brody, the organization's Advocacy Director, agreed that
buying back slaves creates a ``real danger of fueling a market in
human beings'' in a country as desperately poor as Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   He called slavery there a ``very troubling issue'' but said that
the real challenge it raises is that of finding an end to a long
war which he said neither side can ever hope to win.
</P>
<P>
   Brody pointed out that human-rights organizations and the U.N.
Human Rights Commission have long been calling for international
monitors to be sent to Sudan to trace children taken into slavery
and secure their liberation. But no action has been taken.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 report on slavery in North Africa, a representative of
the Human Rights Commission accused Sudan's government forces of
regularly abducting and transferring women and children from
southern conflict zones to the north, where they disappeared.

 Column: Getting Your Ergonomic Needs Met  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  My friend is a programmer with 15 years of experience in
several computer languages. She had a car accident in 1996,
followed by surgery and extensive physical therapy. Now she's
trying to return to work but running into problems. She needs a
completely ergonomically sound workstation, including a computer
table that can adjust to either sitting or standing height. So far,
she's found that employers stop returning her calls when they learn
about her ergonomic needs. What can she do?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  The Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state
laws prohibit companies from discriminating against disabled
jobseekers like your friend.
</P>
<P>
   But face it, hiring someone who may need thousands of dollars
worth of special equipment can be a scary proposition. Potential
employers don't know the quality of her work; they don't know the
scope or cost of the equipment she'll need; they don't even know if
she'll stick around more than a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   Your friend needs to do as much as she can to defuse such fears.
That means presenting potential employers with a solution rather
than a problem. It means presenting herself as an active partner in
making that solution happen _ not as an adversary or a passive
complainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than just saying, `You need to spend all this money to
accommodate me,' she should say, `I know what I need, here are the
sources for the best price and equipment, and I'm going to do my
share to stay healthy and productive,''' said Gary Karp of Onsight,
an ergonomic consulting firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Your friend can start by researching precisely what equipment
she needs and how much it costs: One place to check is the
Ergonomic Sciences Corp., a Mountain View ergonomic equipment firm
with a Web site at  &LR; www.ergosci.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   She should also find out what outside financial help is
available. Most states, including California, have a Department of
Rehabilitation that will help pay for equipment or training to help
disabled people re-enter the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Your friend might also consider buying a small part of the
equipment herself _ especially if there are pieces that she'd want
to keep permanently. That would show employers she's willing to
meet them halfway.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco vocational counselor Betty Kohlenberg suggests
that your friend consider temporary or volunteer work that uses her
skills while she searches for a permanent position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking volunteer positions or temporary positions will help
update her skills and give her some recent work experience to talk
about with potential employers,'' Kohlenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the question of precisely when your friend
should reveal her ergonomic needs to a potential employer.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WORKWAYS (89155 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Let's assume her disability isn't outwardly visible. Legally, she
doesn't have to disclose her need for an accommodation until she
starts work. So some disability experts suggest waiting to raise
the issue until she has a job offer in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should say, `I'm thrilled with your offer. Can we set up
an appointment to discuss a few things in person?''' said Judy
Doane, a San Francisco specialist in repetitive strain injuries.
``At that meeting, she should tell them how excited she is to have
the job, how she's looking forward to working really hard, and how
she will need (some ergonomic help) to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Paying Commissions
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work for a financial services company that is about to be
bought by another firm. I'm not a salesperson, but I receive
commissions for business that I help bring in. I recently helped
land a very big account that should generate quite a bit of money.
Here's the problem: Commissions for the deal are to be paid
quarterly over the next two years, based on how much revenue it
generates. But the company that's acquiring us doesn't have a
commission program at all. Is it required to keep paying my
commissions?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Companies can't refuse to pay wages for work that has
already been done. Similarly, they can't refuse to pay commissions
that have already been earned.
</P>
<P>
   When is a commission considered `'earned?'' When an employee has
done everything that is required from him or her as part of the
deal, according to Thomas Makris, an employment lawyer with
Rosenblum Parish &AMP; Isaacs in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say your company requires you to continue servicing this
client over the next two years in order to receive a commission.
Your work is not complete. That means the commission isn't legally
``earned'' yet. And the company could refuse to pay you if it
switches to a new no-commission policy.
</P>
<P>
   But let's say you've completed all your duties on this account.
You've earned your commission _ and you must be paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this person has done everything he was expected to do to
make the sale happen and now just has to sit back and wait for the
money to roll in, there's a very good argument that he should be
paid,'' Makris said.
</P>
<P>
   Does the fact that the company is changing owners affect its
obligation to pay commissions? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   When this new company buys your old one, it's most likely
assuming the old company's legal obligations _ including the
obligation to pay commissions that employees like you have already
earned.

 &HT;    AOL reaches deal with SBC on high-speed Net access
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ America Online, the nation's largest online service,
and SBC Communications, the country's second-largest local phone
company, will offer high-speed Internet access to AOL members in
the West and South.
</P>
<P>
   SBC now offers high-speed digital subscriber line service in
California, Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kansas. The
agreement also includes Nevada Bell, which plans to deploy DSL
service this year.
</P>
<P>
   AOL said it will now be able to offer high-speed access in 21
states. The service needs to team with phone or cable companies
because it doesn't own any networks. Instead, it buys access and
resells it with AOL's content for a monthly rate of $21.95. AOL
said SBC service will cost an extra $20 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies such as San Antonio, Texas-based SBC want to
increase their sales of Internet services, yet they haven't been as
successful as America Online in attracting consumers. DSL is more
than 50 times faster than most standard modems, and will allow
customers to use a computer and phone or fax simultaneously on one
line.
</P>
<P>
   In January, AOL formed an alliance with Bell Atlantic to offer
high-speed access to AOL subscribers in the Bell Atlantic region.
BellSouth, which serves all of Georgia and eight other states, has
been conspicuously absent from the recent flurry of DSL and
high-speed content announcements and partnerships. BellSouth
spokesman Ted Creech says the company has been talking to AOL about
a DSL deal.
</P>
<P>
   He says there are 2 million DSL-ready homes in BellSouth's
service area. BellSouth estimates 5 million households will be
ready for DSL before the end of the year. BellSouth offers DSL
service in parts of Atlanta, Jacksonville and Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., Birmingham, Ala., Charlotte, Raleigh and Durham, N.C., and
New Orleans. DSL will be available in 23 more markets before the
end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in discussions with AOL,'' Creech said. ``And we
still are. We have been in conversations with lots of Internet and
network service providers. We currently have contracts with 14
providers right now for ADSL. It's actually a very active area of
our business.''
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth has not been able to come to terms with key
players such as AOL and major Internet service providers such as
Atlanta-based MindSpring.

COURT RULES OUT REFERENDUM ON NEW TAX PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ The New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled Thursday
that Gov. Jeanne Shaheen cannot look to the voters to solve the
state's looming school funding crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous opinion, the court turned down Shaheen's request
that voters be allowed to approve by popular referendum any new tax
system created to meet the court's April 1 deadline for enactment
of a new education finance scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Referenda on legislation are unconstitutional in this state,''
the justices declared in an advisory opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen, who said that she welcomed the opportunity to pit a
funding plan she outlined this week against a plan that includes
the state's first tax on personal income, was clearly disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been my view that on an issue as important as school
funding, the people of New Hampshire ought to be able to choose,
and that our state constitution permitted such a vote,'' Shaheen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling leaves the state's political leaders _ and
especially Shaheen _ in a difficult position, forced to choose
between increasing business taxes and drastically expanding the
state's reliance on gambling; ending the state's famous refusal to
impose an income tax; or allowing the New Hampshire education
system to fall into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen insisted that one of those options, enacting an income
tax such as the one that narrowly passed the House last week, is
now out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a referendum, an income tax is off the table and we
must continue to working together to resolve this crisis in the
very short period of time that lies ahead,'' Shaheen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers believe the court's decision decreases the
chances that the badly fractured political system will be able to
reach a consensus. The binding referendum would have left the issue
of how best to raise the estimated $900 million needed every year
to fund schools up to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 15 months of haggling, the state's political leaders
must decide. If they cannot agree over the next three weeks, the
school portion of property taxes will become legally uncollectable,
teachers will begin receiving pink slips, and New Hampshire, whose
loathing for taxes is legendary, could find itself in a grim
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes the worst of the scenarios more likely than they
were two hours ago'' said Tom Rath, a former attorney general and
Republican political activist.
</P>
<P>
   The court has been pushing this debate from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, the court ruled that the current system of
raising money for schools with local property taxes created
unconstitutionally high disparities between rich towns and poor
ones. Lawmakers, the court ruled, would have to find a better way.
With that began the long struggle to find a politically palatable
remedy.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the plans that have emerged since yet appears to
have the political support to pass.
</P>
<P>
   On March 4 the 400-member House narrowly passed a bill calling
for a combination statewide income and property tax and sent it to
the state senate which Democrats control for the first time in 86
years. This plan could pass in the Senate, observers agree, but
Shaheen has promissed to veto it. There are not thought to be the
votes to override a veto, especially in the House, where the
measure passed 194-190, far short of the needed two thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen countered with a proposal that would raise the money
with a $6 statewide property tax, increased taxes on business, a
new 5 percent tax on capital gains, and an additional $145 million
by allowing video slot machines for the first time at the state's
four racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitality industry has already come out against Shaheen's
plan and business opposition is building. Nor are the odds for
legislative approval of video slot machines good. In the past, a
majority politians of both parties have consistently refused to
expand gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that the governor's plan would not raise enough
money to pass constitutional muster. The Shaheen plan would provide
an average of $4,554 per pupil, $500 less than called for in the
rival income tax plan and nearly $1,000 less than the state's
average per pupil spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some reservations now about her plan,'' said Scott
Johnson, a lawyer for the coalition of five property-poor school
districts that first sued the state in 1991. ``There are some
constitutional problems with the adequacy amounts.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Shaheen plan, other argued, is bound to experience more
opposition as it is given more scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the more you look at it the more warts you
find,'' said Republican House Speaker Donna Sytek, whose own plan
has failed to come up for a vote in the full House.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the deadlock has brought ever louder complaints that
the court has gone too far. Some have suggested rewriting the
constitution so that justices would no longer enjoy life tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is about a hair's breadth away from getting
themselves term-limited,'' said Stephen Duprey, the State
Republican party chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor, too, is feeling intense pressure. With
presidential aspirants in every coffee shop and the nation's eyes
on New Hampshire, Shaheen may have been looking forward to the
chance to veto an income tax. Now, she may find herself written
into history books as the governor who raised taxes on business and
brought casino-style video gambling to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure she wants to make some of these choices,'' Rath
said. ``This has thrown everything back to square one which will
certainly make for an interesting month.''

   CALIF-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ From the Mexican border to the
Mark Taper Forum here, theater is alive _ and well enough _ in
Southern California, and the stars of film and television are
dabbling in it in ever greater numbers. This season alone, familiar
faces as diverse as Carol Burnett, Annette Bening, Donald
Sutherland, Al Pacino and Molly Ringwald have appeared, or are
scheduled to do so, on Los Angeles stages, in new works, revivals
of classics, or reworkings of recent New York offerings. By Todd S.

   NY-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ Architecture or real estate, what's
it going to be? Does New York have room for both? These are the
basic questions raised by the Canadian Center for Architecture's
competition to redesign an important piece of land on the west side
of midtown Manhattan. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).

<P>
   STAND-ALONE-FILM (Paris) _ After seeing ``I Stand Alone,'' after
meeting its director, Gaspar Noe, 35, one couldn't help but ask:
How could a pleasant young man with a positive view of life make a
film as dark and desperate as this one? Well, Noe might of course
have confessed that he was a secret nihilist, that ``I Stand
Alone'' (``Seul Contre Tous'') was a public form of psychotherapy.
Reassuringly, his answer was more straightforward. ``I can make a
film like this because I feel at ease with myself,'' he said. By
Alan Riding. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   ROMANCE-FILM (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) _ If you can't dazzle
them, shock them!'' the adolescent heroine of Catherine Breillat's
1989 film ``36 Fillette'' declares, with a glance at her own daring
decollete. Could that be the French director's motto? Ms. Breillat,
who is 50, is no stranger to scandal. From her first novel, written
when she was 17, to her most recent film, ``Romance,'' her candid
dissections of human sexuality have ignited debate at home and
abroad. ``Romance'' enjoyed a noisy premiere last month at the
International Film Festival here alongside a retrospective of Ms.
Breillat's six previous films. (``Romance'' is being shown as part
of the series ``Rendez-Vous with French Cinema Today'' at the
Walter Reade Theater on Friday and next Sunday and has just been
acquired by Trimark Pictures for an American release.). By Leslie
Camhi. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   KUBRICK-FILMS (Undated) _ When Stanley Kubrick died a week ago,
he left behind the monolith from ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' as the
single most salient image of his career. This (who could forget?)
was the dark, austere object that arrived in the midst of primitive
ape-men. It drove them into a state of high anxiety as they rallied
around the thing, touched it, recoiled, tried to fathom it, sensed
its intense power without quite grasping what that power might
mean. The arrival of each new mind-blowing Kubrick film was much
the same. By Janet Maslin. (Moved).

   DLUGOSZEWSKI-DANCE (New York) _ It's not often that someone
starts making dances after turning 60. Lucia Dlugoszewski, who
makes her choreographic debut on March 23 at Playhouse 91, is not a
total neophyte, though. A seasoned composer and musician, she
carried on a creative partnership, and marriage, with the
choreographer Erick Hawkins for more than 40 years. After Hawkins
died, Ms. Dlugoszewski set about staging three pieces outlined in a
notebook he kept at his deathbed. Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak
Dance Project performed the first of these posthumous works,
``Journey of a Poet,'' to mixed reviews at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music in 1997. The Hawkins company will present the two others
during its one-week run at Playhouse 91, which wraps up the 92d
Street Y's monthlong Harkness Dance Project. By Christopher
Reardon. (Moved).

   ARTHUR-MITCHELL-DANCE (New York) _ It is a landmark year for
Arthur Mitchell. In the coming months, he will be celebrating his
50th year in dance, the 30th anniversary of The Dance Theater of
Harlem and his 65th birthday. Dressed in a black silk shirt, black
jacket and black slacks, he makes as striking an impression now as
he did as a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet in the
1950s and 60s. On his bookcase in his office are photographs of
himself with Balanchine, another with Jacqueline Kennedy at the
White House and a more recent shot with President Clinton in 1993,
when Mitchell won the Kennedy Center Honors. By Valerie Gladstone.

   HEDDA-GABLER-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ Ever since Henrik Ibsen
wrote ``Hedda Gabler'' in 1890, the role has tantalized and lured
actresses. The tragedy, about a bored, vengeful wife on the edge of
madness, has been interpreted, with various degrees of Freudian and
feminist shadings, by Eva Le Gallienne, Geraldine Page, Maggie
Smith, Glenda Jackson, Jane Alexander and Dianne Wiest, among
others. ``What Hamlet is to men, Hedda is, in some ways, to
women,'' said Annette Bening, the latest Hedda, who has found the
role the most complex and relentless of her career. The production,
which begins previews Sunday evening will open on March 24 for a

   GERMANY-THEATER (Berlin) _ Competition can be good for business
_ even among cultural institutions. But in Germany in the last few
months, a rivalry involving three leading men of the theater has

cultural politicians can vie with one another for headlines, renown
and as large a piece as possible of the country's cultural pie. By
Anne Midgette. (Moved).

<P>
   JUSTICE-THEATER (London) _ Which new play has provoked the most
attention in the British theater so far this year? Which has
garnered the most column inches in the press, the most hours on
television, and by far the most enthusiastic reviews? No, the
answer is not some striking drama at the National or a searing
satire at the Royal Court. It has been a defiantly undemonstrative,
unpretentiously devastating piece called ``The Color of Justice''
that opened in January in the little Tricycle Theater in the
unfashionable North London area of Kilburn and went on to replace a
revival of ``Annie'' at a 1,500-seat theater in the West End, where
it ended its run Saturday. By Benedict Nightingale. (Moved).

<P>
   STEVE-REICH-MUSIC (Undated) _ On the new album ``Reich
Remixed,'' American, British and Japanese DJs pay tribute to the
American minimalist composer Steve Reich, at the invitation of his
label, Nonesuch (CD, 79552-2). Some of the DJs, notably DJ Spooky
(aka Paul Miller) were versed in his music; others just saw it as
an archive of cool sounds. Either way, their attraction to Reich's
work is anything but arbitrary. Drumming phases and sampling _ the
central components of contemporary dance music _ have formed an
integral part of his style since the mid-1960s. By Adam Shatz.

   BETH-ORTON-MUSIC (Undated) _ The English singer-songwriter Beth
Orton, 28, whose 1997 album ``Trailer Park'' was a spellbinding

   HOCKNEY-POSTER-ART (London) _ If you have ever dreamed of owning
a David Hockney but haven't had $20,000 (or considerably more) to
spend on a drawing, oil painting or lithograph, Christie's South
Kensington has come along with the largest-ever sale of Hockney
posters, to be held here on March 25. And although one might argue
that posters are not in the same league as paintings and
lithographs, the collection testifies to precisely that dazzling
breadth and wit that have made Hockney, now 61, one of the most
popular and admired of contemporary artists. By Matt Wolf. (Moved).

<P>
   CHILDHOOD-PHOTOGS (Undated) _ Devils or angels, children remain
hugely popular subjects for artists, especially photographers.
Though art photographers like Larry Clark and Nick Waplington track
the seamy side of youth in the 1990s, it is the free-and-easy
tradition of child photography that endures and continues to
influence the family albums and greeting cards of today. By Sarah
Bayliss. (Moved).

   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-MAJOR-ZEMAN (Prague, Czechoslovakia) _ Major Jan Zeman was a
Czech Communist Columbo, Peter Falk in immaculately pressed
fatigues, a savvy television cop whose tough questions and dogged
detective work unraveled the greatest mysteries of the Czechoslovak
Socialist Republic and always got the party's man. &UR;  &LR; From 1970 to
the mid-1980s, ``The 30 Cases of Major Zeman'' was one of
Czechoslovakia's greatest television hits, avidly followed by party
members and counter-revolutionaries alike. When Vaclav Havel and
the velvet revolution swept Czechoslovakia's ossified Communist
regime from power in 1989, Major Zeman turned in his badge, and
reruns of old American police shows like ``Miami Vice'' and ``Hill
Street Blues'' patrolled Czech airwaves. But now Major Zeman has
been recalled to active duty. The public service broadcaster Czech
Television has decided to rebroadcast the series sometime later
this year, outraging some of the Communists' real victims. By Peter
S. Green. (Moved).

CLINTON DEFENDS HIS ACTIONS IN NUCLEAR SPYING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTIGUA, Guatemala _ President Clinton vigorously denied on
Thursday that the administration had minimized evidence of nuclear
spying by China and defended his policy of engagement with Beijing
as the only effective means of restraining Chinese behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he was under no illusions about China's covert
efforts to acquire American nuclear weapons technology. He said
that after receiving persuasive evidence that highly classified
data about American nuclear weapons design had been leaked from the
Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, he acted
aggressively to contain the damage and prevent further incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not ignore evidence. Quite the contrary, we acted on
it,'' the president said at a news conference at the conclusion of
a summit meeting with Central American leaders. ``I believe the
record is clear that we did respond in an appropriate way.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments on Thursday were his first public statements
since reports emerged over the weekend that a Chinese-American
scientist at Los Alamos might have been responsible for providing
information in the 1980s that enabled China to develop a
miniaturized nuclear warhead similar to the most sophisticated
weapons in the American arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has opened an investigation of the case, including
allegations that the Clinton administration sought to play down the
severity of the alleged espionage and delay the investigation so as
not to jeopardize its policy of rapprochement with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he did not become aware of the potential scope
of the technology transfer until July, 1997, when he was briefed on
a continuing FBI inquiry into a case of possible espionage at the
Energy Department laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The initial investigation produced evidence not only of a hugely
damaging transfer of American nuclear technology, but of systemic
leakage of military secrets from the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, we moved quickly and decisively,'' Clinton said,
``not only with the continuing FBI investigation and a CIA review,
but also with an intense review of the counter-intelligence
capacities of our Energy Department labs.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that beginning in early 1998, he had
significantly tightened security at the weapons facilities,
including requiring polygraph examinations for employees with
access to critical information.
</P>
<P>
   And he asserted that the intelligence committees of Congress
have received 16 briefings on the matter since 1997, despite angry
complaints from members that the administration kept them largely
in the dark about the alleged spying.
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected calls from some Republicans that he dismiss
Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, whom some have accused
of foot-dragging in the spy case in order to protect and justify
his support for a policy of close cooperation with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met twice with Jiang Zemin, the Chinese president, in
the fall of 1997 and the summer of 1998, after Clinton learned of
the espionage charges but months before they became public. The
president plans to meet with the Chinese prime minister, Zhu
Rongji, in Washington in April.
</P>
<P>
   Critics suspect the administration of burying evidence of the
spy case to avoid damaging the relationship Clinton was trying to
build with Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Berger acted appropriately and therefore I would
not release him or ask for his resignation. I just don't think
there's any evidence to support that,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that despite this case and other evidence of
Chinese acquisition of weapons-related technology from the United
States, it was in America's interest to remain engaged with the
Asian giant.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his policy of ``strategic partnership'' with China
had already brought benefits, including China's signing of the
Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   He also praised Beijing's cooperation with the United States for
progress in non-proliferation programs aimed at Iran, Pakistan and
North Korea. China has also played a constructive role in limiting
the damage from the Asian economic crisis of the past 18 months,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would argue that our efforts to have an honest and open
policy with China, so that they don't think that we have made a
decision in advance to try to contain and limit them in their
economic growth and their development as a nation, has paid
dividends,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe those things would have occurred if we had
not had an open, candid, honest relationship with China, aware of
all the facts,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The president pointedly noted that the alleged transfer of
weapons technology to China occurred in the mid-1980s, when China
made rapid strides in its own nuclear program that were detected by
U.S. intelligence agencies. At the time, there was no clear
evidence that Chinese technological leaps were the result of theft
of American weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the current espionage case proves that Chinese spies
pilfered American weapons design, Clinton said, there remain
reasons to maintain ties with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that the evidence justifies an isolated
no-contact relationship with China,'' he said, ``when we have
gotten the benefits not only to ourselves, but to the rest of the
world, of our engagement policy.''

HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVE $11 BILLION `ED-FLEX' LEGISLATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House and Senate handily approved legislation
Thursday to give states and schools more flexibility in how they
spend $11 billion in federal money, a vote that gave each party a
claim to being in tune with the public's interest in education.
</P>
<P>
   But, after a week of partisan squabbling in the Senate over
amendments, a Democratic measure pushed by President Clinton to
authorize the hiring of 100,000 teachers to reduce class sizes
failed in a vote along party lines. In fact, Senate Republicans
pushed through an amendment that could jeopardize the $1.2 billion
already allocated to the program, a move that angered Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan bill, called ed-flex, passed the House by a vote
of 330-90, with only Democrats voting negatively, after arguing
that it would hurt poor children and fail to make schools more
accountable for improving academic achievement. In the Senate, the
bill passed 98-1. Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., cast the dissenting
vote. The two houses will now work to combine their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the the legislation allows both parties to present
themselves as the champions of education, but it means more to the
Republicans for two reasons. First, it helps them forge their own
identity with legislation giving local educators more control, and
makes up lost ground on the education issue, which they ceded to
Democrats for years.
</P>
<P>
   Second and more important, the bill is an element of a
congressional strategy meant to demonstrate that Republicans are
more than the party of impeachment, and that they have put bitter
partisanship behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have also taken a strong stand on two foreign policy
issues, Kosovo and China. On those issues they set themselves
against Clinton but not necessarily against a united Democratic
front in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the bipartisan work we said we were going to do in this
Congress,'' Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who has vowed to
reach out to Democrats, said Thursday at a news conference on
education. ``It's a real testament that people can work together,
that we can get good things done for America's kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Senate rejected the Democratic effort to add
Clinton's proposal to pay for the new teachers on a 55-44,
party-line vote, the measure is anything but dead. It will come up
again as part of a larger education bill later this year.
Thursday's vote simply enabled the Democrats and their allies in
the teachers unions to target Republicans who want their support,
but voted no Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does not oppose the bill, but in a statement on
Wednesday he said he ``will vigorously oppose any Republican
amendments to undermine the bipartisan agreement we reached last
year on class size,'' including the Senate provision that could
strip the existing $1.2 billion for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed-flex permits local schools districts to think outside the
box,'' said Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., who co-sponsored the
legislation. It would allow ``states and schools to mold federal
assistance to meet their individual needs,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill is modest at best, a ``small step'' as its
sponsors called it, congressional Republicans held it up Thursday
as their first major legislative victory of the year. Overall, the
federal government provides just 7 percent of the education budget
for the nation's schools and some educators say the bill would have
little impact.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which began as a pilot project in 12 states, would
allow all states to waive certain federal restrictions so schools
would have more leeway in how they spend $10 to $11 billion in
federal money. Some schools in the pilot project have used the
money, which is earmarked mostly for programs that benefit poor
children, for tutoring, for example. Schools would be eligible so
long as they demonstrate academic improvement.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 governors support the legislation, along with the
National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats argued that the bill does not adequately
require schools to show academic improvement, and they worried that
disadvantaged children would lose out in the shuffle. Their
attempts to address those concerns, which Republicans called
unfounded, were rejected Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A report by the General Accounting Office said the pilot project
had achieved some success. Two states in particular _ Texas and
Maryland _ have shown promising results. But the other 10 states
have scarcely taken advantage of the program. The report also cited
accountability concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot leave it up to the states,'' said Rep. Major Owens,
D-N.Y. ``They have not done a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the bill is likely to have minimal impact on
students, education experts say, because it would not substantially
increase the flexibility states already have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does ed-flex move us into new territory?'' asked Frank Newman,
president of the Education Commission of the States, a bipartisan
group that works with states to formulate education policy. ``Not
nearly in the way that you might imagine if you listened to some
member of Congress talking about it, because the current system is
not a rigid set of rules. States already largely get what they want
from the money so ed-flex doesn't change much.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, it appeared the bill would sink in the Senate
after the two parties wrangled over Democratic amendments,
including the proposal to authorize hiring the teachers, which was
approved by Congress last year with a $1.2 billion downpayment. The
measure would have allowed for an extra $11.4 billion to complete
the task in the next seven years. The House, with its stricter
rules, precluded a vote on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate made a specific promise last fall to help schools
hire 100,000 new teachers,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., the
senior Democrat on the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, who
said he would attach the measure to other pieces of legislation.
``We should keep that promise, not undermine it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, argued that the
amendments should be dealt with later this year, as part of a
sweeping education bill. But on Wednesday, rather than yank the
legislation and risk a partisan taint, he permitted the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said it dawned on him at a town hall meeting ``that we were
going to allow this bill to get tangled up or die because of
procedural haggling.'' Parents, he said, ``would not have
understood it, or liked it.''

   The Democratic amendments, relating to beefing-up after-school
and drop-out prevention programs, all failed. Republicans, though,
did get one of their pet proposals through. The measure would give
local governments the choice of using the $1.2 billion that was
appropriated for teachers last year on special education programs,
if they choose. Democrats say it could make final approval of the
bill difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy vowed to ``fight the conference committee report as hard
as I can,'' if the special education measure is not dropped.

WOODWARD LAWYERS SAY THEY WANT TO STUDY NEW EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ The lawyers who defended former au pair Louise Woodward
in the murder of eight-month-old Matthew Eappen want to put an end
to the controversy over Sunday night's ``60 Minutes'' program so
they can investigate its claims and ultimately demonstrate
Woodward's innocence, they said at a press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But a former colleague fired off a written statement of her own
which promised to keep the controversy alive.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers Harvey Silverglate, Andrew Good, and Barry
Scheck dismissed as ``red herrings'' the debate over the
independence of experts who appeared on the televised report, and
criticism of the lawyers for releasing samples of the infant's
brain tissue to the freelance reporter who originated the segment.
</P>
<P>
   They said the debates distracted from what the experts, Dr.
Floyd Gilles and Dr. Marvin Nelson, had said on the television
program: that Eappen had died from the delayed effects of a
strangulation up to two days before his collapse, rather than from
being shaken and having his head slammed against a hard object, as
prosecutors had argued.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also tried to distance themselves from former
colleague Elaine Whitfield Sharp, who first told the press of the
firm's pre-trial relationship with Nelson, and has criticized the
strangulation theory posed by Gilles and Nelson. Sharp also said
this week that she had met with Gilles, of whom the defense denied
any knowledge before the ``60 Minutes'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp was dismissed from the defense team after her arrest for
drunk driving in June 1998. At the time, her former colleagues
released a statement saying she had exhibited ``an aberrant pattern
of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end Thursday, Sharp had fired off a rejoinder to the
lawyers' statements about her, calling the strangulation theory
``grasping at straws,'' and asserting once more that her colleagues
had full knowledge of her meetings with both Nelson and Gilles.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Woodward was found guilty of second-degree
murder by a jury that agreed with the prosecution's claims that she
had shaken Matthew Eappen and slammed his head into a hard object
just before he became unconscious on Feb. 4. But the conviction was
reduced to manslaughter days later, and she was set free.
</P>
<P>
   By attributing the infant's death to a strangulation up to 48
hours before his collapse, the doctors raised the possibility that
someone other than Woodward could have caused his death.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers said they would begin a weeks-long
investigation of the strangulation claims immediately, for which
they would not be paid, by either Woodward or E. F. Au Pair, the
company which placed her in the Eappens' home.
</P>
<P>
   If that investigation gives credence to the strangulation
theory, they said, they will approach Middlesex District Attorney
Martha Coakley to pursue a further, independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley was ambivalent about that plan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they feel there was an injustice, and Woodward was wrongly
convicted, as in every case we keep an open mind,'' said Coakley.
``But it's disingenuous of them to say now that having thoroughly
examined this case, that they want a second bite at the apple. But
having said that we'll keep an open mind. The ball is in their
court.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers avoided the question of whether they would
ultimately seek a new trial for Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're jumping about 95 steps ahead,'' said Good.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would see where the investigation takes them,
then consult with Woodward on whether to go back to court. But
Scheck said that Woodward has been prepared to take the riskier
routes throughout in the interests of demonstrating her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers lambasted the 77 doctors who signed a letter on
Wednesday criticizing the strangulation theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain totally confused (as to) why people rush to judgment
without looking at the data,'' Scheck said. ``It's not a letter
writing campaign where you vote on what your favorite thesis is
without looking at the underlying data.''
</P>
<P>
   And they dismissed criticisms of them for having turned over
microscopic samples of Matthew Eappen's brain tissue to the
journalist, Katie Leishman, for examination by Gilles. They called
the criticism ``an apparent effort to turn attention away from the
all-important questions of what the tissue slides and other
scientific exhibits prove.''
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the slides were not turned over to ``any Joe
Blow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Leishman) was more conversant with the evidence than any
other news media person we've talked to,'' said Silverglate.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of Sharp's contention she had met earlier with
both experts, a spokesperson for the hospital in Los Angeles where
both practised confirmed Thursday that Sharp had met with them
after calling them with repeated requests. But the spokesman said
the doctors had terminated the meeting when it became clear Sharp
``had little to say.''
</P>
<P>
   In their written statement, the lawyers said they had paid
Nelson for reviewing some materials about a month before the trial,
but did not call him as a witness in the trial. And they had no
knowledge of Gilles whatsoever, Good said.
</P>
<P>
   If Sharp met with the doctor, Silverglate, Good and Scheck had
no knowledge of it, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what she was doing most of the time,'' Good said
of Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp fired back an angry reply to that statement late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense team was made aware of my meetings with Drs.
Gilles and Nelson,'' she wrote. ``I kept the defense team informed
of every meeting I had with every expert and potential expert in
the case, and I have documentation which proves this fact.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Silverglate, Good and Scheck bristled at claims
that their investigation of the strangulation claims was an attempt
to rehabilitate their reputations after failing to win a not-guilty
verdict for Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``History and our mothers will take care of our reputations,''
said Silverglate. ``That's not what we're here for.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Though he was one of the most famous men of this
century, Joe DiMaggio's funeral Thursday morning at Sts. Peter and
Paul Roman Catholic Church, where he had made his first communion
and married his first wife, was astonishingly small, devoid of the
celebrities of his vanishing era or, for that matter, of this one.
</P>
<P>
   Solemn gongs from the church bell announced the procession, and
only six pallbearers carried DiMaggio's orchid-draped mahogany
coffin. They were a nephew, the husbands of two of his
granddaughters, two longtime friends and DiMaggio's only son,
Joseph Paul DiMaggio Jr., from whom he had been estranged for
years. Just a few dozen mourners attended the service, at the New
York Yankee legend's request, and zealous police officers kept
throngs of reporters and about 200 onlookers behind barricades
across the street, in DiMaggio's beloved Washington Square Park.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, who died Monday at age 84 at his home in Hollywood,
Fla., after a long battle with lung cancer, was eulogized by his
brother Dominic, the only remaining sibling of the four brothers
and four sisters with whom he grew up here in North Beach. The Rev.
Armand Oliveri, who had known the DiMaggio family for all his 79
years, led the traditional funeral Mass. ``They said they wanted it
to be family,'' Oliveri said afterward, ``and that was about it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Joe DiMaggio married Dorothy Arnold at Sts. Peter and Paul
in 1940, the year after winning the first of his three Most
Valuable Player awards as a Yankee, 20,000 people jammed into
Washington Square to catch a glimpse of him. The divorced DiMaggio
was mobbed again in 1954, when he was retired, his 56-game hitting
streak stored in the record books, and he brought home Marilyn
Monroe, whom he married at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But here in North Beach, where he would return often to visit
old friends while staying in the house he had bought for his
parents 60 years ago, it was a well-established fact that DiMaggio
liked to keep his private life private.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of DiMaggio's old North Beach friends stood among
the crowd, among them Peter Macchiarini, an 89-year-old artist who
remembered watching Joe DiMaggio play on the minor league San
Francisco Seals. ``He couldn't have been a better dancer,''
Macchiarini said. ``His running and his hitting were all one
movement. It was graceful. It was ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he said he had never seen DiMaggio's famous exploits
as a Yankee outfielder, but that he had seen him once as they were
both driving to Candlestick park for a ball game. ``We were both
driving along and I waved at him, and he smiled and waved back from
that big brown Cadillac,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd had never had a glimpse of the man in person.
Victor Berardelli, 85, a retired maintenance man, said he simply
was proud that DiMaggio, the son of an Italian fisherman, had come
from this neighborhood. ``He grew up here and played on this
playground,'' he said, gesturing to a lot next to the church. ``He
never forgot where he came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, was the one mourner those
in the crowd outside recognized. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the hearse pulled away on its way to the suburb of Colma
where he would be buried, the crowd broke into applause. There were
even a few baseball-park cheers and whistles.

 &HT;    Education bill gives states wider options
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress on Thursday passed an education bill that
would give states greater flexibility over how they spend more than
one-third of the federal education money flowing to local school
districts.
</P>
<P>
   But the lopsided votes in the House and Senate masked partisan
divisions over the bill. Senate Democrats threatened to urge
President Clinton to veto the bill because of an amendment they
said would gut his plan to lower class sizes by funding 100,000 new
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have pulled an anti-education hat trick,''
said Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) moments before the Senate voted
98-1 (Democrat Paul Wellstone of Minnesota voted no) to approve the
Education Flexibility Partnership Act.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans defeated an amendment that would have fully
funded Clinton's class-size initiative and adopted their own
amendment that would allow states the option of spending the $1.2
billion appropriated last year for lowering class sizes on either
new teachers or special education programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, school districts would be given more freedom in
spending $264.7 million of the $763.9 million the state receives
from the federal government for primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   The House version passed 330-90. Democratic Reps. Cynthia
McKinney and John Lewis were the only Georgians to vote no.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling in Antigua, Clinton issued a statement saying that he
will campaign to remove the Republican amendment allowing states
the option of funding special education instead of hiring new
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be working together to make continued progress on
obvious national needs such as reducing class size _ not attempting
to tear down the bipartisan work we did last year to address this
problem,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), a Senate leader on education, said
the votes signaled the beginning of a trend away from federal
control over education and toward greater flexibility at the local
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole mission here is an acknowledgement that all of these
federal strings have not produced a very favorable result,''
Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Newly elected Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), a former state school
board chairman, said school districts might, for example, elect to
use money to lower teacher-pupil ratios in poorer school districts,
or purchase computer software especially designed for
non-English-speaking students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to bring about a lot of creative thinking on how to
use the money,'' Isakson said.

 &HT;    Tiny pests devouring New Orleans history
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ In this tourist town, there are haunted tours,
voodoo tours, home tours and cemetery tours.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was that termite tour.
</P>
<P>
   A group of entomologists and pest control experts set out
Thursday from behind Jackson Square in the French Quarter to
inspect the damage Formosan termites do to homes, businesses, even
trees.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have to go far. New Orleans is second only to
Honolulu for infestation by Formosan termites, which are much more
plentiful and destructive than the usual termites, called ``native
subterraneans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A colony of 1 million Formosan termites would consume a
two-by-four in 30 days,'' said Ed Martin, tour guide and termite
hunter. ``And most colonies number in the millions.'' He's been an
entomologist working in New Orleans pest control since 1948, around
the time the Formosans arrived in the United States hidden in
military equipment brought back from World War II campaigns in the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   At least 90 percent of the buildings in the French Quarter have
termites. A federal program called Operation Full Stop is under way
in a 15-block section of the historic neighborhood. By setting
traps and actually killing the termites instead of repelling them _
as was done in the past _ experts hope to rid the area of termites
in five years. If it works, the method will be used more widely.
</P>
<P>
   Once termites move into a region, it takes about 25 years for
them to cause noticeable damage. The French Quarter is so infested
because the buildings are attached to one another, Martin said. The
facade of one house on the tour was completely ripped off. Termites
had eaten through the brick and stucco to get to the wood beams
supporting the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll eat through anything _ your computer wires, your
telephone wires,'' said homeowner Pam Fortner, whose home is in the
15-block area being treated and studied. ``It's devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   In Armstrong Park, on the edge of the French Quarter,
entomologists are studying termites before they kill them. They
believe there are about 11 million termites lurking underground at
the park.
</P>
<P>
   The tour, arranged by a pest control industry group called
Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment, continued at City
Park, where about 20 percent of the trees are infested. The
largest, a 600-year-old live oak called ``Madonna,'' has branches
so rangy and long that they must be supported by wires and
telephone polls. Inside the trunk is a colony of at least 1 million
tiny wood-eaters. The city's Termite Control Board is working to
save the tree by trying to lure the termites away with underground
bait.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of the trees in New Orleans are infested with
termites, said Mike Carroll with the Termite Control Board. Most of
the older houses in the city have been infested at one time, but
humans have been gaining ground over the pests in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the technology has now caught up with the problem,''
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Termites cause $300 million in damage annually in New Orleans,
and more than $1 billion nationwide. They are most prevalent in
warm, wet climates. Treating and repairing damage to an infested
home can cost as much $20,000.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Seasons of growth by a sandy stream
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Helen C. Hynes
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   When my two cousins from Chicago, Fred and Bill, started
spending their summer vacations at our house in the little town of
Tiskilwa, Ill., life became an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the early 1920s, and as an only child, I usually spent
my days playing with my dolls and dog, reading books and helping
Mama.
</P>
<P>
   When ``the boys'' came, suddenly I was allowed to do things that
I couldn't before, and my embroidered dresses were quickly replaced
by an old pair of tan overalls.
</P>
<P>
   I tagged along with delight as we roamed the nearby woods,
climbed trees, gathered buckeyes, skipped stones in the big
``crick,'' picked berries, raked leaves for bonfires, played
hide-and-seek and pom-pom-pullaway and even snitched a few apples
from the orchard of the crabby old man at the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   When it rained we sat on the porch strumming our ukeleles made
of cigar boxes and rubber bands, or played cards.
</P>
<P>
   Picnics were the most fun, and our favorite spot was over the
hill in a wooded valley back of Gus Magnuson's farm.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a small, rocky stream with a sandy spot on one bank
where we could have a fire and even an old log to sit on.
</P>
<P>
   Kids from the neighborhood went with us: Les, Baba, Avalon,
Wilma and little Doodie, who always straggled along at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Cousin Fred, at 13, was the only one allowed to carry a knife
and matches, so he built the fire and cut willow sticks to spear
the weenies and marshmallows.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the weenies were scorched or the marshmallows caught
fire, yet it all tasted wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   We would lie on our backs on the grass, vying to find the most
exciting pictures in the clouds, and wade in the stream.
</P>
<P>
   I so well remember the throat-bursting joy I felt at being
included in those picnics, of knowing I belonged with Fred and
Bill, of feeling so free, instead of being a little girl alone.
</P>
<P>
   As with every summer, our last picnic that year was a sad one
because my cousins were leaving the next day.
</P>
<P>
   While the others picked up the sacks and apple cores to burn, I
gathered willow sticks and playfully stuck them in the ground
behind the log, pleased with the little fence I made.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Fred kicked sand over the ashes of the fire and we
trailed back over the hill.
</P>
<P>
   So for me it was back to embroidered dresses, dolls and
schoolbooks; back to autumn leaves, winter snow, spring rain and,
inevitably, another glorious summer.
</P>
<P>
   As we trooped over the hill for our first picnic of that new
summer, the same little gang with Doodie trailing behind, we found
the rocky stream, the sandy spot for our fire and the log still
there.
</P>
<P>
   And behind the log, a straight line of tall and graceful
willows, bending slightly forward and making a lovely green bower
above our sitting place.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped and held my breath. The wonder of that miracle has
never left me.

GOP-BACKED EDUCATION BILL APPROVED BY BOTH HOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Crying victory as both the House and Senate
approved education legislation ``essential to the country,''
Republicans Thursday took what they hoped was a giant leap away
from impeachment with passage of a popular bill that would give
schools greater freedom in the way they spend federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, known as ``Ed Flex,'' had been questioned by several
Democrats who believed it might let poor students slip through the
cracks. Patterned after a program already in place in 12 states,
including Massachusetts, the bill would give all 50 states the
possibility of waiving requirements that normally accompany
government grants.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of bitter wrangling in the Senate, and a far easier
day of discussion in the House, the bill was overwhelmingly
approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be the news _ not how we got there, or what
amendments were offered,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
``For the second time this year, in a bipartisan way, the Senate
passed a bill that's important to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in both the House and Senate had hoped to attach a
provision to authorize payment for 100,000 new teachers, a measure
that received a congressional nod of approval in last year's
spending bill. Senator Edward M. Kennedy fought for an amendment to
push the plan ahead, tying up Senate debate for more than a week.
Republicans blocked it, and the amendment failed 55-45 in a
party-line vote.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in a move that infuriated Senate Democrats, Republicans
designed a program that would not require schools to hire new
teachers at all. Through an amendment, Republicans said that the
money set aside last year _ $1.2 billion for 30,000 new teachers in
1999 _ could instead be used in special education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy called the move an ``anti-education hat trick.''
Accusing Republicans of pitting special-ed students against poor
ones, he said the amendment would ``effectively kill the commitment
Congress made last year for smaller class size.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think the Congress missed a very important
opportunity,'' Kennedy said on the Senate floor. Other Democrats
said the Republican plan would have a severe impact on President
Clinton's plan to hire 100,000 new teachers, at a cost of $11
billion, over the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused the Republicans of using the bill ``to undermine
one of our most important educational achievements -- an initiative
to hire 100,000 well-prepared teachers to reduce class size in the
early grades to a national average of 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be working together to make continued progress on
obvious national needs such as reducing class size -- not
attempting to tear down the bipartisan work we did last year to
address this problem,'' Clinton said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, all but one Senate Democrat _ Paul Wellstone of
Minnesota _ voted for the bill despite the Republican amendment,
and despite underlying fears the program might let schools spend
federal funds recklessly instead of on the neediest. The final vote
was 98-1.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republicans were not without their own moments of
frustration. Thanks to an agreement hammered out the day before,
Republicans were forced to vote ``no'' on five Democratic
amendments, leaving them open to accusations their education
rallying cry lacks legislative substance.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, who plans to introduce his own education
bill next week, said the vote meant Congress had ``passed one step
of overall reform and missed the opportunity to do a comprehensive
approach because it remains too mired in partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In the House, where the bill passed 330-90, Democrats offered
more resistance in their final votes than in the Senate. But during
the debate, they failed to stymie Republicans at all and even
missed a chance to offer their own amendment on the new-teacher
hiring plan.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois cited the victory as
a ``great first step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the bipartisan work we said we were going to do in
this Congress,'' said Hastert, who has worked furiously in recent
weeks to focus public attention on something other than Clinton's
impeachment, which bitterly divided the House last fall and caused
GOP approval ratings to plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Ed-Flex (Education Flexibility Partnership Act) plan,
schools are able to apply for waivers from federal rules that
normally accompany some $15 billion in federal funds, including the
largest program, Title I, which sends money to the poorest schools.
Ed Flex enjoys wide bipartisan support, as well as the backing of
all 50 governors, and, according to Republicans, has not failed to
reach poorer students in the states where it has been tested.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, one of the first states where Ed Flex was
tried, educators say the program has allowed money allocated for
poor students to be used far more effectively _ for example,
freeing school officials from filling out endless paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   And yet in the short term, Ed Flex may have more of an impact on
politics than policy. After Thursday's vote, several senators in
both parties said the partisan divide had been widened by the
debate, which lasted more than a week and was led largely by
Kennedy. They also acknowleged that both parties remained locked in
a tug-of-war over the overall issue of education, and Ed Flex was
just the beginning the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said: ``The
question of if people see this as the Democrats finally breaking
through and getting education on the agenda, or as Republicans
responding to education ... It's too early to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lott, saying Kennedy had ``not been constructive'' in
holding up the vote for so long, claimed victory right away,
pointing to the popularity of Ed Flex and its ultimate passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats, I don't think this has helped them,'' Lott
said. ``We were on the high ground. They were on the low ground.
They were trying to ball this thing up.''

 &HT;    Vivid portrait of old New York is best that `Dreamland' offers
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL MARCH 14: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Eileen M. Drennen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You read a novel like ``Dreamland'' because you want to get lost
in the past. And where better to get lost than New York City in
1910, with its millionaires and immigrants, factory girls and
gamblers, politicos and cops, outcasts and reformers. Their
collisions and alliances on the city's ragged streets forged much
that we recognize as America.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing such a sprawling canvas, and using an alternating
cast of narrators to carry the action forward, it's clear that
Kevin Baker has in mind nothing less than an epic.
</P>
<P>
   His command of the time and place are masterful. You can see the
Bowery by street lamp, with its pushcarts of oysters and potatoes.
You can hear the unholy din of the factory looms, relentless as an
army of trains. You can smell the crowded tenement hallways, where
the smells of dinner merge into a gumbo of Irish and Jewish and
Italian smoke. Where people are so poor, they rent out their beds
by day to roomerkehs (Yiddish for boarders) who work by night.
</P>
<P>
   As chief researcher for Harold Evans' ``The American Century,''
Baker stockpiled enough details of turn-of-the-century life
(including a heady mix of Yiddish, Irish and Chinese words, and a
handy glossary) to transport you to that place and time. Extended
scene pieces of boardwalk, factory and underworld life darken the
picture enough that we understand the allure of the bright and
blinking oceanside wonderland of the title.
</P>
<P>
   For it's not just the real Dreamland he's concerned with, that
famed Coney Island theme park to top all others, with its minarets
and moonscapes, its million lights, beer gardens, canals and roller
coaster. It's the darker land of dreams, the city itself, which
offers as much betrayal as promise.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Baker's scope _ and flabby way with words _ is his
undoing. No matter how fresh and real he makes this lost world, the
characters he unlooses upon it remain maddening shadows.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of alternating voices propel the narrative strands
forward. Trick the Dwarf, a sideshow regular who lives in the
tattered beachfront Tin Elephant hotel and whose idea of escape is
blacking his face with charcoal so he can ``pass'' for a newsboy,
is something of a guiding presence. His observations open and close
the book and supply some of its wilder moments (notably, the foul
pleasures of the rat pit, where one dog vs. many rats fight to the
death, and the true story of the mad circus elephant's execution,
which took more gruesome tries than you can imagine).
</P>
<P>
   Other voices include Lower East Side sewing machine operator
Esther ``Esse'' Abramowitz, who sneaks out to Dreamland with her
gangster sweetheart Kid Twist and strikes for better working
conditions; her brother Lazar, a.k.a. Gyp the Blood; and a fading
Irish pol called Big Tim Sullivan. Interspersed are ensemble
chapters called ``On the Boardwalk,'' which unfold on the salty
pleasure domes of Coney Island, and ``The Great Head Doctors From
Vienna,'' wherein psychiatrists Freud and Jung undertake their
grand visit to America.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, all of them meet, in the end, at Dreamland. But their
intersection feels more contrived than inevitable. All that happens
in the course of this saga doesn't seem to change anyone. Or if it
does, you never know: In one of the oddest wrap-up chapters ever,
Trick the Dwarf follows his account of the burning of Dreamland
with a long list of maybes:
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the rest of it, who knows? You want an epilogue, but
who knows where people go? They get swallowed up in the crowds, and
all that is left is speculation. Maybe Esther did get married, and
settled down to churning out children in spite of herself. While he
got a good position with the City or made his fortune bottling
celery tonic. ... Or maybe they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker can't have it both ways. If he wants readers to buy into
his lengthy sleight of hand, he owes them an actual payoff.
</P>

 &HT;    The logjam of logic: Prof's profundities a near death sentence
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, MARCH 14, DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some months ago I expressed to a local educator the thoughtless
wish that schools would return to diagraming sentences. I am, I
realize, out of touch with the way things are done nowadays, and am
innocent in particular of educationist theory. What is taught in
the schools of education is deeper water than my small brain is
designed to navigate. I hug the shore, alert for wind shifts that
might carry me dangerously far from port.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I would not have thought teaching students the sturdy
backbone of an English sentence _ the noun, the verb, the predicate
_ an unreasonable expectation. And it's fun besides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we don't do that anymore,'' I was told in that tone of
peremptory smugness that education folks seem obligated to
cultivate. Catching a mild surprise in my reaction, she confidently
informed me that ``the research'' _ the habitual fallback on which
they hang their every response _ had shown sentence diagraming to
be old hat.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, I thought, not wishing to butt my head against this
particular brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   We do things differently in a poststructuralist age, and the
schools of education are not the only places in the thrall of
technology. To write like a poststructuralist you have to know a
lot of hard words and have a head full of theory.
</P>
<P>
   A lumbering lack of articulation
</P>
<P>
   No one spins a sentence in poststructuralist criticism like
Judith Butler. A Judith Butler sentence is a timber truck loaded
with redwood. It is not for nothing that Butler, who teaches
philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley, is the
reigning Bad Writer of the Year. The journal Philosophy and
Literature annually awards this Oscar for obscurity, and in
December it was Judy's turn to cry. I don't know what journal was
lucky enough to publish her winning sentence, but take a deep
breath and enjoy:
</P>
<P>
   ``The move from a structuralist account in which capital is
understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous
ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to
repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of
temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from
a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as
theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the
contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception
of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of
the rearticulation of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that wonderful? It snakes like a river, rearticulating
here, converging there, the big lumber rolling downstream, clause
piling upon clause. Really, it's got everything you could want in a
good academic sentence _ all the grad-student staples but with the
polish of a master. You've got your hegemony _ twice _ and I
counted six variations of structure, studding the sentence from one
end to the other. Convergence shows up only once, but you've got
rearticulation and contingent twice each. And notice that she even
works in homologous. Neat. And on top of so much else, she finds
space to give a winking nod to Althusser, dead all these years but
alive and kicking in the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Abstraction beyond the ken of laymen
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, I should acknowledge, is entirely smitten by
Butler's prose. In The New Republic recently, Martha Nussbaum,
herself a philosopher of note, gave up all hope of diagraming
Butler's gem and suggested, rather uncharitably, that it was a
charade. ``It is difficult to come to grips with Butler's ideas,''
she wrote, ``because it is difficult to figure out what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   This is quite unfair. Thinkers such as Butler and the literary
critics enamored of her force us to think harder. They deal with
complexity at a level of abstraction higher than any physicist. It
should not be surprising that they write in a technical language
beyond the capacity of uneducated laymen. Opacity is proof of
profundity. It's a kind of higher mathematics for grad students who
bailed out after algebra.
</P>
<P>
   If Nussbaum, who teaches at the University of Chicago Law
School, can't make sense of what they're trying to say, there are
others who vouch they can. In the English departments, Judith
Butler is read with reverence. Her prose is difficult, the young
adepts tell me, because it deals with exceedingly technical ideas _
structural totalities as theoretical objects, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Literature? This is theory, and it's thorny stuff. When the bad
writing award was bestowed on Butler, the journal Philosophy and
Literature's editor cited a certain Warren Hedges, who teaches
English at Southern Oregon University. Hedges is awed by Butler,
and has called her ``probably one of the 10 smartest people on the
planet.'' You get the idea that the journal's editor, if not also
Nussbaum, thinks Professor Hedges is unquestionably one of the 10
stupidest.
</P>
<P>
   But who wouldn't be impressed by a two-ton sentence? You
wouldn't want to diagram it, and you certainly couldn't sing it.
Either would ruin it. You only behold its profundity, whatever its
meaning.

 &HT;    `Visions' of 20th century via man and machinery
 &HT;    (EDS: EMBARGOED UNTIL MARCH 14: DFO NOT MOVE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The other night I was hunched over the dining room table, trying
to decipher a diagram I had pulled off the Internet. Around me were
scattered the guts of the family computer, including a faulty
internal modem I was trying to replace. Under my breath I was
cussing out the (at)! computer industry, wondering why they
couldn't make their products more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly an image popped into my mind of my father back in the
'60s, hunched over the 17-inch family Zenith with a diagram in his
hand, trying to locate a faulty vacuum tube.
</P>
<P>
   Different times, different technologies. But the same problems.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Visions of Technology,'' Richard Rhodes has compiled an
anthology of more than 200 selections tracing the development of
technology through the 20th century. Some of the selections are a
sentence or two; others stretch for pages. Overall, the focus of
the book is not truly technology, but rather the human reaction to
it. Time and again, technology inspires both great hope and great
fear: Sometimes the hopes and fears prove justified; sometimes they
prove to be silly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lewis Mumford and Benton Mackaye in 1931
anticipated the building of the interstate highway system _ they
called it the Townless Highway _ with controlled vehicle access to
allow high-speed travel. ``With no danger of anyone suddenly
cutting across, with no officious advertiser begging him to halt
and change his tires or his underwear ... the motorist has less
anxiety and more safety at 60 miles an hour than he used to have in
the old roadtime confusion at 25,'' they predicted.
</P>
<P>
   In that same year, another writer was a little more savvy as to
the human price to be paid. ``On the highway we used to meet men
and women. Whether on foot, on horseback, in buggies or even on
bicycles, it was always persons whom we encountered. Now we do not
meet individuals but automobiles ... grim, impersonal machines
which we try to crowd past, unmindful of our fellow-being behind
the glass and metal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dial telephones now seem impossibly old-fashioned, but when they
were introduced in the late 1920s, replacing whole banks of
telephone operators, they confounded many users. In 1930, the U.S.
Senate even adopted a resolution banning dial telephones from the
Capitol because they were too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we chuckle, that same body today bars its members from
bringing laptop computers onto the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The power of the media is also anticipated in several selections
collected by Rhodes. After witnessing the first television
broadcast of a major political event, the 1940 Republican National
Convention, a New York Times reporter noted that the world had just
changed, that ``sincerity of the tongue and facial expression gain
in importance. ... How they comb their hair, how they smile and how
they loop their necktie become new factors in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Vannevar Bush, a remarkable visionary who headed the U.S.
government's science effort during World War II and later, mused in
1945 about something he called a ``memex,'' an information storage
device accessed by keyboard that would allow the user to travel to
sites offering information related to his topic of research, a
system that sounds remarkably like the Internet with its hypertext
links.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, however, Bush told Congress that the concept of
intercontinental ballistic missiles was some sci-fi writer's bad
dream. ``I think we can leave that out of our thinking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Any anthology is defined as much by what it excludes as by what
it contains. It also inevitably reflects the tastes and interests
of its editor. Rhodes, who won a Pulitzer Prize and National Book
Award for his 1988 book ``Making of the Atom Bomb,'' ranges widely
in his sources, drawing from the lyrics of a Loretta Lynn song as
well as the writings of biologist E.O. Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, Rhodes makes clear his intention to limit
selections to the 20th century and to draw mainly from American
sources. But some of his other choices are odd. For example, the
most contentious and perhaps most important technology-related
debate at the end of the 20th century involves the use of
biotechnology: genetics, genetic testing, cloning and the
transplanting of genes among plants and animals, among other
issues. There's not a word about it in ``Visions of Technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Because most of its selections are so short and often charming,
the book lends itself well to night-stand reading. Unfortunately,
the lack of length precludes any in-depth discussion of
technology's impact and our reaction to it. Its best pleasures are
moments of startling clarity that put our own modern anxiety about
technology into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   It's somehow reassuring to read of a woman reminiscing in the
1920s about how simple things had been back when she was growing up
in the 1890s. Until the automobile came along, she says wistfully,
families and neighbors used to spend a lot of quality time
together.
</P>
<P>
   Her anxiety is familiar; we still feel it 75 years later,
although today we tend to blame TV and the home computer, not the
automobile. As another writer puts the lesson, ``We do not hate
machines. We hate new machines.''

HOUSE, ADMINISTRATION WRANGLE OVER KOSOVO TROOP ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House unleashed a bruising rebuke of the
Clinton administration Thursday, rejecting White House pleas to
forgo a bitter debate over whether to send US troops to Kosovo,
amid a critical stage in the quest for peace in the embattled
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts joined only four
other Democrats in endorsing the Republican-led initiative, which
Democratic leaders assailed as an ``irresponsible'' threat to the
Kosovo peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   After siding with all but one Republican in approving the
contentious debate, Frank criticized the White House for failing to
adequately consult Congress about plans to dispatch as many as
4,000 American soldiers as part of a 28,000-member NATO to
implement a peace deal in Kosovo, if it is reached.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement has been held up largely by the refusal of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept the presence of the
foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much I like this president, I can't acquiesce
when the administration unilaterally engages in military action
whenever it wants,'' Frank said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a news conference in Guatemala, criticized the
timing of the debate and suggested the showdown could harm the
peace negotiations. ``I do not believe Congress should take any
action that would in effect pre-empt the peace process or encourage
either side to say `no' to it,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, the only liberal among the Democrats who voted with the
Republican majority, also raised concerns about the high cost of
peacekeeping efforts, which generally require additional funding to
supplement the annual Pentagon budget. ``We end up in the situation
where the military budget eats up everything else,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans called for the showdown to protest what they
described as Clinton's penchant for committing the United States to
expensive peacekeeping missions and failing to meet his deadlines
for withdrawing the troops.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said the administration has
exceeded the Pentagon budget by $21 billion on peacekeeping
missions, including an ongoing commitment in Bosnia that Clinton
had said would end in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the ability and limits of our armed services, how much
can we do?'' Hastert said in a news conference before the debate.
``If we buy into this, what do we do if something happens in Korea?
What do we do if something happens in Taiwan?''
</P>
<P>
   The House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt, blasted the
GOP attack on Clinton's military policy as a reckless undermining
of the Kosovo peace talks, which are scheduled to resume in Paris
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is bloodshed, if there are more killings, if this
thing spreads to other countries, it will be because of the
irresponsible leadership in the House of Representatives in
bringing this up before it should have been brought up,'' Gephardt
said in a news conference after Hastert's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Although the House resolution on Kosovo is non-binding, the
Republican defiance of Clinton at a crucial phase of the peace
talks revealed the stark differences between the White House and
congressional Republicans over foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The House majority leader, Richard K. Armey, decried the
proposed American role in Kosovo as ``poorly considered and
unlikely to achieve our desired ends.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the National Security subcommittee on military
readiness, Representative Tillie K. Fowler, a Florida Republican,
said the Kosovo peacekeeping mission is ``a recipe for resentment,
not reconciliation, and it will be our troops that are on the
ground and in the crosshairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fowler, like many other Republicans, said there was no
compelling reason to send American soldiers to Kosovo. ``Could I
tell someone that their loved one died in Kosovo in defense of
American vital interests?'' she said. ``The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats lashed out at the reluctance among many Republicans to
help the peacekeeping effort in Kosovo. More than 2,000 people have
been killed in the year-long battle by the Kosova Albanians against
the dominant Serbs to regain their autonomy, lost in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Represenatative Tom Lantos of California, a Hungarian-born
Democrat who is Jewish and survived the Holocaust, said on the
House floor that ``isolationism is rampant in this body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me glad some of my colleagues were not here when the
decision was made to participate in the Second World War,'' Lantos
said.

   BOSTON _ The lawyers who defended former au pair Louise Woodward
in the murder of eight-month-old Matthew Eappen want to put an end
to the controversy over Sunday night's ``60 Minutes'' program so
they can investigate its claims and ultimately demonstrate
Woodward's innocence, they said at a press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But a former colleague fired off a written statement of her own
which promised to keep the controversy alive.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers Harvey Silverglate, Andrew Good, and Barry
Scheck dismissed as ``red herrings'' the debate over the
independence of experts who appeared on the televised report, and
criticism of the lawyers for releasing samples of the infant's
brain tissue to the freelance reporter who originated the segment.
</P>
<P>
   They said the debates distracted from what the experts, Dr.
Floyd Gilles and Dr. Marvin Nelson, had said on the television
program: that Eappen had died from the delayed effects of a
strangulation up to two days before his collapse, rather than from
being shaken and having his head slammed against a hard object, as
prosecutors had argued.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also tried to distance themselves from former
colleague Elaine Whitfield Sharp, who first told the press of the
firm's pre-trial relationship with Nelson, and has criticized the
strangulation theory posed by Gilles and Nelson. Sharp also said
this week that she had met with Gilles, of whom the defense denied
any knowledge before the ``60 Minutes'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp was dismissed from the defense team after her arrest for
drunk driving in June 1998. At the time, her former colleagues
released a statement saying she had exhibited ``an aberrant pattern
of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end Thursday, Sharp had fired off a rejoinder to the
lawyers' statements about her, calling the strangulation theory
``grasping at straws,'' and asserting once more that her colleagues
had full knowledge of her meetings with both Nelson and Gilles.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Woodward was found guilty of second-degree
murder by a jury that agreed with the prosecution's claims that she
had shaken Matthew Eappen and slammed his head into a hard object
just before he became unconscious on Feb. 4. But the conviction was
reduced to manslaughter days later, and she was set free.
</P>
<P>
   By attributing the infant's death to a strangulation up to 48
hours before his collapse, the doctors raised the possibility that
someone other than Woodward could have caused his death.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers said they would begin a weeks-long
investigation of the strangulation claims immediately, for which
they would not be paid, by either Woodward or E. F. Au Pair, the
company which placed her in the Eappens' home.
</P>
<P>
   If that investigation gives credence to the strangulation
theory, they said, they will approach Middlesex District Attorney
Martha Coakley to pursue a further, independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley was ambivalent about that plan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they feel there was an injustice, and Woodward was wrongly
convicted, as in every case we keep an open mind,'' said Coakley.
``But it's disingenuous of them to say now that having thoroughly
examined this case, that they want a second bite at the apple. But
having said that we'll keep an open mind. The ball is in their
court.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers avoided the question of whether they would
ultimately seek a new trial for Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're jumping about 95 steps ahead,'' said Good.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would see where the investigation takes them,
then consult with Woodward on whether to go back to court. But
Scheck said that Woodward has been prepared to take the riskier
routes throughout in the interests of demonstrating her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers lambasted the 77 doctors who signed a letter on
Wednesday criticizing the strangulation theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain totally confused (as to) why people rush to judgment
without looking at the data,'' Scheck said. ``It's not a letter
writing campaign where you vote on what your favorite thesis is
without looking at the underlying data.''
</P>
<P>
   And they dismissed criticisms of them for having turned over
microscopic samples of Matthew Eappen's brain tissue to the
journalist, Katie Leishman, for examination by Gilles. They called
the criticism ``an apparent effort to turn attention away from the
all-important questions of what the tissue slides and other
scientific exhibits prove.''
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the slides were not turned over to ``any Joe
Blow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Leishman) was more conversant with the evidence than any
other news media person we've talked to,'' said Silverglate.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of Sharp's contention she had met earlier with
both experts, a spokesperson for the hospital in Los Angeles where
both practised confirmed Thursday that Sharp had met with them
after calling them with repeated requests. But the spokesman said
the doctors had terminated the meeting when it became clear Sharp
``had little to say.''
</P>
<P>
   In their written statement, the lawyers said they had paid
Nelson for reviewing some materials about a month before the trial,
but did not call him as a witness in the trial. And they had no
knowledge of Gilles whatsoever, Good said.
</P>
<P>
   If Sharp met with the doctor, Silverglate, Good and Scheck had
no knowledge of it, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what she was doing most of the time,'' Good said
of Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp fired back an angry reply to that statement late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense team was made aware of my meetings with Drs.
Gilles and Nelson,'' she wrote. ``I kept the defense team informed
of every meeting I had with every expert and potential expert in
the case, and I have documentation which proves this fact.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Silverglate, Good and Scheck bristled at claims
that their investigation of the strangulation claims was an attempt
to rehabilitate their reputations after failing to win a not-guilty
verdict for Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   ``History and our mothers will take care of our reputations,''
said Silverglate. ``That's not what we're here for.''

RED SOX HOTLY DENY HENRY CHARGES OF MISHANDLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Think it's easy being Dan Duquette? On a day
set aside to celebrate the signing of Ramon Martinez, the Red Sox
general manager found himself angrily denying charges that he and
physician/owner Arthur Pappas had mishandled pitcher Butch Henry
and several other Boston players.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this spring, Henry, now with the Seattle
Mariners, criticized the Red Sox for the manner in which the team
dealt with him. Last month, Henry blamed his exit from Boston on a
$1 million paycut by an ungrateful team that penalized him for
getting hurt in 1998. Henry pitched only nine innings and two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Now word has come from the Mariners training camp in Peoria,
Ariz., that Henry is laying blame at Pappas, whom Henry says asked
him to work through a knee injury rather than have surgery. Henry
refused and says he might have lost a whole year had he taken
Pappas's advice and waited until the end of last season to have the
operation. Henry elected to have surgery in July, when doctors
found a partial tear of his left anterior cruciate ligament. Over
the winter, Henry signed a $1.5 million contract with Seattle and
may wind up in their starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Charges that Pappas, a limited partner of the Red Sox since
1977, faces a conflict of interest are not new. Second baseman
Marty Barrett sued Pappas and the Red Sox in 1992 and eventually
was awarded $1.7 million in a US District court. The topic
resurfaced last season in the wake of apparent misdiagnoses of
injuries to Brian Rose, Lou Merloni, and Reggie Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   But Duquette will have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well-known that Dr. Pappas is considered one of the top
physicians in baseball,'' Duquette said. ``Why would the other 29
teams be coming to him regularly. If a doctor handles as many as
1,000 patients and you only hear complaints from three of them, I'd
say that's a pretty good record.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette's response to Henry's charges were stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it wasn't just a $1 million pay cut,'' Duquette
said. ``The truth is that at one point we offered him $2 million
for two years. He turned us down. Maybe we did mishandle Butch.
Every time I looked up he was on the disabled list.''
</P>
<P>
   At today's prices, Duquette said, players must contribute. Henry
was well paid in 1997 when he overcame a shoulder problem and had a
7-3 record in 36 appearences. In 1998, Henry collected $1.376
million for pitching nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   Henry's problems last season began when he pulled a hamstring
running the bases during an exhibition game against the Pirates.
After spending the rest of the spring in rehab, Henry came up to
Boston in May and made two starts before suffering an injury to his
left knee. As the days and weeks passed, Henry began to think more
about the 1999 season than trying to come back in '98. So he
elected to have the surgery, against the team's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surgery is always the last option,'' said Duquette. ``That is
why we recommend to players to try everything before surgery. At
the same time, we're not going to ask a player to go out there and
risk his career.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Duquette added, it's the players' responsibility to report
in good shape and stay that way all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what Bill Parcells said? Football players play during
the football season,'' Duquette said. ``In baseball, if you're on a
year-round conditioning program, you ought to be in shape so that
you can help your team. This is the same guy who pulled his
hamstring rounding third heading for home against the Pirates in a
spring training game last year. He did it on the bases. The last
time I looked a pitcher in the American League doesn't have to hit
or run the bases.''

NATIONS COULD BYPASS U.S. CERTIFICATION WITH ANTI-DRUG PLANS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENNIFER DAY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bipartisan trio of senators proposed Thursday
waiving the certification process for major drug-producing
countries if they submitted a plan for fighting the drug-export
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, senators said, would ease the dilemma the U.S.
government faces in choosing between alienating foreign governments
or maintaining good relations even though illicit drugs come from
that country.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton recently certified Mexico as a partner in the
war against drugs, despite evidence of corruption in the nation's
judicial system and increased opium poppy production. The
certification essentially clears the government of possible
sanctions for not fighting drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., introduced a bill that would waive
countries from the certification process if they submitted to the
U.S. government a plan on how to curb drug production and transit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what we're doing is ending this confrontation with
Mexico,'' Gramm said. ``I believe that the president of Mexico, I
believe many of his high officials are trying hard to be
successful. In many cases, they are not being successful.''
</P>
<P>
   If a country that received a waiver failed to show progress in
drug interdiction after entering into the agreement with the United
States, it would have to go through the normal certification
process established in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The law now requires the president to assess by March 1 each
year whether drug-producing countries are cooperating in the war on
drugs. A two-thirds vote in both the Senate and House is required
to overturn the president's decision.
</P>
<P>
   If a country is not certified, it may be subject to trade
sanctions as well as deprivation of U.S. aid other than funds to
fight drugs. The United States also may oppose loans by
international financial institutions to ``decertified'' countries.
</P>
<P>
   The certification process has come under fire as a meaningless
political show. Critics cite Mexico as an example of a country with
a serious drug production and export problem, but which is
consistently certified because of its close relationship with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Others note that decertifying Mexico and imposing sanctions for
its inability to control the drug flow simply alienates potential
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we refuse to certify based on the facts, we then make it
harder for people to join us in this effort,'' Gramm said. ``Rather
than producing a greater effort on the part of our ally, our
neighbor and our friend, we create hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   To monitor countries with certification waivers, the
Boxer-Dodd-Gramm bill would require the administration to submit
progress reports twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   At any time, Boxer said, Congress could investigate whether a
country was living up to its agreement, which must include specific
plans to control illicit drug production, distribution and
interdiction as well as cooperation among law enforcement agencies
and border security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any day of the week, if we don't agree with the findings, we
can get the country right back into certification,'' Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Antonio Zabalgoitia, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy,
said it's too soon to comment on the proposal, adding that others
may be presented as well.

AT LOS ALAMOS LABS, BALANCING SCIENCE AND SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
   (wg) 
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ As science becomes an increasingly
collaborative international enterprise, a clash has intensified
between the creative impulse to share information and the national
security need to keep secrets, including the advanced designs of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Science has rapidly evolved from a small men's club into a mix
of men and women from every continent, and some of them say that
the balancing act has grown extraordinarily difficult.
</P>
<P>
   This collision, scientists say, lies at the heart of the
investigation into possible espionage at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory. Government officials say they believe China stole
nuclear weapons secrets from the lab in the mid-1980s and used the
information to make miniature warheads.
</P>
<P>
   When more than half of the graduate students in engineering
programs at top American universities are foreign born, when
research teams are commonly composed of scientists from half a
dozen countries, and when important findings are presented at
meetings held all over the world, the idea that ``you can keep one
aspect of your work secret and another aspect open is simply
illusory,'' said Greg Mello, who studied engineering at Harvey Mudd
College in Claremont, Calif., under professors coming from as far
as Turkey and China.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 277 Chinese, 364 Russians and 115 Indian nationals
visited or worked at Los Alamos, according to the lab's director,
Dr. John Browne. Of these, 88 were allowed access to secure areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science is not a closed box,'' said Mello, who is now director
of the Los Alamos Study Group, a watchdog organization that follows
a range of nuclear issues. ``You can't draw a line down the middle
of a person's head.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is what scientists at the national laboratories are
expected to do, lab officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere has made it harder to track how information is
leaked and to distinguish legitimate scientific exchanges from
espionage, according to law-enforcement and intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing to protect against is what is in the mind of
an individual,'' Browne said. If someone wants to give an adversary
information that he carries in his head, there's not much that can
be done to stop him, he said. In the old days, spies carried
blueprints out of Los Alamos. In the current case under
investigation, FBI agents spent three days questioning a
Taiwan-born American citizen, Wen Ho Lee, who was accused of
security breaches and fired Monday from his job as a computer
scientist at Los Alamos. American officials say Lee is the prime
suspect in the transfer of information, but he has not been charged
with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the focus of the FBI's questioning of Lee was a
scientific meeting he attended in China in 1988, officials said.
Exactly what he said there, and to whom, is part of what the bureau
is trying to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Many intelligence officials say the conflict between sharing
information and keeping secrets has too often been resolved at the
expense of national security. Robert Gates, director of the CIA
from 1991 to 1993, said in an interview: ``We were appalled at the
number of Soviets they allowed to tour the labs. In the world of
science, there are no borders. It makes people naive about the
potential for exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law-enforcement officials say that security at the labs has
been lax for years and they are dismissive of arguments from
scientists who have resisted increased counter-intelligence
programs in favor of expanded international scientific exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists value those exchanges. At Los Alamos, for
example, which calls itself a quasi-academic institution,
scientists are using supercomputers to model how new weapons
components would behave if incorporated into real bombs. The
findings are top secret.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, these weapons designers are sharing their
solutions of complex computer problems with Los Alamos colleagues
who are solving similarly complex problems in weather prediction or
brain function. Those findings, which are not classified, are in
turn shared with scientific colleagues all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, scientists from America, Russia,
China and other nations have been attending an increasing number of
international meetings to share information, said Dr. Harold Agnew
who directed Los Alamos in the 1970s and is now retired in Solana
Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Someone might give an unclassified account of how detonators are
used in physics, he said, and just hearing the talk could give
another scientist clues for solving weapons problems. ``This may be
a form of spying that happens all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Browne, a career Los Alamos scientist who took over as
director in October 1997, said that it is not so difficult to
separate the worlds of secret and open information. Some ideas are
``born classified,'' he said. These insights play such an important
role in weapons design that everyone recognizes the need for
secrecy. ``They tend to involve the integration of mathematical and
physical principles and engineering details into a code that
simulates aspects of nuclear weapon performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas can be shared safely with scientists working on
other complex problems, Browne said. ``Ideas go in both
directions,'' he said. ``We might find someone working on a
nonlinear system and realize it has an application in weapons as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonlinear systems are hugely complex natural phenomena _ things
like weather on Jupiter, human cognition, thermonuclear explosions
_ that can only be studied using new mathematical tools and
supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   When there is a gray area _ an idea could help outside
scientists but it might also give hints about nuclear weapons
design _ security experts are called in to make the judgment call,
Browne said. Individual scientists are not encouraged to make such
decisions on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Lee might be guilty or he might be a political scapegoat, said
Dr. George Cowan, a former Los Alamos nuclear scientist and founder
of the nearby Santa Fe Institute. ``We don't have all the facts,''
he said. ``But it's also possible that the Chinese did the design
themselves. When they shot their first bomb, they used no foreign
intelligence. They went their own way.''
</P>
<P>
   The tension between openness and secrecy has bedeviled Los
Alamos scientists from the beginning. Founded in 1943 as a secret
city tucked in the pine and juniper forests of the Jemez Mountains,
it is the birthplace of the atomic bomb. Security was tight. Many
scientists did not tell their wives what they were doing. When bomb
designers went out for drinks and dinner, military personnel
followed them and listened to their conversations.
</P>
<P>
   And yet this is where the biggest breach in American nuclear
security occurred. Two trusted scientists, Klaus Fuchs and Ted
Hall, independently copied bomb blueprints and gave them to Russia,
explaining later that they believed science should be freely
shared. Two of their couriers, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were
executed for espionage while two other couriers went to jail. Fuchs
spent eight years in a British prison. Hall was never prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   They got the secrets out without being caught because everyone
trusted everyone else, said Ellen Bradbury Reid, a Santa Fe
resident who has who has interviewed most of the ``old timers'' who
were part of the Manhattan project. ``If the guards knew you, you
didn't have to hide anything,'' she said. ``Anyway, the security
people were worried about Germans, not Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much changed until the early 1970s when the first open
facility was created for conducting unclassified work. Hundreds of
scientists began visiting, although they were not permitted in
classified areas. The first delegation from mainland China came
during this period.
</P>
<P>
   Then and now only U.S. citizens can obtain clearances to work in
secure areas and have access to classified documents. All others
are kept, as they say in Los Alamos, ``outside the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   From the 1970s until now, the number of outsiders visiting the
laboratory has shifted up and down along with geopolitical changes,
said Dr. Sig Hecker, a former Los Alamos director who now works
closely with Russian scientists on ways to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons, and particularly the availability of plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   The 1980s may have been a good time for Chinese spies at the
national labs, said Tom Powers, an author of several books on
espionage, because ``everyone was focused on the Russians.''
According to the FBI at least three incidents of Chinese espionage
occurred during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Los Alamos was adrift,
Hecker said. But in 1994 it got new marching orders: maintain
stewardship of nuclear weapons through modelling components in
advanced computers, stop foreign proliferation of nuclear materials
and clean up the polluted domestic nuclear sites.
</P>
<P>
   To carry out this mission, Los Alamos must maintain close ties
with top-flight American universities, Hecker said. But given the
internationalization of science, this means inviting foreign
graduate and postdoctoral students to work in unclassified areas.
It means balancing openness with secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say laboratory security is lax. The General Accounting
Office, a watchdog agency of Congress, recently reported that out
of 5,472 visitors to the laboratory between 1994 and 1996, many
from countries deemed ``sensitive,'' only 892, or 16 percent, were
given background checks before being allowed access to laboratory
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Security has been stepped up in recent months, according to Jim
Danneskiold, a laboratory spokesman. Many of the younger scientists
are less imbued with the old Cold War mentality, he said, and need
to be reminded of security risks. Scientists who work in classified
areas are forbidden to talk about their work ``outside the fence''
at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming director Browne has improved training for
employees who might run into foreign agents while attending
conferences. ``We tell them they are vulnerable and ask them to
think about why they are being approached,'' Browne said. ``They
have to report back to us if anything occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne said there is a danger in going too far with security
measures. If laboratory scientists felt stifled and unable to carry
out free and open exchanges, the best and the brightest would not
want to go there to work. ``We must not overreact to this serious
situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the international visits continue. Hecker went to
China in 1994, as their guest. Lee, the accused spy, also went to
China.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how scientists can know what to say and what to hold back,
Hecker said that security experts at the lab provide frequent
briefings on all security policies. As materials are declassified,
he said, these policies change, but it is up to the individual
scientist to know how to walk the line properly.
</P>
<P>
   There really are secrets worth protecting, Powers said. ``It
worries me that the Chinese appear interested in an arms race,'' he
said. ``We were lucky once. I doubt we can be lucky twice.''

   With their team sputtering and their fan support on the wane,
the New Jersey Nets made a blockbuster three-team trade Thursday
that will bring the Brooklyn native Stephon Marbury, perhaps the
greatest player to come out of New York City in the past 20 years,
back to the metropolitan area.

   The move should quickly and significantly improve the Nets'
on-the-court performance and perhaps enable them to legitimately
rival the New York Knicks for the hearts of basketball fans
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   As the driving force behind the eight-player deal that included
the Minnesota Timberwolves, Marbury's former team, and the
Milwaukee Bucks, New Jersey sent Sam Cassell and Chris Gatling to
Milwaukee and Brian Evans and their 1999 first-round draft pick to
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Marbury, the Nets received Chris Carr and Bill
Curley, who they immediately waived, from Minnesota, and Elliot
Perry from Milwaukee. Minnesota received Terrell Brandon, a
two-time all-star point guard, from Milwaukee, in addition to
Evans.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Marbury is the latest bold move made by the
Nets' new ownership group, which is headed by Ray Chambers and
Lewis Katz and includes Bill Cosby. Since purchasing the club for
$150 million last fall, the group has paid an estimated $350
million to merge with the powerful New York Yankees and form a
groundbreaking partnership called YankeeNets; laid out plans to
build a new state-of-the-art arena in downtown Newark, N.J., to
help to revitalize the city's moribund infrastructure; and made
Jayson Williams, the club's charismatic center, the highest-paid
player in franchise history, signing him to a seven-year, $100.1
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' good fortune came at Minnesota's expense as the
Timberwolves only grudgingly traded Marbury, one of the most
exciting and talented players in the National Basketball
Association. Off to an impressive 12-6 start behind Marbury and
all-star forward Kevin Garnett, the Timberwolves parted with the
third-year guard because of his refusal to make a long-term
commitment to the club.
</P>
<P>
   The team offered Marbury a six-year, $70.875 million contract
extension, the maximum amount allowable under the league's new
collective bargaining agreement, but the player's aversion to
Minnesota's climate and lifestyle led him to reject the offer and
plan to test the free-agent market after the season. Given the
option of trading Marbury for the best possible player or losing
him for nothing in return at season's end, Minnesota took the best
deal available.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time since January that the small-market
Timberwolves lost a marquee player because of lifestyle
considerations. Before this season began, Tom Gugliotta, an
all-star small forward, left Minnesota and accepted less money to
play for the Phoenix Suns. While the club did fine in acquiring
Brandon, the breakup of Marbury and Garnett put to rest what could
have become the league's most outstanding guard-forward tandem of
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, who starred at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn,
leading it to three city championship appearances, is one of the
brightest young playmakers in the league, along with Philadelphia's
Allen Iverson. His unique combination of brashness, skill and
determination enabled him to lead the Timberwolves to their first
playoff appearance in franchise history last season. Built in the
mold of the new-generation, scoring point guards, Marbury shoots
the ball often, averaging 18 points, but also gets his teammates
involved and is third in the league in assists at 9.3 per game.

GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER QUITS; EUROPEAN MARKETS JUBILANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ After losing a power struggle over economic
policy that had sent tremors across Europe for months, Germany's
left-wing finance minister, who was also chairman of its ruling
party, abruptly resigned from both jobs on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation by Oskar Lafontaine marked a stunning new turn
for Germany's new chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, who defeated
Helmut Kohl in elections last September but whose government has
seemed confused and adrift ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation had implications well beyond Germany. As one of
Europe's most combative and ideological leaders, Lafontaine had
almost single-handedly talked down the value of Europe's new single
currency, the euro, with his loud and unrelenting demands on the
European Central Bank to lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   He had also shifted Germany, which accounts for more than
one-quarter of Europe's economic output, on a sharply leftwing
direction that frequently clashed with Schroeder's more pragmatic
and pro-business instincts.
</P>
<P>
   But Lafontaine has been unable to stimulate German economic
growth, which has slowed to a crawl while unemployment has remained
stuck at more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets in Europe reacted with thunderous approval
within minutes of the resignation. The euro scored its biggest
one-day jump in value since it was introduced in January. It jumped
from just below $1.08 to $1.10, as investors bet that German growth
could get a lift and that the European Central Bank would have more
freedom to steer its own course. It is widely expected that German
stocks will surge on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine gave no reason for his departure, and Schroeder
appeared as surprised as everyone else at the resignation. It was
still unclear whether the chancellor would end up a loser or a
winner after the dust settles.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine's resignation clearly reflected the disarray in
economic policy and Schroeder's own loss of credibility. German
business leaders have expressed outrage over Lafontaine's plans to
increase their taxes, with some big companies even threatening to
move operations out of the country. Lafontaine had also raised
hackles with American leaders, like Robert E. Rubin, the U.S.
treasury secretary, by campaigning for controls over exchange
rates.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Schroeder appeared to have eliminated a
powerful rival. Lafontaine, a burly and garrulous politician who
badly wanted to run for chancellor himself, wielded enormous power
until Thursday night as the head of Germany's ruling Social
Democratic Party. Although he could never match Schroeder's
charisma and flair for television, he commanded a loyalty among
party traditionalists and among Germany's powerful labor unions
that Schroeder could never hope to equal.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine deferred to Schroeder last year, recognizing that he
could never match Schroeder's popularity with voters. But as
finance minister, he then quickly dominated German economic policy
and muscled aside more pro-business moderates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two had been rising. Last week, Schroeder
bypassed his finance minister by pledging to German insurance
companies that he would limit their tax increase to about $5
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   He also began seeking out direct contacts with business leaders,
soothing their ruffled feathers in order to keep them from walking
out of talks with the government and unions.
</P>
<P>
   The hostility apparently erupted at a Cabinet meeting on
Wednesday. According to a report on Thursday by the newspaper Die
Welt, Schroeder obliquely hinted about resigning himself if the
government didn't stop antagonizing industry with tax increases and
demands to shut down nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   According to Die Welt, Schroeder railed at ``anti-business
policies'' that were ``against the majority of the people'' and
said he might reach the point where he would ``no longer assume
responsibility for such a policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But people who were in the chancellery Thursday said Schroeder
and his top lieutenants were genuinely shocked by Lafontaine's
decision, which he conveyed in an icy letter just one sentence
long.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-minute news conference Thursday night in which he
refused to take any questions, Schroeder said he was ``taken
aback'' by the decision while insisting that ``the stability of the
work of government is not in question.''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders at both ends of the spectrum said they were
shocked, and both supporters and opponents speculated that
Schroeder might even seek out a new coalition, perhaps with
Germany's small libertarian party, the Free Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked,'' said Peter Siegel, chairman of the Social
Democratic Party local branch in Limbach-Oberfrohna, near Berlin.
``It was evident that differences between Lafontaine and Schroeder
would eventually surface. But everybody in the party had hoped that
one could handle them in a professional way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hans-Olaf Henkel, president of the German Federation of Industry
and one of Schroeder's toughest critics, was elated. ``This will
give Schroeder the maneuvering room to come up with policies that
are more friendly to business and growth,'' he said Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   That view was largely echoed by Theo Sommer, co-publisher of the
liberal weekly newspaper Die Zeit, whose other co-publisher is
Helmut Schmidt, who was Germany's Social Democratic chancellor in
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy to see this, because they had lost five months by
trying to do things without knowing how to go about it,'' said
Sommer. Much of the blame, Sommer said, went straight to
Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was steering the wrong course _ far too ideological, far
too left-wing and too removed from the economic realities of the
country,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Fels, a senior German economist with Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter in Frankfurt, said Lafontaine's departure would be good news
for the euro as well as for German stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the euro's dramatic jump after the resignation provided
powerful testimony to the cloud Lafontaine had cast over the new
currency. When the euro was introduced on world markets Jan. 4, it
jumped immediately to about $1.19 and then began a long steady
slide to less than $1.08 in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that reflected the abrupt slowdown in European economic
growth, and more particularly the slowdown in German growth. The
German economy actually declined about four-tenths of a percent in
the last quarter of 1998 and many economists believe the country
will grow only 1.5 percent this year _ one of the slowest rates in
Europe, except for Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But Lafontaine contributed to the slide by raising doubts about
the independence of the new European Central Bank and perhaps even
backing it into an overly rigid policy just to prove its
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very good news for Germany markets,'' Fels said of
Lafontaine's resignation. ``Schroeder has won the power struggle
with Lafontaine. It now becomes easier for the European Central
Bank to concentrate on economic fundamentals without having to fend
off political calls for lower rates.''
</P>
<P>
   What most surprised political experts was that Lafontaine
resigned as head of the Social Democratic Party as well as finance
minister. But for all the heartburn he caused, some experts said
Lafontaine brought Schroeder invaluable political skills that he
may soon miss badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Lafontaine who held the party together,'' said Oskar
Niedermeyer, a political scientist at the Free University of
Berlin. ``Now there is a danger that the old fights between the
different party wings could surface again.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many politicians immediately began speculating that
Schroeder might reorganize his current political coalition between
the Social Democratic Party and the environmental Green Party.
Several experts said Thursday night that Schroeder might try to
shore up his support by teaming up with the small Free Democratic
Party, which represents a die-hard faith in laissez-faire
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens have caused Schroeder numerous problems, the most
serious of which has been their demand for a rapid shutdown of
Germany's commercial nuclear power plants. The country's big
utilities have angrily charged that the rapid shutdowns would cost
them enormous sums of money and Schroeder has been openly
sympathetic toward them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Greens will be weakened by the resignation,
because Lafontaine tended to represent left-wing ideas,'' said
Jurgen Falter, a political scientist at the Gutenberg University in
Mainz. ``I would not exclude the possibility of a change in
coalition that would bring the Free Democrats into the government
within this session of Parliament.''

DEMOCRATS ARE READY TO PICK LOS ANGELES FOR CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Mass., Pa.)   (rk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ending months of speculation, the Democratic
National Committee and Los Angeles civic and business leaders are
scheduled to announce on Monday that the party will hold its
national convention here next year, party officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The convention will be in the city for the first time since John
F. Kennedy was nominated in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that a
few, final financial details were being ironed out, but that
negotiations were expected to conclude over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A formal announcement, with the newly elected Democratic
governor, Gray Davis, and the Republican mayor of Los Angeles,
Richard Riordan, has been planned for 11 a.m. Monday at the
still-unfinished Staples Arena downtown, which will be the site of
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just back and forth over who's going to pay for the media
center, things like that,'' one party official said.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, party officials have made it clear that Los Angeles
is their top choice for the gathering Aug. 21-24, 2000. The city
beat out two other finalists, Boston and Denver, home to the
party's general chairman, Roy Roemer, and its outgoing national
chairman, Steve Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   But party officials had worried about who would guarantee the
financing for the convention because the city wanted the party to
sign a contract with the private citizens' committee that was
organized to sponsor the convention, instead of with the city
itself, as usually happens. Officials said Thursday that obstacle
had been overcome and that the party was willing to accept the host
committee's guarantee.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An unusual triumvirate of local leaders _ Eli Broad, a
billionaire businessman, David Geffen, the billionaire
entertainment mogul, and William Wardlaw, a prominent lawyer and
former partner of Riordan _ joined forces last year to head the
host committee seeking the convention, offering about $35.5 million
in financial backing.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the bid became an important element of Los Angeles'
effort to celebrate and show off its successful rebound from years
of economic, environmental and social disasters, and to profit from
the thousands of delegates and journalists the event will draw, and
the estimated $150 million in economic activity they generate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some initial worries by Vice President Al Gore that a
convention might be dominated by glittery celebrities who would
alienate swing voters, administration officials said that in the
end, the lure of California's 54 electoral votes proved too
appealing. California is vital to any Democratic candidate's
electoral strategy, and especially since Davis' election last fall
as the state's first Democratic governor in 16 years, Los Angeles
came to seem by far the most logical choice, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was said initially to favor Philadelphia, but when the
Republicans chose that city for their convention, that was no
longer a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, it's almost anticlimactic,'' said Rosalind Wyman,
the doyenne of the city's Democratic establishment and a member of
the party's site selection committee, reflecting on what has been a
foregone conclusion for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a national convention is such a positive for a city.
If your city shows well at all, it has an opportunity to really
show off. And televising west to east means the convention ends
early here, so delegates and journalists can go out and eat and
spend.''

DATA AWAITED ON TREATING BREAST CANCER WITH BONE-MARROW
TRANSPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cancer researchers have announced that by mid-April they will
make public the results of the first four large-scale studies
comparing standard treatment for advanced breast cancer to a far
more aggressive and controversial procedure involving bone-marrow
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   But the findings may well be equivocal, researchers caution,
even though they had hoped the studies would determine once and for
all whether the arduous bone-marrow treatment was worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to come out with a dogma?'' asked Dr. John
Durant, executive vice president of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology in Alexandria, Va., a group representing 12,000
cancer specialists. ``No. In all probability there will be
controversy. But there will be more information than there was.''
</P>
<P>
   Data from the four studies, two from the United States, one from
Sweden and one from South Africa, will be posted on the oncology
society's Web site (www.asco.org) by April 15, and formally
presented at its annual meeting May 15-18 in Atlanta. The four
studies included a total of about 2,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the data are still being analyzed, there are hints
that the transplants have not had a dramatic impact. For one thing,
the American studies, which began 11 years ago, were periodically
evaluated by a data safety monitoring board, which would have cut
the experiments short if it had become apparent that one of the
treatments worked markedly better than the other. But the studies
were not interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the principal investigator of an American study of
553 women, Dr. Edward Stadtmauer, director of bone marrow
transplantation at the University of Pennsylvania cancer center in
Philadelphia, said that even though he had been involved in the
research for 10 years, he was still not sure whether one of the
treatments was better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting with tremendous eagerness for the final
analysis,'' Stadtmauer said. In the meantime, he added, his center
is continuing to offer the procedure to appropriate patients with
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The studies, which could influence treatment decisions made by
thousands of women, have generated such intense interest and
speculation that groups representing patients and researchers have
taken the unusual step of issuing statements to explain why the
results have not yet been released. The organizations, including
the National Cancer Institute, which sponsored the American
clinical trials, said the data were still being analyzed and were
not being deliberately withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors began offering bone marrow transplants to women with
advanced breast cancer in the 1980s, after the procedure had been
proved to help people with some forms of leukemia and other cancers
affecting the blood and immune system. The treatment involves
giving patients such extremely high doses of chemotherapy that the
immune system is virtually destroyed, and must be replaced with a
bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   For breast cancer, the procedure was recommended to patients who
had a poor outlook because the cancer had invaded many lymph nodes
or had spread to bones, liver or lungs. In most cases, instead of
using bone marrow from a donor, the patient's own marrow would be
harvested before treatment and returned afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure itself has risks: the toxic drugs can cause
bleeding and organ damage and leave a patient vulnerable to
dangerous infections. In its early days, as many as 15 percent of
patients died from the treatment itself. On Thursday, Stadtmauer
said, that figure is more like 1 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The transplants became standard procedure for advanced breast
cancer in some medical centers, even though the technique had not
been tested in breast cancer using the gold standard of medical
research, a randomized, controlled trial in which patients with the
same disease at the same stage are assigned at random to one
treatment or another, and monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of hard data, many doctors and patients became
convinced that a bone-marrow transplant was the last hope for women
with aggressive breast cancer. In some cases when insurance
companies tried to deny payment for the procedure (which can cost
more than $50,000), calling it experimental, women sued for
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   It became difficult to study the procedure, because many women
wanted it and refused to enter a study in which they might be
picked for the standard treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Stadtmauer said he hoped the trials would help identify which
patients could benefit from transplants. ``Now, based on the best
possible experience, we know that of 100 patients with metastatic
breast cancer, maybe 20 will benefit from bone-marrow
transplantation,'' he said. ``I would like to make it so that we
only have to treat, say, 30, to get that 20, and we could treat the
other 70 with newer and perhaps better therapies that will help
them more.''

STARR'S SPOKESMAN RESIGNS ABRUPTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chief spokesman for Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel who has been investigating President Clinton,
abruptly resigned on Thursday, as Starr asked the Justice
Department to look into unauthorized disclosures of confidential
material from his own office.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Charles Bakaly, has resigned effective June 1,
but will cease his duties immediately and go on paid administrative
leave until then, Starr said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr said he accepted the resignation ``with regret,''
there was no doubt that Bakaly's departure and the unauthorized
disclosures were linked. Bakaly has retained a lawyer, Howard
Shapiro, who issued a statement that his client would cooperate
fully with the Justice Department inquiry and was ``confident that
he will be found not to have violated any statute, regulation or
court order.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said he had referred to the Justice Department the results
of his office's internal inquiry into possible unauthorized
disclosures that led to a front-page article in The New York Times
on Jan. 31. The Times reported on that day that Starr had concluded
that he had the constitutional authority to seek an indictment of
Clinton before Clinton left the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's new Washington spokeswoman, Elizabeth Ray, did not
return a telephone call seeking comment on Thursday's developments.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation of Clinton's attempts to conceal his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky led to Clinton's impeachment. He
was acquitted in the Senate of obstruction of justice and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The Times article said that Starr had concluded, after
conferring with two constitutional-law scholars in his office, that
he had the authority to seek an indictment of a sitting president,
but that he had not yet decided whether to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The article cited ``several associates'' of Starr as sources of
information and quoted Bakaly as saying: ``We will not discuss the
plans of this office or the plans of the grand jury in any way,
shape or form.''
</P>
<P>
   The article prompted Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, to accuse
the independent counsel's office of leaking information on Starr's
thinking _ an accusation that Bakaly denied.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said he had no comment on Bakaly's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Oreskes, The Times' Washington bureau chief, said, ``We
do not discuss the sources of our stories.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman, Myron Marlin, confirmed that
Starr had notified the department that he would forward the results
of his internal inquiry. Marlin said the department had not
received the data pertaining to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we receive it,'' Marlin said, ``we will determine how
best to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement on Bakaly's behalf, Shapiro said that, with the
``high-profile phase'' of Starr's investigation largely completed,
this was ``a logical time for Bakaly to make the transition back to
the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly, a lawyer from Los Angeles, joined Starr's office last
May. Before that, he was a spokesman for another independent
counsel, Donald Smaltz, who unsuccessfully prosecuted Clinton's
former agriculture secretary, Mike Espy.

CLINTON ADVISER SAYS NORTH KOREA IS ADVANCING ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Korea is working on its nuclear program,
despite Clinton administration statements that the program is
frozen, according to former Secretary of Defense William Perry, the
president's special adviser on North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is moving forward on their nuclear
weapons,'' Perry said at a news conference today for the
publication of his book ``Preventive Defense,'' written with Ashton
B. Carter and published by the Brookings Institution. ``They seem
to have other programs under way that are part of a nuclear
effort.``
</P>
<P>
   This month Perry will submit a report to the president on the
effectiveness of U.S. policy toward North Korea, assessing whether
the North has complied with a 1994 agreement that guaranteed it
fuel oil and other aid in return for a pledge to freeze its nuclear
weapons effort.
</P>
<P>
   Last year U.S. spy satellites discovered several underground
complexes burrowed into the hillsides of North Korea near
Kumchang-ni, leading the Clinton administration to raise questions
about the site.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement Thursday the administration repeated its
conclusion that there was ``no basis to conclude at this point that
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has violated'' the 1994
agreement and that it was pressing for inspections of the
suspicious site ``to be able to confirm that North Korea remains in
compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the North Koreans have refused to allow those
inspections. But the Clinton administration announced Thursday that
it had made some headway in talks with the North Koreans in New
York and that it believes the North Koreans may be persuaded to
allow the United States to inspect the site where North Korea is
suspected of constructing a nuclear reactor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some progress, some headway,'' said James
Rubin, spokesman for the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Since the new underground complex was discovered, the North
Koreans have alternately demanded money _ once asking for hundreds
of millions of dollars _ and food aid in exchange for inspection
rights. The United States refused both requests.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Perry was named special adviser on North Korea to
figure out how to save the 1994 Agreed Framework, which became
endangered not only by the discovery of the suspicious site but by
North Korea's launching last summer of a three-stage rocket over
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   That test caught Japan and the United States by surprise and
demonstrated the North Koreans' ability to launch missiles that
could threaten South Korea, Japan and the American troops stationed
in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is very serious,'' Perry said Thursday. ``The
long-range-missile program itself suggests in parallel the
development of a nuclear weapons program.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rocket launching in turn helped spur the Clinton
administration's decision to set aside funds for the eventual
development of a limited missile-defense system and prompted
Congress to question why the United States should continue honoring
its part of the 1994 Agreed Framework.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated questioning, Perry refused Thursday to divulge
what he will report to the president. He did say he would present
the president with two separate recommendations: one road to follow
if the North agreed to cooperate and another road with ``sterner
measures'' if the North rejected the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any recommendation that I give to President Clinton will deal
both with the possibility that North Korea will respond to positive
proposals and the possibility that they may not,'' Perry said. ``If
they do not, then sterner measures will be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to Asia, Perry said he received the necessary
backing of Japan and South Korea, both allies, for the proposals
and that in discussions with Chinese leaders he outlined why it was
in China's interest to find a peaceful solution to the North Korean
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He said, though, that if the North Koreans refused to cooperate,
``We would expect to have the United States, Japan and South Korea
united in both the need for sterner measures and the way in which
we carry them out.''
</P>
<P>
   In private discussions, Perry has suggested that he will propose
a package deal for North Korea that could include more aid in
exchange for freezing nuclear production and imposing strong
restraints on ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   And if it were necessary, Perry said he would travel to
Pyongyang after delivering the report to Clinton to explain the new
American strategy to the North Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm open to going to Pyongyang,'' he said, ``under the right
conditions.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average pushed within 65
points of the 10,000 mark Thursday before surrendering about a
quarter of its gains amid signs that the recent rally has widened
to include stocks that had been left in the wake of technology
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index reached
records, but the Nasdaq market, which is dominated by
high-technology issues, managed only a slim advance after being in
negative territory for part of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow climbed 124.60 points, or 1.3 percent, to 9,897.44. The
high point was 9,935.46 at mid-session, when the gain was 162.62
points. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 10.84 points, or eight-tenths of a
percent, to 1,297.68. The Nasdaq index edged up 6.25 points, or
almost three-tenths of a percent, to 2,412.25.
</P>
<P>
   More evidence that the economy continues to surge helped fuel
the latest advance, which widened to include oil stocks,
Caterpillar, Coca-Cola and other issues that had been left behind
through a long period of enthusiasm for technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks also caught fire, with American Express pacing
the Dow with a jump of 5 7/8, to a record 123 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is a broadening of the leadership, which is
an encouraging sign,'' said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment officer
at BankBoston. He noted that major averages were setting records
even as popular technology issues like Dell Computer, Intel and
Microsoft remained well below their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   But the rotation of interest did not include small companies,
many of which have been selling at low prices relative to their
earnings. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company shares was a
fraction lower Thursday and shows a loss of 4.95 percent so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be extremely difficult for them to rally until
we get a consensus that the next interest rate move will be down,''
a process that will take two or three months, said Robert Froelich,
vice chairman of the Kemper Funds Group.
</P>
<P>
   Among various unsettling factors during the day, traders said,
was a report that Microsoft would make an announcement at 5 p.m.,
with speculation about the subject ranging from possible good news
on the government's antitrust suit against it to bad news about
sales or earnings.
</P>
<P>
   With the market closed, Microsoft said it expected a $400
million revenue shortfall in the quarter ending March 31 because of
a delay in introducing the next generation of word-processing and
spreadsheet software. Shares of Microsoft fell 15/16, to 160 1/2,
in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really a rotation going on'' in the market, said
Richard Hoey, director of equity research at Dreyfus Corp. ``You
have a loss of energy in the old tech leadership and drugs while on
the other side there is a bounce in oils'' and other laggards, such
as DuPont and Goodyear Tire and Rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts based hopes for higher oil prices on a possible
agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
limit output, as well as signs of economic recovery in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil rose 3 3/16, to 94 9/16, while Chevron advanced 1 13/16,
to 85 1/16, and Exxon gained 1 7/16, to 74 3/4. Drilling-company
stocks, however, were mostly lower after rising on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola jumped 3 11/16, to 66 3/8, after Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette raised it to ``buy'' and predicted a price of 79 within 12
months. Auto stocks also gained after an increasingly optimistic
Ford Motor said the industry could sell as many as 16 million cars
and trucks in 1999. DaimlerChrysler lifted its projection to 15.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers were mixed despite a strong government report on
retail sales for the first two months of the year, but Wal-Mart
Stores stood out with a gain of 1 3/4, to 95 5/16, nearly double
the 52-week low of 48 3/16 set last April.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage stocks and some banks were also strong after Warburg
Dillon Read recommended several companies including Merrill Lynch,
up 2 1/2, to 89 1/4; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, up 2 11/16, to 101
3/4; Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, up 1 3/4, to 61 15/16, and
Citigroup, up 1 15/16, to 65 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange expanded to a hefty 909.6
million, with advancing issues outnumbering declining ones by 1,748
to 1,256. New highs, however, barely surpassed new lows _ 82 to 73.

 &HT;    The amazing exploits of Jack Hill
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Some would call them breasts and blood, camp and
come-ons. They are the ingredients Jack Hill was sure to include in
his legendary exploitation films of the 1960s and '70s. With a
poetic flourish, he calls them something else: ``The amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things that were titillating,'' Hill explains. ``I hate to say
sex and violence because those elements are part of Shakespeare and
Greek drama as much as anything. But I had to deliver the goods in
the sense of stuff the audience would pay to see without big stars.
Instead of `Who's in it?,' it was 'What's in it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Quick answer: sassy girl gangs with switchblades, lusty
cheerleaders, cannibals, drug dealers, avenging prostitutes, women
in prison and bundles of crowd-rousing cat fights. And let's not
forget the Amazonian feats of blaxploitation queen Pam Grier, whom
Hill helped vault to '70s stardom.
</P>
<P>
   It's celluloid that unreeled at drive-ins and grindhouses, never
art houses. Ironically, art houses (and video shelves) are where
the visceral thrills of Hill and peers Russ Meyer, Roger Corman and
Herschell Gordon Lewis have been consigned today.
</P>
<P>
   The South by Southwest Film Festival _ itself a kind of
elaborate art house _ will honor Hill with an eight-film
retrospective Sunday through next Friday at venues around town.
Hill, camp crusader Quentin Tarantino and frequent Hill performer
Sid Haig will present the director's best-known works: ``The Big
Doll House'' (1971), ``The Big Bird Cage'' (1972), ``Spider Baby''
(1964), ``Switchblade Sisters'' (1975), ``Foxy Brown'' (1974),
``Pit Stop'' (1969), ``Coffy'' (1973) and ``The Swinging
Cheerleaders'' (1974).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of film festivals have these weighty tributes,'' says
Nancy Schafer, executive producer of the SXSW Film Festival. ``I
just like the idea of really showing off a guy who knows everything
about filmmaking and did a brilliant job and was not heavily
entrenched in the system doing serious, weighty films. He fits our
overall aesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Exploitation is cinema without guile, delivering vice and
vulgarity shorn of hypocrisy. Filmmakers such as Hill and his
mentor Corman offered a rebuke to Hollywood pieties, and, better,
satisfied audiences' unspoken yearnings. Like the freak-show
barker, the filmmakers did it to make a buck, and have some fun.
</P>
<P>
   So who was being exploited _ the stereotyped blacks and
half-nude women on screen, or us?
</P>
<P>
   Who cares? shot back the movies, as well as audiences. This was
outlaw entertainment _ frank, unaffected and gleeful, free of
pornography's icky anatomical specificity. Exploitation films
wallowed in their R-rated depravity, and beckoned us to skinny dip
with it.
</P>
<P>
   A KNACK FOR FILMMAKING
</P>
<P>
   A young, established classical musician, Hill went to the
University of California at Los Angeles with the intention of
making musical scores for films. He dabbled in film and writing
courses, discovered a knack, and was encouraged to continue on this
path. His 1962 student film was called ``The Host,'' a 30-minute
shocker based on James Frazer's ``The Golden Bough.'' Apparently,
classmate Francis Ford Coppola saw Hill's project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film became the basis for the third act of `Apocalypse
Now,' '' Hill says. ``My cameraman on my student film was the
second unit cameraman on `Apocalypse Now,' and he said they were
all laughing about how they were shooting Jack Hill's student movie
there. It's the part of the movie that didn't work in my opinion.
Nobody understood it. So if you see my student film, you'll
understand what the third act of Coppola's movie means.''
</P>
<P>
   (In 1996, Tarantino re-released Hill's ``Switchblade Sisters''
under the aegis of his Rolling Thunder Pictures label. The laser
disc and DVD versions contain ``The Host.'')
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s and '70s, schlock producer-director Corman used to
poach the best film students at UCLA and put them to work on his
outlandish pictures. Hill, Coppola and a New York University
student named Martin Scorsese all started under Corman's wing.
</P>
<P>
   Doing all manner of film work for Corman, from inserts to
writing and editing, Hill was suddenly in the epicenter of the
exploitation movie world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of fell into it,'' he says. ``I fell into the path
of least resistance doing whatever people hired me to do. But I
enjoyed working on those kinds of films. They were really fun to do
because you had a lot of freedom as long as you delivered the
necessary elements _ the amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill worked on such unabashed hokum as ``The Wasp Woman''
(1960), ``The Playgirls and the Bellboy'' (1962) and ``The Terror''
(1963). Then he was hired to finish Coppola's early directorial
effort ``Dementia 13,'' about an ax murderer in a spooky castle. In
those heady days, a longing to make high art never tugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt somebody was paying me good money to make a
movie and it was my duty to hopefully get their money back and make
a profit,'' Hill says. ``So I always wanted to make audience-appeal
movies, but I wanted to do more than that. I wanted the movies to
have audience appeal but at the same time deliver something on a
higher level, and I think I did accomplish that.''
</P>
<P>
   The first feature Hill called his own as writer-director was the
cannibal horror-comedy ``Spider Baby,'' starring Haig and an ailing
Lon Chaney Jr. Of his films, it's his personal favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chaney loved the script so much and really wanted to do a good
job. It gave him a chance to do comedy, which nobody else thought
he could do,'' Hill says. ``He stayed sober during the whole thing,
which was very, very difficult for him. It was really sad he died
before seeing that the movie would become an international cult
classic.''
</P>
<P>
   FINDING PAM GRIER
</P>
<P>
   It was during a cattle call for his girls-in-prison flick, ``The
Big Doll House,'' that Hill met Pam Grier. Famously, they would
make three more films together, including the blaxploitation
classics ``Coffy'' and ``Foxy Brown.'' The Afro-sporting Grier
packed sex and punch into one voluptuous package. Not until 1997's
``Jackie Brown'' would Grier be so on top of her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pam came in and I was immediately struck by her presence and
authority and personality and appearance,'' Hill says. ``I just
took a chance at giving her one of the leading roles, and she
almost stole the picture. She had a natural talent and so I adapted
the role for her. Of course, after that I wrote the scripts
specifically for her, with her personality very much in mind. She
was very hard working. She got better with each picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more over-the-top scenes and cheese-stuffed lines in
Hill's films elicit groans and giggles in our glibly ironic times.
Hill doesn't take it personally. ``Audiences laugh when they're
supposed to. My work cannot be trivialized,'' he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intended to, in Shakespearean lingo, play to the
groundlings and also have some higher elements in it, and I think
it does that. As Quentin (Tarantino) says, it has some meaning once
you're willing to participate in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's directorial career effectively died after 1983's
``Sorceress,'' with which he was so displeased that he removed his
name from it. Time rolls forward and exploitation, save for
inadvertent goofs like ``Showgirls,'' becomes arcana for driven
buffs. Hill still has two action-adventures he wants to make if
he's allowed to.
</P>
<P>
   And if he is, Hill says he will not forget what Corman always
told him, a reliable mantra for the exploitation aesthetic:
``Something has to happen every reel.''

 &HT;    Director's first film to play up Austin's computer-effects
talent
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Yesterday, Chris Roberts was known only to PC
gamers. To them, he was a digital rock star, creating dynamic,
addictive computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is the 30-year-old who created the ``Wing Commander''
game series, a series that sold more than 5 million units and made
Austin's Origin Systems an estimated $100 million. He is the man
who started his own game company _ Digital Anvil _ in 1997 and was
immediately given an undisclosed amount (some estimate the sum at
$80 million) by Microsoft, with carte blanche to do whatever he
pleased. He was king, a computer-gaming god.
</P>
<P>
   But that was yesterday. Tonight, everything changes.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight at 8 in the Paramount Theater, Roberts makes his
directorial debut with the Austin premiere of ``Wing Commander,'' a
$25 million science fiction extravaganza based on his game series.
Tonight, Roberts takes off his cloak and crown and puts on his
rookie cap as he introduces himself as Chris Roberts, filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   There's more at stake here than Roberts' ego and potential film
career. This premiere could add another facet to Austin's growing
reputation as an inexpensive filming alternative to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Wing Commander'' was shot in Luxembourg, the
computer-generated effects and much of the post-production work was
done locally, an Austin first. If ``Wing Commander'' is even mildly
successful _ producer Todd Moyer says pulling in even $35 million
would make it a ``huge hit'' _ it will prove that Austin can
produce a commercial film with locally produced high-grade special
effects for, in Hollywood terms, a pittance.
</P>
<P>
   A best-case scenario would result in a slew of new film
productions for the city as well as a reason to shoot effects-based
movies here.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Wing Commander' could be major,'' says Tom Copeland,
director of the Texas Film Commission, a state-funded office
responsible for bringing film crews to Texas. ``Nothing like this
has ever been done to this extent in Texas. Post-production and
special effects have always been done in L.A. This will say to
Hollywood: `If you don't believe things like this can be done in
Texas, take a look at this.' It really could start something new in
Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   GAMING WUNDERKIND
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Roberts, you wouldn't know he was carrying such a
burden. A couple of days before the ``Wing Commander'' premiere,
his attention is trained on one of his favorite scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's seen the movie more than 40 times, Roberts still
giggles while describing the battle to save the main
spaceship.``You see it's like the settlers are circling the
wagons,'' he exclaims in his British-tinged Texas accent. ``The
(spaceship) Tiger Claw seems doomed! But then, the fighters return
and it's like the cavalry has returned to save the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, his brother Erin (a game developer at Digital Anvil)
and his mother and father moved from their native Manchester,
England, to Austin in 1988. The 17-year-old Roberts immediately
recognized Austin as ``really cool'' and wanted to stay. In
England, he had made a name for himself as a gaming Wunderkind,
making award-winning games since he was 13. He planned to continue
here.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts was working on a game called ``Wiz Adore'' in 1992 when
Richard Garriott wooed him to come work at Origin. Soon after,
Roberts began working on a game called ``Squadron.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I started off thinking about battleships in space and bought a
lot of World War II research books to help me get in the right
mind-set,'' Roberts said. ``I thought it would be cool to take the
war in the Pacific and put the fighters dogfighting in space.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting game was the first of five ``Wing Commander''
games. While the first two were action-based favorites, ``Wing
Commander III: Heart of the Tiger'' was a revolutionary
action-based game and computer-based interactive movie. It was
Roberts' first opportunity to display his talents as a storyteller,
a talent his mother says he had from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chris was small, his father used to tell him and his
brother these fabulous stories and put the two boys in them,''
Susan Roberts said from her West Lake Hills home. ``And really,
when you look at it, that's what Chris does with his games. He puts
the person into the story. To a degree, he also does that with his
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Roberts had completed five ``Wing Commander'' games and
built a mighty franchise.
</P>
<P>
   GOING SOLO
</P>
<P>
   That year, Origin was bought by gaming giant Electronic Arts.
Unhappy with the subsequent corporate bureaucracy, Roberts and his
colleague Marten Davies began their own company. In the first
attempt by someone in the gaming industry to cross over to film,
Digital Anvil was born with the intention of developing games and
creating movies based on those games.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was good enough to prompt software giant Microsoft and
local computer maker AMD to invest. Even local auteur Robert
Rodriguez bought a minor share of the company because ``it just
seemed right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We started a company on our core strength, which is games,''
said Davies, president of Digital Anvil. ``But we also wanted the
freedom to go into another medium _ the ability to go from silicon
to celluloid.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Roberts wrote a script for ``Wing Commander'' and kept
it for three years before meeting producer Todd Moyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time a game developer has crossed over to
director, and I think Chris has a great vision and, for the most
part, pulled it off,'' said Moyer, who also produced Jean-Claude
Van Damme's ``Time Cop'' and the Pamela Anderson movie ``Barbed
Wire.'' ``I've dealt with all these big money features. I wanted to
do a picture where we had a smaller budget, stick to it and still
come out with a quality product. I think we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   POST-PRODUCTION SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   In April last year, shooting for ``Wing Commander'' was
completed, and the film was brought to Digital Anvil. Here, 19
artists worked on more than 290 visual-effects shots. Though
significantly less costly than a Hollywood version, the film has an
impressively slick look to it. Spaceships and battles look more
like a $70 million production than the $25 million actually spent.
</P>
<P>
   While advance buzz and audience previews of ``Wing Commander''
range from ``flawed'' to ``visual achievement,'' no one has been
tougher on the film than Roberts. Known to be hypercritical of his
work, Roberts is a perfectionist, totally focused on his goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things I would have changed about the movie,''
he said. ``Like the Kilarathi, the bad guys. Next time I would have
done them digitally. It would have been great to have had a really
cool, scary bad guy. Next time I'll do it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts stops, realizing he is validating his reputation as a
perfectionist. ``I just hope people appreciate the production value
they are getting for budget of this film.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Schafer, director of the SXSW Film Festival, hopes the
film will bring some recognition for Austin and its ability to
provide an atmosphere and the talented artists that helped make
``Wing Commander'' a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wing Commander'' is also the first film to carry an actual
Austin brand in the end credits, reading ``Visual FX created in
Austin, City of Ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER BEGINNING
</P>
<P>
   For now, all Roberts can do is sit and wait for the reviews and
box offices numbers to roll in. In the meantime, he plans to go
back to developing games with his brother and the rest of the gang
at Digital Anvil. For the past two years, Roberts' pet game project
has been ``Freelancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Games, he says, are a great respite from making films, because
they contain no time limits. If it takes a few years, then it takes
a few years. Roberts, the digital rock star, doesn't have the time
pressures that Roberts the first-time director does.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, his mind remains focused on his movie. ``Ultimately,
what I'd like to achieve with this film is to see Austin grow as a
film community,'' Roberts said. ``It would be cool if someone was
talking about Austin film and mentioned `Wing Commander.' But as
far as Austin's filmmakers, like Robert Rodriguez and Richard
Linklater are concerned, I don't feel I'm a member of that club
yet.

HOUSE MOVES AHEAD WITH KOSOVO DEBATE OVER WHITE HOUSE OBJECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This is no longer a page 1 story.) 
(wg) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the fierce objections of the Clinton
administration, the House moved ahead on Thursday with a debate
over whether U.S. troops should be sent to Kosovo as part of a NATO
peace-keeping force should a settlement be reached in the Balkan
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Although any House action on the issue would not be binding on
President Clinton, the debate came at a crucial diplomatic juncture
in the faltering peace effort as a new round of international
negotiations over Kosovo was scheduled to resume Monday.
Congressional officials of both parties said the vote on a
resolution authorizing troops was too close to call, raising the
possibility of a sharp foreign policy defeat for Clinton at a
moment when he is traveling overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution under consideration in the House notes that the
president is authorized to carry out the deployment of U.S. troops
to join a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo. But numerous
amendments were pending, including one offered by Rep. Tillie
Fowler, R-Fla., that would express ``the opposition of Congress''
to any deployment of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Senior members of the president's foreign policy team _ many of
them overseas _ placed calls to lawmakers throughout the day. And
in Guatemala, President Clinton said, ``I do not believe that
Congress should take any action that will in effect pre-empt the
peace process or encourage either side to say no to it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright implored the
House to hold off, saying that a vote against troops at such a
delicate moment would be seen as ``a green light to resume
fighting.'' She was backed by Bob Dole, the former Republican
presidential contender and Senate majority leader, who warned
Congress that a no vote could ``throw cold water on any possible
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an aggressive assertion of Congress' role in foreign
policy, the new speaker, Dennis Hastert, refused to heed the call
for delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to be direct and honest with the president and
his secretary of state,'' he said in a speech on the House floor.
``I told them that I believed it was my duty as speaker to ensure
that members of the House of Representatives, Republican and
Democrat, have the opportunity to fairly and openly debate this
important issue before troops are sent into a potentially dangerous
situation. I believe Congress must have a meaningful role in this
decision, no matter how difficult our choice, nor how hard our
task.''
</P>
<P>
   The day was also a test of how Hastert would compare with Newt
Gingrich, a confirmed internationalist. Hastert, R-Ill., said in an
interview late Thursday afternoon that he had told Albright that
``probably my presumption would be I would be favorable to'' the
president's proposal to deploy 4,000 troops as part of a 28,000
NATO peacekeeping force. But he said he would not make a final
decision until he heard the debate.
</P>
<P>
   He was also unapologetic about his timing for forcing the issue
to the floor. ``We need to have an open debate,'' he said in the
interview. ``The White House, I'm just being perfectly honest about
this, was rather reticent to come up to Congress to try to sell
this thing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Rep. Dick Armey, the House majority leader and Rep. Tom
DeLay, the House Whip, opposed the deployment of troops. DeLay
called it a ``big dangerous quagmire'' and ``another bad idea in a
foreign policy with no focus.'' He said the Clinton administration
had become too dependent on air strikes or threats of air strikes,
speaking of bombings in Iraq, strikes against targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan and the threat of air strikes against Serbian targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing sovereign nations for ill-defined reasons with vague
objectives undermines American stature in the world,'' he said.
``The international respect and trust for America is diminished
every time we casually let the bombs fly. We must stop giving the
appearance that our foreign policy is formulated by the
Unabomber.''
</P>
<P>
   Through hours of sharp debate that stretched into the night,
House members clashed passionately over the role of the United
States in the post-Cold War world, as well as over the U.S.
leadership role in NATO. They argued over whether outsiders could
ever end the ethnic strife in the Balkans, where two world wars
began, and expressed misgivings about the length of the U.S.
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia which Clinton had once promised
would be of limited duration. The debate split the Republican
party, though most Democrats spoke out in support of the
president's policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall Bosnia, my friends,'' said Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C.
``The president told us our troops would be back home, I believe,
by December of 1996. But when I last checked, December 1996 has
come and long gone and our troops are still there.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I don't mean to protray myself as an isolationist
but to suggest that Bosnia and Kosovo are European problems that
should be resolved by Europeans hardly constitutes isolationism.
It's isolationism-lite at its best, if that. I just believe we do
not need to insert our oars in those waters.''
</P>
<P>
   In disagreeing, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., argued: ``It boils down
to a simple proposition. Is NATO worthwhile?''
</P>
<P>
   Saying the western alliance was trying to ``stop genocide, to
stop slaughter,'' he said. ``There really is a moral obligation for
those who have the resources to intercede.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats spoke forcefully in favor of the deployment and
questioned why the Republican leadership had scheduled such a
debate when a new round of diplomacy was beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the height of irresponsibility,'' said Rep. Dick
Gephardt, the House minority leader. ``This should not be about
politics. It should not be about giving the administration a black
eye. This is about ending a humanitarian catastrophe and preventing
the slaughter of thousands of innocent people caught in a simmering
ethnic conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eliot Engel of New York said, ``If the United States
Congress votes against sending troops to Kosovo, Slobodan
Milosevic, the butcher of Kosovo, will laugh and laugh and laugh
because we will have given him cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats tried but failed to postpone the debate on two largely
party-line procedural votes _ 218-199 and 218-201.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Fighting spread across southern Kosovo
Thursday and Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy, left for Washington
empty-handed after his meetings here with the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooke first met with representatives of other nations
involved in trying to bring peace to Serbia, then handed over the
negotiating to the Greek and Russian foreign ministers. The Greek
foreign minister, George Papandreou, arrived Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke failed to make any headway in meetings Wednesday with
Milosevic, who continues to refuse to accept foreign troops in
Kosovo as part of a peace plan. The troops' major function would be
to protect ethnic Albanians from Serbian and Yugoslav forces that
have been harshly suppressing a separatist militia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, was quoted by the
Russian news agency Interfax in Moscow as saying the conflict in
Kosovo must be resolved peacefully, a reminder of Russia's
traditional sympathy for Serbia and its opposition to NATO's threat
of air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes are thin that the representatives of two fellow
Eastern Orthodox nations, Russia and Greece, can sway Milosevic
before peace talks resume Monday in Paris. Russia has often offered
to intervene with the Serbs, to little effect.
</P>
<P>
   There is no apparent concern in Belgrade that the threat of
airstrikes is serious.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke seemed to acknowledge that Thursday. ``We don't like
to go around rattling rockets and making threatening gestures,'' he
said. ``Our positions are clear and President Milosevic knows them,
and we will be in continuing contact with him.''
</P>
<P>
   He said time remained for a compromise before Monday. ``I don't
want to leave you with a sense of optimism or pessimism,'' he told
reporters. ``We came out here to make clear what the American
position was. That has clearly and unequivocally been done.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Milosevic made clear that he would not accept
foreign peace keeping troops as a condition of the peace plan for
Kosovo, a province in Serbia that is 90 percent Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday his influential wife, Mira Markovic, depicted
America as the ``biggest bully at the end of the 20th century'' in
a speech at the University Left in Belgrade, the independent VIP
news agency reported here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Markovic, the head of the Yugoslav Left movement and a
radical nationalist, defended Serbia's record, saying:
``Allegations that the interests and rights of minorities in Serbia
are not respected are untrue. These allegations are used by those
who invented them as an excuse to bring pressure and use violence
against disobedient Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbia and Montenegro are the last republics in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As diplomacy seemed to stall, fighting in Kosovo spread for the
first time to the southern region around Prizren, one of Kosovo's
most gracious towns and so far an example of peace and harmony.
Serbian forces shelled the region, near the border with Macedonia,
continuing the strategy of clearing this area of both rebels and
civilians. Thousands of residents have been forced to leave their
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Casualties reported Thursday from fighting on Wednesday were
some of the highest in recent weeks: six fighters of the Kosovo
Liberation Army and 20 Serbian soldiers were reported wounded in
fighting around Vucitrn, in northern Kosovo, according to the VIP
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   There were no casualty figures for the fighting Thursday in the
south.

 &HT;    For `fanboys' eagerly waiting, the Net is a friendly cantina in
a lonely, sometimes hostile galaxy
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Some people can't figure out what
they'll be doing next week, much less in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Not Joseph Helmsorig.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, May 21 has been a sacred date. That's when
the new Star Wars movie, ``Episode I: The Phantom Menace,'' debuts
in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   And the day before, the 29-year-old emergency medical technician
from Sunrise will don a homemade costume and transform himself into
Boba Fett, an obscure character who had all of six lines of
dialogue in the three previous films.
</P>
<P>
   Then he'll trudge down to the local theater _ in his $1,100
get-up _ and camp out overnight so he can party with hundreds of
others who have waited since 1983 for a fresh Star Wars movie. And
after seeing ``Phantom'' the first time, he plans to go to as many
showings as he can get into that day.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Helmsorig is truly devoted. His TV remote control is a
light sabre. His apartment is decorated top to bottom in ``Star
Wars'' clutter. He's all set to get a tattoo with an insignia used
by bad guy Darth Vader's troops. And when he isn't working or
studying to be a paramedic, he spends hours combing through Web
sites and chat rooms that analyze the most arcane hints of the new
film's plot and characters. Even his computer makes ``Star Wars''
sounds when it's turned on.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fascination with `Star Wars' knows no boundaries,'' he
says, almost solemnly.
</P>
<P>
   He has plenty of company in his galaxy of adoration. If Internet
traffic is any indication, an untold legion is lurking in a
parallel universe waiting for the big day.
</P>
<P>
   In computer parlance, they're known as ``fanboys,'' obsessive,
tenacious ``Star Wars'' fanatics who spend hours scouring the
digital globe for tidbits about the upcoming ``prequel.''
</P>
<P>
   They discuss alien adventures and sword fights. Some confess to
dressing up and going out in public _ for no apparent reason. One
even talks about wanting to play the movie in the delivery room
when his wife gives birth to their first _ though as yet
unconceived _ child.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the real world plays along. Helmsorig's
girlfriend, Stacey Moskowitz, has never seen the first movie all
the way through. The 29-year-old paralegal, who describes herself
as a ``Star Wars widow,'' usually nods off right after the film
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep seeing the same 15 minutes,'' she said. ``I can't even
tell you who Han Solo is. I'll go see the new film, but I'm not
going to stand in line overnight. I didn't camp out to see Duran
Duran in 1986, so I'm definitely not doing it for this.''
</P>
<P>
   For a fanboy, this is good news. The fewer people in line, the
more times they can see ``Phantom'' the first day. And the second.
And the third.
</P>
<P>
   The hysteria has remained at this pitch since the trailer for
the prequel hit movie screens in November. ``Star Wars'' Web sites
have been bombarded with the kind of urgent traffic you might have
seen from crowds racing to catch the last chopper out of Saigon.
There are thousands of unofficial fan sites, and a half-dozen of
them receive more than 15,000 hits a day. Every day, these sites
post new tidbits about the trailer, the prequel and the Skywalk
convention in Dallas that will coincide with the release of the
film. So many assume the film's box office draw will eclipse
Titanic's more than $1 billion worldwide total that it's passe to
even mention the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In ways, the November trailer was almost cruel for the way it
torqued their thirst. Some paid the $7.50 it cost to get into ``A
Bug's Life'' or ``Meet Joe Black'' just to see the 2.5-minute
snippet. Later this month, fans will get another trailer, purported
to have more than 100 fresh sequences from the film.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Pepsi USA will launch an ad campaign for soft drink
collectibles that will likely include a gold Pepsi can sporting
Jedi instructor Yoda and the Episode I logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only saw the first trailer once and I saw it on MTV,'' said
Jim Brogan, 27, of West Palm Beach. ``I went to go see `A Bug's
Life' because I heard the preview was running before the movie and
all I got to see was a (expletive) preview for Inspector Gadget.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogan, who works at Past Present Future Comics on Military
Trail, grew up with the series. ``Every three years, my life
revolved around going to see the next film,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even turned `Star Wars' into a drinking game at college,''
he said. ``You'd have to pick a character and recite a line of
dialogue. If you screwed it up, you'd have to drink the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Phantom Menace'' mania on the Internet is tame compared
with the mainstream media's handling of the movie, devotees say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense in the press is that (the film) is the second
coming,'' says Ira Mayer, publisher of the Entertainment Marketing
Letter. ``The truth is there is no next Beatles, there's no next
Elvis. There is just what there is.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, too high expectations may doom the film.
</P>
<P>
   But to devotees like Lou ``T-Bone'' Tambone, a Web master for
www.starwarz.com, that kind of talk is heresy.
</P>
<P>
   Tambone's credentials: He got married on May 25, 1997, the 20th
anniversary of the release of the first ``Star Wars'' film. Their
wedding cake was graced with Han Solo and Princess Leia figurines,
and they marched into their reception to the forceful strains of
the John Williams theme.
</P>
<P>
   He admits his fixation is unusual. ``But some guys think it's
their responsibility to inform the world about every little thing
that every Star Wars person does, like `Jake Lloyd (the 8-year-old
boy who plays young Darth Vader in the prequel) scratched his head
today,''' he says. ``OK, that's obsessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Obsession, though, is a word fanboys are used to hearing. Most
wear it like a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends laugh and make fun of me and say I'm too
obsessed,'' said Josh Burton of Boca Raton, whose ``Star Wars''
collection includes bed sheets, posters, collectible figures and
the working R2-D2 phone. He has about 20 Star Wars T-shirts, he
sells ``Star Wars'' comic books at the store where he works and
he's a member of the official fan club.
</P>
<P>
   And, etched into his back _ in Gaelic _ is a
shoulder-to-shoulder tattoo with the movie's catch phrase, ``May
The Force be with you.'' (Roughly translated, it's An Bhru Leat.
It's a symbolic nod to his other passion: Celtic history.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's like when someone has a really big hobby,'' he says.
``If it was a boat or something like that, no one would say
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Internet fan groups, these folks are not
competitive, choosing to share their discoveries and observations
with fellow fanboys. And for the most part, Lucasfilms hasn't
struck back at the fans for posting images and inside information
on the Web. (The production company has issued a few
cease-and-desist orders to sites that sell ``Star Wars''
memorabilia.)
</P>
<P>
   There is a peaceful, almost childlike quality about the online
community, which is what the whole thing is really all about,
fanboys say. It's about escape, entering a universe where good
conquers evil and the heroes get the best costumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid, you want to do all that stuff,'' Joseph Helmsorig
said. ``You want to save the world and the universe and get the
girl.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tambone cuts to the chase. ``When I was 7, my parents were
going to get divorced,'' he recalls wistfully, his voice taking on
the timbre of Princess Leia in the 1977 classic. ```Star Wars' was
out in full force, and it became a safe place, a hideaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew attached to it. It distracted me from the real world.''

<P>
   The signing of income tax returns, an American ritual in its
86th year, is being swept into the dustbin of history.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing those traditional John Hancocks with digital
signatures will ease the electronic filing of returns, but the
method chosen by the IRS will also mean continuing costs for
taxpayers. That is because they must still go through software
vendors and electronic filing agents to send their returns to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, anyone who filed a return electronically also had to
mail in a signed paper form, or jurat, the statement that makes an
individual who files a false return liable for prosecution for
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has directed the IRS to move 80 percent of taxpayers to
electronic filing by 2007, up from 20 percent now, because it will
be cheaper, faster and far less prone to errors. The IRS estimated
that its cost to process an electronic Form 1040 was $5 last year,
compared with $3.85 for a paper return. But once most people move
to electronic filing, the IRS figures, costs should fall to less
than $2 a return, in 1996 dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The cumbersome system for obtaining signatures, however, is seen
as a big obstacle toward meeting the government's 80 percent goal.
Though the number of electronic returns grew by more than 5 million
last year, to 24.8 million, the growth rate must nearly double to
meet the objective.
</P>
<P>
   Because of concerns about computer security, individuals cannot
file electronic returns directly with the IRS. Instead, the IRS has
licensed about 93,000 accounting firms, enrolled agents and other
preparers as their intermediaries. If a taxpayer files a return
over the Internet through vendors like Turbotax, Securetax,
Taxlogic or Taxact, the return first goes to the software company,
which is licensed as an ``electronic return originator.'' The
originators, which have access to IRS computers, make sure the
return meets IRS protocols and, typically, charge fees for the
services.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in a shift in strategy, the IRS has offered to drop
the signature-form requirement for a big group of taxpayers _ 8
million people whose returns indicated that they prepared their own
1997 tax returns by using computer software. A year ago, most of
those taxpayers printed out and mailed in their returns, but nearly
1 million chose electronic filing.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting those filers is a key to rapid growth in electronic
filing, said Robert Barr, the IRS's assistant commissioner for
electronic tax administration, who previously was an executive at
Intuit, maker of Turbotax.
</P>
<P>
   The 8 million taxpayers were sent postcards containing
electronic customer numbers, much like the personal identification
numbers on bank cards. Those numbers can be used to file a return
electronically without having to submit the separate signature form
or mail-in W-2s (but keep them in case of an audit).
</P>
<P>
   Barr said that if taxpayers did not receive or keep their
postcards, they could not get new customer numbers for this year.
But there are two other options.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is allowing 8,100 tax preparers to let their customers
select their own four-digit codes, which can be used instead of a
traditional signatures, Barr said. The IRS does not publish a list
of those preparers, so taxpayers choosing that option will have to
shop around.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, since 1996, taxpayers have been able to use
Telefile, which uses touch-tone phone technology for filing Form
1040EZ, a simplified form for people who make less than $50,000. In
lieu of the signature form, EZ filers can use a code found on tax
materials the IRS mailed to them at the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the IRS focused its electronic-filing strategy
on lower-income taxpayers, who commonly have more money withheld
from their paychecks than is required and then collect big refund
checks. That strategy created a perception problem for electronic
filing, especially among accountants who work with wealthier
clients; many perceived the electronic system as not designed for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Krokus, an accountant in Norwalk, Conn., saw the problem
at a recent tax seminar for fellow accountants whose clientele are
middle- to upper-income taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked how many people in the room filed their clients'
returns electronically, and not one hand out of more than a hundred
went up,'' Krokus said. ``I explained that I have used electronic
filing exclusively since it was first available in Connecticut in
1989, and that it is good for clients because it reduces the chance
that a government clerk will make a keypunch mistake transferring
numbers from a paper return.''
</P>
<P>
   Solving the image problem could mean hundreds of millions of
dollars in annual savings for the IRS in processing and follow-up
work. ``You are far less likely to hear back from us if you use
electronic filing,'' Barr said.

SEARCH FOR UAL CHIEF SAID TO NARROW TO GM EXECUTIVE AND UAL'S
PRESIDENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ending one of the most closely watched executive searches, UAL
Corp., the parent of United Airlines, has narrowed its hunt for a
new chief executive to two candidates, according to two people
close to the search.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are James E. Goodwin, who has spent 32 years
at United and was promoted to president of UAL in September, and
Louis R. Hughes, a longtime executive at General Motors Corp., who
was passed over as heir apparent there in October.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the two men present UAL's board with a clear choice
between an airline industry insider and an outsider with a somewhat
similar background to UAL's 63-year-old current chief executive,
Gerald Greenwald, who plans to retire in July.
</P>
<P>
   The UAL board is expected to make its selection at its regularly
scheduled meeting on March 25, one of the people close to the
search said. But this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
warned that the decision could be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have been interviewed by the board's six-member search
committee, which will recommend one of them to the full board for
approval. Hughes was scheduled to meet Thursday with one member of
the committee who he had not yet met.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the search has been high because, in addition to
owning the world's largest airline, UAL is the country's largest
employee-owned company. Workers own about 55 percent of the
company's stock, with the unions representing United's pilots and
mechanics holding the lion's share. Each union also has a seat on
the UAL board and together they have veto power over who can be
named chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In September, John A. Edwardson, UAL's president and Greenwald's
chosen successor, resigned after the unions made clear they did not
want him to lead the company following Greenwald's retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever becomes chief executive will have to negotiate new
contracts with United's unions and decide whether to renew the
employee stock ownership program that expires next year. That
prospect in an industry with notoriously bitter labor relations was
said by some industry experts to limit the number of potential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Madison Walton, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots
Association, whose leader is on the board's search committee,
disputed that. ``We have had many outstanding candidates express
interest in leading our employee-owned company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Plews, a spokesman for UAL, declined to comment on the
search other than to say that that the board ``continues to
evaluate a number of outstanding candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Goodwin and Hughes as final candidates was
first reported Thursday on the Web site Business Week Online.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes has followed a career path similar to Greenwald, who
spent most of his career at the Chrysler Corp. before joining UAL
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, 50, joined GM in 1966 and rose to head its international
operations in 1992. Their $36 billion in revenues last year were
roughly twice those of UAL. Though he was a close personal friend
of John F. Smith Jr., GM's chairman, Hughes was edged out of the
running to succeed him six months ago when the company named his
rival, G. Richard Wagoner, Jr., president and placed both GM's
domestic and international operations under his supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Because he spent most of his career outside Detroit, Hughes has
not been identified with GM's poor relations with the United
Automobile Workers, which has led to several costly strikes. Hughes
has also served on the boards of several European companies,
including Deutsche Bank AG and Saab Automobile AB, where labor
unions are also represented.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodwin, 54, has had a chance to impress the company's
unions since he was promoted to president at UAL six months ago.
Though not well known outside United, he has an encyclopedic
knowledge of its operations, having worked in virtually every
division over the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interaction with Jim Goodwin has been quite positive since
he has become president,'' Walton, the pilot spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people close to the search said that Goodwin emerged
only recently as a candidate. The other handful of people
considered were all from outside the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin C. Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, said that choosing Hughes might make the most sense because
it was unlikely that Goodwin would leave if he were passed over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a key labor practitioner like Goodwin to run the
airline as Inside and Hughes as Outside,'' he said. ``might be the
best situation of all.''

HELP FOR THE UNINSURED MAY REST IN TAX CODE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not since the demise five years ago of the Clinton
administration plan to overhaul the nation's health care system
have Americans without health insurance, now more than 43 million
people, received so much attention.
</P>
<P>
   With the post-impeachment Congress determined to demonstrate
interest in domestic policy, and with lobbyists of all stripes
trying to influence the health insurance debate, the
long-overlooked uninsured are suddenly ``hot.''
</P>
<P>
   The road to any enactment of legislation providing them coverage
will be complicated, with many Republicans focused on marketplace
solutions, and some Democrats on marketplace shortcomings. But
across much of the political spectrum, a bit of consensus on an
approach is developing.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than start a whole new government insurance program or
expand the old ones _ Medicaid and the already overburdened
Medicare _ Republican leaders, a number of Democrats and an array
of powerful interest groups are looking for solutions in the tax
system. Proposals receiving serious consideration on Capitol Hill
would give millions of working families, which account for the bulk
of the uninsured, tax breaks or vouchers to buy health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, Republicans and Democrats alike have
introduced at least six bills that would let the nation's three
million self-employed workers immediately deduct the full cost of
insurance. The bills would speed a phase-in that allows the
self-employed to deduct 45 percent of premiums this year, a break
that under current tax law escalates very gradually and does not
reach 100 percent deduction until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those measures, others now pending would offer
tax credits (distinct from a deduction in that they are subtracted
from the tax bill itself, rather than just from the income on which
the tax is based). For instance, Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the
House majority leader, plans to introduce legislation this spring
to give uninsured workers and their families an annual tax credit
tentatively set at $800 per adult and $400 per child, to a maximum
of $2,400, to buy insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Armey bill, the credits would even be ``refundable''
to the poorest workers, who earn too little to pay much or, often,
any income tax. With a refundable credit, an individual worker
whose tax would ordinarily be $500, for instance, would keep that
amount and be sent $300 more by the government, giving him $800 to
pay for all or a part of his annual premium.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats who agree with Armey on little else are
prepared to go along with credits, hopeful that by extending
coverage to more people, they can move the nation a step closer to
the goal of universal coverage that eluded President Clinton in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Rep. Pete Stark of California, the ranking
Democrat on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, are
skeptical that the proposals now under consideration offer
meaningful help. Armey's maximum credit of $2,400, for instance,
would pay less than half the annual premium that insurers require
of many families.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of the proposals, there is little
disagreement that the issue's time has come. ``It's a very hot
topic right now,'' said Eugene Steurele, a tax policy expert at the
Urban Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the impetus to deal now with the problem stems from
projections of more than a decade of federal budget surpluses
ahead. ``Why not return some of it in a way that also helps
alleviate the crisis of the uninsured?'' Armey wrote to colleagues
in January.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing in with tax-break ideas of their own are a score of
prominent lobbying groups and policy research organizations,
running the gamut from the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute
and the National Center for Policy Analysis on the right to the
Progressive Policy Institute, a group of moderate Democrats.
Similarly, the American Medical Association (an emphatic proponent
of strictly regulating health maintenance organizations) and the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce (an emphatic opponent) joined last month
to promote the idea of tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   The concepts under discussion would be in keeping with a
longtime federal practice of using the tax code as an instrument of
social policy. A provision in Clinton's current budget proposal,
for instance, offers $1,000 tax credits to help pay for long-term
care.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics like Stark insist that the uninsured poor would
find the health care credits too small to be of much appeal _ to
say nothing of deductions, which favor people in high tax brackets
and are all but meaningless to those who earn so little that they
pay virtually no income tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're open to it,'' Chris Jennings, a White House health
policy official, said of the tax credit notion, but ``we have not
found the model'' that could be simply and fairly administered and
be generous enough to reach large numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Congressional critics of the Armey approach are perhaps most
heatedly opposed to a Republican idea that would ultimately offer
tax credits to all, so that they could do their own health
insurance shopping. Stark says employers would use the availability
of those credits as a rationale to stop providing benefits, whichin
many cases would be more generous than those that could be bought
with the credits. ``Tell me,'' he said, ``why every employer
wouldn't drop health insurance in a New York minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Democrats who have little argument with ``targeted''
credits, aimed specifically at the poor, see broader credits that
might undercut the employer-based insurance system as a danger that
would leave workers vulnerable to the vagaries of the marketplace
free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, Henry J. Aaron, senior fellow and budget
economist at the Brookings Institution, finds little promise in
using the tax system to steer consumers into the marketplace for
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the Zeitgeist,'' Aaron said of the emerging
consensus. ``We are into market solutions _ vouchers in education,
privatizing Social Security. Not to be talking about tax credits
for health care'' would seem like ``a gross omission.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think it's got any future,'' he said, adding that
unless Congress created a big regulatory apparatus like the one
envisioned in the long-dead Clinton plan, insurers and HMOs would
pick and choose among consumers, setting premiums low to attract
the young and healthy and prohibitively high for older and sicker
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for the Senate Democratic leader,
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, agreed that ``a lot of things have to
be fixed in the individual market'' before a tax-break approach
could be enacted. She said she did not see tax credits or vouchers
``as something that has a lot of traction this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bills keep coming, and their details vary widely.
Rep. Jim McDermott of Washington, a doctor who is a Democratic
member of the federal commission on the future of Medicare, would
give tax credits to cover 30 percent of the insurance premiums of
individuals with incomes up to $25,000 and families with incomes up
to $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., has drafted a bill that would
allow a deduction of up to $2,000 to each working taxpayer who buys
health insurance privately.
</P>
<P>
   At the extreme is the legislation planned by Rep. Bill Thomas of
California, chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on
Health. He says he will offer a bill this year to jettison the
entire employer-based insurance system, which covers close to
two-thirds of all workers. Thomas' goal is shared by Armey, who
acknowledges that as a political matter, it is unattainable any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, Thomas complains, Congress gives tax
breaks to businesses that provide insurance benefits to their
workers, and the government allows the businesses to pass the
breaks on to their employees. (That is, the employees are not taxed
on the benefits.)
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, companies pay a worker's entire premium; more
often they pay 60 to 80 percent of it. But more than 18 percent of
all workers, 24.6 million of them, went without health insurance in
1997, according to the nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research
Institute. And about half of those 24.6 million earned less than
$30,000, leaving few with enough to buy insurance on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we provide 100 percent coverage for some workers,''
Thomas said, ``when others have zero? That's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   So he would take away the business tax break and build a new
system based on tax breaks to individuals, who would buy their own
insurance. ``I want to change the whole system,'' he said. ``You
have to go back to square one and rethink it.''

 Visa Takes Steps to Keep Big Customers Happy  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Visa's recent reorganization is aimed at making sure more of its
increasingly restive large-bank members don't jump ship, according
to credit card industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   Visa USA announced Wednesday that it has created a new position
overseeing relations with members and merchants, reporting to chief
executive Carl Pascarella. It hired Bond Isaacson, a 41-year-old
IBM executive, to fill it.
</P>
<P>
   The move was announced the same day Citigroup, the
second-largest issuer of Visa cards, said one of its executives
will join the board of MasterCard and that the bank is shifting
most of its credit card business to that association.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson's appointment was the key move in a series of steps the
Foster City association has taken to shore up relations with the
giant banks that control more and more of its business, industry
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that they're taking their large customers very
seriously and don't want any more defections,'' said Anita
Boomstein, a New York lawyer specializing in credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry's merger wave has created giant
institutions that dominate the credit card business, including
Chicago's Banc One, New York's Chase Manhattan and North Carolina's
BankAmerica. Their large market share puts them in position to make
unprecedented demands on Visa and MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, for example, demanded that Visa put its logo on the
back of credit cards so that the bank could use the front to
showcase its own brand. Visa agreed to move its logo but balked at
other Citigroup demands, prompting the bank to jump to MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson is taking a job that the association eliminated as a
separate function several years ago. Now that function has taken on
new importance as the association's biggest members throw their
weight around.
</P>
<P>
   Visa's new executive will be based in Charlotte, N.C.,
headquarters for BankAmerica. He currently heads IBM's BankAmerica
sales team.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time the association has had such a senior
executive based away from the home office, evidence of how
important Visa considers its relationship with BankAmerica,
industry watchers said.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Visa said it chose to base Isaacson in Charlotte
because most of its members are in the East.
</P>
<P>
   William Stewart, the systems chief who before the reorganization
also headed member relations, said in an interview that Isaacson
brings ``the sales skills we need to go after the huge banks.''
Isaacson, he noted, ``is used to calling on very large customers.``
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of VISA12 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  At the same time, Stewart insisted Visa's reorganization isn't a
reaction to the way big banks are stepping up their demands.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson said he ``is not being hired to soothe the feelings of
big banks.'' And Visa isn't reorganizing because of Citicorp's
defection, Stewart said, noting Isaacson was hired after a yearlong
search.
</P>
<P>
   As for Citigroup's defection, Visa ``is not agitated,'' Stewart
said. ``We gain customers and lose customers all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Visa's effort to put on a brave face, the association
was rattled by Citigroup's move and will bend over backwards to
keep big banks happy, industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly want to work more closely with their key
players,'' said Robert McKinley, chief executive of CardWeb.com, an
Internet service tracking the credit card industry.

 AOL Will Open Faster Pipeline to Internet  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Californians who use America Online will soon have a faster way to
access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 online service provider is teaming up with SBC
Communications Inc., parent of Pacific Bell, to offer high-speed
Internet access via customers' existing telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5 million Pac Bell customers will have access to the
high-speed service by the end of the year, according to SBC and AOL
officials.
</P>
<P>
   AOL will use digital subscriber line technology, or DSL, to give
customers faster access. DSL is about 50 times faster than
traditional dial-up modems.
</P>
<P>
   The service, when it's rolled out this fall, is expected to cost
$20 per month on top of AOL's $20 per month fee for basic service.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell also offers its own branded DSL service via Pac Bell
Internet for about $40 per month.
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of DSL is that its users can remain on the Internet
without tying up their phone line. Also, they can access the
Internet as soon as they turn on their computers, without having to
wait for the modem to dial up the Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers will be able to upgrade their existing AOL service
and keep their e-mail addresses but get the benefits of DSL,'' said
Steve Dimmitt, Pac Bell's vice president of consumer marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is similar to one AOL signed with New York's Bell
Atlantic Corp. in January. By partnering with both Bell Atlantic
and SBC, AOL can now provide DSL service to 53 percent of its
customers, said AOL spokesman Tom Ziemba.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers said the deal with SBC is an important step
for AOL of Dulles, Va., which needs to give its customers more
bandwidth, or a faster pipeline to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With competition from cable modem providers such as AtHome
Corp., AOL needs to provide DSL and other advanced services to
retain customers, said Blaik Kirby, who follows the industry for
Renaissance Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is a good thing for AOL in the sense that it gives
them a migration path for their existing customers to a higher
speed alternative,'' Kirby said. It's also important for SBC, he
said, because it makes the company a serious player in the DSL
market.
</P>
<P>
   While AOL wants to offer DSL, the company is continuing to look
at additional broadband services, such as fiber-optic cable and
satellites, Ziemba said .
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't decided that DSL is the only way to go,'' Ziemba
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few drawbacks to DSL.

   DSL is faster than a traditional modem but still slower than
cable modems, which access the Internet about 50 times faster. At
$40 per month, DSL is about the same price as cable-modem service,
which costs $40 to $50 per month.

 &LR;  The service is also not available everywhere. More than 50
percent of Pac Bell customers should have access to DSL by the end
of the year. Customers have to be a certain distance from a Pac
Bell central switching office to get DSL service. Ziemba said AOL
customers who want the service should talk with Pac Bell to see if
their homes are capable of getting the technology. About 5 million
homes in California can get DSL service, according to Pac Bell.

   GONZALES, La. _ In the seventh row of the New St. John
Fellowship Baptist Church, on the floor next to a viscous pool of
blood the full width of the pew, a Bible lay face up Thursday,
opened to a chapter of John that was spattered in red.
</P>
<P>
   Stained hymn books and notebooks were everywhere, diapers and
slippers and baby bottles, the frenzied residue of a moment of
chaos that occurred when a man kicked open the church doors during
a Wednesday night Bible class and started shooting, killing three
people and wounding four, two critically.
</P>
<P>
   Shon Miller, a 22-year-old homeless man, was charged by Gonzales
police with four counts of first-degree murder and three counts of
attempted murder. Among the dead were his estranged wife, Carla,
25, and their son, Shon Jr., 2, who had cried out to him in the
instant before the shooting. Police officials said that before
bursting into the church with his 9mm semiautomatic pistol, Miller
had fatally shot his mother-in-law, Mildred Vessel, 53, in a van
outside her home nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was shot in the back in a standoff with the Ascension
Parish sheriff's officers and local police after the church
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Any killing in this town of 7,000 people, 20 miles southeast of
Baton Rouge and so unassuming that no one can remember the last
major news story here, would shake the foundations of the social
structure. But to have a massacre in a simple white-brick Baptist
church, in the middle of evening Bible class, in a sanctuary
half-filled with children, was unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a small community _ stuff of this nature doesn't
happen in our quiet little town,'' said Darryl Hambrick, who went
to school with Mrs. Miller and had been her neighbor for years.
``When you go to church for serenity and prayer and for some kind
of peace in your life, and then you go there and something tragic
like this happens, it's sad that we live in a country like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Landry, the Gonzales police chief, said he could not
remember a crime so bloody and disturbing here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safest place in the world I always thought was a church,
and now that sanctuary has been broken,'' Landry told reporters.
``We'll all be a long time getting over this.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings apparently stemmed from the stormy relationship
Miller had with his wife for the last two years, friends and family
members said.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrick said Miller burned the family's trailer two years ago
and slashed his wife's tires. He was arrested, accused of beating
her and knocking her tooth out in 1997, sheriff's officials said.
Last August, Mrs. Miller received a restraining order prohibiting
him from having contact with her, and he was jailed for 90 days
after violating it, officials said. He lived on the streets after
getting out of jail late last year, and a few weeks ago, Mrs.
Miller told him she was filing for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told her from the beginning that he wasn't the right one,''
said Timothy Vessel, Mrs. Miller's brother. Vessel's wife,
Lequatta, described Miller as ``crazy'' and ``violent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they were getting a divorce,'' Mrs. Vessel said.
``He just couldn't take the pressure, so I guess he felt he had to,
you know, he had to kill her since he couldn't have her.''
</P>
<P>
   Other family members said that a few months ago, Miller was
dismissed from his job as a welder at an automotive machine shop
here because of repeated public arguments with his wife, and they
suggested that he blamed her for losing his job.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Miller apparently knew his wife and son
were going to Wednesday night Bible class at the church. Jeffrey
Wiley, the sheriff of Ascension Parish, and family members said
that before the class, Miller asked two friends to drive him to the
small wood-frame house on Coontrap Road where his wife was staying.
She wasn't there, but her mother was, and he walked up to the van
in which she was sitting and shot her in the head, Wiley said.
</P>
<P>
   The two friends, who saw the shooting, tried to drive away, but
their car stalled, officials said. Miller then got back into the
car and ordered his friends at gunpoint to drive to the church. The
pastor, Clarence Stephens, said the two men ran into the church and
told him that Miller had just shot someone and was approaching with
a gun. But it was too late to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   He burst into the church, where about 100 adults and children
were studying the third chapter of the Book of John, and fired two
shots into the ceiling, ordering everyone to get down, Stephens
said. As his son shouted, ``Daddy, Daddy,'' Miller shot his wife,
Stephens and police officials said, then reloaded his gun and fired
more shots, killing his son and Vaniaro Jackson, 19, who was
sitting beside Mrs. Miller.
</P>
<P>
   As Miller ran from the church, police and sheriff's officers,
who had been summoned by Stephens, surrounded the church and
cornered Miller in a dilapidated woodshed nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Officers tried to negotiate with him for about an hour, but in
frustration, Wiley said, he ordered a sharpshooter to shoot the gun
out of Miller's hand. He said another officer tripped and
accidentally fired a shot into Miller's back.
</P>
<P>
   The shot paralyzed Miller from the waist down. He was taken to
Louisiana Medical Center in New Orleans, where he was listed in
stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Jackson, Vaniaro Jackson's mother, said he was in church
every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it happened in the streets or in the church house, it
happened, and we can't change that,'' she said. But, added her
husband, William Jackson, ``it puts a big question in your head.''

 Chevron Unit Moving Base To Houston  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Chevron Chemical, a division of Chevron Corp., told its employees
yesterday that it will move its headquarters to Houston from San
Ramon and eliminate 300 positions over the next year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring, which will reduce costs by $76 million, is
part of an effort to cut expenses at the company by $500 million
this year, Chevron spokesman Mike Libbey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are hard decisions to make but must be done if we are to
remain competitive during this severe petrochemicals downturn and
extended period of low energy prices,'' said Chevron Chemical
President Darry Callahan in a memo to the staff that was obtained
by The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surplus employees will be notified over the next few months
that their jobs will be eliminated,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Maran, an analyst with A.G. Edwards, said many petrochemical
producers are cutting back these days. Chevron, whose revenues
plummeted to $29.9 billion last year from $40.6 billion in 1997,
``is not atypical of the industry at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, corporations stepped up construction of
petrochemical facilities during a commodity boom. But even as
production increased, the Asian economic crisis and weakness in
other economies has caused slumping demand _ and declining prices,
said Maran.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company memo, the headquarters move will occur
by September, and jobs will be cut in both San Ramon and Houston.
Human resources and finance personnel are safe for now, but the
company is studying what to do with those departments, it added.
</P>
<P>
   Production facilities and foreign operations will not be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Libbey said it is not clear many people will be laid off because
much of the downsizing would be handled through retirement and
attrition. Workers will be offered incentives to retire early, and
some may be hired in other parts of the company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical division headquarters, which currently employs
about 200 people, is being moved from San Ramon to be near the bulk
of the unit's 5,200 staffers in Texas, Libbey said.
</P>
<P>
   Petrochemicals, such as benzene and styrene, are used to make
plastics for both consumer and industrial use. Historically they
have accounted for about 10 percent of revenues for San Francisco's
Chevron, although that level has fallen recently, said Libbey.

 Professionals seek new profile with cosmetic surgery  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
It's not unusual for middle-aged executives in today's youthful
economy to feel their careers need some sort of a lift.
</P>
<P>
   How about a face-lift?
</P>
<P>
   A small but growing number of older managers and professionals
are turning to cosmetic surgery as a way to keep pace with their
twentysomething colleagues and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Women make up the vast majority of cosmetic surgery patients,
accounting for about 85 percent of all procedures. But men are more
likely to cite career concerns as a reason for seeking surgery,
according to local doctors.
</P>
<P>
   For both genders, critics say, cosmetic surgery shouldn't be
taken lightly. Procedures can cost up to several thousand dollars
and, in some cases, can lead to life-threatening complications.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the drive for youth &LR;   &LR; often overpowers these
concerns, particular in Silicon Valley with its emphasis on
constant technological change and its legions of highly skilled
young workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fastest-growing segment of my practice is men in their
late 30s, 40s or early 50s,'' said Dr. Michael Rabkin, a San
Francisco ophthalmologist who performs a large number of laser
eyelid surgeries. ``Their main concern is the competitive business
environment today. They feel that if they're perceived as looking
old or fatigued, they'll be at a disadvantage in the workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 men underwent liposuction in 1997 _ triple the
number that did so in 1992, according to a conservative estimate by
the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of FACELIFT () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The number of men getting eyelid surgery rose from about 8,900 to
14,000. The number getting face-lifts rose from about 2,800 to
5,100.
</P>
<P>
   Some men _ even men under 50 _ single out career concerns as the
main reason they're seeking surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Greenberg, a San Francisco plastic surgeon, performed
a face-lift and liposuction last month on a 45-year-old salesman
who said his boss was favoring his younger colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he felt very productive, he feared he was starting
to be treated as a senior citizen,'' Greenberg said. ``He wanted to
have a facial rejuvenation, so he could look as young as he
feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Affatato, a 61-year-old military adviser to the Saudi
government, had a complete face-lift last year primarily to make a
youthful impression on his Middle Eastern business contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that if you're younger, you must have a lot on
the ball,'' said Affatato, who splits his time between Carmel and
Virginia. ``This is what the Bill Gateses and the Michael Dells of
the world have done. The moneymakers are no longer the
fiftysomethings of Wall Street; they're the young entrepreneurs who
buy stock online. That's why the young look is `in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other men turn to cosmetic surgery from a combination of
concerns about their careers and general self-image.
</P>
<P>
   One 60-year-old high-tech CEO had surgery on his eyelids and
throat last December because he felt a little out of place among
his young employees.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of FACELIFT () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``I don't think anyone looked at me as being an old man,'' said
the CEO, who asked to remain anonymous. ``It was more internal
pressure. I'm in a business interacting with 35- and 40-year-olds
all the time. I was sensitive to that. ... When I'm interacting
with people now, I feel better, because we look like
contemporaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Some career experts are appalled by the idea of cosmetic surgery
as a solution to age bias in the business world.
</P>
<P>
   They acknowledge that age discrimination is a problem for many
older workers: More than 15,000 people filed age bias complaints
with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year.
</P>
<P>
   But these critics call surgery a shallow and potentially
dangerous response.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetic surgery typically costs anywhere from several hundred
dollars to $5,000 per procedure. The cost is rarely covered by
insurance. And if done badly, cosmetic surgery can cause
complications such as infections that threaten patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are doing this out of fear of aging, but it's a
superficial approach,'' said Ann Eichhorn, executive director of
the LifePlan Center, a San Francisco nonprofit that helps people
over 45 with personal and career transitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were working with these people, I'd try to help them
value who they really are,'' Eichhorn said. ``It's a sad state of
affairs when we get to a point where people take such dire measures
and expense to change the way they appear to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cosmetic surgery patients would disagree with Eichhorn's
description of their decision as ``sad.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of FACELIFT () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  They say it's part of a strategy to actively manage their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sato, 54, is a manager at a large Bay Area company who
had eyelid surgery last year to make himself more marketable if he
goes into business as a consultant. When he worked as a consultant
in the past, Sato saw clients reject some of his associates who
looked old in favor of younger but less qualified people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say that our culture should value age and experience,
but people should also value themselves,'' Sato said. ``People get
caught up in feeling like victims. Taking proactive steps (like
surgery) can help you get over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Silicon Valley businessman who had anti-wrinkle
treatments with Botox and collagen described the procedures as just
one part of an overall effort to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going hog wild and dying my hair,'' said this man, a
51-year-old telecommunications consultant who asked to remain
anonymous. ``But I have a number of quite important presentations
to give in the next three months _ one here, one in Japan, one in
Ireland. I wanted to do everything I could to make them as
effective as possible. I'd be naive to think this is the crucial
difference. But it's one piece of the overall package.''

WORLDWIDE LAWS OF LIFE:
 FAILURE IS ONLY A DETOUR ON THE ROAD TO SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Sir John Templeton, the Tennessee-born billionaire and founder
of the Templeton funds, built his fortune on his legendary ability
to perceive value that others overlooked. In his column, he urges
us to recognize the value of spirituality in life.)

only a detour.'' -- Corrie Ten Boom)

</P>
<P>
   If success were easy, then it would not necessarily be true
success. Some of history's most successful people learned to cope
with failure as a natural offshoot of the experimental and creative
process and often learned more from their failures than their
successes.
</P>
<P>
   By taking the attitude that failure is merely a detour on the
way to our destination, hope can blossom into success.
</P>
<P>
   How can we best define success? Does it simply mean that there
was a task before us that we accomplished? If that is the case,
then we could call walking down the driveway and retrieving the
mail a success. Minor matters, regardless of how trivial, could be
defined as successes so long as they were completed. Yet, success
means so much more.
</P>
<P>
   Success comes when we face a challenge and struggle against odds
to succeed. Historically, success has often followed a series of
failures.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many of America's greatest heroes experienced their
share of failures. Abraham Lincoln suffered a staggering defeat in
the first election he ever entered, and was considered a poor and
bumbling speaker. Yet, he became one of our greatest presidents,
whose speeches are still regarded as masterpieces of political
persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   William Faulkner experienced a number of rejections as a young
writer by publishers who had no understanding of his innovative
narrative style, but despite repeated failures and impoverishments,
Faulkner went on to become one of the South's foremost novelists
and to win the Nobel Prize for literature.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Edison was another who struggled with failure.
Nevertheless, through hard work and the understanding that
``failure is only a detour,'' he invented the electric light bulb,
record players, and motion picture -- to name only some of his
inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Because learning is a process that may result in a failure of
one kind or another, failure can be essential to success. It is
important to study our failures, to learn from them, and then to
make a new attempt. Eventually this process can lead to success.
</P>
<P>
   However, if an individual gives up at the first failure, then
nothing has been learned, and no skill has been gained that can
improve our subsequent efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A person is seldom defeated by failure when he understands that
failure can be considered as part of a natural process leading to a
positive conclusion. He can then accept it as a mere detour and not
a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   Often success or failure, happiness or misery, in a situation
may be a matter of perspective. In her book ``The Hiding Place,''
Corrie Ten Boom described a discussion with her mother about Tante
Beb, the aunt who had lived with them for a number of years. Corrie
observed how unhappy Beb was, always complaining and comparing
their home to the ``Wallers,'' where she had been ``so happy'' as
their housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   But mother knew better. ``Corrie,'' she asked, ``Do you know
when she started praising the Wallers so highly? The day she left
them! As long as she was there, she had nothing but complaints. The
Wallers couldn't compare with the Van Hooks, where she had been
before. But at the Van Hooks, she'd actually been miserable.
Happiness isn't something that depends on our surroundings, Corrie.
It's something we make inside ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   If we want to succeed, we may consider blazing new trails rather
than going down the worn-out paths of former or accepted success.
Someone said that the difference between failure and success could
be doing a thing ``nearly'' right or ``exactly'' right.
</P>
<P>
   George Horace Lorimer offered, ``Because a fellow has failed
once or a dozen times, you don't set him down as a failure until
he's dead or loses his courage -- and that's the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Elbert Hubbard commented, ``The line between failure and success
is so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it!''
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Treasury,'' W. R. Beattie presents the idea that real
success can be enjoyed in the process of building-in the drafting
of the plans, laying the foundation, selecting the materials,
measuring the many parts, and then dove-tailing them together. He
felt a person's greatest joys often came from the anticipation of
each day's accomplishments and the satisfaction gained from a task
well done.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, consider a most important room in your ``house of
living'' -- the room of your mind. What you are can be dependent
upon what is in this room. You are -- first and foremost -- a
spiritual being, so the plan for your inner room should be
exquisite, comfortable, and satisfying. This place can represent a
sanctuary of loveliness and peace. Its furniture consists of your
thoughts. The walls must be sturdy in faith, with the colors
showing forth the beauty of strength and courage, joy and peace,
love and goodness, praise and thanksgiving, and positive,
confident, success.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, the light of wisdom must fully illuminate this
room, for it is in this inner room that you shape your world, and
it is here that you may fashion the self that you give to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   As Alexander Crummell, American minister and writer, said, ``All
real success springs from that inward might which we exert upon
society.''

MONEY BARRIER KEEPS EAST EUROPE OUT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: See also NATO and EUROPE-FARMS)  
(DW) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Now that Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are
joining the NATO alliance, perhaps the European Union might be less
afraid about letting them in too, President Vaclav Havel of the
Czech Republic observed during a recent swing through Western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curtain that came down 50 years ago was ripped away 10
years ago, but in certain respects, it still exists as a kind of
psychological barrier,'' he said recently. ``Admission into NATO is
a significant step, because we see that the West is not afraid of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the collapse of the Iron Curtain, the most
important barrier still separating the east of Europe from the more
fortunate west is money.
</P>
<P>
   While the Atlantic alliance, led by the United States, is
willing to see the first three formerly Communist countries as full
partners, the European Union is still years away from admitting any
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important reasons are the costs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the accession agreements they have worked out with
the alliance, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary together will
be assessed only about $65 million a year for NATO programs,
according to allied officials in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   But offsetting this, the alliance plans to put $150 million a
year for the next 10 years into helping the three countries improve
military airfields, communications networks and air defenses they
had built as members of the Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
   Poland plans to raise its military budget to $3.3 billion this
year, half a billion more than in 1997, while the Czech Republic
and Hungary plan to spend $1.2 billion and $745 million in 1999,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   All three new members might well have been tempted to spend more
on their militaries if they were not entering the collective
security of NATO, supporters of expansion say. Skeptics say that
NATO's cost estimates are much too low.
</P>
<P>
   But joining NATO looks almost easy compared with the costs and
the complexities of joining the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Letting poorer countries from Eastern Europe join the European
Union will cost both new and old members of that organization
money, though hardly as much as the United States spent after World
War II in the Marshall Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West spent a lot on armament,'' Gyorgy Konrad, a Hungarian
writer, lamented at a recent gathering of central European and
western policy makers and intellectuals in Berlin. ``It appears not
to want to spend a lot on solidarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, starting with Germany, the cry from the rich but
unemployment-plagued European countries is to spend less, not more,
on items like farm programs, which cost Europe nearly $44 billion
last year, 45 percent of the total European Union budget.
</P>
<P>
   After wrangling all winter between Germany and France, European
agriculture ministers finally agreed Thursday, after negotiating
all night, to cut price supports for grain, beef and dairy products
by 15 to 20 percent over the next few years. But experts believe
more changes are necessary before countries like Poland, with tens
of thousands of small farmers, join the system.
</P>
<P>
   The agricultural policy was set up at the end of the 1950s, when
German leaders still felt guilty about what the Nazis had done to
France. The goal was to keep French farmers, then far more numerous
than they are now, prosperous while German industry got free access
to French and other European markets.
</P>
<P>
   But Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who was not even alive during
World War II, questions why Germany pays more in farm support
programs than it receives. Now, like many of his generation, he
does not see why Germany should be asked to foot more than its
share of the European bill.
</P>
<P>
   Spain, Portugal and Italy are fighting proposed cuts in European
regional infrastructure investment programs. Almost all countries
are fighting changes in cumbersome decision-making procedures that,
with 15 member states, often make European Union meetings last all
night.
</P>
<P>
   Without change, European leaders keep saying, new members could
bring only total gridlock or bankruptcy. But change will surely
take a few more all-night meetings like a special European summit
conference planned later this month in Berlin, the third such
meeting since last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Hans van den Broek, the European commissioner for foreign
affairs, said that the European Union was spending $1.6 billion a
year helping prospective new members get ready. ``The candidates
have to be able to adopt and, more importantly, implement some
80,000 pages of laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All this will take time, he says, time the formerly Communist
countries also need to make sure their economies are not
overwhelmed and crushed by more powerful Western ones when they
join the European Union and trade barriers come down.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, even Havel's target of 2002 for membership for the
Czech Republic looks optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``European leaders spent more time at their summit in Vienna in
December talking about ways to postpone abolishing duty-free shops
next year than they did about the prospect of admitting countries
from Eastern Europe,'' said the French philosopher Andre
Glucksmann. ``I think we have wasted 10 years.''

 FIGHTING RJR, ICAHN DEMANDS THAT IT SPIN OFF NABISCO STAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two days after RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. announced that it was
splitting up its food and tobacco businesses, its biggest investor,
Carl C. Icahn, said Thursday that he was not happy with the plan
and would wage a proxy fight to get the company to create a
separate entity from its stake in Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn's decision came one day ahead of a deadline Friday for
filing an alternate slate of directors for RJR Nabisco two months
in advance of the company's annual meeting. In a telephone
interview, he said the board that he had assembled would include
himself. He refused to name the other members but was clear about
their agenda. ``It's going to be a board that will unquestionably
do the spinoff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, RJR said it would get out of the tobacco business by
selling its international tobacco business to Japan Tobacco for $8
billion and spinning off its domestic tobacco operations. Under the
plan, RJR's only asset would be the 80.6 percent of Nabisco that it
owns.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement Thursday afternoon, Icahn, who recently
acquired about 7.7 percent of RJR's shares, said he thought
shareholders would benefit more if the company spun off Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   Steven F. Goldstone, the chairman and chief executive of RJR
Nabisco, said in a statement that Icahn's idea would not work. ``If
I thought it was practical, I would have done it myself,'' he said.
``But a Nabisco spinoff can't get done, and we are going to do what
can actually get done.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the liability from lawsuits over smoking.
</P>
<P>
   RJR management has said that the company could not spin off
Nabisco without incurring more problems from critics who would
accuse it of a so-called fraudulent transfer of assets, stripping
away holdings that might otherwise be used to pay claims in
tobacco-related litigation. Experts say the company's new structure
means that plaintiffs could turn to the holding company to collect
their claims, should the assets of the tobacco company, to be
called R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, run out.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn said he and his lawyers disagreed. Jay Mayesh, a partner
in the law firm Stroock &AMP; Stroock &AMP; Lavan, who is advising Icahn,
said, ``There's a big difference between talking about a fraudulent
transfer and proving it.''
</P>
<P>
   RJR shares have been trading well below the price of Nabisco
shares that are held by the public. Thursday, RJR closed unchanged
at $30 a share, while Nabisco closed at $42.1875. Marginal movement
in RJR's share price since Tuesday was obviously a factor in
Icahn's decision to press ahead with his proxy fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Steve Goldstone I think you did the right thing in
selling international and you moved to enhance value,'' Icahn said,
``but if the stock went up on the news, I wouldn't win this proxy
fight and it would be stupid to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Wall Street had backed away from RJR stock in
recent days because of concern that his huge stake was about to be
sold, Icahn said such fears were misguided. ``I'm not going to sell
my stock until after the meeting, that's for sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders will have to vote for either management's proposal
or Icahn's at the RJR annual meeting on May 12 in Winston-Salem,
N.C.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Continued worries about the effect of tobacco-related litigation
have kept many investors away from companies like RJR.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn said that if his plan was adopted, there would be no more
such ``tobacco taint.'' Indeed, he said he thought the price of
Nabisco would rise significantly over all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be no discount,'' he said. ``You'd go to the kinds
of multiples you see at other food companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Icahn has tried repeatedly to get the management of RJR to spin
off the food business, especially since a leveraged buyout in the
late 1980s left the company with a huge debt.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer involved in tobacco litigation said that the point of
Icahn's plan seemed to be to avoid further liability on smoking
claims but that the move itself would probably stir lawsuits of
another kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do it Icahn's way, I am sure there would be people to
challenge it,'' said Joe Rice, a lawyer in Charleston, S.C., who
represents 25 of the state attorneys general who settled claims
against cigarette companies for $206 billion last year. ``The sole
purpose of the spinoff is to free it from tobacco liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Black, a tobacco analyst for Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co., said
he agreed with Icahn's proposal because it would remove the risk of
liability from the Nabisco shares. At the same time, he added:
``He's got an uphill battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Icahn said he was hoping to keep the proxy fight focused on the
single issue of which entity to spin off. ``I'm not here to say
that Steve Goldstone is a bad guy,'' he said. ``I hope it doesn't
elevate to anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Goldstone offered some saber-rattling of his
own. ``My goal is to complete the sale of Reynolds International
and the spinoff of Reynolds Tobacco promptly after our annual
meeting on May 12th,'' he said. ``I want to assure our shareholders
that I won't permit our company to get diverted from that critical
objective by playing public proxy games.''

CLINTON AND LATIN LEADERS TURN TO IMMIGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTIGUA, Guatemala _ President Clinton and a group of Central
American leaders declared Thursday that they would work among
themselves and with the United States to reach ``humane and
permanent solutions'' to the problems of illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration was issued at a one-day meeting here that
focused on reconstruction after a devastating autumn hurricane,
development, trade and immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also promised to accelerate efforts to assist one
another in the economic and political transformation of the region
after decades of strife and catastrophic natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, at the end of a four-day visit by Clinton to the
subcontinent, brought together Presidents Arnoldo Aleman of
Nicaragua, Alvaro Arzu of Guatemala, Armando Calderon Sol of El
Salvador, Leonel Fernandez Reyna of the Dominican Republic, Carlos
Roberto Flores of Honduras and Miguel Angel Rodriguez Echeverria of
Costa Rica, as well as Prime Minister Said Wilbert Musa of Belize. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They met at the Casa Santo Domingo, a hotel built around the
ruins of a church and monastery built by Dominicans in the 16th
century and largely destroyed by earthquakes in 1717 and 1773. This
picturesque colonial town, in a valley formed by three volcanoes,
was the capital of all of Central America until the 18th century. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the opening of the session, Clinton noted that he was the
first American president to visit Guatemala since Lyndon B. Johnson
stopped briefly at the Guatemala City airport in the '60s. ``This
visit is long overdue,'' Clinton said. ``More importantly, this
moment in history is long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration announced four small initiatives to foster
growth and reconciliation. The administration will provide $25
million to bolster the Guatemalan peace accord of 1996, including
money for schools, small-business development, courts and local
governments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The administration also plans to grant $25 million for
environmental protection throughout the region, $11 million for
disaster response and $8.2 million to eliminate child labor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was marred by Clinton's inability to deliver a much
larger package of hurricane relief, totaling $956 million, that has
been held up by a dispute with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Central American leaders and a few protesters in El Salvador and
Guatemala complained that U.S. immigration policy discriminated
against some political refugees from the region.
</P>
<P>
   Calderon Sol told Clinton on Wednesday that he did not feel that
U.S. policy was justified, because refugees from El Salvador and
Guatemala did not have the same rights to settle in the United
States as those from Cuba and Nicaragua. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States is preparing to deport 1,000 Salvadorans who
fled the devastation of Hurricane Mitch, while Washington seeks a
way to let El Salvadoran political refugees remain in the United
States.

UTAH EXCEEDS EARLY FORECAST BY MAJERUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ When the Utah basketball team arrived here
Wednesday, coach Rick Majerus promptly did the obvious thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the players out to eat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Majerus, whose success as a coach is matched only by his
legendary accomplishments in various buffet lines, also noted that,
``It wasn't really a place I would have picked myself, but it was
instructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they can all say they've eaten alligator.''
</P>
<P>
   These Utes (27-4) can also say they've made the NCAA Tournament,
a notion that once seemed about as likely as the idea that they
would be dining on gator in the French Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After last year's team lost to Kentucky in the NCAA championship
game, Majerus gazed into the future and designated 1998-99 a
``rebuilding year.'' Actually, it's turned out fairly well.
</P>
<P>
   Utah will open play in the Midwest Region against Arkansas State
(18-11) at 11:30 a.m. today (KTVT/Channel 11) at the Superdome,
coming in as the second seed and riding a 22-game winning streak,
having finished the regular season ranked sixth in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon's second game will feature Washington (17-11)
against Miami of Ohio (22-7). Kansas (22-9) will face Evansville
(23-9) at 6:50 p.m., after which third seed Kentucky (25-8) will
match up against New Mexico State (23-9).
</P>
<P>
   ``We began the season relatively young and inexperienced,'' said
Majerus, ``although some early notions of our strength may have
been a little harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``My original assessment was based not so much on losing Michael
Doleac off last year's team as it was on the fact that three of our
best players went off on missions for the \RMormon\S church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one kid who was a real gun, but he's now riding his
bike through Ecuador, proselytizing for the church. We have other
team members in Mexico City and Houston. We may be pretty good when
they come back.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as Arkansas State coach Dickey Nutt is concerned, the
Utes look pretty good right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, for starters, they have the best coach in the country,
and maybe the best point guard in the country,'' Nutt said. ``Here
we are, in the tournament for the first time ever, living our dream
... and we draw Utah.''
</P>
<P>
   The point guard in question is Andre Miller, the Western
Athletic Conference Player of the Year and a man who is not
surprised at success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it a surprise that we've had this kind of
season,'' he said. ``In the past few years we've had teams that had
high-profile stars like Doleac and Keith Van Horn _ and maybe we
don't have that this year. But this is a team that does a lot of
things well.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah has not lost since Dec. 12, and Majerus credits much of the
growth to a killer road trip early in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a 15,000-mile round trip
\RHawaii-Chicago-California-Texas\S where we were on the road for
22 of 26 days,'' he said. ``We learned a lot about each other, and
when it was over we were a different team.'' \Ntagtop:Whit Canning,

SYRACUSE ENDS A DISAPPOINTING SEASON WITH LOSS TO OKLAHOMA STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BARRY JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The quality of Syracuse's season was reflected in
its seeding in the NCAA tournament: No. 8, the lowest of Coach Jim
Boeheim's 23-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen were inconsistent, failing to put together more
than two consecutive victories since the start of the season.
Despite one of the nation's better defenses, Syracuse lost five of
its last 10 games entering the South Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Oklahoma State ended those struggles, shrugging off
Syracuse's only serious threat to pull away to a 69-61 victory in
the opening round before a crowd of 27,184 in the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the case all year,'' Ryan Blackwell, a Syracuse
junior, said. ``We have the players, but we just don't put our
minds to it and go out and do what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, ninth-seeded Oklahoma State (23-10), an at-large
entrant from the Big 12, will face top-seeded Auburn, an 80-41
winner Thursday over No. 16 Winthrop.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen (21-12) trailed Oklahoma State from the outset, as
the game fell into a frustrating pattern for Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Big East club kept the Cowboys from building a
substantial lead, for more than 29 minutes the Orangemen could not
pull closer than three points. That is because Syracuse failed to
contain Oklahoma State's outside shooters, who made 8 of 18 shots
from 3-point range, many when the Orangemen mixed up their
defensive looks by going to a man-to-man alignment.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Adrian Peterson, who finished with 21 points, led Oklahoma
State's barrage by hitting 5-of-8 3-point attempts. The
6-foot-4-inch senior also had six offensive rebounds, all in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   When Syracuse employed its 2-3 zone, Cowboy playmaker Doug
Gottlieb repeatedly found open teammates, recording 11 assists
without taking a shot. His feeds helped forward Desmond Mason to a
28-point performance, his best showing in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Mason and Peterson scored all but two of Oklahoma State's points
as it led, 33-30, at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The game's single tie came on a baseline jumper by Damone Brown
with 2 minutes 51 seconds remaining. That was the closest Syracuse
had come since the game was about seven minutes old and Jason
Hart's 3-pointer had cut the Oklahoma State lead to 9-8. But 27
seconds after Syracuse caught up, Joe Adkins, a junior guard, made
his only shot of the game, a 3-pointer that pushed the Cowboys
ahead, 60-57.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse responded with a jumper from Blackwell with 1:59 left,
cutting the edge to 60-59. That would be as close as the Orangemen
came as the reserve forward Brian Montonati scored consecutive
baskets, sparking a 9-2 run to close the game for Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   Etan Thomas, showing no signs of the hand injury he sustained in
the Big East tournament, finished with 21 points for Syracuse. Hart
had 17.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was only the third in the opening round for a Boeheim
team in 19 NCAA appearances.
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN 80, WINTHROP 41
</P>
<P>
   Auburn (28-3) held Winthrop to the lowest point total in NCAA
play since 1996, when Mississippi State beat Princeton, 63-41, in
this same arena.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied, 13-13, midway through the first half when the
Tigers, winner of the Southeastern Conference, hit their stride.
They finished the half with a 24-5 rush, forcing nine turnovers and
holding Winthrop, the Big South Conference champion, to 2 of 13
shooting after it forged the tie on a free throw by forward Jacques
Vandescure.

CLINTON, CENTRAL AMERICAN LEADERS SIGN AGREEMENT 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTIGUA, Guatemala - With President Clinton offering economic
incentives, the leaders of seven Central American and Caribbean
nations reaffirmed pledges Thursday to improve human rights, combat
crime and drugs, and clean up the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, hammered out over the past several weeks in
Washington, was signed in this historic city on the final stop of
Clinton's four-day tour of the region wracked 4-1/2 months ago by
Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central America has had a long and difficult season aggravated
by the recent hurricanes,'' Clinton said against a backdrop of
stone buildings draped with bougainvillea. ``But we can truly
rejoice that the springtime of renewal and rebuilding is here.``
</P>
<P>
   The document was similar to an agreement the leaders signed in
Costa Rica two years ago. Although lacking historical drama, the
document signed Thursday served as a recommitment to programs
designed to strengthen the economies of the emerging democracies.
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of Antigua, the former capital of Guatemala, a
handful of protesters blocked a bus shuttling journalists and White
House staff members to the summit. It was the second demonstration
in two days against U.S. involvement in Guatemala's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton arrived in Guatemala City on Wednesday, he remained
aboard Air Force One for almost a half-hour until the Secret
Service determined that a demonstration outside the National Palace
was under control. Later, while Clinton was speaking inside,
several hundred protesters outside chanted anti-American slogans
and ``Viva Monica,'' referring to Clinton's ex-paramour, Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of church ruins dating to the 18th century,
Clinton signed Thursday what is being called ``The Declaration of
Antigua.'' Also signing the document were Presidents Alvaro Arzu of
Guatemala, Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua, Carlos Flores Facusse of
Honduras, Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador, Migues Rodriguez of
Costa Rica and Leonel Fernandez of the Dominican Republic, and
Prime Minister Said Wilbert Musa of Belize.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration included pledges from Clinton to forgive loans,
revise immigration laws and lower trade barriers to help stimulate
economic recovery for the emerging democracies, promises that hinge
on his ability to convince Congress to agree.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for a $956 million aid package Clinton wants
Congress to approve to help with storm recovery in Guatemala, El
Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's best chance to deliver on his end of Thursday's
agreement is the forgiveness of major portions of loans owed the
U.S. by Nicaragua and Honduras. Under the agreement, 90 percent of
Nicaragua's debt would be written off; 67 percent of what Honduras
owes Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In private meetings with Clinton earlier in the week, four of
the Central American presidents expressed disappointment in what he
has proposed in the Caribbean Basin Initiative he sent to Congress
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said the
initiative falls short of the trade latitude given Mexico under the
North American Free Trade Agreement, which the Central Americans
see as vital to attracting investment necessary to provide jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who was present during Clinton's meetings with the
presidents of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, said
damage from Hurricane Mitch has compounded the economic woes of the
four developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Given organized labor's opposition to lowering trade barriers
that might threaten U.S. jobs, the limited trade package was the
best Clinton could hope to get through Congress, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   On immigration, Clinton has remained firm about enforcing U.S.
immigration laws and protecting the nation's borders. At the same
time, he has acknowledged the unfairness of regulations governing
legal migration from Central America and has promised to push
Congress to rewrite the laws.
</P>
<P>
   Already angry over Washington's plan to resume deporting illegal
immigrants back to their countries, the Guatemalan and Salvadoran
presidents reportedly balked over the weekend at signing the
document because of clauses seeking to end illegal migration and
exploitation of under-age workers.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's summit, Arzu, the Guatemalan president, said
Hurricane Mitch showed the need for ``an integral plan for
development'' in Central America, and predicted the area would
prosper if it is allowed access to world markets.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, he said, there will be less pressure on Central
Americans to seek jobs in the United States. ``If we want for
democracy to remain with us forever, we must be sure it is
translated into evident and tangible benefits for our people,''
Arzu said. ``If we want for our people to stay ... we need to offer
them the opportunities that we now only find abroad.``

LAWMAKERS LOOK INTO CRUISE-LINE TAX EXEMPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Miss.)  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Saying the United States could be losing billions of dollars
each year, two Democratic congressmen asked the IRS Thursday to
estimate how much foreign-owned cruise companies are saving because
of tax code provisions that exempt them from income tax and other
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The congressmen, Peter DeFazio of Oregon and Gene Taylor of
Mississippi, said in a letter to the IRS commissioner, Charles
Rossotti, that they wanted the assessment because Congress might
take up legislation later this year to expand access to U.S. ports
by foreign-owned passenger ships.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary estimates from the Clinton administration are that
the tax provisions allow the industry to avoid billions of dollars
a year in federal taxes, DeFazio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that a large, growing and very profitable
U.S.-based industry is escaping all of its federal tax burden,''
DeFazio said in a telephone interview. ``This is a basic issue of
fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the cruise industry, which has annual
revenues of about $10 billion, say that the unique tax exemption is
part of international transportation law and that the industry pays
millions of dollars a year in port fees and other charges. A new
study for the industry found that it bought $6.6 billion worth of
American goods and generated 176,433 jobs in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very proud of the contribution which the cruise
industry makes to the U.S. economy,'' said Cynthia Colenda,
president of the International Council of Cruise Lines, the
industry trade group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 17 major cruise lines are based in the United States
and rely on American passengers, they are exempt from U.S. income
tax and some other taxes because the companies are registered in
foreign countries and their ships fly foreign flags. The countries
in which those companies are registered do not have income tax.
</P>
<P>
   An article last month in The New York Times described the tax
benefits and said Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise
company, earned $2 billion in the last three years yet paid less
than 1 percent in income taxes. Those taxes were on revenue from
hotels and tours in the United States. Carnival is based in Miami
but registered in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Under longstanding tax law, to qualify for the income tax
exemption, foreign cruise lines operating from an American port
must visit a foreign destination before returning to the United
States. But last year Congress debated relaxing the law to permit
foreign ships to transport passengers between U.S. ports without a
foreign stop.
</P>
<P>
   Some American port and tourism officials pushed for the change
to increase tourism. The domestic cruise industry opposed it,
arguing that American ships would have difficulty competing with
foreign vessels that pay no taxes.
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio, the ranking Democrat on the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee's Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
subcommittee, said he expects the issue of expanding access to
American ports to arise again.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for taxing foreign cruise companies appear slim
despite some support. In January, the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott of Mississippi, called on the administration to work with
Congress to re-examine tax policies that might stifle the domestic
cruise business.
</P>
<P>
   But DeFazio acknowledged that he faces a tough battle against
the foreign cruise companies, which lobby effectively. ``I've been
told I'm walking into a buzz saw,'' he said.

PRESIDENT DENIES IGNORING EVIDENCE OF NUCLEAR SPYING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTIGUA, Guatemala _ President Clinton vigorously denied on
Thursday that the administration had minimized evidence of nuclear
spying by China and defended his policy of engagement with Beijing
as the only effective means of restraining Chinese behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he was under no illusions about China's covert
efforts to acquire American nuclear weapons technology. He said
that when he received persuasive evidence that highly classified
data about American nuclear weapons design had been leaked from the
Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, he acted
aggressively to contain the damage and prevent further incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not ignore evidence. Quite the contrary, we acted on
it,'' the president said at a news conference at the conclusion of
a summit meeting with Central American leaders. ``I believe the
record is clear that we did respond in an appropriate way.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments on Thursday were his first public statements
since reports emerged over the weekend that a Chinese-American
scientist at Los Alamos might have been responsible for providing
information in the 1980s that enabled China to develop a
miniaturized nuclear warhead similar to the most sophisticated
weapons in the American arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has opened an investigation of the case, including
allegations that the administration sought to play down the
severity of the suspected espionage and delay the investigation so
as not to jeopardize its policy of reconciliation with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill on Thursday, Republicans toned down their fiery
criticisms of the administration's handling of the Los Alamos spy
case, perhaps sensing that undue hysteria was creeping into their
response.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert echoed Clinton's call to remain engaged
with Beijing. ``The more we're involved with China, the better off
we are _ for us and for China and the Pacific area,'' Hastert said
in an interview. ``It's also important that we stress our views on
human rights. If we aren't engaged, we can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he did not become aware of the potential scope
of the technology transfer until July 1997, when he was briefed on
a continuing FBI inquiry into a case of possible espionage at the
Energy Department laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The initial investigation produced evidence not only of a hugely
damaging transfer of American nuclear technology, but of systemic
leakage of military secrets from the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, we moved quickly and decisively,'' Clinton said,
``not only with the continuing FBI investigation and a CIA review,
but also with an intense review of the counterintelligence
capacities of our Energy Department labs.''
</P>
<P>
   But American officials have said that the federal government's
drawn-out effort to track down the possible leak was plagued by
delays, inaction and skepticism _ even though senior intelligence
officials considered it one of the most damaging spy cases in
recent history. For instance, a recommendation by the FBI in April
1997 that background checks be reinstated on visitors to Los Alamos
was ignored for 17 months by the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly three years later, no arrests have been made. A
prime suspect in the case, a Taiwan-born scientist at Los Alamos
National Laboratory, was fired on Monday after three days of
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that beginning in early 1998 he had
significantly tightened security at the weapons facilities,
including requiring polygraph examinations for employees with
access to critical information.
</P>
<P>
   And he asserted that the intelligence committees of Congress
have received 16 briefings on the matter since 1997, despite angry
complaints from members that the administration kept them largely
in the dark about the alleged spying.
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected calls from some Republican presidential
hopefuls that he dismiss Sandy Berger, the national security
adviser, whom some have accused of foot-dragging in the spy case in
order to protect and justify his support for a policy of close
cooperation with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Berger acted appropriately and therefore I would
not release him or ask for his resignation. I just don't think
there's any evidence to support that,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Craig Thomas, a conservative Republican from Wyoming who
heads the Foreign Relations subcommittee for Asia, dismissed as
``premature'' the demands for Berger's resignation. ``I've never
supported the idea that every time China does something we don't
like we ought to submit a thing to the Senate and get after them,''
Thomas told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met twice with Jiang Zemin, the Chinese president, in
the fall of 1997 and the summer of 1998, after Clinton learned of
the espionage charges but months before they became public. The
president plans to meet with the Chinese prime minister, Zhu
Rongji, in Washington in April.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that despite this case and other evidence of
Chinese acquisition of weapons-related technology from the United
States, it was in America's interest to remain engaged with the
Asian giant.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his policy of ``strategic partnership'' with China
had already brought benefits, including China's signing of the
Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   He also praised Beijing's cooperation with the United States for
progress in non-proliferation programs aimed at Iran, Pakistan and
North Korea. China has also played a constructive role in limiting
the damage from the Asian economic crisis of the past 18 months,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would argue that our efforts to have an honest and open
policy with China, so that they don't think that we have made a
decision in advance to try to contain and limit them in their
economic growth and their development as a nation, has paid
dividends,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe those things would have occurred if we had
not had an open, candid, honest relationship with China, aware of
all the facts,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The president pointedly noted that the alleged transfer of
weapons technology to China occurred in the mid-1980s, when China
made rapid strides in its own nuclear program that were detected by
U.S. intelligence agencies. At the time, there was no clear
evidence that Chinese technological leaps were the result of theft
of American weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the current espionage case proves that Chinese spies
pilfered American weapons design, Clinton said, there remain
reasons to continue to work with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that the evidence justifies an isolated
no-contact relationship with China,'' he said, ``when we have
gotten the benefits not only to ourselves, but to the rest of the
world, of our engagement policy.''

CELTICS TRADE DECLERQ TO THE CAVALIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Andrew DeClercq &UR;  &LR; boarded the Celtics team bus Thursday
night with the rest of his teammates, preparing for a game against
the Hawks. That was at 5:30. Thirty minutes later, the men sitting
next to DeClercq &UR;  &LR; were former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   DeClercq &UR;  &LR; became a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers when the
Celtics traded him and a first-round draft choice for
6-foot-10-inch, 285-pound center Vitaly Potapenko. Cleveland has
the option of taking the first-rounder this year or next. The only
condition is that the Celtics retain their '99 pick if they wind up
with one of the top three choices in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics coach Rick Pitino has said all season that his team
needs size and a defensive presence, which is what made Potapenko
attractive to the team. What made him unattractive to the Cavs is
his contract status: He'll be a free agent at the end of the season
and the sides couldn't agree on his worth. Potapenko supposedly
wants a deal averaging between $6 million and $8 million per
season; the Cavs didn't want to pay that much for a man who would
essentially be backing up Zydrunas Ilgauskus. So the trade was on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great move for us,'' said Pitino, who praised
DeClercq &UR;  &LR; for giving the team everything he had, but added the
6-10, 245-pound DeClercq &UR;  &LR; is ``really a power forward.'' And
everyone knew the Celtics needed a center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Vitaly is that he's 280 pounds and can guard
his own man (without needing a double team),'' Pitino said. ``He
may be the strongest player in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics play in Detroit Friday night, when Potapenko is
expected to join them. He also is expected to move quickly into a
role as the team's starting center. Although DeClercq &UR;  &LR; is more
comfortable at forward, he will start for the Cavs at center for
the rest of the season since Ilgauskus is hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland coaches loved that Potapenko was comfortable in the
weight room. One assistant even said the center, who will be 24 in
a week, is stronger than Karl Malone. That's one reason Pitino said
he didn't mind giving up a protected first-round pick, especially
since ``there isn't a center in the draft.'' Pitino looked at the
free agent list and saw Olden Polynice was the only center. ``And I
think he would be looking for a little more than the $2 million
exception,'' the coach said, referring to the only way the Celtics
would have been able to sign anyone. As for being able to meet
Potapenko's contract demands, Pitino said, ``I'm comfortable that
we'll be able to sign him.''
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for signing extensions this season is Saturday. If
the Celtics don't sign Potapenko _ who is currently making $1.42
million _ by then, they'll have to wait until after July 1.
Potapenko is averaging about 8 points and 5.5 rebounds per game. He
averaged 7.1 points and 3.9 rebounds last season. During his rookie
year, he was known as a scorer who didn't want to defend. That drew
the ire of coach Mike Fratello. Recently, Potapenko has improved
his defense but still hasn't established himself as an elite
rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino was asked if it hurt him to give up the first-round pick,
which the Cavs will most likely take this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team doesn't need more youth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The top-three protection is significant. Many personnel people
believe that if the draft were held today, the top three picks
would be Lamar Odom of Rhode Island, Steve Francis of Maryland, and
Elton Brand of Duke. All those players, assuming they declared for
the draft, could make the Celtics better. But after them, there is
a dramatic dropoff in talent.

 SPORTS COLUMN: DiMAGGIO'S LAST CALL: FAMIGLIA  
(rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Once this man lashed home runs in Yankee Stadium
and married a glamorous actress, but Thursday Joe DiMaggio came
back to the old neighborhood to be buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing was, Joe never played for our church teams,''
said the Rev. David Purdy, SDB, the pastor of Saints Peter and Paul
Roman Catholic Church, the gorgeous Italianate church, with a
quotation in Italian from Dante's Paradise on the facade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe had some kind of a dispute with the man who ran our team
so he played for another church up the hill,'' Purdy said, noting
that this happened before his time _ 70 years ago, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was a free agent as a teen-ager, a right he never
achieved as one of the most celebrated athletes of his century. The
Yankees could contemplate trading him for Ted Williams, but in
those days of the reserve clause, the Yankee Clipper could never
contemplate changing teams of his own volition.
</P>
<P>
   Times change. Neighborhoods change. In the park across the way,
approximately 100 people concluded their morning exercise, the
robust motions and tonal chants of tai chi, just before the funeral
cortege arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The couple of hundred people in the news media swarm nearly
outnumbered the individuals who came to pay their respects, even
though the family had said, thanks but no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Famiglia. Family. That is a familiar concept in the Italian
enclave of North Beach, where Mandarin and Cantonese languages are
now as prominent as Sicilian or Tuscan dialects.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral was for about 40 members of the DiMaggio family, and
a few close friends, plus Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball,
and Gene Budig, the president of the American League, which will
probably annoy George Steinbrenner, who would have liked to be
here.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was once asked what he would say to Steinbrenner if he
had the delightful opportunity to negotiate a salary in these days
of the nine-digit salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiya, partner,'' or words to that effect, was his instant
response. But even though Steinbrenner had replaced DiMaggio's lost
World Series rings last fall, he was most definitely not family.
Nor were the mayor of this charmed city, nor a few prominent actors
and ball players and other world figures who had to be pointedly
told, please, don't even ask.
</P>
<P>
   Famiglia. In the eulogy, DiMaggio's brother, Dominic, himself a
terrific center fielder, spoke of his brother's accomplishments on
the field, and reminded the family how proud his brother was to be
included in the 10 best-dressed men in America.
</P>
<P>
   Dom DiMaggio briefly alluded to his brother's never finding a
life's companion. There had been one wedding to Dorothy Arnold in
this same church in 1939 _ the crowds were tenfold Thursday's
modest assembly _ and another marriage in City Hall to Marilyn
Monroe, after which the couple posed for photographers in front of
Saints Peter and Paul.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Joe DiMaggio remained elusive, just as he had been
all his life. To some people in the North Beach neighborhood,
DiMaggio was the solitary old gent who sat in the corner and nursed
a beer _ when he was in town. To others he was the cordial neighbor
on Beach Street who offered batting tips to a child _ when he was
in town.
</P>
<P>
   He was bemused by the Paul Simon lyrics, but Joltin' Joe had
indeed left and gone away, a long time ago. Perhaps it was the very
act of setting out to conquer the world that made it impossible to
truly come home, alive.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, DiMaggio was almost a myth, a specter. A North
Beach local, an honorary Italian named John McDermott, would see
DiMaggio taking his morning walk down by Fisherman's Wharf.
Sometimes he would stop and chat, McDermott said, and sometimes he
would not. And that seems to be the way the world remembers Joe
DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something else: ``He made us proud, as
Italian-Americans,'' said Anthony C. Azzolini, one of the
proprietors of Caffi Roma, on Columbus Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio remembered the old neighborhood. When he sat down
to plan his own funeral, DiMaggio even specified that the cold cuts
for the wake come from the Molinari delicatessen on Columbus. The
singer and the organist were from the neighborhood. The 79-year-old
priest who celebrated the Mass, the Rev. Armand Oliveri, had buried
two DiMaggio brothers and one sister.
</P>
<P>
   Oliveri noted that DiMaggio could have had a cardinal say the
mass, but he chose a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was estranged from his only child, a son who served as
a pallbearer, but at the end of his 84 years, and perhaps a bit
late, Joseph Paul DiMaggio revealed that ancient longing _ to come
home, accompanied by the only people that matter, famiglia.

EDITORIAL: A NEW START FOR GERMANY'S GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, March 12: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his brief tenure as Germany's finance minister, Oskar
Lafontaine often seemed to be running a government of his own, one
that was determined to raise corporate taxes and resist pressures
from international capital markets. It was a struggle he was likely
to lose in any case, and it is probably best that he chose to
resign Thursday, after less than five months on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the euro currency has increased pressures on
European governments to lower business taxes to attract employers
who can easily relocate. But Lafontaine swam against the tide,
proposing to raise taxes on German businesses and to force other
countries in Europe to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   He also loudly demanded that the new European Central Bank lower
interest rates. On the merits, he had a case, but the political
realities were that the new central bank dared not appear to be
caving in to such pressure. With Lafontaine gone, a rate cut now
may be more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Lafontaine's power came from his other job, as leader of
the ruling Social Democratic Party. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is
expected to take that job for himself, making it clear that he is
the boss. Now it will be up to Schroeder to offer a clear vision of
what his government hopes to accomplish, something that has not
been possible because of infighting within his cabinet.

WINDFALL FOR BAY STATE SEEN IN REPORT FUNDED BY CASINO BACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Legalizing casino gambling in Massachusetts would
increase state revenue and boost annual Lottery sales by an
estimated $137 million, according to a study commissioned by casino
gambling supporters scheduled to be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, commissioned by a group of businessmen seeking to
open a casino in Salisbury Beach, is the third progaming study
authored by professor Clyde Barrow of the University of
Massachusetts at Dartmouth released in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   The studies are intended to increase pressure on the Legislature
to expand gambling in Massachusetts. Lawmakers are scheduled to
take up the issue Tuesday, when the joint Committee on Government
Regulations considers a slew of bills to expand gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, New Hampshire lawmakers will begin to vote next
week on a measure sponsored by Governor Jeanne Shaheen that would
place nearly 3,750 slot machines at the Granite State's four
racetracks, thereby increasing pressure on Massachusetts lawmakers
to expand gambling here.
</P>
<P>
   Barrow's new study focuses on a bill sponsored by state Senator
James P. Jajuga, Democrat of Methuen, that would allow the
construction of three casinos, located in Salisbury Beach and in
Bristol and Hampden counties, and authorize up to 200 slot machines
at each of the state's four racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   The study concludes that casinos would generate an additional
$150 million a year in direct local aid to Massachusetts cities and
towns. But it's the argument that expanding gambling will lead to
greater Lottery sales that's likely to catch the attention of key
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Barrow said his conclusions are based in part on the experience
of Connecticut, where state lottery sales increased after the
Mashantucket Pequots opened Foxwoods Casino in Ledyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fiscal year 1998, the Connecticut State Lottery contributed
over $264 million in revenues to the state's general fund,'' Barrow
said, ``an average increase of over $7 million annually since the
inception of casino gaming in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Representative Daniel E. Bosley, Democrat of North
Adams, who as House chairman of the Government Regulations
Committee helped kill casino gambling in Massachusetts with a
scathing report on the ``false promises'' of casino advocates in
1996, said Thursday that Barrow's conclusions were a result of
``shoddy research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Connecticut lottery increased sales because it expanded
its instant ticket games,'' Bosley said. ``We commissioned a very
expensive and exhaustive study two years ago which concluded that
you cannot draw any inference at all between the increase in
lottery sales and the introduction of casinos in Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien, who oversees the
Lottery and supported casino bills as a state senator, said she
will keep an open mind on the issue of expanded gambling in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   As The Boston Globe has previously reported, Governor Paul
Cellucci is in favor of allowing the Martha's Vineyard-based
Wampanoag tribe to operate a casino, and Senate President Thomas F.
Birmingham and Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly have declared they
``have no moral objections'' to expanded gambling in the state.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, who has opposed expanded
gambling in the past but signaled a willingness to take another
look at the issue, could not be reached to comment Thursday.

MIHM'S ABILITY REACHING NEW HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you think you can take Chris Mihm on the tennis court? Think
again. He was ranked among the state's top players in his age group
as a 14-year-old growing up in Austin, Texas; you wouldn't stand a
chance of serving or volleying against him.
</P>
<P>
   So you think you can beat Chris Mihm in the swimming pool? You'd
lose again. The 7-footer would be capable of easily outreaching you
at the wall, even if you were leading by a full length.
</P>
<P>
   So you think you can post-up Chris Mihm on the basketball court?
That would be even more comical than ``There's Something About
Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   On all three counts, you'd be a triple (crowned) loser.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm will stand head-and-shoulders above everyone when the
multitalented 7-foot, 262-pound sophomore center leads Texas
(19-12), a seventh seed, against No. 10 seed Purdue in an East
Regional first-round game at the FleetCenter. At first glance,
Purdue's roster does not appear to have the personnel big enough to
challenge Mihm in the paint, let alone the tennis court or swimming
pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those players who's gotten better and better in
the last two years,'' remarked Purdue coach Gene Keady. ``He's got
long arms and he's got great hands, and he's big. He's got a good
touch and it looks like he might have a chance to move on to
another level. But it's one of those things where you see kids get
better, you know it took a lot of hard work. It just didn't happen.
I just think once he started to buy into Coach (Rick) Barnes's
system, he took off. And he's probably been the difference on their
team right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm earned a spot on the Big 12 media's All-Improved and
All-Defensive squads after averaging 13.4 points, a team-leading
10.9 rebounds, and recording 82 blocked shots. He says there are
two reasons he's improved. First and foremost, there was the
arrival of Barnes from Clemson, and, second, he was a devoted
participant in the Pete Newell Big Man Camp last August in
Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Pete Newell and the staff he has assembled there are
some of the best at teaching a lot of fundamentals and big-man
moves and techniques,'' said Mihm, who befriended Evan Eschemeyer
of Northwestern and A.J. Bramlett of Arizona during his Hawaiian
camping trip. ``That camp has helped me overall with just footwork
and my overall arsenal of different moves. But this year with Coach
Barnes coming in, I've learned so much. He's just a great teacher
and great coach, and he's really helped in a lot of areas of my
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them, I think, is the defensive end,'' he added. ``I've
really become a lot better defensive player and I've tried to
concentrate on other areas, like rebounding. My rebounding average
was up (from 8.0 to 10.9), and I was been able to average a
double-double.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Barnes, ``The first time I saw Chris, we had just gotten
here and we were doing our individual workouts and right off the
bat you knew this guy had great hands, great attitude, and was a
great guy who wanted to work. Then, as he started moving, you saw
he was a guy who had great agility. He's young, but as time went
on, he continued to learn a lot about himself but there is no doubt
in my mind that Chris Mihm is one of the best players in college
basketball tody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been as hard or harder on Chris Mihm as any player I've
coached, because when you look at him you see greatness and you
want to see it come out of him every day,'' Barnes added. ``He has
learned how to practice hard and he's raised his own bar, where now
some of the things I've told him he can do, I think he's realized
that he can do. He had truly a great, great year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Mihm's breakout games of the season came in a 76-65
victory over the University of Massachusetts Jan. 31 at the Frank
Erwin Center. In one of the few games he was not double- or
triple-teamed, Mihm dominated his one-on-one matchup with Lari
Ketner by scoring 20 points and grabbing a season-high 17 rebounds.
Afterward, UMass coach Bruiser Flint was left to state the obvious.
``(Mihm's) going to make a lot of money one day, I'll put it that
way. He was making baseline jumpers from 10-12 feet out with a guy
in his face. What do you do about that?''
</P>
<P>
   While Mihm would gladly sacrifice ``a flashy dunk'' for the
chance to swat someone's shot on the defensive end, Barnes hopes
Mihm continues to capitalize on his potential to become a
well-rounded player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want him just to be a block player, because he's too
good a shooter and his skills are too good to keep him down
there,'' Barnes said. ``I do want him to step out and face the
basket and play that way some, too. He's been a tremendous force on
the defensive end. We were able to extend our defense a little bit,
because we know we've got somewhat of a security blanket back there
that when players go in there they know there's a guy lurking back
there who can alter some shots and block some shots.''
</P>
<P>
   But, then again, those represent only a fraction of Chris Mihm's
abundant athletic talents.

NIKE CRITIC PRAISES GAINS IN AIR QUALITY AT VIETNAM FACTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A prominent critic who badly hurt Nike's image when he exposed
unsafe conditions at one of its factories in Vietnam in 1997 issued
a report Thursday that gave the footwear giant high marks for
improving air quality at the plant, although he said some
significant problems remained.
</P>
<P>
   After disclosing 18 months ago that the air in parts of the
plant had levels of cancer-causing substances that exceeded local
standards by 177 times, the critic, Dara O'Rourke, applauded the
factory for improving ventilation, reducing the use of hazardous
chemicals and training managers on safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke, an environmental researcher at the University of
California at Berkeley, praised Nike for a turnaround, noting that
it was substituting less harmful chemicals for dangerous ones and
had taken the unusual step of allowing a critic like him to inspect
the factory, which is outside Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, the world's largest athletic shoe company, let O'Rourke
visit the factory in December while he was in Vietnam working as a
consultant for the U.N. Industrial Development Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been important improvements, but I don't want to
say Nike has solved all its problems,'' O'Rourke said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke criticized the factory, which is owned and operated by
a Korean contractor, for making insufficient use of protective
equipment like masks and gloves and for having excessive heat and
noise in parts of the plant, which has 9,200 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Kidd, Nike's director of labor relations, said in an
interview that the Tae Kwang Vina factory was an average factory,
not a model one, and that the improvements there were similar to
those at Nike factories throughout Asia. To prove that conditions
have improved at other Nike factories, Kidd said Nike would allow
O'Rourke to visit any of its 37 footwear factories in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Global Exchange, a human rights group that has been Nike's
harshest and most persistent critic, issued a statement Thursday
praising the company for improving conditions and for letting an
outside monitor inspect the factory.
</P>
<P>
   Medea Benjamin, the group's co-director, said, ``This is
certainly an astounding transformation for a company that once
treated independent monitoring as a public relations exercise,
limiting factory access to people they thought would write
favorable reports.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In November 1997, O'Rourke made public a damning inspection
report about the Vietnam factory, leaked to him by a disgruntled
employee, that the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young had prepared for
Nike's internal use. That report said that 77 percent of the
factory's workers reported respiratory problems in 1996 and that
employees worked 65 hours a week, far more than Vietnamese law
allowed. Hours have since been reduced to about 45 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Nike's effort to improve air quality has involved
reducing the use of petroleum-based chemicals _ known as volatile
organic compounds _ used in adhesives, solvents and primers. These
chemicals include toluene, which causes damage to the liver,
kidneys and central nervous system, and acetone, which causes
respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nike is relying instead on water-based chemicals because they
are considerably less dangerous when they evaporate, although
O'Rourke called for studying the health effects of these chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report, which was written O'Rourke and Garrett Brown,
an occupational safety expert, said the factory ``has implemented
important changes over the past 18 months which appear to have
significantly reduced worker exposures to toxic solvents, adhesives
and other chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd said Nike had cut its use of volatile organic compounds to
70 grams for every pair of shoes from 340 grams three years ago. He
said that converting to water-based chemicals had cost millions of
dollars but but that because 30 percent less of these chemicals are
needed than the petroleum-based ones, Nike's operating costs had
been cut by more than $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke's report noted that 18 percent of workers at the
Vietnam factory reported nose and throat illnesses last year, down
from 86 percent in 1997 and 77 percent in 1996. But his report said
it was puzzling that the number of workers going to the factory's
clinic for what they said were respiratory problems was about the
same last year as in 1997. O'Rourke called on Nike to more closely
monitor how many workers have respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   His report noted that several rooms with heavy equipment had
dangerously high noise levels and that the temperature in the plant
often exceeded 98 degrees. He complained that many workers did not
use ear plugs and that the cotton masks and gloves many workers
used were inadequate to protect them from the chemicals with which
they work.

 KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the new speaker of the
House, may be trying to shed all comparisons with his mercurial
predecessor, Newt Gingrich. But he cannot avoid one of the central
problems that Gingrich faced in trying to run the House: his party
appears hopelessly split, and with just a 10-vote majority, Hastert
has even less room to maneuver than Gingrich had.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert was overruled last week by party conservatives, who are
blocking aid to Central America unless it can be offset by cuts in
domestic programs, like food stamps. The week before, the speaker
signaled a compromise with moderates after they complained about
the proposed tax cut of 10 percent across the board, which had
become the party line, saying they wanted narrower tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert even seemed to be compromising with Democrats, who have
been pushing for an increase in the minimum wage. He suggested that
he did not have the power to stop it, only to shape the final
package.
</P>
<P>
   Two months into his accidental speakership _ he was catapulted
into the job after Robert Livingston's surprise renunciation of the
post after admitting extramarital affairs _ Hastert has shown
himself to be a pragmatic and cautious politician. He is mindful
chiefly that he needs to cement the political center if he hopes to
pass any legislation _ and keep control _ with his whisker-thin
majority.
</P>
<P>
   He is also more comfortable behind the scenes than on stage.
This has made it difficult for many outside of House Republicans to
get to know him and has raised an inevitable question: Are his
initial steps toward compromise the unintended result of an
inexperienced and tentative leader? Or are they the deliberate
strategy of a shrewd negotiator who knows how to piece together
legislation and will ultimately undercut Democratic accusations
that this is a do-nothing Congress?
</P>
<P>
   Hastert is the first to admit that he has no grand design.
``Three months ago, being speaker of the House was the farthest
thing from my mind,'' he said in an interview in his office
Thursday. ``I didn't expect it. You feel your way through this. The
best way for me to take this job is one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new speaker is slowly consolidating his power. One House
member who is sympathetic to him said: ``Unlike Newt, who got up
every day and told us how to save the world, Denny is calmly trying
to stake out a position where 218 will agree on taxes, 218 will
agree on health care, 218 will agree on education. It's not
glamorous, but he is dealing with congressmen one on one.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day, Hastert must confront the cold reality that five of
his 222 Republicans could abandon him on a vote and that, assuming
Democrats held together, his party's legislative agenda could
collapse. Then the Republicans could lose control of the House.
They could lose the House anyway, of course, but some legislative
achievements would help them gird against becoming known as the
party of impeachment, the party that could not govern.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes could not be higher. And the calculus _ to balance so
many competing interests and hold the majority _ must be precise.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this is bean counting, not vision,'' said Marshall
Wittmann, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
research group. ``Denny Hastert is meeting with everyone and going
over the schedule and counting heads. `How many do we have for this
rule? How do we calibrate this?' It's a green-eyeshade form of
legislating.''
</P>
<P>
   This plays to Hastert's strength. His previous role in the
House, as deputy whip, was to take the temperature of his
colleagues on bills coming to the floor and round up votes by
applying pressure to his colleagues and tinkering with the bills to
bring them into alignment. He used these skills most notably on
health care legislation in 1996, when Republicans got an experiment
in medical savings accounts added to the Kassebaum-Kennedy
legislation allowing workers to keep their health-care coverage if
they changed jobs. This took endless meetings and member-by-member
attention, a modus operandi that Hastert has taken to the speaker's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been counting votes for four years around here, and it's
a vote-by-vote situation, no matter how far-reaching you'd like to
look,'' Hastert said. ``You need to check where your folks are on
every vote and you never take anybody for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to sit down and listen to what people have to say and
at least try to accommodate what their concerns are. I think that's
why I'm here, quite frankly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He has also retained the instincts of the coach he once was. By
design and temperament, he shuns the limelight, preferring to
promote his team, not himself. Toward this end, he has reinvested
authority in his committee chairmen, defusing and decentralizing
the power that Gingrich had amassed in the speaker's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I've learned _ just because you're the speaker
doesn't mean you're the guru on every issue out there,'' Hastert
said, adding that he prefers to let the experts do the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will restore the speakership to the traditional mold,''
said Rep. J.D. Hayworth, a conservative Republican from Arizona.
``That means using the tools of the institution which over time
have worked rather than try to reinvent the process: Using
committees, spending time on the floor, reaching out on the
telephone, being accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has been accessible not only to members but also to
fund-raisers. He has been hobnobbing with Republican donors across
the country and lobbyists in Washington in an effort to keep
dollars flowing into the party's congressional campaign committee,
which plunged into debt in last year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   All of this private activity leaves little time for developing a
public persona, and Hastert remains relatively anonymous. This,
combined with his conciliatory style and his continued role as a
vote counter, has contributed to a perception that he has no
specific agenda of his own, beyond his oft-stated desire to make
the trains run on time. That in turn has raised some concerns
within the House that he has ceded big-picture decision making and
pre-eminence on Capitol Hill to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is getting up to speed every day,'' said Rep. Thomas Ewing,
a fellow Illinois Republican and longtime friend. ``When you're
working with such a slim majority, you really have to keep some
flexibility. If he had a 20- or 30-vote majority and a little more
experience, he would probably have more definite ideas, but his
strength right now is not being hamstrung by feeling `it has to be
my way.'''
</P>
<P>
   He is operating with virtually no margin for error, a task
complicated by the differences within his party. The moderate
Republicans in the House are flexing a new-felt power stemming from
their vote with conservatives on Dec. 19 to impeach President
Clinton, even though polls showed that a majority of their
constituents supported the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's next-to-impossible for leaders to go to the moderates and
say `You've got to cast a hard vote for me,''' Wittmann of the
Heritage Foundation said. ``They've already cast it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now those moderates need to assert their independence, and
Hastert appears sensitive to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, the moderate Connecticut Republican who led
a dozen of her colleagues against the 10 percent tax cut, praised
Hastert, calling him ``a good strategist.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert must satisfy the moderates while not antagonizing the
conservatives. There is a large reservoir of good will toward the
speaker. But privately, some conservatives say they worry that he
is making tactical blunders by ceding conservative goals too
quickly and that his conciliatory instincts will give them little
with which to distinguish themselves from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need definitional bills that pass but that Clinton vetoes
so we can say, `Here are the differences between us and Gore,'''
one conservative said, anticipating the presidential nomination of
Vice President Al Gore. ``That was the beauty of the 10 percent
cut. Now, Hastert has undermined it without even making an effort
to sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing his own majority is fragile, Hastert has been diligently
seeking Democratic support for various bills on taxes, education
and missile defense, hoping that for every Republican vote he might
lose, he can gain a Democrat one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly,'' he has said, ``with the margin of votes that
we have, we need to do as much stuff as we can on a bipartisan
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   But he cannot for a moment forget that the Democrats are
determined to retake the House and replace him with Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader. Despite Hastert's
friendly public overtures _ he has met not only with Democratic
leaders but also with the various Democratic factions _ the
Democrats smell blood.
</P>
<P>
   And many in the House expect that as election-year politics come
into focus, the Democrats will decide that they have little to gain
by helping Hastert and the Republicans look good.

EDITORIAL: SALT LAKE RIDDLE: WHO KNEW WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Friday, March 12: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The business and political establishment of Salt Lake City has
portrayed the bribe-giving involved in securing the Winter Olympic
Games for 2002 as largely the handiwork of two rogue executives.
Both of them, along with several board members, have resigned.
Virtually everyone else involved in Salt Lake City's bid efforts
was supposedly unaware. But documents obtained and interviews
conducted by Times reporters strongly suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Paperwork from the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young indicates
that senior bid committee officials, including top officials of
Utah corporations, were briefed in 1995 about questionable
payments. That is an assertion these business leaders deny.
Disturbingly, documents that might resolve the dispute _ namely,
minutes and handwritten notes taken during bid committee meetings
in 1994 and 1995 _ were destroyed by the committee's law firm. The
law firm, in turn, says it does not know who gave the order to
shred or dispose of the documents.
</P>
<P>
   These revelations reinforce conclusions reached by the ethics
commission convened by the United States Olympic Committee and
headed by former Sen. George Mitchell. His panel lacked the power
to subpoena witnesses or documents. Nonetheless it found that
trustees of the bid and organizing efforts failed to exercise
adequate oversight, even though they had access to managers and the
books. The Mitchell report said it ``strains credulity'' to suggest
that awareness of improprieties was a tightly held secret.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations by the Department of Justice and Utah's attorney
general have the best shot at revealing who knew, approved and took
part in efforts to buy the votes of International Olympic Committee
members with gifts, scholarships, cash and other inducements. This
scheme was surely not the work of just a few zealous individuals.

 &HT;    Vols won't look past Delaware
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ So, Tony Harris, what were you doing the last
time Tennessee won a game in the NCAA Tournament?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 4 or 5,'' said the Volunteer point guard. ``I was
probably breaking a bunch of toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the perspective of Tennessee's players on the school's
last NCAA Tournament win which, for the record, came over Marquette
(57-56) in the first round of the 1983 Mideast Regional. Since then
the Vols have been to the tournament only twice (1989, 1998) losing
both times in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   It is this piece of history, and Tennessee's (20-8)
disappointing play in last week's SEC Tournament, that has the
fourth-seeded Vols as an upset special on a lot of backets today as
they host 13th-seeded Delaware (25-5) in the first round of the
East Regional at the Charlotte Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question Tennessee has better athletes than the
America East champs, who had a 13-game winning streak earlier this
season. The question is, will Tennessee's talented athletes show up
to play?
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee entered this season with high expecations, ranked No.
9 in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   But since an opening-game loss to Arizona (73-72), the Vols have
shown a disturbing tendency to play up or down to the competition.
Tennessee swept Kentucky for the first time since 1979 to win the
SEC's Eastern Division. But the Vols also lost to Mississippi State
twice, the latest coming last Friday (62-56) in the second round of
the SEC Tournament. Tennessee was on a seven-game winning streak
when it inexplicably fell apart against the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   So inquiring minds want to know: Will Tennessee get caught
napping again, thinking Delaware can't play?
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, said coach Jerry Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we've been up and down at times this season but I feel
that we'll be ready to play,'' said Green, in his second season at
Tennessee. ``In fact, I had to cut practice short yesterday
(Wednesday) because I was afraid somebody might get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Tennessee's players thought they were ready to play a
year ago when they went to the West Regional, also as a No. 4 seed.
They now admit they did not take No. 13 Illinois State seriously
and lost 82-81 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we made a mistake of looking on and saying we could
play Arizona (in the second round),'' said guard Brandon Wharton.
``We're going to take it one game at a time this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite last week's loss to Mississippi State, Green has felt
pretty good about his team since losing back-to-back home games
against Arkansas (69-52) and Mississippi State (88-82) in early
February. He made some adjustments after those games to simplify
the offense and, except for the SEC Tournament, the Vols have
played well since.
</P>
<P>
   ``About eight games ago, I thought we might shooting our way out
of it (the tournament),'' said Green. ``But I don't think there is
any question that our kids are more comfortable being in this
position than we were a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all this team has accomplished _ 20 wins, the SEC East
championship, the sweep of Kentucky _ if it gets upset today for
the second year in a row, it will be labeled as a significant
underacheiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think about things like that. We came here to win,''
said Wharton, the team's leading scorer at 13.0 ppg. ``If you think
about being afraid to lose, you're in trouble. There's no time for
that.''

 &HT;    `Apprentice' Blaney on Busch pole
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dave Blaney won't jump to NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit
until next season, but the former sprint-car standout beat 13 Cup
regulars in Thursday's qualifying for the Yellow Freight 300 Busch
race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Blaney, 36, won the pole for Saturday's race with an average
speed of 186.755 mph, which broke AMS' Busch qualifying record of
186.673 mph set by Dick Trickle in November.
</P>
<P>
   Part-time Cup driver Jeff Green was second at 186.648 mph, and
Mark Martin, the two-time defending champion in the race, was third
at 186.322.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup drivers took eight of the 25 qualifying spots,
including five of the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I'm sitting, I need to learn as much as I can, as fast
as I can,'' Blaney said. ``I probably wouldn't be saying that if I
missed the race by a couple of spots, but from where I'm sitting, I
think it only helps me learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaney, a native of Hartford, Ohio, and father of three, spent
15 years driving sprint cars, winning more than 185 feature events
and $3.5 million in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Blaney was given a two-year ``apprenticeship'' in the
Busch series by his sponsor before entering the Cup circuit in
2000. Bill Davis, who owns Blaney's Busch team, also owns the Cup
venture of Ward Burton.
</P>
<P>
   While other Busch drivers are criticizing so many Winston Cup
regulars racing in the smaller series on a weekly basis, Blaney is
welcoming the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get close enough to them, you can learn where
they're hitting the brakes and where they're picking up the
throttle,'' he said. ``I'm out here trying to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS RATINGS SOAR
</P>
<P>
   Last week's Las Vegas 400 not only was the most-attended
sporting event in Nevada history, but it also was the second-most
watched race in NASCAR history, excluding the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   The second annual race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, which
featured brothers Jeff and Ward Burton battling over the final 35
laps, had a 6.0 rating, marking a 3 percent increase over the
inaugural event, according to ABC. The 6.0 rating translates to a
15 share, which means the race was watched by an estimated 5.99
million households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Las Vegas performed exceptionally,'' Speedway Motorsports
chairman Bruton Smith said. ``The television rating is outstanding
given that 1998 was the inaugural year for the Las Vegas 400. With
this record-breaking event behind us, we will finalize plans for
further growth of this facility. We've got tremendous opportunities
in Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   THIS AND THAT
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stahl of Savannah qualified for today's Johnson Industries
300 ARCA race, joining local drivers Mark Gibson of Winder, Mike
Ciochetti Jr. of Clayton and Bill Flowers of Powder Springs. ...
Jason Jarrett, the son of Winston Cup driver Dale, wrecked during
practice Thursday and was unable to drive in first-round qualifying
for the Busch race.

 &HT;    Declining legacy: Wood Brothers patient
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Perhaps only a fellow Virginian could understand the
burden that Elliott Sadler carries on his young shoulders, that of
trying to restore the Wood Brothers racing team to its former
glory.
</P>
<P>
   When he was hired to drive the No. 21 Ford this season, Sadler,
a rookie, gushed about the responsibility of sitting in the Wood
Brothers seat once warmed by some of racing's greatest names _
Yarborough, Pearson, Allison, Foyt, Bonnett, Baker, Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always kept a special eye on the Wood Brothers because we
were from Virginia,'' the 23-year-old Sadler said. ``To be able to
drive a race car for them at such an early age is very
overwhelming. Very flattering. I feel very lucky. I just want to do
what I can to make the most of it and repay those guys for giving
me the shot of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As a point of reference, history is a wonderful thing. But it
can also carry too much weight. After three races, the only
tradition Sadler can relate to is his newly established one of
getting in wrecks. Daytona: wiped out. Rockingham: wiped out. Las
Vegas: wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks into the season, he's mired in 43rd place (out of 49
drivers) in the points race.
</P>
<P>
   And Sadler is kicking himself. ``It looked like somebody might
have gotten in the back of Michael (Waltrip) and got him around,''
he recalled about the latest wreck. ``There was just so much smoke,
and I just panicked, I guess. I was trying to get slowed down in
time. I tried to go to the inside, and it just locked up on us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to apologize to everybody on this Wood Brothers
team. I've made a lot of bad mistakes the last three weeks, and I
just need to get a gut-check and turn this thing around.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's one nice thing about this racing business. There's a
fresh start just about every weekend. Sunday's Cracker Barrel 500
could be just that for the Woods and Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   While Sadler, who won five times in two full Busch seasons,
continues to define himself as a Winston Cup driver, the Wood
Brothers are trying to ease the burden of history. Forget about the
past, they're telling Sadler, just make notes about what you're
going through now and look ahead.
</P>
<P>
   As early as the 1980s, the words ``legendary'' and ``storied''
usually preceded references to the Wood Brothers teams.
</P>
<P>
   From 1973-79, the Woods, with David Pearson at the wheel, had a
stretch that forged their place in history: 43 victories in seven
years. Eleven victories in 18 starts in 1973; 10 victories in 22
starts in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The team was formed 49 years ago by Glen and Leonard Woods. Glen
drove; Leonard was the chief mechanic. The team is the all-time
Winston Cup leader in superspeedway victories with 80; its 96
victories since 1953 rank third all-time to Petty Enterprises and
Junior Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Woods are also credited with the first organized pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   But the team has won only twice in the '90s and not since Morgan
Shepherd's victory in 1993 at Atlanta, where the team has won a
record 12 times. Waltrip, the Woods driver the past three years,
had only one top-five finish in 95 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Wood Brothers in 1999 include two brothers (Len and Eddie),
a sister (Kim Wood Hall; they're all Glen's children) and uncle
Leonard. Glen is now retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a different era,'' said Len, the co-crew chief and
engine man. ``In the '70s, you would have us, the Pettys and Junior
Johnson winning about 10 races apiece. Nobody else would win. You'd
have seven cars to beat. Now, you've got 42, and it's much tougher.
Plus, add one Jeff Gordon into it and it makes it double tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today's pit crew could be intimidated by the history the
Wood Brothers created 35 years ago, when Ford brought them to
Indianapolis. They developed venters on the gas can to speed the
flow of fuel into the car and cranked out 18-second pit stops in
the Indy 500 that got the family's picture in True magazine. ``Had
them all in top coats and top hats in front of a tobacco barn,''
Len said.
</P>
<P>
   That also is stuff best left in the scrapbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, we try not to look at the past,'' Len said. ``The past
was different. It's like somebody racing their daddy, like Dale Jr.
Does he have to win seven championships and 80 races to be as good
as his daddy? It's a different time. He may win two championshps
and 40 races and still be one of the greatest drivers because of
the time and the competition level.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Woods are trying to be patient with Sadler. ``Obviously,
we're going to have a little bit tougher time with a rookie,'' Len
said. ``Working with him at each place, you take notes. This went
wrong this week or this went good this week. The next time we show
up there, we should be better.''

 &HT;    `There's a bigger picture out there'
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Walt Weiss is set to begin his second
season with the Atlanta Braves, and the 35-year-old shortstop knows
that it has to be better _ even though he hit .435 in his first
month as a Brave and was voted to his first All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, however, hamstring and quadriceps problems limited
him to 96 games, his lowest total since 1991. But none of that
mattered much next to the trauma he endured in nearly losing his
son Brody, then 3 years old, to e-coli poisoning in June.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As you look back, how would you describe last season?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's hard to sum up that year in a million words or less. So
much happened. When I was playing, I thought I played well, but I
missed so much time. And the thing with my son, it was eventful, to
say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the worst moment in dealing with that?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was one day ... when it looked like he was headed for
the worst. There were two other little kids in there, they were two
days ahead of my son as far as all the symptoms and everything. He
was pretty much following suit.
</P>
<P>
   They ended up having to go on respirators and slipped into
comas; he looked like he was right behind them. ... He wouldn't
respond to anything that we said. When he looked at us, he would
kind of stare right through us. ... He was showing signs of it
affecting his brain. That was the worst day through the whole
thing. That next day, he just turned it around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did going through all that change you?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's real easy to take things for granted. We get in our
daily routines. This game basically can consume you. There's a
bigger picture out there, you know? It just reaffirms what's
important.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did that affect your season?
</P>
<P>
   A: After the thing with my son, I felt like I was done. I was
emotionally and mentally spent. At times, it was difficult to
emotionally gear myself up, because it was like there was nothing
there. ...The first half (of the season) was special. The second
half was rough.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you expect from yourself this season?
</P>
<P>
   A: I just want to make sure I enjoy it, and I have fun here.
I've wanted to play ball my whole life, and I'm basically living a
dream, like we all are. Who knows how much more of it is left for
me?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was hitting leadoff comfortable for you last year?
</P>
<P>
   A: I enjoyed the challenge. It wasn't like I had to make a lot
of adjustments. That's my approach anyway at the plate _ I go deep
in the count. I try to have a high walk total, a high on-base
percentage. That's how I'm going to contribute offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Defensively, what do you pride yourself on?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just being reliable, which hurt last year because I was hurt
so much. That really bothered me more than anything, the fact that
I wasn't reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there anything you can do to stay healthy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Some of it may be luck. I'm getting to the point where I'm
pretty in tune with my body. There are just some things I have to
stay on top of, especially in my upper legs and my pelvis area.

 &HT;    Jirsa relieved of coaching duties at UGA
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three weeks after publicly stating that he had ``a
commitment'' to Ron Jirsa as head basketball coach, Georgia
athletics director Vince Dooley fired Jirsa Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a hastily called news conference Thursday evening, Dooley
cited ``no real hope or encouragement as we look to next year or
toward the future'' and Georgia's regression toward the end of the
season, as the main reasons the Bulldogs ``will be making a change
and searching for a new basketball coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs were 35-30 record in two seasons under Jirsa and
twice played in the National Invitation Tournament. But this year's
15-15 team, which consisted of five seniors and the 1998 freshman
of the year, was expected earn an NCAA Tournament berth. Instead,
Georgia lost 11 of its last 14 games, including an embarassing
77-57 loss to Clemson in the first round of the NIT on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose that, more so than anything, was the reason for the
change,'' said Dooley, who attended the Clemson game along with
President Michael Adams and associate AD Dick Bestwick. ``I got
very concerend with the (regular-season ending) loss to South
Carolina, then also concerned with the loss to Alabama as well as
the loss last night in Clemson. I started thinking about it
somewhat after the South Carolina game and it got a lot stronger,
of course, last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooley gave Jirsa a firm vote of confidence following their
21-point loss to Kentucky on Feb. 17. But the Bulldogs lost four of
the next five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody in the media would give somebody the right to
change their mind,'' Dooley said. ``I'm sure everybody has changed
their mind at some point in time in their life. I meant what I
said, but I also said, if you go back and look, that the season is
not over yet. I was hoping the season would finish much better. As
it turned out, it was worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we ended poorly, didn't show any real
improvement. In fact, I felt like we went the other way. I didn't,
I suppose, see what you might say light at the end of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Jirsa did not attend the news conference and did not return
phone calls at his house. He issued a two-sentence statement along
with a notice asking media members to contact him for interviews
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very appreciative of the support of many friends both on
campus and around the state over the past two years,'' Jirsa said
in the statement. ``I'm disappointed things didn't work out
differently but I sincerely wish the players and the program every
success in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Jirsa, 39, has three years remaining on a five-year contract
that pays him approximately $350,000 a year, $111,300 in base
salary. Georgia is contractually obligated to pay Jirsa at least
$333,900, the remaining salary portion, and could provide
additional compensation in form of cars, tickets and country club
memberships.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia assistant coaches Michael Hunt, Reggie Rankin and Jerry
Waters all have one-year contracts that will be honored until their
June 30 expiration date or until they find other work.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley acknowledged that Jirsa had a difficult task in following
Tubby Smith, for whom he served as an assistant and succeeded at
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, Ron had a tough act to follow. His charge,
perhaps better than any one word, was continuity. That was the
object of hiring Ron, to keep the continuity that we had going
(under Tubby Smith).''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, now head coach at Kentucky, was not at all pleased to
hear the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed to hear Ron was let go after just two
years,'' Smith said in New Orleans, where Kentucky opens NCAA
tournament play today. ``It goes to show you what this business is
all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's players also were caught by surprise. Students are on
spring break and most of the players were out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked,'' said senior forward Michael Chadwick. ``He was
telling us to meet back with him on Monday and talk with him. I had
no kind of clue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' added D.A. Layne, who was informed of
the news while watching the NCAA tournament at his home in
Marietta. Dooley said the search will begin immediately for a
successor and he made it clear that he would prefer a Division I
head coach with a proven record of success. He gave no timetable
other than to have someone in place before the spring signing
period in April.
</P>
<P>
   Among the early names rumored to have interest include
Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson, Southwest Missouri's Steve
Alford, Seton Hall's Tommy Amaker and Leonard Hamilton of Miami.

 &HT;    Lady Vols no shoo-in for fourth title in row
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It may have been inconceivable before the season
began, but Tennessee is not such an overwhelming favorite to win an
unprecedented fourth consecutive women's NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   While the Lady Volunteers are still a pretty good bet to be in
the winners' circle in the San Jose Arena on March 28, they haven't
been nearly as dominating as last season's dazzling 39-0 team. And
that gives others hope that the tournament, which begins today at
16 subregional sites, could be up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   But this is March, after all, and coach Pat Summitt has a
sterling 61-11 record in the NCAA Tournament. There's also the
individual pursuit by Tennessee seniors Chamique Holdsclaw and
Kelly Jolly to become the first Division I basketball players, male
or female, to win four national titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go out there and win our fourth championship, and
win it in style,'' Holdsclaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have left the second-ranked Lady Vols (28-2), who open
against Appalachian State on Saturday, with only one backup in the
low post and two in the backcourt. Also, Tennessee is not an
exceptional perimeter shooting team, and at times has not been able
to maintain its extremely intense defensive pace.
</P>
<P>
   However, the starting five, led by Holdsclaw, Jolly and
All-Americans Tamika Catchings and Semeka Randall, is clearly
better than anyone in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Half the 64-team bracket gets under way today, with featured
games involving Connecticut (27-4), the No. 1 seed in the Mideast,
against St. Francis, Pa. (6 p.m., ESPN2) and Louisiana Tech, which
lost to Tennessee in last year's title game, meeting Central
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Purdue (28-1), which snapped Tennessee's 46-game
winning streak in November, gets started on Saturday, as does
12th-ranked Georgia (23-6), which plays Liberty (21-7) at
approximately 8:30 p.m. in Athens in a Mideast subregional. That
game follows one between Toledo (25-5) and SMU (19-10).

 &HT;    Heavyweight unity
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man at the microphone bellows, ``You've got two
kings fighting for three kingdoms,'' which immediately tells you
this must be a boxing story.
</P>
<P>
   No other professional sport has three governing bodies all
crowning (rhymes with clowning) champions _ then strips two titles
away and distributes them elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, the Denver Broncos now are only the Larry
Bowl champions. But the Falcons have been declared Curly Bowl
champs and the Vikings are winners of the Moe Bowl. We hope one day
to unify the Three Stooges.
</P>
<P>
   Despite itself, boxing will take a rare step forward Saturday
evening. Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis each will carry title
belts into the ring at Madison Square Garden. One will leave as the
sole heavyweight champion _ at least of the three most recognized
sanctioning bodies, the WBA, WBC and IBF.
</P>
<P>
   Something so simple has until now been so fractured. There
hasn't been a unified champion since Riddick Bowe, who defeated
Holyfield for the three belts in November of 1992. But shortly
after the fight, Bowe turned down the WBC's mandate that he make an
immediate defense against Lewis (then the No. 1 contender) and made
a show of it by holding a news conference and depositing the belt
into in a garbage can.
</P>
<P>
   ``That disappointed,'' Holyfield said. ``He made a big
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The championship has been in pieces ever since. In fact, there
have been 10 different champions in the last six years: Bowe,
Lewis, Holyfield, Michael Moorer, Oliver McCall, George Foreman,
Bruce Seldon, Frank Bruno, Francois Botha, Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Bowe's belief was that since he defeated Holyfield, he would be
the recognized champion. But in renouncing the WBC title, he
devalued his championship _ then lost all claim to it by losing the
rematch to Holyfield. Holyfield, who has never passed up a mandated
title defense or been stripped of a title, believes fusing the
three together will aid a sport that remains short on sanity. Those
who control the money agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a unified champion filters down to the extent that, as
the heavyweight division goes, so goes boxing,'' said Time Warner
Sports vice president Lou DiBella. ``Last year was a very dormant
year in heavyweight boxing, and the perception was it was a down
year for boxing in general. The truth is there were some pretty
decent fights, a lot of new young champions emerged, three Olympic
fighters won titles. It wasn't such a bad year for boxing. But
because of the heavyweight division, the perception was boxing
suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Dino Duva said, ``None of the top guys ever fight each
other any more. This fight is crucial and significant for boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBella already has asked WBC president Jose Sulaiman not to
dictate any ludicrous title defenses to Saturday's winner, but he
isn't terribly confident. The WBA wants the winner to fight Henry
Akinwande. John Ruiz is in line for a shot for the WBC. David Tua
is the IBF's No. 1 contender. Sanctioning bodies make most of their
money off fees in title fights, which they can more easily control
with lesser-known ``champions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart money would have to be that somewhere down the line
soon, the titles will splinter again,'' DiBella said.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer and a longtime observer of
boxing's boardroom declarations, said, ``I don't think the title
will be together for longer than six months. It's all based on
politics and money. Until you see boxing regulated by a single
body, it's very hard for me to see things ever changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield hopes to do his part. If he defeats Lewis, he plans to
defend against Akinwande. But it's conceivable he would retire
either before or after that bout, leaving the three crowns in limbo
again. That's not Holyfield's immediate concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about this fight happening,'' he said. ``Only two
people have really set out to put the belts back together _ myself
and Mike Tyson. After Larry Holmes was champion for a while, we had
guys like Trevor Berbick and Pinklon Thomas, and none of those guys
would fight each other. Then Riddick won it and (his manager) Rock
Newman was like, `We're gonna do what we want.' I've had my mind
set on unifying since 1995 after losing to Bowe (in their third
fight). I've stuck to my guns. When I fought (then-mandatory
contender) Moorer (in 1994), they said, `Why don't you fight Lennox
instead and give up the belt?' It's because I've never been one to
go against the rules and regulations. Now I'm the guy they come
to.''
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of talent in the heavyweight division led DiBella to
say that the only other big fight out there is ``the rematch.''
That's assuming no sanctioning bodies gets in the way.
</P>
<P>
   For at least one night, one man can accessorize with three
belts.
</P>
<P>
   FUSING THE ALPHABETS IN BOXING
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Saturday's heavyweight title fight between Evander
Holyfield (WBA, IBF) and Lennox Lewis (WBC) will create the first
unified champion since Riddick Bowe. After taking the the belts
from Holyfield on Nov. 13, 1992, Bowe renounced the WBC portion a
month later rather than make a mandatory defense against Lewis,
then the No. 1 contender:
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBC) May 8, 1993: Lewis decisions Tony Tucker for the title
vacated by Bowe.
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBA, IBF) Nov. 6, 1993: After two successful defenses, Bowe
loses a rematch to Holyfield by majority decision.
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBA, IBF) April 22, 1994: Holyfield, in his first defense,
surprisingly loses a decision to Michael Moorer. He suffers from
severe shoulder pain and dehydration, eventually leading to a
misdiagnosed heart problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBC) Sept. 24, 1994: Lewis, after wins over Frank Bruno and
Phil Jackson, is stopped in two rounds by Oliver McCall in England.
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBA, IBF) Nov. 5, 1994: Moorer dominates first nine rounds of
his first defense against George Foreman, but is knocked out in the
10th round.
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBA) March 4, 1995: Foreman, ignoring the WBA's order to
defend his title against then-No. 1 ranked (again) Tucker, is
stripped by the WBA, which orders an elimination bout between
Tucker and Bruce Seldon.
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBA) April 8, 1995: Seldon claims the WBA title with a
seventh-round TKO over Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   _ (IBF) June 29, 1995: Foreman is stripped of his second belt
when he declines the IBF's unusual mandate to fight a rematch with
Axel Schulz after Foreman's disputed win by decision April 22. The
IBF, like the WBA, orders a title elimination match between Frans
Botha and Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBC) Sept. 2, 1995: McCall, in his second defense, loses a
decision to Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   _ (IBF) Dec. 9, 1995: Botha decisions Schulz for title but tests
positive for steroids and is stripped. IBF orders a new title fight
between Botha and Moorer.
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBC) March 16, 1996: Mike Tyson wins his first title since
his return from prison with a third-round TKO over Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   _ (IBF) June 12, 1996: Moorer decisions Schulz for title.
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBA/WBC) Sept. 7, 1996: Tyson seemingly fuses two belts by
easily beating WBA champ Seldon with a first-round knockout. But
WBC belt is in limbo after Lewis goes to court to win a title shot.
Tyson chooses to bypass bout for more lucrative and perceived
easier fight against Holyfield. Courts mandate that WBC award its
belt to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBA) Nov. 9, 1996: Tyson is stunned by a 12-to-1 underdog _
Holyfield, who wins by an 11th-round TKO.
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBC) Feb. 7, 1997: Lewis, in his first ``title defense,''
avenges loss to McCall with a fifth-round TKO when McCall suffers a
nervous breakdown. He makes four more defenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBA/IBF) Nov. 8, 1997: Holyfield, after winning a rematch
with Tyson, unifies two of the belts by knocking down Moorer five
times and winning by eighth-round TKO.
</P>
<P>
   _ (WBC/WBA/IBF) March 13, 1999: Holyfield fights Lewis.

 &HT;    Weigh-in: Lewis 246, Holyfield 215
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Evander Holyfield's proclamation that he is going to
knock out Lennox Lewis in the third round of Saturday's heavyweight
title unification is having a pronounced effect in Las Vegas,
prediction central.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield remains an overall favorite of about 7-5 at the
Caesars Palace Sportsbook. But the odds of him winning by
third-round KO have plummeted _ from 30-1 to open to 22-1 on
Wednesday to 15-1 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield smiled when informed of the odds at Thursday's
weigh-in, saying, ``I'm gonna do it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thomas, Holyfield's attorney, said, ``Wow! I guess people
are starting to wake up. Betting against Evander Holyfield is never
a smart thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewis camp is not moved by the odds, and in fact felt buoyed
by the weigh-in. Lewis weighed in at 246 pounds, which is 31
heavier than Holyfield (215).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's too light _ Lennox will just destroy him,'' said Frank
Maloney, Lewis' manager, as Holyfield stepped off the scales.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-pound differential is not the greatest disparity for a
Holyfield fight. In 1991, Holyfield (208) weighed 49 pounds less
than George Foreman (257).
</P>
<P>
   At 246, Lewis was three pounds heavier than for his two previous
bouts against Zeljko Mavrovic and Shannon Briggs, but he has been
as high as 251 for Oliver McCall last year. Holyfield weighed 217
for his last fight against Vaughn Bean in September and was 214
previous to that against Michael Moorer. For what it's worth,
Holyfield also hadn't eaten lunch before the 4 p.m. weigh-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good at this weight,'' he said. ``I never worry about
what the other guy weighs; I only worry about what I weigh.

 &HT;    Sabates still revs up NASCAR
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His stock-car racing team isn't doing much in points
or earnings at the moment, but car owner Felix Sabates still leads
Winston Cup in candor.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions _ he's full of 'em.
</P>
<P>
   On the delayed delivery of the new Chevrolet Monte Carlo:
``NASCAR doesn't want to give Chevrolet a great car right off the
bat, because then we have the crybabies of Ford doing the crying.
They're trying to make the Monte Carlo not as good as the Taurus at
the beginning, because they know we're going to make the car better
at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   On the crying by car owners: ``This is a game. The Chevy people
cry. The Ford people cry. We all cry. We're nothing but a bunch of
crybabies. You hope at the end, the one that cries the most ends up
with the breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   On minorities in racing: ``People say what is the average NASCAR
fan going to think if you have blacks in this sport? I saw
something (recently): Coors had a party, about a thousand people.
Jim Brown walked in there unannounced and 999 people went to him
for autographs. The women all wanted pictures with him. The guy's
63 years old, but he's still got the charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   On the chances of a rookie ever winning the Daytona 500:
``They're not going to let any rookie win Daytona. He'll be upside
down on the back straightaway, his roof flap would be digging a
trench on the race track.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ever-changing world of Winston Cup racing, he's still
Felix after all these years.
</P>
<P>
   This is the team owner who once celebrated a victory by
rewarding his crew chief with a motorcycle and the crew with a
boat. He once showed up at a speedway media center with two armed
guards and $1 million in cash, challenging Rusty Wallace to lap the
field in a Pontiac after the driver complained that the car Sabates
was running at the time had been given too much of an edge by
NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   In his 10th year as a team owner, Sabates still draws a crowd,
because he is perhaps the most entertaining owner in the garage.
One wonders what the size of his audience might be if his team
actually won a race, which hasn't happened since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Team Sabco tries again this week in the Cracker Barrel Old
Country Store 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Sterling Marlin will
attempt to qualify the No. 40 Chevy, Joe Nemechek the No. 42 Chevy.
A season of anticipated improvement is enduring a slow start.
Marlin is 30th in points (242), Nemechek 34th (204).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working with the new Monte Carlo,'' Sabates said.
``The street car that we have is a race car. Unlike the Ford. They
came out with a four-door taxicab that they converted to a race
car.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Cuban-American, Sabates might be the only minority in
Winston Cup. He is asked often about the absence of minorities in
stock-car racing. He said it takes sponsorship and diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Julius Erving and (ex-NFL player Joe Washington, owners
of a Busch Series team) came in, they came in like, `I'm Julius,
come here and give me stuff.' They turned people off.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabates compared that to the style of former NFL stars Jim Brown
and Willie Lanier, who are considering starting a Winston Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that Jim Brown and Willie Lanier are doing it, in a
very humble way, they're doing their homework and talking to
sponsors, talking to drivers; they're trying to start from the
bottom up rather than from the top down,'' Sabates said. ``We're
going to help them, car-wise and engine-wise. I might even invest
with them. I see the opportunities there to tap a whole new market
in NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone appreciates Sabates' opinions. But that hasn't
slowed him from having them. Last year, he raised some tempers by
gushing about Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said if you took Jeff Gordon and put him on the Sabco team
he'd probably win 13 races, but you take Ray Evernham and put him
on the Sabco team, you might not win any races,'' Sabates said.
``It got a lot of people upset. I didn't mean that as a put-down to
my drivers or to Ray Evernham. But Jeff Gordon is an individual
that comes very few in a lifetime. I bet if you put him in a Jeep
Wagoneer with three wheels, he'd probably win nine races.''

FORMER DEATH ROW INMATE IS EXONERATED IN TWO MURDERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Anthony Porter, who spent 16 years on death row for a
double murder before college journalism students found evidence to
clear him, was exonerated of the killings Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Thomas Fitzgerald of Cook County Circuit Court
overturned both murder convictions against Porter, who came within
two days of being executed for the 1982 shooting deaths of a young
couple during a robbery in a South Side park.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, 43, was released from jail last month after a group of
Northwestern University students found evidence of his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, thanking all of the participants in the case, said,
``I am personally profoundly grateful that we were spared the
unthinkable conclusion to this case.''
</P>
<P>
   He specifically cited ``those outside the system,'' referring to
the students and their professor, David Protess, who obtained a
videotaped statement from Alstory Simon, a Milwaukee laborer who
admitted killing the couple, Jerry Hillard and Marilyn Green.
</P>
<P>
   Protess, who assigns murder cases to his class each semester to
re-investigate, said this about the case: ``It is a great day when
a wrongful murder conviction is overturned. This just shows that
the machinery of death in this state is broken and there is no way
to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the death penalty was reinstated in Illinois in 1977, 11
inmates have been executed and 11 others have been released after
new evidence raised questions about their guilt, prompting calls
for a statewide moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   Though cleared of the murder charges, Porter remains convicted
of armed robbery and related weapons charges that were also heard
at his 1983 murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant State Attorney Thomas Gainer said that the reopened
investigation had led his office to believe that Porter was
innocent of the murders. But Gainer said the prosecutors still
believed that Porter was in the park that night and committed the
armed robbery against the couple.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing has been set for next month to determine whether those
convictions will also be vacated.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there is compelling evidence, both old and new, that
Alstory Simon committed these murders, there is nothing that
diminishes the evidence against Anthony Porter on the armed robbery
charge,'' Gainer said. ``A hearing must be held so that evidence
can be considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter's lawyer, Daniel R. Sanders, said that at the very least
there should be a new trial on the armed robbery charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony was convicted of the armed robbery in the same trial
that a jury was hearing incorrect testimony about a double homicide
which we now know didn't exist,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had to have had a dramatic prejudicial effect on the
jury. But we maintain that Anthony Porter was not in the park that
night and he didn't commit any of these crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald suggested that even if the robbery conviction was
reaffirmed, Porter would very likely not return to prison because
of the time he had already served.
</P>
<P>
   Porter expressed relief Thursday as he left the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God I'm free,'' he said. ``I'm innocent of all these
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six students who helped free Porter attended the
hearing with Protess, who questioned prosecutors' motives for
maintaining the armed robbery conviction. After their
investigation, the students concluded that Porter was also innocent
of the robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case of this magnitude, where an innocent man was almost
executed, it would be too great of a leap for the state to vacate
all of the convictions at one time,'' Protess said. ``It would be
an acknowledgment that they were so mistaken right from the start,
which I don't believe they're ready to admit. It's an unwillingness
to apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon has been charged with the murders and remains in custody.
A lawyer for Simon has said his client shot the couple in
self-defense.

BANKERS TRUST ADMITS IT MISUSED MONEY UNCLAIMED BY CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Germany)   (EDS: This is a late add to page 1 of The New York Times.)  
(js) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bankers Trust Co. pleaded guilty Thursday to federal
criminal charges that senior officers and employees had illegally
diverted $19.1 million in unclaimed checks and other credits owed
to customers to the bank's own books to enhance its financial
performance. The bank agreed to pay a $60 million fine to the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The bank also said it would pay a separate fine of $3.5 million
to New York state authorities for the illegal scheme. Some of the
unclaimed funds taken by the bank were to have been turned over to
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Manhattan also charged that in the
scheme, which occurred between 1994 and 1996, the bank's officials,
including a partner and a managing director, had created a ``slush
fund'' of the unclaimed money that they used to supplement income
or offset expenses ``as needed'' at the end of financial reporting
periods, falsely enhancing the bank's financial results for that
period.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, called the senior
bank officials' behavior brazen and a ``willful disregard for their
legal obligations with respect to the proper handling of unclaimed
customer funds and abandoned property.''
</P>
<P>
   She credited other Bankers Trust officials with first uncovering
the scheme in 1996 and reporting it to the government, but she also
accused the bank of initially minimizing ``the extent of the
culpability of its officers and employees.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that the scheme originated after Bankers Trust's
senior management had ``placed severe pressure'' on managers to
generate revenues and meet expense targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankers Trust's guilty plea demonstrates the serious
consequences for all financial institutions that would violate the
law by misapplying their customers' funds in order to falsely
enhance their financial results,'' she said, adding: ``It is
conduct that will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   At an evening court proceeding in U.S. district court in
Manhattan, David D. Brown IV, a managing director and counsel for
the bank, said that the bank had fired all the officers and
employees involved in the scheme. Court documents said 13 people
were involved.
</P>
<P>
   The document did not name the employees, and bank officials
refused to identify them. The plea bargain document explicitly
states that in accepting the bank's plea, prosecutors will continue
to prosecute people who may have been involved in the illegal
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank acknowledges the violations of U.S. criminal law to
which it is pleading guilty,'' Brown told Judge John Koeltl. ``The
bank accepts responsibility for these transactions and the conduct
of its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Newman, chairman and chief executive officer of Bankers
Trust, said by phone Thursday night that the bank had cooperated
fully with the authorities and would continue to do so as the
investigation continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unfortunate situation, no question about it,''
Newman said. ``On the other hand, it's something that's years old.
We pursued it actively. We launched an investigation. We reported
it to the authorities, and made the necessary changes and brought
in the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Ms. White's characterization that bank officials had
initially minimized the responsibility of its officers and
employees, Newman said that it had taken the bank ``months and
months'' to uncover the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they are saying is that during that process, we
discovered that some of the people who we didn't know in the
beginning were involved in this turned out to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   During the initial meetings with outside authorities, Newman
said, ``some of those people were there for the discussions. They
may not have said, `Hey, I was part of this.' They didn't hold up
their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank AG said in November that it would acquire Bankers
Trust for $10.1 billion. The acquisition is expected to result in
the elimination of 5,500 jobs, mostly in New York and London.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Bankers Trust would be the largest foreign
takeover of an American bank and would vault Deutsche Bank over UBS
AG of Switzerland and the new Citigroup as the world's biggest bank
in assets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the acquisition is something that Newman had long sought to
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, founded in 1903 to handle the trust business of
other large banks, had transformed itself in the late 1980s and
1990s into one of the most aggressive and innovative trading shops
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of derivatives scandals a few years ago wreaked
financial havoc on the bank. A handful of companies said they were
hit with large unexpected losses from complex deals with Bankers
Trust, leading to the departure of Charles S. Sanford Jr. as its
chairman and the ascent of Newman to that position in 1995. The
company was embarrassed when a court made public transcripts of
telephone calls between Bankers Trust employees gloating about how
much money they were making and how little their clients understood
the risk of the deals being made.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an uneven performance through the first half of 1998,
Newman was still well positioned to keep Deutsche Bank at a
distance until the torrent of ill will unleashed by the acquisition
of Alex. Brown &AMP; Sons, which was a regional brokerage firm, and
substantial trading losses in July and August combined to weaken
his standing.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Bankers Trust, posting its next-to-last earnings
report before the expected completion of its acquisition by
Deutsche Bank, said profit in its fourth quarter plunged 54
percent.

EDITORIAL: MISGUIDED CHAUVINISM ON ORGANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Friday, March 12: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The way donated human organs are distributed to patients in this
country urgently needs reform. A report released by the Department
of Health and Human Services shows wide geographic disparities in
waiting times for livers, kidneys and other organs needed to save
lives. The median wait for patients with blood type O for a liver
transplant in New York City, for example, is 511 days, while the
wait a few miles away in New Jersey is 56 days. These irrational
differences arise from a system that often requires that organs be
used in the area where they are donated even though they might be
more urgently needed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has blocked an order from the Health and Human Services
Secretary, Donna Shalala, that might have produced reform. Last
year Ms. Shalala directed the United Network for Organ Sharing, a
private organization that distributes donated organs, to devise a
new allocation strategy. Her department outlined general goals,
such as establishing standards for ranking patients on transplant
waiting lists, but left the details up to the network.
</P>
<P>
   Many transplant centers lobbied vigorously against change,
however, fearing that new rules would reduce their current supply
of locally donated organs. Congress then inserted a provision in
last year's omnibus budget bill to delay the effective date of the
directive until this coming October, and asked the Institute of
Medicine to review the problem, which it is doing now.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile a handful of states have tried to pre-empt the entire
debate with laws designed to give top priority to in-state
residents, even though patients elsewhere may have more critical
needs. These misconceived laws reflect a dangerous parochialism
that, if copied in other states, can only threaten needy patients
everywhere by limiting the availability of organ donations to
increasingly smaller geographic areas.
</P>
<P>
   An important reason for the transplant crisis, apart from the
flawed delivery system, is that the nation as a whole faces a
severe organ shortage. More than 61,000 Americans are on organ
transplant waiting lists. Some 4,000 patients die every year while
waiting for an organ. The Clinton administration has taken some
remedial steps. For example, it has required hospitals to notify
organ procurement organizations whenever a hospital patient dies,
so that no potential donor is overlooked. The current budget
significantly increases funding for programs to encourage
donations.
</P>
<P>
   But increased donations alone will not eliminate the problem of
unfair geographic distribution. That can best be solved by uniform
medical criteria that give patients in all regions a fair shot at a
lifesaving transplant, regardless of where they live. This issue
must ultimately be addressed at the national level. Until it is,
state legislatures should resist passing laws that would make the
problem worse.

HOUSE MOVES AHEAD WITH KOSOVO DEBATE OVER WHITE HOUSE OBJECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS with outcome of House vote; complete writethru) 
(EDS: This is once again a page 1 story.) 
(wg) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House rejected an effort to oppose the
deployment of U.S. troops in Kosovo as it debated Balkan policy
well into the night on Thursday despite the Clinton
administration's objections.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 178-237, rejecting an amendment offered by Rep. Tillie
Fowler, R-Fla., left it quite likely, though still not certain,
that the House would ultimately vote on a resolution to endorse
sending troops to Kosovo as part of a NATO peacekeeping force, in
the event that a settlement is reached in the Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Passionate and sharply divided, House members argued throughout
the day and into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of deploying the troops argued that the United States
had to help stop a ``genocidal war'' that could ignite a broader
conflict. Opponents countered that Europe, not the United States,
should police a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Although any House action on the issue would not be binding on
Clinton, the vote was taken at a crucial diplomatic juncture in the
faltering peace effort, as a new round of international
negotiations over Kosovo was scheduled to resume on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The main resolution still under consideration in the House would
authorize the president to deploy U.S. troops to join a NATO
peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Congressional officials from both
parties said the vote on that resolution was too close to call,
keeping alive the possibility of a sharp repudiation for Clinton,
even as he traveled overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Senior members of the president's foreign policy team, many
overseas, called lawmakers throughout the day. In Guatemala,
Clinton said, ``I do not believe that Congress should take any
action that will in effect pre-empt the peace process or encourage
either side to say no to it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright implored the
House to hold off, saying that a vote against troops at a delicate
moment of western diplomacy would be seen as ``a green light to
resume fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   She was backed by Bob Dole, former Republican presidential
candidate and Senate majority leader, who warned Congress that a no
vote could ``throw cold water on any possible agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an aggressive assertion of Congress' role in foreign
policy, House Speaker Dennis Hastert refused to heed the call for
delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to be direct and honest with the president and
his secretary of state,'' Hastert said on the House floor. ``I told
them that I believed it was my duty as speaker to ensure that
members of the House of Representatives, Republican and Democrat,
have the opportunity to fairly and openly debate this important
issue before troops are sent into a potentially dangerous
situation. I believe Congress must have a meaningful role in this
decision, no matter how difficult our choice nor how hard our
task.''
</P>
<P>
   The day was also a test of how Hastert would compare with Newt
Gingrich, a confirmed internationalist. The Illinoisian said in a
late afternoon interview that he had told Albright a while ago that
``probably my presumption would be I would be favorable to'' the
proposal to deploy 4,000 troops as part of a 28,000-member NATO
force.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he would not finally decide until he had heard the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   He was also unapologetic about his timing for forcing the issue
to the floor. ``We need to have an open debate,'' Hastert said in
the interview. ``The White House _ I'm just being perfectly honest
about this _ was rather reticent to come up to Congress to try to
sell this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The House majority leader, Dick Armey, and the Republican whip,
Tom DeLay, opposed deploying troops. DeLay called the plan a ``big
dangerous quagmire'' and ``another bad idea in a foreign policy
with no focus.'' He said the Clinton administration had become too
dependent on airstrikes or the threats of airstrikes, speaking of
bombings in Iraq, strikes against targets in Sudan and Afghanistan
and the threat of air strikes against Serbian targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bombing sovereign nations for ill-defined reasons with vague
objectives undermines U.S. stature in the world,'' DeLay said.
``The international respect and trust for America is diminished
every time we casually let the bombs fly. We must stop giving the
appearance that our foreign policy is formulated by the
Unabomber.''
</P>
<P>
   Through hours of sharp debate into the night, members clashed
over the post-Cold War role of the United States, as well as over
the U.S. leadership role in NATO. The members argued over whether
outsiders could ever end the ethnic strife in the Balkans, where
two world wars began, and expressed misgivings about the length of
the U.S. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which Clinton had once
promised would be limited in time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The debate split the Republican Party. Most Democrats spoke out
in support of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall Bosnia, my friends,'' Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C.,
said. ``The president told us our troops would be back home, I
believe, by December of 1996. But when I last checked, December
1996 has come and long gone, and our troops are still there.''
</P>
<P>
   In disagreeing, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said, ``There really is
a moral obligation for those who have the resources to intercede.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats spoke forcefully for deployment and questioned
why the Republican leadership had scheduled such a debate when a
new round of diplomacy was beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the height of irresponsibility,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt,
the House minority leader, said. ``This should not be about
politics. It should not be about giving the administration a black
eye. This is about ending a humanitarian catastrophe and preventing
the slaughter of thousands of innocent people caught in a simmering
ethnic conflict.''

 &HT;    167 Texas counties declared at high risk for fires
 &HT;    By staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, citing an abnormally dry
winter, on Thursday declared 167 counties as emergency areas
because of imminent fire danger.
</P>
<P>
   The counties, including Travis, Bastrop, Williamson, Caldwell,
Hays and Burnet, are generally those west of and along Interstate
35 and Interstate 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious situation, and we must take steps now to
reduce fire risk, put firefighting equipment and personnel in
place, and conserve water.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the emergency declaration, Bush asked President
Clinton to make the state eligible for additional resources for
fighting wild fires. Bush also wants all counties to consider bans
on outdoor burning. Thirty-five counties, including Hays and
Caldwell, already have enacted such bans.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also asked all cities and water suppliers to
prepare water conservation plans to put in effect if the drought
predictions prove accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though many of us are having some cool and drizzly days,
we should not get a false sense of security,'' he said. ``The
drought has a head start on most of Texas this year, and we must be
prepared to conserve water and prevent fires today.''COMMITTEE
CLEARS HATE CRIME BILL
</P>
<P>
   A House committee voted 6-2 on the James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes
Act, named in memory of the black man dragged to his death behind a
truck in East Texas last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that if this bill is passed, it will not bring my
brother back,'' Louvon Harris, Byrd's youngest sister, told the
Judicial Affairs Committee on Thursday. ``But I have friends and
family who still have to live in this society. I want it passed for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the legislation were vice chairman Rep. Will
Hartnett (R-Dallas) and Rep. John Shields (R-San Antonio).
</P>
<P>
   ``A crime is a crime, and the fact that one child could be
killed and punished differently than another child because of the
motivation of the killer is not equal protection under the law,''
Hartnett said.SENATOR LINKS BILL TO SPEED TRAPS
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gregory Luna says a bill passed Thursday by the Senate
would encourage speed traps around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill by Sen. Teel Bivins (R-Amarillo), the state's 85
school districts that have police departments, including the Austin
Independent School District, would get half of the fines they
collect from Class C misdemeanor crimes committed on school
property or at school-sponsored events. Class C misdemeanors can
include motor vehicle crimes, such as speeding.
</P>
<P>
   Luna (D-San Antonio) said if schools know they will get some of
the money, they will push officers to issue more citations.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said he doubted that would happen but he will revisit the
issue if it does.
</P>
<P>
   DEADLINE TO FILE BILLS IS TODAY
</P>
<P>
   Today is the last day for legislators to file proposed laws.
</P>
<P>
   Already, thousands of bills are working their way through the
legislative process. Hundreds more could be filed today.
</P>
<P>
   After today, the 60th day of the session, lawmakers will have to
seek permission from their colleagues to file a bill. If that
fails, or if they want to go another route to get a late idea
through the process, lawmakers could attempt to rewrite a similar
bill with their unfiled proposals.
</P>
<P>
   That process is known as substituting a bill.

 &HT;    Texas universities' high-rise dorms don't meet fire safety
standards
 &HT;    By Angela Shah
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sixteen high-rise dormitories on Texas
university campuses _ in particular Jester Towers at the University
of Texas _ lack fire safety equipment like sprinklers and lighted
exits, a state fire marshal told legislators Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A yearlong inspection of 23 dorms at state universities
uncovered dozens of state fire safety code violations at high-rise
dorms at public universities. The inspections stem from by a 1997
fire in a 13-story Texas Tech dormitory that injured several
students. A parent's complaint about the fire led to the the state
fire marshal inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the inspections showed that many of the
``high-rise'' dorms had battery-powered smoke detectors _ some that
did not work _ lacked sprinkler systems and did not have
spring-loaded mechanisms to swing doors closed.
</P>
<P>
   Jester at UT, which houses 3,000 students, was at the top of the
fire marshal's list for needing attention. The 11-story, two-tower
dorm has no sprinkler system, no emergency lighting in its basement
and tower stairwells are not smokeproof, among other things. Some
fire safety improvements are not scheduled to be finished until
2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous not to have sprinklers in the high-rises,''
said Wayne Smith, director of fire safety inspections for the fire
marshal's office. ``By definition, high-rises are above the level
that the fire department (ladders) can get to.'' Most fire
department ladders stretch seven stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a sprinkler system,'' Smith added, ``you can get
to a fire before it's out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported to a higher education subcommittee of
the state House Appropriations Committee, which writes the state
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very concerned that the universities have not been more
timely on this, but I am encouraged by the timeline with the state
fire marshal,'' said State Rep. Dianne Delisi (R-Temple). ``But
this needs to be an ongoing effort. They need to inspect the
buildings on a regular basis. I'm surprised it hasn't already been
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The state fire marshal inspects government buildings on request
or when a complaint is made.
</P>
<P>
   State Fire Marshal Mike Davis told subcommittee members that the
23 universities plan to complete renovations by 2004. Some
improvements, which will cost millions, are contingent on obtaining
funding, state fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Until that time, Davis said the fire marshal's office will
inspect all the properties every four months. State lawmakers said
they will review inspection reports.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the buildings at the universities were built in the
1960s and 1970s before sprinkler systems and other measures were
required, administrators said. The Life Safety Code, which most
states around the country use as the fire safety code for all
public and private buildings, was not state law in Texas until
1995. Once it became state law, Smith said the fire marshal's
office had authority to cite state buildings for code violations.
</P>
<P>
   Universities say they understand the need for sprinklers and
other fire safety tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that fire safety is not a priority. The sprinklers
will be done in four phases during the summers,'' said UT vice
president for legal and administrative affairs Patricia Ohlendorf.
``We've made a number of improvements in Jester since it was built
in the 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlendorf said Jester has fire hoses on each floor, fire
evacuation maps on each resident door and hard-wired smoke
detectors _ which are still being installed. A new fire alarm
system will be operational next month.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Abboud a sophomore who lives on Jester's first floor, said
he feels safe without the sprinklers. But he moved from the third
floor last fall, in part, because his mother was concerned about
fire dangers. He added that the battery-controlled smoke detector
in his room was replaced with a central-system smoke detector and
UT checks it regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom was concerned about the sprinklers, but she feels OK
about it now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Fire Prevention Association in Battery
Park, Mass., sprinklers reduce the chances of dying and the loss of
property damage from a fire by one-half to two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Several universities say the improvements will take at least two
years primarily because of the cost of completing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about millions and millions,'' said Mike
Griffith, building safety director at Stephen F. Austin University
in Nacogdoches.
</P>
<P>
   SFA's 10-story, two-tower Steen Hall lacks a sprinkler system,
door closers and an emergency light at the main entrance. When fire
officials inspected it last year, they did not fidn a service
record for the fire alarm. Complying with the fire code will cost
about $1.8 million, Griffith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're state-funded,'' he said, ``you can't just pull it
out of the sky.''

 &HT;    Laroche misses mark; Rykiel hits pop spot
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Guy Laroche line, which hasn't packed much punch on
the American market for decades, did little to rise in the rankings
with its showing Thursday morning. At its trendiest, belts were the
focal point of this collection. Coats, sweaters, blouses and skirts
all featured a belt of some sort, most notably in snakeskin. Some
of these belts even seemed attuned to the ``utility'' phase fashion
is going through, given that they included zippered pockets.
</P>
<P>
   There were some nice, reversible sheared fur coats, and the
mohair dresses and jackets looked delightful to the touch. The main
colors in play _ green, pink and brown _ were indicative of how
mismatched this collection was to most women's needs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sonia Rykiel: The wiry-haired designer Sonia Rykiel has witty
ways of incorporating figments of pop culture into her collections.
</P>
<P>
   Last year during her spring/summer preview, she hitched a ride
on hip-hop's coattails and produced a bevy of ultrabaggy,
cargo-style pants and floppy hats; and for her fall/winter '99
collection shown Thursday, Rykiel culled the current kiss-and-tell
craze and adorned most of her clothes with lipstick prints of
Lewinskyan proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The embroidered, sequined or appliqued lip prints were placed on
all the imaginable/unmentionable erogenous zones. They were
disconcertingly prevalent distractions from the luxurious cashmere,
angora and alpaca separates Rykiel started her show with. Rykiel's
take on the ``sweater-dressing'' trend featured floor-length
pleated skirts with high splits, ribbed knit bathrobe-style coats
and long ski cardigans.
</P>
<P>
   All the knitwear in the collection realistically addressed
women's need for warmth, but with so many high-tech materials at
designers' disposal these days, Rykiel's clothes appeared rather
retro.

IRAN'S PRESIDENT MEETS WITH POPE IN THE VATICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Repeating for all needing.)  
 (bl)  
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Seeking to improve relations between Christianity and
Islam, Pope John Paul II gave a private audience to Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami on Thursday. It was the first papal
encounter with an Iranian head of state since the shah's regime.
</P>
<P>
   As the pope escorted Khatami, a Muslim Shiite cleric, out of his
study in St. Peter's after a 25-minute talk, he called their
meeting ``very important and promising.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit was particularly important to Khatami, a moderate who
is the first Iranian leader to visit Western Europe since the
Islamic revolution in 1979. He came seeking to improve Iran's
economic and political ties with the West.
</P>
<P>
   As he was leaving, Khatami asked the pope to pray for him and
for the pope's own health and success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is for the final victory of monotheism, ethics and
morality, together with peace and reconciliation,'' he told the
pope through a translator. ``May God protect you.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit was described as cordial and friendly. One member of
the Iranian delegation, also a cleric, was apparently so moved that
as he passed the pope on his way out, he stopped and asked John
Paul if he could do something. He then leaned down and kissed the
pope on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has long stressed the common bonds and beliefs between
Christianity, Islam and other faiths. Since he arrived in Italy on
Tuesday, so has Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the divine faiths are not quintessentially different,''
Khatami said in a speech Wednesday to the European University
Institute at Fiesole, near Florence.
</P>
<P>
   The last meeting between a pope and a top Iranian leader was in
1970, when Pope Paul VI was greeted during an airport stopover in
Tehran by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi. The Vatican did not break
diplomatic relations with Iran after the revolution, and John Paul
has talked with other Iranian officials in the Vatican, but
Thursday was his highest-level meeting. Iran currently holds the
chairmanship of the 54-nation Islamic Conference, and that gave the
audience additional weight.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The meeting with the pope, therefore, assumes capital
importance,'' the papal nuncio in Iran, Archbishop Romeo Panciroli,
said on Vatican radio.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami also met with Vatican City's secretary of state,
Cardinal Angelo Sodano. According to a Vatican spokesman, they
discussed the Middle East, Christian-Islamic dialogue and human
rights in Iran, including the rights of Catholics there.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican is interested in improving conditions for Christians
in Iran, a small community of about 120,000 in a total population
of nearly 70 million. There are only 13,000 Catholics, and they are
allowed to worship in their churches, but according to Fides, the
missionary news agency of the Holy See, Catholics are strictly
watched and denied some civil rights, like serving in the army or
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian government is less tolerant of larger minorities
like the Bahais, followers of a faith that originated in
19th-century Persia and that Iranian clerics consider apostasy.
Rights organizations and Iranian dissident groups say the Bahais
are fiercely persecuted by the more conservative wings of the
Iranian judiciary and by security forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, where security for Khatami was tighter than for any
official visitor since Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989,
about 50 Iranian demonstrators managed to squeeze into a far corner
of St. Peter's Square, but were cordoned off by barriers and a wall
of police officers, who outnumbered the demonstrators almost two to
one.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters waved banners and shouted slogans against
Khatami. ``He is a fascist and a terrorist!'' one protester
screamed. Despite the security, protesters managed to throw
paint-filled eggs at Khatami's motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, Salman Rushdie was in Italy at the same time as
Khatami, receiving an honorary degree Wednesday at the University
of Turin. Rushdie was sentenced to death in 1989 by Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary leader at the time, who
accused the writer of blasphemy against Islam in his novel ``The
Satanic Verses.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September Khatami's government lifted the sentence, known
as a fatwa. But conservative clerics reaffirmed the sentence on the
10th anniversary of Khomeini's decree.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami did not publicly mention Rushdie during his visit, but
Iranian newspapers sharply criticized Italy for acting as host to
Rushdie during the president's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Before visiting the pope, Khatami had a breakfast meeting at the
Italian Foreign Ministry with two dozen top business executives,
including Guglielmo Moscato, chairman of Ente Nazionale
Idrocarburi, the Italian energy conglomerate. ENI and the French
energy group Elf-Aquitaine recently signed a $1 billion contract to
develop an offshore oilfield in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   A Foreign Ministry official said Khatami sought to reassure the
executives that Iranian society is opening up and that foreign
investors could have confidence in the new climate.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who flew back to Tehran on Thursday, told the
pope that he left with ``beautiful memories'' of his visit in the
Vatican.

 &HT;    Robert enters a killer's mind with great insight
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 14.
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  A Sight for Sore Eyes. By Ruth Rendell. Crown. $24.
</P>
<P>
   Fine writing, a hallmark of Ruth Rendell's mysteries, is matched
by her insight into sociopathology in one of the best of her 42
books. The lives of three characters are traced over two decades.
Teddy, product of an uncaring environment, develops into a
promising artisan with no conscience or comprehension of love.
Francine, 19, whom he loves instantly and obsessively, was a child
when she witnessed her mother's murder.
</P>
<P>
   The trauma left Francine temporarily unable to speak, but she
has since recovered and been accepted at Oxford. She is
overprotected by a batty stepmother, Harriet, the visionary beauty
featured in a painting on which the novel is based. Over the
decades she grows vain, faded and jaded. Trapped in a loveless
marriage, she seduces young handymen.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of the three converge tragically as Teddy finds that
murder does not mar his conscience. Rendell's tale is made more
spellbinding by well-drawn, Dickensian characters adrift in the
20th century. She explores class differences, family interaction,
useless lives, entrapment and the ways in which crimes mirror the
society that helped spawn them.
</P>
<P>
   The unsolved murder of Francine's mother hovers throughout. Less
crafty writers would have trouble tying up such complex factors,
but Rendell's ending is an ironic and elegiac variation of Poe's
``The Cask of Amontillado.'' The British author pays discreet
homage to her forebears and elevates mystery writing to literature.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hush Money. By Robert B. Parker. Putnam. $22.95.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Parker has been writing Spenser-Hawk novels for 25 years,
and the wear occasionally shows. But the shamus and his sidekick
still crack wise, Spenser's code of honor remains untarnished, and
he and Susan maintain a lusty relationship. Plus, Parker still
excels in creating timely situations. In ``Hush Money,'' Spenser
takes on two unrelated pro bono jobs for Hawk and Susan. Robinson
Nevins, a black conservative professor denied tenure, wants Parker
to find out why.
</P>
<P>
   The plot wends its way through gay society, academia and white
supremacist culture. Meanwhile, Susan talks Spenser into tracking
down the stalker of a divorced friend, who soon becomes as much
stalker as stalkee. The plots bump awkwardly _ it's almost as if
Parker combined two book ideas into one.
</P>
<P>
   One climactic scene is too contrived and the other
uncharacteristically tame: One hungers for a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Parker writes well about the complexity of relationships,
his portrayal of academic bureaucracy is on target, and he
struggles _ against a macho tradition _ to convey gender, sexual
identity and race issues with sensitivity.

 &HT;    Mickle gleans extraordinary from everyday lives
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Novels about divorce are as common as, well, divorces. But
Shelley Fraser Mickle's novel ``Replacing Dad'' (Algonquin Books of
Chapel Hill, $16.95) transcends the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to air at 9 p.m. Sunday (4608) as a CBS movie,
``Replacing Dad'' is a partly humorous, partly dramatic story of a
teenage son who tries to hold the family together after a messy
divorce in a small Florida town. To complicate matters, the father
not only leaves the family, he marries his daughter's fifth-grade
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The point of ``Replacing Dad,'' says Mickle, 55, is that he's
irreplaceable. ``Many fathers think they're valued only for their
economic contributions, but they are needed emotionally as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gainesville, Fla., author got the idea for the book from an
incident that happened to a friend whose husband had left her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She mentioned to me that her son, who was about 12, was having
trouble sleeping. She learned that he felt he was responsible for
the safety of the family and stayed up all night listening for
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Mickle has never been divorced is no handicap, she
says. ``Divorce is all around me, and I feel compelled to try to
address my friends' pain. The fact that I'm happily married and not
divorced anchors me emotionally. If I had been divorced, I wouldn't
have had the strength to write about what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   An Arkansas native, Mickle grew up determined to become a
writer. A turning point came in the 1950s when she contracted polio
and spent a year in wheelchairs and braces. ``It was like my mind
became crystallized in the sense that I was kept a child forever,''
she says. ``But I also became a very old person who understood what
was really important in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickle attended the University of Mississippi in hopes of
absorbing the Faulkner mystique, then devoted two years to reading
the classics and honing her writing skills. During the next 20
years she raised two children, published a few short stories, and
finally sold ``The Queen of October'' in 1989. It, too, was about
the effects of divorce on a family.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to get her most recent novel published, Mickle is
working on a collection of her National Public Radio essays and
another novel about a family changed by divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a subject that is endlessly fascinating to me,'' she
says. ``Real life is not necessarily great dramatic happenings.
People who lead ordinary lives can be extraordinary. That's what my
fiction is about.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Deadly dosage: Reading Robin Cook is enough to make some
people avoid hospitals or at least wear a surgical mask whenever
they venture outside of their homes. Beginning with his novel
``Coma,'' which dealt with stolen human organs, Cook has turned out
a succession of medical thrillers about everything from plague to
genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest novel, ``Vector'' (Putnam's, $24.95), a
disgruntled Russian emigre teams up with a right-wing group in New
York to use anthrax as a way of exacting revenge on the United
States for the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet
Union. Only forensic pathologists Jack Stapleton and Laurie
Montgomery stand between the terrorists and disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Recent news stories about bioterrorism in Japan and anthrax
threats in Atlanta and other cities make such fictional scenarios
even scarier, Cook says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I finish one of these books I feel kind of
semi-responsible,'' says Cook, 57, an ophthalmologist who still
practices occasionally in Boston. ``But bioterrorism is not a
secret to the right-wing groups. These guys can get recipes for any
biological weapon off the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook will sign books at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Barnes &AMP; Noble, 2900
Peachtree Road N.E., 404-261-7747.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the news: Russell Banks' ``Cloudsplitter'' and Barbara
Kingsolver's ``The Poisonwood Bible'' are two of the nominees for
the PEN/Faulkner Award for fiction. Other nominees are ``Starting
Out in the Evening'' by Brian Morton, ``The Hours'' by Michael
Cunningham and ``The Doctor Stories'' by Richard Selzer. Winners
will be announced in April. . . . The 35th annual Georgia Author of
the Year Awards ceremony will be held Saturday at Mercer University
in Macon. The 86 nominees are Georgia residents who have published

 &HT;    Godwin's women try to balance secular, sacred
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 14.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest challenge for any writer growing up in Asheville,
N.C., in the 1940s was avoiding the long shadow of Thomas Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Godwin had no problem meeting that challenge, because she
had a much more romantic role model: a mother who worked as a
newspaper reporter by day and wrote stories for pulp romances by
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was natural of me to want to do the same thing,'' says
Godwin, 62, who remembers her mother dashing off to her job in the
morning and returning after dark ``in elated exhaustion, wearing
the smoky, inky smells of her larger world.''
</P>
<P>
   As the child of divorced parents, Godwin's other role model was
her grandmother, who cooked and ran the household. ``She was a
remarkable woman, but as far as I was concerned, the choice was
simple. At 5, I allied myself with the typewriter rather than the
stove.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen books and numerous awards later, Godwin's choice
apparently was the right one. Critics from Joyce Carol Oates to
Kurt Vonnegut praised her debut novel, ``The Perfectionists,'' and
subsequent works for their portrayal of intelligent, creative
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godwin's great topic is woman's search for identity,''
novelist Lee Smith wrote in her review of ``Father Melancholy's
Daughter'' (1991) in the Los Angeles Times. ``Her literate, smart
women characters possess the free will to make choices, to take
responsibility for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what Margaret Bonner does in Godwin's new novel,
``Evensong'' (Ballantine Books, $25). A young motherless daughter
of an Episcopal priest in ``Father Melancholy's Daughter,''
Margaret returns in this sequel as the pastor of a church in a
North Carolina mountain village. It is the eve of the millennium
and Margaret is married to Adrian Bonner, a much older man who
suffers from bouts of depression. Both are better at dealing with
the problems of others than with their stale marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview from her home in Woodstock, N.Y., where she
lives with her longtime companion, composer Robert Starer, Godwin
talked about her writing, her views on religion and the
autobiographical nature of her women characters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did you first begin writing?
</P>
<P>
   A: I sent my first story to Child Life when I was 9. It was
rejected, but they said to keep trying. It was about a man who was
henpecked by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You wrote that your mother would ``read'' stories to you out
of a blank address book. Did that inspire you to be a writer?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was 4 or 5 then. This was before I could read fluently. I
knew there were no words in that little book, and I knew exactly
what she was doing. Seeing her do it made it possible to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Evensong'' and ``Father Melancholy's Daughter'' are
essentially about faith. People today seem to be concerned with
spirituality, yet novelists are reluctant to address this. Why do
you do it, and why do you think others don't?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Grace Mungers (a firebrand evangelist in ``Evensong'')
are in great excess. These are the people who want to accost you
with their own God-image. That's very off-putting. That's why
serious novelists veer away from the subject. The God image is an
ineffable thing, and it has to do with the individual and inner
life. The reason I wanted to write a book about a priest and a
woman of God is because I couldn't find one. The only character of
a woman minister that I could find in English was in George Eliot's
``Adam Bede.'' I wanted her to be married and have to deal with the
sensual side of life and those problems. I wanted to create a
female model of the spiritual life for myself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do your women characters want?
</P>
<P>
   A: They used to want independence in my early novels. And
security. And they wanted to escape the cultural strictures of
their upbringing at the same time they wanted to be comforted by
the cultural aspects of their upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was a middle period when their vocation, their work
became very important. ``The Odd Woman,'' for example, was a story
about a young professor who gauged her life by what she knew of
literature. The character in ``Violet Clay'' was a young artist who
was trying to make the leap from talented illustrator to original
artist.
</P>
<P>
   In my last three books, my heroines are definitely being drawn
to the life of reflection _ the double life of being truly in the
world and truly in the spiritual sphere as well. They're trying to
find a balance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have had many tragedies in your life. Your father
deserted your family when you were a child and later committed
suicide. Your half-brother committed suicide, and your mother was
killed in an auto accident. Does writing about them help? How?
</P>
<P>
   A: One way I handle tragedy is to distance myself. I created a
father for myself in ``Father Melancholy's Daughter.'' It was just
the kind of father who suited me yet had some of the
characteristics of my father. Both were depressed, but my father
was a playboy and Father Melancholy was a priest.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Southern Family,'' I wrote about a character who
committed suicide that was based on my half-brother. I just wanted
to write and follow it as closely as I could. It's left unsolved at
the end. As I wrote in ``Father Melancholy's Daughter,'' as long as
you still feel grief, they're still with you. You don't want the
ache to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you sometimes feel you spend more time observing than
experiencing life?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm still working on enjoying the moment. I think that's
something very few people, writers included, achieve. I used to
have more of an ironic distance than I do now. I seem to be falling
in love with direct simplicity.

 &HT;    With a dearth of pioneering new works, old guarantees gold on
the Great White Way
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 14.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Broadway has long feared the shock of the new. This
season, though, the Main Stem is doing quite well, thank you, with
the shock of the old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death of a Salesman'' is once again a Jovian thunderbolt under
director Robert Falls, perhaps even more searing than it was in its
legendary premiere 50 years ago. Ditto ``Electra,'' featuring a Zoe
Wannamaker with a punkish haircut and a bottomless tank of rage.
``Fosse,'' like ``Chicago,'' shows that the late choreographer Bob
Fosse's jaded joy in the human body is even more in tune with our
premillennial, no-more-secrets age than the decades when he created
the dances. ``Not About Nightingales,'' the lost melodrama by a
27-year-old Tennessee Williams making its American premiere by way
of London, has been mounted by Trevor Nunn to maximize the
existential chill of its prison setting.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for every bracing new Broadway entry there's a safer,
mushier one. ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' got mixed
reviews. ``Footloose'' was kicked around. Bernadette Peters brings
sensual warmth to ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' but almost everything
else about the revival is, as Irving Berlin wrote elsewhere, as
cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that Broadway, as it heads into the
seven-week gun lap before the cutoff (April 28) for Tony Award
nominations, is on track to top its record-setting mark of 11.5
million tickets sold in 1997-98. But the numbers really say more
about the hotness of long-runners (``Rent,'' ``Cabaret,'' ``The
Lion King'') than they do about the shows that have been added to
the Broadway lineup since this past June.
</P>
<P>
   The season's lack of good new works will be nakedly revealed
when the Tony Award nominating committee meets in May. Unlike the
revival categories (``Salesman'' vs. the Kevin Spacey ``Iceman
Cometh,'' opening April 8, will be in a tremendous face-off for
best revival of a play), the pickings for best play and musical
will be slim. Broadway has drifted so far from its role of 1949 _
when a ``Salesman'' could triumph as an unknown quantity _ that the
favorites for 1999's best play will be pre-heralded London imports:
Conor McPherson's ``The Weir'' (previewing March 23) and David
Hare's ``Amy's View,'' starring Judi Dench (April 3).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most bitter reminder of Broadway's commercial
realities was the untimely demise of ``Parade'' last month. The
daring musical by Alfred Uhry and Jason Robert Brown was undone by
its mixed reviews and unsparing sadness. Its short run makes it a
long shot for best musical. The favorite at this point would have
to be the red-hot ``Fosse'' (classified as ``new'' by the
Tony-nominating committee, even though it's old material). ``The
Civil War,'' set to Frank Wildhorn's country-western pop score and
opening April 22, shapes up as the only other contender. Here's a
rundown of what's new in New York:
</P>
<P>
   `Fosse'
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' (1989) a few seasons ago
was like a trip through time, to a carefree New York of the 1940s
and '50s, when the mating dances of sailors and secretaries were
lighter than air and even the street gangs moved with balletic
grace.
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``Fosse,'' the new anthology of work by the late
choreographer, it's the dances that travel forward, leap into life
in our moment of time. The numbers are so amazingly contemporary
that you look at them and wonder how they could have been created
25 or 45 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse was often sexual (he worked many teenage hours in Chicago
burlesque houses) but never coarse; he discovered the elegant in
the blatant. Like a great playwright or musician, he made as much
from stillness as movement. His dancers wore pure black long before
it was the uniform of cool. They had attitude before anyone called
it that. They stalk downstage, like cats after prey, while the
snapping of fingers, the whisper of brushes on cymbals, creates the
charge of expectation that at any moment they will pounce upon some
note and brand the air with their fiery tableaux.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tremendously entertaining Broadway show. As conceived by
Richard Maltb Jr. (the director), Chet Walker (who re-creates the
Fosse choreography) and former Fosse girlfriend-collaborator Ann
Reinking (who assists them both), the show roams through the late
choreographer's entire canon _ from Broadway to TV specials to
films (``Cabaret,'' ``All That Jazz''). Pat Brady's orchestra, with
powerhouse brass, sounds terrific. At 2 1/2 hours, it's a bit too
much of a good thing, but the sheer variety ensures something new
for even the Fosse aficionado.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest number, ``Steam Heat'' from ``Pajama Game'' (1954),
is the most joyous. It places its dancers (led by Jane Lanier,
looking eerily similar to Fosse wife/interpreter Gwen Verdon) in
the baggy suits of vaudevillian clowns so that they can better
ambush us with endless inventions of athletic grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's Ruby''
</P>
<P>
   It's uncomfortable for any Atlantan who's enjoyed the work of
director Kenny Leon at the Alliance Theatre to see his long-awaited
New York debut production at off-Broadway's Joseph Papp Public
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Barely any of Leon's talent shines through, mainly because of
Thulani Davis' choppy script. Starting with the documented case of
Ruby McCollom (Viola Davis), a black Florida woman convicted in
1952 of killing a white doctor, and Zora Neale Hurston's (Phylicia
Rashad) attempt to revive her career by covering the trial for a
Northern newspaper, the playwright adds confusing layers of
speculation (including Hurston's ``visions''). Was Ruby raped by
the doctor? Did she then begin an affair with him, or was sex her
payment for morphine? Is the playwright stacking the deck to make
Ruby appear more of a victim?
</P>
<P>
   The story has the Grade B Southern gothic-ness of ``In the Heat
of the Night'' (the TV show, not the movie). Early scenes have an
awkwardness one never sees in Leon's Alliance productions. Davis is
a terrific choice for Ruby _ a woman who broods behind an invisible
steel visor _ but Leon's casting brilliance failed him in the
choice of the doctor. Beau Gravitte's ``dangerous good-ol'-boy''
seems like a slightly campy put-on.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rashad, looking overweight and unsure of herself, has an
off day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bright Lights, Big City''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, ``Rent'' is a hard act to follow, but just about any
new rock musical would have been better for director Michael Greif
and off-Broadway's New York Theatre Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``City'' deals with 20-something downtown types enjoying a
surplus of sex partners and drugs (``Cocaine: Dran-o for the
brain-o!''), but in every other respect, the 1984 Jay McInerney
novel is the anti-``Rent.'' It's cynical and intimately
confessional, where the late Jonathan Larson's musical was romantic
and larger than life. Yet Greif and adaptor/lyricist Paul Scott
Goodman attack the story of Jamie (the preposterously clean-cut
Patrick Wilson) with high energy and no irony, as if he were
another of ``Rent's'' idealistic bohemians instead of the
self-centered, darkly compulsive, blocked writer that he is. The
novel was redeemed by McInerney's sour wit, but the Scottish
Goodman translates almost none of it to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman is a good composer, however, nearly as good as Larson,
and ought to jump right back into a creative mode with a good
playwright and/or lyricist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ashes to Ashes''
</P>
<P>
   What in the world has happened to Harold Pinter? Now 68 and one
of the master dramatists of the 1950s and '60s, he hasn't written a
satisfying full-length play in 20 years. ``Moonlight'' was
ballyhooed as his comeback play a few seasons ago but wasn't. He is
Britain's answer to Sam Shepard: the prematurely disappearing
playwright.
</P>
<P>
   Now from London comes the only slightly-less-ballyhooed ``Ashes
to Ashes.'' At 40 uneventful minutes, the production at the
Gramercy Theatre might be described as an unformed riddle not quite
wrapped in an enigma.
</P>
<P>
   In their coldly pristine English home, a man (David Strathairn,
too stiff) interrogates a woman (Lindsay Duncan, riveting) about a
former lover who may have been a sadist (``He put his fist against
my mouth . . . tore babies from the arms of screaming mothers . .
.''). She seems to be self-hypnotized. Whether she's aroused or
horrified, amoral or numb, fantasizing or channeling another
woman's traumatic memory, we do not know.
</P>
<P>
   Nor _ thanks to Pinter's chilly, quick-sketch approach _ do we
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annie Get Your Gun''
</P>
<P>
   Bernadette Peters finally has the sun-splashed, melody-rich,
girl-gets-boy musical that she has always deserved. At
50-going-on-30, the pocket goddess has no trouble commanding the
boys' attention, and in the strapping baritone Tom Wopat, she
finally has one worth getting.
</P>
<P>
   And Broadway at last _ just two months before the Tony Award
cutoff _ will have its first bona-fide hit musical of the season,
if there's any justice.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big if, however, considering that some elements of this
revival don't come close to the stars' level. If Peters and Wopat
weren't onstage so much, this Graciela Daniele production might
seem plastic and pat. Aside from a few witty, athletic dance turns
(choreography by Daniele and Jeff Calhoun), the show behind the two
stars is merely OK.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on Broadway, and off-
</P>
<P>
   Recapping some long-running shows: The best ones that are still
relatively fresh (less than three years old) are ``Chicago'' at the
Shubert and ``Cabaret'' at Studio 54. Both are wittier,
sharper-edged and more sexually charged than their original
productions. ``The Lion King'' at the New Amsterdam is sheer joy.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``in-between'' category _ entertaining, though flawed _
is Warren Leight's ``Side Man'' at the Golden; a brooding,
intelligent new memory play about a struggling jazz musician.
Judging by reviews, Tennessee Williams' ``Not About Nightingales''
at Circle in the Square is similarly mixed, a youthful prison
melodrama saved by Trevor Nunn's powerful direction.
</P>
<P>
   Off-Broadway, there are hits for Generation X'ers or anyone with
a taste for the outrageous. ``This Is Our Youth'' at the Fairbanks
is the authentic, witty chronicle of drugged-out '80s kids;
``Killer Joe'' at the Soho is scary-funny, trailer-park gothic.
``Hedwig and the Angry Inch'' at the Jane Street is a transsexual's
saga set to surprisingly tuneful rock.

 &HT;    Chamber music eyes what's next
 &HT;    EDs:Embargoed for Sunday, March 14.
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixties cinema and '70s rock spawned ``new waves,'' pop culture
pundits claim to predict the ``next big thing'' and Brooklyn, N.Y.,
has its own Next Wave festival. Taking their cue from these
examples, Emory University and Thamyris, the Atlanta contemporary
music ensemble, are launching Next Fest.
</P>
<P>
   As its name suggests, the chamber music festival will focus on
contemporary trends. That means the work of living composers, sure,
but also livelier approaches to programs aimed at audiences more at
home in rock clubs than concert halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to expand our thinking to really embrace the music
that's going on right now,'' says Steven Everett, a Thamyris
co-founder and Emory music professor. ``You can no longer do the
kind of repertoire you did in the '60s or '70s. You don't have the
audience anymore. You have to find something that relates to people
more directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Next Fest takes several cracks at that goal.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Thamyris stages the 1969 music-theater piece ``Eight
Songs for a Mad King'' by British composer Peter Maxwell Davies.
It's a meditation on music and insanity as experienced by England's
King George III, who loses his grip as he tries to teach his pet
bullfinches to sing. The birds will be represented by the members
of Thamyris perched, symbolically and literally, in wire cages. The
king, portrayed by Canadian vocalist Tony Berg-
</P>
<P>
   aman, endures violent mood swings expressed through an intense
range of extended vocal techniques _ watch out, Yoko Ono.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing stays stable,'' Everett says of the piece, which deals
with the concept of distortion as a musical process and makes
parodic use of fox trots and Baroque themes. ``The shifts of
musical language are so sudden and so stark and so dramatic. I've
never met anyone who didn't come away mesmerized by this piece.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``Mad King'' is designed to rattle the consciousness,
Saturday's show by Bang on a Can All-Stars promises an intriguing
dose of postmodern Muzak. The New York new-music group, which like
Kronos Quartet affects a stylish image, will play its ``Music for
Airports.'' Rock composer Brian Eno's 1978 album introduced the
term ``ambient music'' and anticipated the emergence of an entire
genre of electronic music.
</P>
<P>
   Bang on a Can, a six-member ensemble that uses electric guitar
and synthesizers in its arrangements, got its name staging
round-the-clock concert marathons.
</P>
<P>
   The rock connection isn't an automatic bonus, says Jeff Hunt,
founder of the Atlanta experimental music label Table of the
Elements. ``The rock audience is even more conservative and
reactionary than your most staid classical audience,'' he says.
``But there is a core audience of people coming from a rock context
that's been exposed to a lot of music and is well-educated about
it. That's a very receptive audience, coming from outside of what
would be the traditional context for new music.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to make forward-thinking chamber music more appealing
to more people, the whole notion of what's avant-garde is up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what was going on in the 1960s had a shock element
that had to be there in order to create something new,'' Everett
says. ``A couple of years ago I saw (performance artist) Laurie
Anderson in a production, and she said there is no avant-garde
anymore. You can't really shock audiences today. The only true
people who shock us are terrorists.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    `Star Wars' fans turn to Web for trailer peek
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ May the trailer be with you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' prequel fans got an early peek via the Internet on
Thursday at the new 2 1/2-minute trailer for ``Episode 1 _ The
Phantom Menace.'' And what did they see? Jedi knights battling
armored battle droids, the return of that nasty Emperor, blazing
light-saber duels, Jabba, vicious new devil-horned villain Darth
Maul and enough luscious sweeping landscapes from a world far, far
away to impress even David Lean.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm Ltd. posted the full trailer, which hits theaters
today in metro Atlanta and across the country, on its official Web
site at http://www.starwars.com late Wednesday, not long after
George Lucas announced in Las Vegas that his fourth ``Star Wars''
film will be released May 19, two days earlier than previously
planned.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, the new trailer had been previewed on
``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Access Hollywood.'' Today, CBS'
``This Morning'' will have cameras in the basement of 27-year-old
Carl Cunningham's home in Acworth (GA.). CBS plans to show the
trailer to Cunningham, an IBM staffer and Internet aficionado, and
about a half-dozen other Georgians for their comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm patient,'' Cunningham said Thursday when asked if he was
planning on downloading the trailer off the Internet before CBS
arrives. ``I'm going to wait till tomorrow so my comments will be
fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, however, won't be so willing to wait when the
complete ``Phantom Menace'' opens. ``We're getting a hotel room
overlooking a theater the day before,'' he said. ``That way we can
tell if the lines get too long at 3 a.m. We'll be able to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander on `Voyager'
</P>
<P>
   In his first series TV appearance since ``Seinfeld'' closed in
May, Jason Alexander _ sporting a hefty head of hair _ will play a
villainous alien on the March 31 episode of UPN's ``Star Trek:
Voyager.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's executive producer, Brannon Braga, said makeup
artists plopped ``Albert Einstein hair and a funny forehead'' on
Alexander for the role. Alexander's character offers to help Capt.
Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) out of a jam but then leads his fellow
aliens in an insurrection.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last year was a memorable one for American cellist
Lynn Harrell. It was the year he lost his hands and got them back.
</P>
<P>
   And just in time, too, for playing and recording two works by
Miklos Rozsa with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.

building for 20 or 25 years, according to Harrell's British
neurologist, the cellist became aware of a growing numbness in the
first finger of his right hand (which controls the pressure on the
cello bow). As he investigated causes and remedies, he realized he
had lost sensation in his left hand as well. When his doctor
proposed surgery, Harrell decided to have both hands done at the
same time. The operation took place in June.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters more complicated, his surgeon did it the hard
way. Instead of arthroscopic surgery, with minimal cutting of
muscle and tissue, ``he wanted to see what he was doing rather than
using the little TV camera,'' Harrell said by phone from his home
in London.
</P>
<P>
   That meant a much longer period of recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   Harrell embarked on physical therapy with a sports medicine
clinic in Aspen, Colo., that normally works on Olympic skiers.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up taking five months off from playing. He reintroduced
himself to the cello with three minutes a day of practice,
increasing the time in tiny increments. He played open strings (no
left hand needed) and then slow scales. ``It was excruciatingly
painful,'' he said, ``because I had no calluses and no muscles. I
hadn't realized one could lose all that so quickly.'' By August, he
was ready to begin work on his concert repertory _ but even so, he
was forced to cancel some of his September engagements.
</P>
<P>
   As a further challenge, the Rozsa concerto is quite difficult,
and Harrell, 55, was learning it for the first time. ``There are
quite nasty things in it,'' he said cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   The ASO will record a CD this weekend that will include the
violin concerto played by Robert McDuffie at last week's concerts
and the two works to be heard on this week's. It will be only the
third time the concerto has been recorded for commercial
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   The recording follows a current interest in serious music by
Hollywood composers such as Erich Korngold, Franz Waxman and
Bernard Herrmann.
</P>
<P>
   When his agent first told him that the concerto had been written
by the composer who scored ``Ben-Hur,'' it raised his eyebrows a
little. Indeed, there is a little ``Ben-Hur'' in the cello
concerto.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I have great admiration for what he did in this piece,''
Harrell said. ``It seems well-written, and he obviously understood
the cello.'' For instance, Rozsa often has the cello line
duplicated by the xylophone _ a technique later borrowed by
Shostakovich in the second cello concerto he wrote for Mstislav
Rostropovich. ``It's a very clean sound, hard and energetic,''
Harrell said, ``but it doesn't sustain.'' So it doesn't cover the
cello.
</P>
<P>
   As for balance, a perpetual problem in works for cello and
orchestra, Harrell says, ``I don't know. I've never played it with
orchestra!''

 &HT;    In Venice, a romantic tradition withstands changing currents
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 14.
 &HT;    By Holly Crenshaw
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Italy _ They are dream merchants, and they know it.
</P>
<P>
   Lounging along the Grand Canal in jaunty striped shirts and
broad straw hats with ribbons that flutter in the wind, the
gondoliers of Venice hold a monopoly on one of the world's most
enthralling experiences.
</P>
<P>
   But that experience _ a hallucinatory blur of iridescent green
water, dazzling pink and gold Renaissance palazzi and the gentle
lapping of the boatman's oar _ comes with a hefty price.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where reality and fantasy collide.
</P>
<P>
   To travel to Venice and not take a gondola ride seems
unthinkable, like sightseeing in San Francisco without hopping on a
cable car. In both locales, they're more than transportation:
They're the city's quintessence, an inseparable part of the
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   But as I studied my guidebooks and prepared for my first visit
to this most romantic of destinations, I felt a growing sense of
dread. Hiring a gondolier for a 50-minute ride sounded as stressful
and decidedly unromantic as negotiating a fare with a New York
cabdriver.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are posted rates _ 120,000 lira, or about $70,
during my November visit _ at Venice's 11 official gondola stands.
But my research warned me that those prices are virtually
meaningless, that gondoliers are free to charge double or more if
they choose and that they often will try to ditch their passengers
after a 15-minute ride while suddenly losing all ability to
understand English.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I wasn't sure I wanted to sully such a treasured
vacation by haggling over prices or caving in to extortion _ only
to fall victim to the gondolier's fast-running watch.
</P>
<P>
   Though the dishonesty is indefensible, it's only fair to
acknowledge some justification for the steep prices. Like the city
itself, gondoliers are perched on the edge of extinction, existing
in a watery netherworld of fading tradition and rising tides.
</P>
<P>
   Vastly outnumbered by Venice's vaporetti _ noisy public
transportation boats that ply commuters up and down the Grand Canal
_ the sleek, silent gondolas have dwindled from about 15,000 in the
17th century to a few hundred today. The gondolieri, who often
learn the trade from their fathers, must buy their own vessels and
pay for their upkeep at one of the city's five gondola yards. And
their entire yearly salary must be earned in a six-month tourist
season.
</P>
<P>
   So I decided to keep an open mind and gauge the scene when I
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   I started with an easy way to sample a boat ride: hopping on a
traghetto, a ferry gondola that does nothing but make quick trips
back and forth across the Grand Canal. Because there are only three
bridges across Venice's main waterway, locals pay 600 lira, or 34
cents, and use these gondolas as a short cut.
</P>
<P>
   But this, too, had its complications. Tradition dictates that
passengers remain standing, so I picked a spot in the crowded,
flat-bottomed boat and firmly stood my ground.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a woman started pointing at the floor and saying
something to me in obviously irritated Italian. It took a minute to
understand that I needed to shift to a different spot to help
balance the boatful of commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as we walked near the landmark Rialto Bridge _ one of
Venice's largest gondola stations _ I heard a voice cry out,
``Gondola! Gondola!''
</P>
<P>
   Hustling for passengers in this tourist-clogged area, a
gondolier offered a ride for 100,000 lira, or $57. For a moment, I
considered grabbing the cheaper fare but decided the price was
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   That night at our pensione, just off the Grand Canal, our
concierge unexpectedly volunteered to reserve a gondola for the
following day. For 120,000 lira _ the official rate _ a gondolier
would pick us up at our hotel at the appointed hour, with no
bargaining necessary.
</P>
<P>
   We reserved for 9 a.m., but when no one came, our concierge
phoned and was told someone would be there at 10 instead. When it
did arrive, it was wonderful to watch the gondola _ 36 feet long
and 5 feet wide _ pull into the little side canal and stop at our
front steps.
</P>
<P>
   The gondolier extended a steadying hand, helped us into our
seats and steered us out onto the Grand Canal. That first moment
was breathtaking. It was a brilliant Sunday morning _ cold but
sunny and clear _ with church bells pealing in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   When another ringing sound suddenly cut through the air, our
gondolier deftly grabbed his cell phone from his pocket and took
the call while still managing to keep our boat on a steady keel.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was into his well-rehearsed narrative in fairly fluent
English. ``On the right, you will see the home of Casanova, the
Venetian playboy,'' he said, gliding past the ornate palazzo.
</P>
<P>
   Slipping quietly past Ca' Rezzonico, where Robert Browning lived
out his final days, I paused for a moment to study our gondola's
gorgeous details. The black, eel-like boat was trimmed in the
traditional style _ with plush, fringe-lined seats, a bright red
floor and gilded sea horses mounted on either side. As the bow of
the gondola sliced through the water, its tiny Venetian flag
flickered in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look to your right side for the home of poet Lord Byron,'' our
gondolier continued. Just then, a vaporetto loaded with tourists
came chugging past, and I looked up to see three cameras pointed my
way.
</P>
<P>
   We turned into a moody side canal and enjoyed a few moments of
solitude. Every now and then, our fragile little boat would scrape
along some 500-year old stone wall, and our boatman would mention
that this had been Mozart's home or offer another historical detail
as we slipped through the shadowy alleys.
</P>
<P>
   The gondolier, a friendly young man with blond hair typical of
northern Italians, told us his father was a water taxi driver.
``But I don't like the engines. I like the silence,'' he said,
winding his way through the maze-like canals. ``And I like the
gondola history, the tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, we rounded a corner and were back in the
bright sun and midmorning traffic of the Grand Canal, where the
gondolieri shouted greetings to each other as they passed. Instead
of returning to our hotel a short distance away, our gondolier
asked if he could drop us off in front of the busy Accademia
Gallery, probably because he could find his next fare more easily
there, and we agreed.
</P>
<P>
   As he turned to tie up our boat, I quickly checked my watch: 40
minutes _ 10 minutes shy, but close enough, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   The boat pitched back and forth as we stood to climb out, and
our gondolier gallantly offered his arm. Still, I somehow managed
to crack my skull into his as I disembarked.
</P>
<P>
   A fitting end, I thought, for what had been a sublime journey of
otherworldly sensations, pierced with jarring reminders of ordinary
life.
</P>
<P>
   Information: The official rate for a Venice gondola is 120,000
lira for a 50-minute ride, with each additional 25 minutes costing
60,000 lira. After 8 p.m., the rate climbs to 150,000 lira, with
each additional 25 minutes costing 75,000 lira. But gondola fees
are set by each boatman, and prices can vary wildly. Singers and
accordionists can be prebooked, or sometimes hired on the spot at
the more touristy gondola stands, such as the one at San Marco, for
an extra fee. Gondolas can hold up to six people, who can split the
fare. Passengers may ask to ride to a particular destination or
visit a certain area; otherwise, the gondolier will take his
favorite route.

 &HT;    Eye candy: Opulent Vienna a soaring Baroque confection
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, March 14.
 &HT;    By James D. Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ What a wedding cake of a city this is.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the soaring 450-foot Gothic spire of Stephansdom
cathedral or row upon row of intricately ornate Baroque facades or
the massive, overindulgent opulence of Schonbrunn Palace, this is a
city that looks like it was decked out by a cake decorator on a
binge.
</P>
<P>
   But what else would you expect in a setting whose history is
steeped in the soaring swells of Strauss waltzes, high-prancing
Lipizzaner stallions, an angelic boys choir, luxuriant coffeehouses
serving thick java laced with whipped cream and desserts designed
with nothing but sweet excess in mind?
</P>
<P>
   Vienna's intoxication with the frills and flourishes of Hapsburg
Empire court society has become an enduring love affair,
exemplified no better than by its unabashed fondness for the curved
lines and ornamental excesses of the Baroque.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise, then, that the New Town Hall, that most
mundane of edifices in most municipalities, resembles not so much a
pedestrian place of government as it does a civic cathedral, with
its 320-foot central clock tower serving as its secular spire.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a building that bristles with balconies, turrets, spires
and arched, ornamented windows, its numerous vertical lines giving
it the appearance of an oversize matchstick creation. At night, it
strikes an even more formidible pose as floodlights isolate its
pinnacles in stark relief against the surrounding darkness.
</P>
<P>
   And, for good measure, there's the Wiener Rathauskeller, a
popular wine cellar in the basement, serving up Austrian wines,
meals and traditional music.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the street stands the impressively stately
Burgtheater, a masterpiece in Italian Renaissance style that
features mirror-image, candelabra-lined grand staircases leading up
from the side entries to the main foyer. Just about everything
here, it seems, looks like a palace inside.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, amid all this splendor, it's the little things that stand
out _ the entertaining and sometimes amusing dollops of filigree
and folderol at every turn that leave a lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
   At the Burgtheater, sculpted cherubs adorn the balustrade, and
statues representing the muses of music and the dramatic arts
straddle the roof line. They're small details that can be easily
overlooked amid the overall grandness of the building's facade.
</P>
<P>
   And it's that way all over the city: little touches that force
you to crane your neck skyward and keep your eyes ever alert for
serendipitous surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you have to stretch some muscles to take in all of
Stephansdom, the city's landmark cathedral, its south tower
piercing the sky, as gray and daunting in reality as it is on
celluloid in the opening scene of the 1949 black-and-white classic
``The Third Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The massive interior of the 325-foot-long cathedral contains a
rich array of carvings, sculpture and ornate altars, all filtered
through the soft light of soaring stained glass windows. The
Pilgram's Pulpit (named after its creator, master craftsman Anton
Pilgram) is an intricate Gothic structure decorated with depictions
of four contemplative theological figures.
</P>
<P>
   On a clear day, one of the best panoramic views of the city and
the Danube (alas, it was blue only in the imagination of the
younger Johann Strauss) is from the viewing platform in the south
tower _ if you're up to climbing almost 350 steps to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, in the Hofburg Quarter, you'll find the former site of
the Hapsburg winter palace and the heart of Old Vienna. This
complex of imperial structures grew haphazardly over the centuries
as each new emperor sought to leave his mark. The result is a
hodgepodge of styles, not always in sync with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Along Naglergasse you can see some of the most representative
Baroque facades in the city. Yet only a few twists and turns of
streets away, facing the Michaelerplatz, is Loos House, which
outraged Archduke Franz Ferdinand with its simple modernistic lines
when built in 1912. Architect Adolf Loos despised ornamentation for
its own sake, which put him greatly at odds with conservative
Viennese society.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder, then, that in Vienna you can find horses stabled
in buildings that once served as the residences of royalty.
</P>
<P>
   At the Renaissance-style Stallburg Palace _ once the residence
of Archduke Maximilian and later home for an imperial art
collection _ are stables for the Spanish Riding School, which is
located in the building across the street. There you can watch the
specially bred Lipizzaner stallions go through their paces amid the
splendor of high columns, crystal chandeliers and an exquisite
coffered ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Even the city's major transportation artery is a jewel. To see
most of the major attractions, you merely follow the Ringstrasse,
the elegant boulevard built at Emperor Franz Josef's behest in the
late 19th century. The tree-lined thoroughfare drapes the confines
of the compact Old City like an empress' bejeweled necklace, with
major sights _ the State Opera House, the Museum of the History of
Art (as much an artwork itself as the collections it contains), the
Natural History Museum, the Parliament and so forth _ dangling like
shimmering baubbles along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But to fully appreciate the splendor that was once Vienna, you
need to leave the Old City just briefly to visit Schonbrunn Palace,
the imperial family's former summer residence _ now part of the
city but once a vacation refuge in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Though you're allowed to visit only a small portion of the 1,400
rooms, the areas on display are resplendent with Maria Theresa's
guiding touches _ rococo gilding, hand-painted wallpapers, wood
paneling from all over the world, antique furnishings and artwork.
Even the enormous iron stoves required to warm each room are
massive, ornate marvels that raise the potbellied stove to artistic
status.
</P>
<P>
   At the Orangerie, one of the magnificent outbuildings at
Schonbrunn, where imperial and royal celebrations were held and
Mozart conducted concerts, you can attend an evening's
entertainment that provides a sampler of the city's music and dance
history.
</P>
<P>
   With the music of Mozart and Strauss supplied by an ensemble,
the program includes vocal soloists and dancers. The finale, a
couple in period costume waltzing to the strains of ``The Blue
Danube,'' provides a fitting close to any journey to Vienna: the
icing on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: The round-trip fare to Vienna is $418 on
midweek departures through April on Lufthansa, United, Sabena,
KLM/Northwest, Delta, Alitalia and Austrian Airlines. Tickets must
be purchased by March 31. There are no advance-purchase
restrictions, but a Saturday stay is required.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting around: From the airport, the cheapest way into the
city is the Schnellbahn train (about $3.50). Other options include
city buses, which operate every 20 minutes (about $5.50), shuttle
buses (about $20) and taxis (about $40). You can get tickets from
the conductor. The train takes about 30 minutes to transport you to
Wien Mitte station, where you connect with the city's extensive
subway system. At the airport, you can pick up transit system maps
and buy the Vienna Card (about $24), which permits unlimited rides
on the city's transit system for 72 hours from its first use (it's
not good for the train ride into town). With the Vienna Card, you
can also get a coupon booklet that provides discounts or other
perks at many of the city's main attractions, shops and
restaurants. Several other discount fare options (day passes, etc.)
are available.

HOUSE REJECTS GOP-LED EFFORT TO OPPOSE SENDING U.S. TROOPS TO
KOSOVO 
 &HT;    By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House killed a resolution Thursday aimed at
preventing the deployment of any U.S. forces to Kosovo as Congress
began an impassioned debate on the controversial issue of putting
U.S. troops in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had defied a request from President Clinton to delay
debate on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton, backed by former GOP senator Bob Dole, pleaded
with Congress not to push ahead with a vote until a peace agreement
is completed between the Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo, Republican leaders said they were determined to consider
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Working late into the night, Congress gave tentative approval to
the deployment of troops to Kosovo if Clinton provides Congress
with specific details of the mission's goals.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 237-178 the House also rejected a call by Majority
Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and others to prohibit the deployment of
any U.S. forces to the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., began the debate by
calling the ethnic conflict in Kosovo ``a great human tragedy,''
but said it was important for Congress to grapple with it before
the Clinton administration decides to commit forces as part of any
peace plan. He dismissed concerns expressed by Clinton and Dole
that a vote by Congress against deploying troops could undermine
any chance for a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by Democrats who warned the Republican
leaders that a vote against deployment would give a green light to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to continue his ethnic
cleansing in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said Hastert's decision to
go ahead with the debate was a clear signal that the GOP leadership
had chosen partisanship over a united U.S. front that could
encourage the ethnic Albanians and Serbs to sign a
Washington-brokered peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans opposed to committing U.S. forces argued that
any peace plan between the two warring sides likely would fail,
leaving U.S. soldiers in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is not a hopeful nation aspiring to democracy. It is a
big, dangerous quagmire,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling U.S. soldiers ``warriors'' and not ``baby sitters,''
DeLay criticized Clinton for having no clearly defined mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has no plan to do anything but go to
Kosovo, hold hands with the two sides and hope they behave when we
leave. But of course they won't. The killing and the mayhem will
continue as soon as NATO pulls out,'' said DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   He joined with Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., in offering his own
resolution to bar the deployment of U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay used his floor statement to address the broader issue of
U.S. foreign policy and NATO's role in Europe. Referring to the
possible deployment of troops to Kosovo, he suggested that it would
amount to ``meddling in the internal affairs'' of a sovereign
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the historic mission of the alliance as defensive,
he declared, ``NATO is starting to resemble a power-hungry
imperialist army.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally designed to defend member nations from attack, it
is now setting itself up to be the attacker,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   While DeLay's comments struck a chord with a large number of GOP
colleagues who rose to applaud, some Republicans, who also oppose
sending troops, sided with Democrats in their support of the
administration's efforts to negotiate a deal between Milosevic and
the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him the authority to be the commander-in-chief and we
cannot deny him the authority granted to him in the Constitution,''
said Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala. ``It is irresponsible for Congress
to be debating this at this time while they are in negotiations
trying to negotiate an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go ahead with the debate marked a setback for
the administration, which has failed so far to get Milosevic and
Kosovo Albanian separatists to sign an agreement that would invite
NATO forces onto Serbian soil to help keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration has yet to lay out a specific
deployment plan, Pentagon officials say the U.S. commitment to the
peacekeeping mission would comprise about 4,000 troops in a total
international force of 20,000-30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, traveling in Central America, reiterated Thursday that
U.S. and NATO forces would be deployed only if a peace agreement is
signed by Serbs and the Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   He said the deployment plan would include a ``clear'' exit
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Although nonbinding, the resolutions offered in the House on
Kosovo gave members a chance to vent their frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed horror at the
``slaughter and massacre'' of innocent civilians in Kosovo at the
hands of Milosevic, whom they referred to repeatedly throughout the
debate as ``a bloodthirsty ... brutal killer'' who should be be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But they disagreed on the best approach to ending the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to take up a resolution next week that
would authorize the deployment of forces. But several senators are
expected to offer amendments that would lay out specific conditions
governing any commitment of forces.

ORACLE REPORTS SLOWER-THAN-EXPECTED SALES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares in the Oracle Corp. dropped sharply in
after-hours trading Thursday after the company reported
slower-than-anticipated software sales. Oracle reported
third-quarter earnings that essentially matched analysts'
expectations, but revenues from both data base and applications
software fell short.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle executives said revenues were reduced by a short quarter
and the spillover of a number of large pending sales into the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle reported its results after the market close. Its shares
closed at $36.875, down $1.0625 in Nasdaq trading, but dropped as
low as $30.875 in after-hours trading. Analysts said that the
slowdown in revenues was partly offset by reduced expenses, but
that Oracle needed to see sales growth from new products.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, which ended Feb. 28, Oracle reported earnings
of $293 million, or 20 cents a diluted share, up 36 percent,
compared with $215 million, or 14 cents a share, in the comparable
period a year ago. Revenues increased 19 percent, to $2.079
billion, from $1.749 billion in the third quarter of the 1998
fiscal year. Earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect a
3-for-2 stock split last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenues were light in the quarter,'' said Rick Sherlund, an
analyst with Goldman, Sachs. He noted that application sales grew
by just 5 percent in the quarter, down from 19 percent in the
second quarter; data base sales grew by 10 percent, down from 26
percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a pretty good pipeline of products, but
disappointing revenue growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual step, Oracle featured Lawrence J. Ellison, the
company's co-founder, chairman and chief executive, in its
conference call with securities analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Passing quickly over the third-quarter financial results,
Ellison concentrated on the company's Internet-enabled version of
its core data base program, Oracle 8i, as well as new software to
automate sales and manage customer and vendor relationships. He
predicted that Oracle would pass Siebel Systems Inc. in sales-force
automation software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we are going to grow faster than all of our secular
competition in this pre-Y2K year,'' Ellison said. He said the
company's sales of large enterprise software would grow faster than
those of SAP, Baan or Peoplesoft; its data base sales faster than
those of IBM or Microsoft, and procurement software faster than
Ariba's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're nothing but Net, 100 percent Internet,'' he said.
``We're the only company, the only one where every single report,
every interaction is through an Internet browser.'' &QL;

HUSKY SUCCESS RIDING ON FRESHMAN POINT GUARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Slashing and distributing or scoring himself,
Senque Carey established the tempo for Washington when it won eight
of nine games during a month-long stretch.
</P>
<P>
   He was an impressive freshman, a one-time backup turning into a
prime-time force.
</P>
<P>
   But now he is five games and three weeks removed from those
sensational days, Carey's game becoming unusually average right
when the Huskies need it to be exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Bender says point-guard play is critical to a team's
success in the NCAA tournament. If that is the case, the Huskies
could be in trouble Friday afternoon at the Superdome when they
take on Miami of Ohio in a Midwest Region first-round game.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the production from Todd MacCulloch, Donald Watts and
Deon Luton, the Huskies need a stronger effort from Carey to
advance to the second round. His late-season difficulties coincided
with the Huskies', amplifying Carey's importance in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Stanford loss on Feb. 18, Carey has averaged 5.1
points, 10 below his output during the nine-game span. He has had
12 assists and 16 turnovers and shot 26.6 percent. He rarely
penetrates like he used to, evidenced by his sudden disappearance
from the foul line. Carey has not taken a free throw in the past
three games.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone _ from Carey to Bender to MacCulloch _ believes that a
crossover move is coming this afternoon, with the point guard
dashing off in a different direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in a slump or anything like that,'' Carey said. ``I
know what I'm capable of doing. I've performed in big games, I've
been bad in big games. You can't let the NCAA (tournament) stuff
get in your head. I'll just be myself and let the game come to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   MacCulloch thinks it will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in the tournament is not going to rattle him,'' the
Husky center said. ``It's just going to accelerate his play.''
</P>
<P>
   If MacCulloch is to be effective inside, he needs to get the
ball in scoring position. It's the same situation with Watts and
Luton on the wings. Carey must be a proficient director for the
halfcourt offense to run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   He has proven capable against the country's best teams, sparring
with and even occasionally outplaying some of the marquee point
guards like Jason Terry and Baron Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final stretch of the regular season, he lugged home,
using fatigue as a partial explanation. Bender said it was an
understandable development.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point every freshman hits the wall,'' the coach said.
``He hit his in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender said that Pac-10 teams became more familiar with the
freshman and took away his strengths. They kept the ball out of his
hands. They prevented him from playing in the middle of the floor.
They didn't leave him open on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   The adjustments left Carey searching for shots and teammates and
finding none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't gotten as many looks as I did in the past,'' he
said. ``I'm not taking the shots I was taking. I don't know for
what reason. But the season's not over. There's time to change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey has been hesitant, making poor judgments instead of field
goals. He takes shots when he shouldn't and passes on others in the
open. He used to be confounding to the opponents instead of the
Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Bender saw a glimmer of the dynamic Carey in the final
regular-season game, claiming that the point guard regained his
confidence against Washington State. The observation sounded more
wishful than insightful.
</P>
<P>
   Carey had five assists and two steals but also committed five
turnovers and was 1-for-6 from the field, scoring three points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bothered by my lack of scoring and assists,'' Carey
said. ``We're not doing bad without me. But we do better when I
perform. I'll base myself on winning in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   If Carey ignites Friday, it will not be entirely surprising.
Miami of Ohio admits to be focusing on MacCulloch while also being
concerned with Watts and Luton on the perimeter. There was no
mention of a 20-year-old from East Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're loose,'' Carey said. ``I'm sure we'll be nervous, but
it's time to play now. This is what we've all been waiting for.''

TORRE MAY BE OUT 3 MONTHS; ZIMMER TO TAKE HIS PLACE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Yankee officials remain certain that manager Joe
Torre, who was told on Tuesday that he has prostate cancer, will
return to the dugout eventually. But the estimates of his absence
range from three weeks to three months, and on Thursday, Torre's
bench coach, Don Zimmer, said he would try to manage the team as
Torre would.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, who did not appear at the ballpark here Thursday and was
unavailable for comment, is leaning heavily toward having surgery
for the removal of his cancer, according to others in the
organization, and that procedure likely will occur at Washington
University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, acknowledged
that Torre was close to a decision. ``But I'm not sure it's been
finalized yet,'' Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Fans here were asked to think of Torre for a moment before
Thursday night's exhibition with Texas, and they responded with
loud applause. Zimmer was in his customary spot, on a chair
adjacent to the Yankees' dugout, running the team with the special
assistant Stump Merrill and other Yankee coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer, who has spoken to Torre repeatedly in recent days,
suggested the Yankees' manager could come back perhaps as soon as
the first weekend of the regular season, when the Yankees play host
to Detroit at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank Torre, the manager's brother, and others in the
organization are suggesting that Torre might need as long as three
months to recover. Joe Torre must not only be well enough to make a
manager's decisions, but he must also be ready to handle the team's
rigorous travel and the intense scrutiny he will face when he
returns.
</P>
<P>
   And the manager's older brother made it clear that the lure of
baseball would not be a factor in determining when Torre comes
back; the only objective, Frank Torre said, is for Joe Torre to
regain his health. ``How long it takes is unimportant,'' Frank
Torre said. ``Managing is unimportant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have not formally announced that the 68-year-old
Zimmer will be the manager. But as Torre awaited the results of a
biopsy on Monday, he asked Zimmer to fill in if he had to leave the
team, and on Wednesday, Steinbrenner visited Zimmer at home, where
the coach was recovering from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden somebody pounded on the door and there was
Steinbrenner,'' Zimmer said. ``He said, `When the hell are you
going to get up? C'mon, let's go.' He said hopefully Joe won't miss
too much time, but you'll run the club.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer has 13 seasons of managerial experience, with San Diego,
Boston, Texas and the Chicago Cubs. But he sees no reason to change
the Yankees, who have won two championships in Torre's three
seasons. ``Joe and I sat side by side for three years, and I think
we kind of think alike,'' said Zimmer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Yankees' coaching staff will share the day-to-day
responsibilities of spring training: the pitching coach Mel
Stottlemyre will work with the pitchers; Willie Randolph, the
former second baseman, will oversee the infielders, etc. Once the
season starts, however, Zimmer will have full control, including
decisions regarding the pitching _ when to take out a pitcher, whom
to bring in from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to manage, I'm going to make the pitching
decisions, and that's taking nothing away from Mel,'' Zimmer said.
``Until Joe gets back, I will make the decisions. That doesn't mean
I won't discuss them with Mel.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cone said Zimmer would be fine as interim manager, and if
any group of players could be self-propelled, it would be the
Yankees, who are loaded with intense veterans. Before Torre left
Legends Field Wednesday, he told Cone and Roger Clemens and others
to take control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I just want you guys to be leaders, and not let
anybody stray, not let anybody slack off,''' Cone recalled. ``In
the midst of going through what he went through, he had the
presence of mind to tell us to not let anybody step out of line.''

 &HT;    Haitian death toll now a mystery
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ One boat or two? Fifteen lost souls or
40?
</P>
<P>
   A relative claimed Thursday that at least one of the three
Haitians who survived Saturday's mass drowning off Palm Beach
County lied about the number of boats and people, adding to
confusion and doubt already surrounding the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents increased the mystery by removing another
survivor from Good Samaritan Hospital and saying they couldn't
disclose where he was being held, whether he was under suspicion of
being a smuggler or whether it was for his protection as a witness.
Yvon Pierre-Louis had been under 24-hour guard since Monday and was
not allowed to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the jumbled stories of survivors and a report that two
boats were missing from the Bahamas, U.S. Border Patrol and Coast
Guard units thought they were searching for victims of a double
capsizing that threw 43 people into the water. Border Patrol agents
suspected the boats were run by smugglers who ferry desperate
Haitian immigrants to the United States from the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard rescued three men and picked up the bodies of
two women, leaving 38 presumed missing. No more bodies have come
ashore and no debris has been found, but the Border Patrol hasn't
ruled out the possibility of two boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, there still could have been two,'' said Dan
Geoghegan, assistant chief of the Border Patrol in Miami. ``The
good news is maybe there weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Two survivors, who gave their names as Carmel Auguste and Peter
Pierre, were taken to Krome Detention Center after leaving the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   When first rescued, the men said they were on a single boat,
though they weren't sure how many people were on board. As
investigators questioned them, their stories began to change and
contradict each other: two boats; one caught fire _ or took on
water _ and sank; one tried to help the other and both sank.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Pierre's real name is Wilner Casseus, and he made up the
story about the two boats, his brother said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Chavannes Casseus, a Palm Beach County resident, said he got a
call Saturday to visit his brother in the hospital. When he
arrived, Wilner Casseus told him there was only one boat with 18
people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Wilner gave authorities a fake name because he was scared of
being deported or charged with something, his brother said: ``If he
tell a lot of lies, it's because he's so scared. He don't know what
to do so he make up a lot of lies.'' Chavannes Casseus called
Daniella Henry, director of the Haitian American Community Council,
on Tuesday after she went on the air on WHSR. Henry had held a
lively discussion on Radio Haiti-Amerique Internacional with
callers.
</P>
<P>
   Chavannes Casseus said his brother is from l'Artibonite, a
grain-producing district in central Haiti hit hard last year by
Hurricane Mitch. Henry said the other two survivors, Pierre-Louis
and Auguste, are also from l'Artibonite. Marie Joseph of West Palm
Beach said she believes her young cousin, Elie Norelus, was on the
boat with the men and that the boy's mother lives in l'Artibonite.
</P>
<P>
   Henry said she interviewed Pierre-Louis in the hospital
Saturday, before he was placed under guard, and that he told her he
never saw two boats. But he also said that when everyone was
swimming around in the water, he talked with someone he didn't know
_ a man he believes could not have been on his boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a mystery somewhere,'' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no mystery about Haitians telling conflicting
stories about their perilous journeys to the United States. It's
standard procedure, according to the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every vessel that lands, whether there's a tragedy or no
tragedy, if 20 people are on that boat, I get 19 different
stories,'' Geoghegan said. ``They're instructed by the smugglers to
tell conflicting and confusing stories to stymie any
investigation.''

EYES OF WORLD TO BE ON MISSOURI CITY AS THREE NATIONS JOIN NATO

   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ The world map will be redrawn in
Independence today.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic will join NATO in
ceremonies beginning at 11:30 a.m. at the Truman Library in
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will preside. She will be
joined by foreign ministers Bronislaw Geremek of Poland, Jan Kavan
of the Czech Republic and Janos Martonyi of Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Their aircraft is expected to arrive at Downtown Airport at
10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The event represents the first expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion effectively redraws the boundaries of Europe,
pushing the alliance some 400 miles east toward Russia _
encompassing territory once controlled by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also commits U.S. military forces to the defense
of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, as if they were any
other of the current 16 NATO member nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just absolutely astounding,'' said Robert L. Stockwell of
Overland Park, Kan., a former U.S. Army officer who worked for NATO
in the early 1990s. ``It's astounding to see where we are now, 50
years after the Cold War began.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO was created in 1949 to confront the Soviet Union in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of communism that began in 1989, however, left many
former Soviet satellites eager to join the alliance. In July 1997,
NATO invited Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to represent
the first wave of expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Last April the U.S. Senate approved the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   For all its geopolitical import, the NATO ceremony should not
tie up traffic across Kansas City. The ceremony and ensuing
luncheon are private events, and the Truman Library will be closed
to the public for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ceremony will be big news around the world. About 30
print foreign correspondents are expected, and foreign television
broadcast crews will use as many as seven satellite trucks. The
first of those were pulling into place Thursday in front of the
library at U.S. 24 and North Delaware Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Each foreign minister will speak briefly, and Albright will
follow with about a 30-minute address.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hackman, Truman Library director, understands that
Albright's remarks will be the first of three major NATO addresses
she will make in 1999, NATO's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   By holding today's event at the Truman Library, Hackman said,
the State Department is delivering a clear tribute to former
President Harry S. Truman and his secretary of state, Dean Acheson,
for their leadership in helping to found NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the focus of Madeleine Albright's comments is putting
NATO into historical perspective, it seemed to the State Department
that the library would be an appropriate place to look at NATO
until now,'' Hackman said.
</P>
<P>
   A 50th anniversary NATO summit, bringing together the leaders of
44 nations, is scheduled in Washington in late April.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of debate, however, whether expanding NATO is even
a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have argued that the expansion promotes U.S. security
interests by nurturing new democracies in Europe and providing a
hedge against a resurgent Russia. Those supporters include Bill
Eckhardt, a lawyer and retired Army colonel who teaches at the
University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely in favor of this,'' said Eckhardt. ``NATO is
the linchpin alliance that we have had for this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckhardt believes, however, that not nearly enough debate
preceded NATO's decision to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whates with NATO and its expansion is crucial,''
Eckhardt said. ``My frustration is is that there is an educational
process that goes along with this that was, in my judgment, absent.
This comes as close to committing us to war than anything else that
I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, meanwhile, have maintained that NATO expansion will
dilute the organization's original mission of self-defense, and
also antagonize Russia. In fact, during a Munich, Germany,
conference last month, a Russian official declared that NATO was
intent on the ``destruction of the existing world order'' in its
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Everett of Independence, a former intelligence officer
with the CIA who served many years in Europe, believes NATO
officials want to aggravate Russia by expanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if we can irritate them enough, and maybe if we can get
enough rhetoric out of them in response, it will help to continue
the idea that we can have a potential resurrection of the `evil
empire' and that we must continue to support NATO,'' said Everett,
who also is executive director of the Kansas City Interfaith Peace
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Stockwell, the former NATO officer, believes expansion is in the
best interests of those nascent democracies eager to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that they are without the communist albatross around their
necks, they have to find the natural relationships with their
neighboring countries on both their west and east,'' he said.

MIAMI SPELLS SUCCESS FOR REDHAWKS STAR SZCZERBIAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ One of the most traumatic moments in Wally
Szczerbiak's life came in first grade.
</P>
<P>
   Already it had been hard, because first grade was in Madrid,
Spain, where his father, Walter, was a professional basketball
player.
</P>
<P>
   Then his teacher dropped this assignment on the class: Write
your name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking, `You've got to be kidding me,'''
Szczerbiak said.
</P>
<P>
   Six consonants and a random vowel in the first seven letters was
graduate-school work, not something for kids. But the teacher
insisted. So Szczerbiak, tongue out, persevered.
</P>
<P>
   After about 20 minutes, he had strung it together.
</P>
<P>
   Whew.
</P>
<P>
   From there, life has been pretty much downhill.
</P>
<P>
   It's the rest of us who must now learn what he mastered in first
grade, including the Superdome's marquee for the Midwest Regional
in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the region's big-time programs such as Kentucky, Kansas
and Utah, the 6-8 senior forward might well be the best player
here. It is the Washington Huskies' misfortune to have drawn his
number, and the greater misfortune of the scribes who chronicle
them to have to type his name.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps through practice we would be better at it by now, had
Szczerbiak gone to a college more commensurate with his talents,
such as Iowa, or St. John's, or George Washington, to name a few
that recruited him out of Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But he chose to dwell in relative basketball obscurity by
attending Miami, a college that must be distinguished by the phrase
``of Ohio,'' because of confusion with the other school, Miami of
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, sorry. I meant Boise of Florida. No, wait. Ohio of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's not like I'm the only one messed up. One of Miami's
recent stars, Devin Davis, tells the story of getting his first
recruiting call from a Miami assistant coach. After about 20
minutes, he agreed to take a visit. But he couldn't figure out why
the guy wanted him to have a plane ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Davis lived in Miami, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   To confuse geographic matters further, Miami of Szczerbiak is
the name of the school, not its town, which is Oxford (not THAT
Oxford). Oxford is a little burg of 19,000 just inside the Indiana
border, about 35 miles northwest of Cincinnati, which you may
recall was the hometown of Xavier, the Huskies' first-round
opponent in last year's hoops cavalcade. (Ohio is full of obscure
Division I schools that annually fill out the fringes of the NCAA
bracket just to hassle Washington. Or have you forgotten that
Dayton upset the Huskies of Detlef Schrempf and Chris Welp in the
1984 NCAA tourney's third round?)
</P>
<P>
   Oxford isn't that far from Dayton, or Indianapolis, or
Louisville, but it isn't really anywhere in particular, either. The
school could just as easily be known as Miami of Nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that Miami is part of the Mid-America
Conference, which, despite being 52 years old, has hidden in the
Midwest more successfully than cutting-edge fashion.
</P>
<P>
   While having a fair reputation in football, the MAC in
basketball, aside from 1986 Miami graduate Ron Harper, the Chicago
Bulls guard, doesn't have much to recommend it. Miami has been as
successful in the tourney as any of the 13 MAC schools, and has a
4-17 record.
</P>
<P>
   Friday marks the RedHawks' fourth tourney appearance in the past
eight years. The most startling game came in 1995, when they beat
No. 5 seed Arizona 71-62 in the first round at Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   That may well represent 10th-seeded Miami's
once-every-hundred-years tourney lightning strike. Problem is, as
Szczerbiak noted, conferences such as the MAC, and schools such as
Miami, just don't see players such as UW's 7-foot Todd MacCulloch.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a midmajor conference, we get good guards, but the big
difference is we don't get the 7-foot shot blockers,'' he said.
``(Friday) will be different for us because in our conference, we
match up better using our smaller lineup. Here, we're going to have
to come up with something we've never done before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies, on the other hand, may not have seen anyone quite
like Szczerbiak, not even at Stanford. The MAC Player of the Year,
who led the conference in scoring (23.6 ppg, fifth in the nation),
was second in rebounding (8.6), fourth in field goal percentage
(52.1), third in free throw percentage (82.6) and ninth in 3-point
shooting (34.7 percent). He could well be the most complete player
in the tourney, and NBA scouts project him as a sure first-round
draftee, perhaps even a lottery pick.
</P>
<P>
   It might be that Szczerbiak's decision to attend a smaller
school where he stands out is paying off. It's safe to say that he
has more fame than consonants. After leading the 1998 U.S. Goodwill
Games team in scoring, he has been the darling of the national
media on its annual hunt for the obscure star.
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak had a high school teammate who went to a big school
and became lost in the roster, a fate he wanted to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go somewhere where I wouldn't play,'' he
said. ``It's been fun having the attention, but we haven't had much
as a team, so this (game) will be great.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career is perfect, in my mind. There's no other place I'd
rather be.''
</P>
<P>
   Szczerbiak is among those rare people who got his tough stuff
done in first grade. Dunking over MacCulloch becomes child's play.

UW'S HUARD RESTORING DRAFT STATUS AFTER TOUGH SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The reconstruction of Brock Huard has begun.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a total reclamation project. The University of
Washington quarterback does have NFL size (6-foot-5, 230 pounds)
and one of the strongest _ if not (start ital) the (end ital)
strongest _ arms of any passer in this year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   But there is definitely some patch work to do after Huard's
ill-fated junior season, when his struggles matched those of his
team and the blame was too often pointed at him.
</P>
<P>
   The process continued Thursday when scouts from more than 20 NFL
teams gathered at the UW to watch 17 draft hopefuls run and jump
and lift.
</P>
<P>
   Having already worked out at the scouting combine in
Indianapolis last month, Huard didn't participate in drills _ he
got drilled.
</P>
<P>
   Huard huddled with a scout from one team to talk about reading
defenses, then was whisked away by a scout from another team to
discuss just what happened to the Huskies last season and his role
in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reconstruction, that's a good way to put it,'' said Jon
Kingdon, a scout for the Oakland Raiders. ``Brock had a tough
season, but he'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   After his sophomore season, Huard was considered one of the top
quarterbacks eligible for the draft. Until, that is, he decided to
return for another season with the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a running game and too few NFL-caliber linemen left
Huard to throw and throw and throw, until he was battered and had
developed some bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   Huard didn't, and still doesn't, offer explanations. Instead, he
set about getting better by working with former Seahawks coach Tom
Flores and ex-UW quarterback Hugh Millen to correct some flaws that
developed during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm physically solid right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Huard was very accurate on his medium-range passes,
but still displayed the habit of throwing off his back foot when
serving up the deep ball. He did the same thing at the combine, a
reaction to being repeatedly blasted by blitzing pass rushers.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Demoff, his agent, likens Huard's situation to that of
Dan Marino in 1983. Marino's draft stock slipped his senior season
at Pittsburgh and he was the sixth quarterback selected in the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened to Brock has given him a quiet
determination,'' Demoff said Thursday. ``Some teams won't go past
the obvious. Other teams will. Those teams willing to take the time
to try to find out the answers to what happened to Brock last year
will be rewarded.''

   GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER RESIGNS IN SURPRISE MOVE
</P>
<P>
   After losing a power struggle over economic policy that had sent
tremors across Europe for months, Germany's left-wing finance
minister and the chairman of its ruling party abruptly resigned
from both jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Oskar Lafontaine marked a stunning turn for
Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, but it had implications
well beyond Germany. As one of Europe's most combative and
ideological leaders, Lafontaine had almost single-handedly talked
down the value of Europe's new single currency, the euro, with his
loud and unrelenting demands on the European Central Bank for lower
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The euro rose against the dollar as traders said that the
resignation of Lafontaine would ease the economic change that
Europe needs to revive growth.
</P>
<P>
   NO DEAL YET ON OIL PRODUCTION CUTS
</P>
<P>
   Oil ministers from five major oil producing nations met in the
Netherlands in an effort to cut crude oil exports of up to two
million barrels a day, which is aimed at further bolstering the
recent modest recovery in crude oil prices. But the ministers broke
up without issuing a statement and will meet again Friday. Prices
of crude oil have rebounded by about $3.30 a barrel since
mid-February, and production cuts would most likely drive up
gasoline prices, which have been kept low by the oil glut.
</P>
<P>
   NIKE CRITIC APPLAUDS PROGRESS
</P>
<P>
   A prominent critic, who hurt Nike's image when he exposed unsafe
conditions at one of its factories in Vietnam in 1997, issued a
report that gave the footwear giant high marks for improving air
quality at the plant, although he said some problems remained.
</P>
<P>
   NO DEAL SIGNALS TROUBLE FOR NISSAN
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Nissan plunged and the automaker's credit rating fell
after the collapse of its merger talks with DaimlerChrysler. The
failure of the talks signaled serious problems not only for Nissan
but for other auto makers.
</P>
<P>
   Few car companies have been the object of as much unwanted
attention lately as BMW, but the company's executives say they want
to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   ANN TAYLOR PROFIT MISSES ESTIMATES
</P>
<P>
   Ann Taylor Stores, the women's apparel retailer, said that
fourth-quarter profits were nearly five times greater than a year
earlier but still missed Wall Street estimates. The company posted
net income of $11.8 million, or 42 cents a share, up from $2.4
million, or 9 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Its
shares fell 87.5 cents, to $45.3125.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT TO SHIFT REVENUE
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it expected to shift $400 million in revenue from
its third quarter to its fourth quarter because of a delay in the
introduction of the next generation of word-processing and
spreadsheet software.
</P>
<P>
   TAKEOVER BATTLES ON EUROPEAN FRONT
</P>
<P>
   Europe's three big hostile-takeover battles veered off into
different directions as investors viewed a three-way French bank
combination as increasingly possible, prospects for an Italian
telephone acquisition seemed to dim and signs of an amicable truce
emerged between two luxury-goods giants.
</P>
<P>
   ORACLE SHARES FALL SHARPLY
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Oracle dropped in after-hours trading after the
company reported slower than anticipated software sales. The
company reported third-quarter earnings that essentially matched
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   National Semiconductor posted a less-than-expected loss for its
third quarter and expects a similar loss in the fourth quarter.

NEW YORK CITY POPULATION GROWTH ACCELERATES SLIGHTLY, DATA SHOW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Ga., Nev. N.J.)   (rk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New York City's population grew more last year than
in any other year since 1986, fueled by a continuing heavy influx
of immigrants and a decline in the number of people leaving for
other regions, according to new estimates released Thursday by the
U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rise was not huge _ between 1997 and 1998, the city's
population grew by 34,672, or one-half of 1 percent, to 7.42
million _ it represented an acceleration of the city's slow but
steady growth since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The new estimates show that for the second consecutive year, all
five of the city's boroughs grew. Queens, the city's major magnet
for immigrants, had the largest number of new residents in the
state, 14,701, while Richmond County _ Staten Island _ was the
state's fastest-growing county, at 1.3 percent. In recent years,
the fastest growing has usually been Putnam County.
</P>
<P>
   New York state's population grew last year to 18.17 million, an
increase of 29,101, or 0.2 percent percent. As has been the case
since 1995, the state's population would have shrunk last year _ by
5,571 people _ without New York City's growth.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's population increased more robustly last year, to
8.1 million people, an increase of 56,627, or 0.7 1 percent.
Eighteen of the state's 21 counties grew, with Somerset County
leading the way, growing by 2.3 percent. Cumberland, Salem and
Essex Counties lost population.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's population barely inched up last year, growing by
6,829, or 0.2 percent, to 3.27 million. All eight counties in the
state showed modest growth except New London, which saw its
population decline by 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the city's growth, the new census figures show that the
New York metropolitan region, along with the entire Northeast,
continued to lag well beyond the rest of the nation. While the
Northeast grew by 0.3 percent, the West grew by 1.6 percent, the
South by 1.3 percent and the Mountain states by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new census estimates, California led the nation
in actual population growth last year, increasing to 32,555,550, a
rise of 484,432 people, or 1.5 percent. Four California counties _
Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego and Riverside _ were among the top
10 counties nationwide in population growth.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada was the fastest-growing state, gaining 68,207 people, or
4.1 percent, to reach 1.74 million. But 4 of 10 fastest-growing
counties with more than 10,000 people were in Georgia, led by
Forsyth County near Atlanta, which grew at a pace of 13 percent
last year.

historically a house of refuge, has turned its back on one of the
groups in greatest need _ people with AIDS. Instead of preaching
sermons of understanding and compassion and offering assistance,
too many black pastors merely rail and condemn.
 &HT;    Simply stated, the black pulpit has abnegated its
responsibilities in dealing with AIDS.
 &HT;    ``The church is where the structure is in the African-American
community,'' said Julia Walker, a spokeswoman for the New
York-based Balm in Gilead Inc., an AIDS information organization.
``An AIDS victim may not set foot in a church, but his mother
probably does.''
 &HT;    Listen to others speak of the black church and its hard line
toward AIDS:
 &HT;    Michael Howard of the Tampa AIDS Network: ``A lot of churches
have the `don't ask, don't tell' attitude. These pastors have a
great responsibility. They have an obligation not only to the
spiritual needs of their congregations, but to the physical needs,
too.''
 &HT;    An AIDS Partnership spokesperson: ``Pews are filled with people
whose lives have been touched by AIDS, who sit silently fearing to
share their pain because AIDS is `not spoken' there. And others are
absent from the pews because they feel they can no longer worship
with people who ignore their hurt or, worse, condemn those who are
suffering.''
 &HT;    Walker and other AIDS workers want the church to become AIDS
information and education centers. ``That process can't get rolling
until preachers jump on board,'' Walker said. ``Right now many
people in these churches can't have a conversation about AIDS
because they're busy associating it with homosexuality.''
 &HT;    For the last 10 years, however, the Balm in Gilead has been
trying to bring the black church into the fight against the spread
of AIDS among African-Americans. A major program in the
organization's effort is the Black Church Week of Prayer for the
Healing of AIDS, which began Sunday, March 7. The national program
is modeled after the successful Harlem Week of Prayer that Pernessa
C. Seele established in 1989 to educate and mobilize Harlem's
religious community.
 &HT;    In 1995, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded a
pilot study of the Black Church Week of Prayer in six cities.
Today, this national program has enlisted 10,000 churches
throughout the nation. Organizers say that the weeklong event is
effective because blacks believe that prayer, education and social
action go hand in hand. Because the church continues to be the
cornerstone of African-American life, it serves as the headquarters
for disseminating information on issues of health, politics and
social change.
 &HT;    ``Given the church's central role in the lives of most
African-Americans, it is essential that religious organizations
lead the struggle to stop the seemingly uncontrollable spread of
the disease and to deliver and demand more services and resources
for people and families infected or affected,'' Seele said.
 &HT;    Following are some of the activities that churches can conduct
during the week of prayer: Leaders can incorporate messages about
HIV/AIDS prevention and compassion throughout the week; the pastor
can deliver a sermon on HIV/AIDS and the role of the church;
leaders can distribute HIV/AIDS education materials to the
congregation and hold a seminar during a special service such as
Sunday school or a youth forum.
 &HT;    Any black person who dismisses the efforts of the Balm in Gilead
needs to consider a sampling of the AIDS statistics:
 &HT;    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the U.S. population,
they account for nearly 50 percent of AIDS cases. By 2005, that
figure is expected to rise to 60 percent.
 &HT;    Today, 300,000 to 500,000 blacks are infected with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS. Most are young, and many live in poor
neighborhoods.
 &HT;    AIDS kills twice as many black males age 25 to 44 as does
homicide. AIDS has become the leading cause of death for blacks
under age 55, even before cancer and heart disease.
 &HT;    More black children are infected with HIV than are children of
all other races combined.
 &HT;    By 2000, a black woman will be nearly 20 times more likely to
have AIDS than a non-black American woman.
 &HT;    Given this grim portrait, the Balm in Gilead should be commended
for encouraging blacks and their congregations to participate in
the Black Church Week of Prayer for the Healing of AIDS. The
problem is that too few African-Americans are heeding the Balm in
Gilead's life-saving message.

SAVING AMERICA? TEN REASONS NOT TO INGEST THIS PROPAGANDA

 By RAOUL LOWERY CONTRERAS 
 &HT;    (Raoul Lowery Contreras, Mexican American, is a columnist and
editorial board member of La Prensa San Diego. He hosts his own
radio talk show on KOGO-AM.) 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Gratuitous assertion is the term in English that appropriately
describes an anti-Hispanic video tape from the San Fernando Valley,
Calif.-based Voice of Citizens Together (VCT). It means a
declaration made to prove a point or to argue without objective
proof.
 &HT;    This method of public communication by VCT replicates the
one-sided assault on the senses of the German people during the
'30s by the Nazi Party of Adolf Hitler and propagandist Joseph
Goebbels.
 &HT;    VCT, of course, will cry foul of this comparison, but they can't
deny that their methods are identical, and that they are certainly
ethnically-phobic of Mexican-origin people, much like the Nazis
were of Jews. The proof is in their own words and in this video.
 &HT;    First, this homemade video from the computer of VCT founder,
Glenn Spencer, is a ripoff. Made from snippets of tape from
newscasts, taken out of context and without balance, it first cost
$25.00. The price then dropped to $14.95 and again to $9.95.
Perhaps they were experiencing difficulty selling their hateful
assertions.
 &HT;    Secondly, unsupported statements abound in this video.
 &HT;    For example, 1, we see a picture of an All-American Iowa boy
who, the narrator tells us, was bound for college, that 14 colleges
wanted him to play football, but because of Mexican drug dealers he
was now reporting to a probation officer, not school. Did a Mexican
drug dealer hold a gun to the boy's head to force him to abuse
drugs? No proof.
 &HT;    Example 2a: The narrator tells us that after the Tyson Foods
company of Arkansas posted billboards in Mexico about jobs in
Arkansas ``the illegal alien population (in Arkansas) exploded _
there were five drive-by shootings in one week.'' No numbers, no
arrest reports, nothing. Just the narrator's statement. Many of the
new Mexican-origin people in Arkansas are completely legal, many
born in the United States. They have saved dozens of factories and
revitalized Northwest Arkansas.
 &HT;    Example 2b: Drive-by shootings in the same breath with illegal
aliens, leading the listener to conclude that the shooting were by
these same illegal aliens. But where they? We don't know, because
there is no proof offered. Did Mexican kids shoot up an Arkansas
middle school last year, killing school children?
 &HT;    Example 3: The narrator says, ``The Mexican crime wave spreading
across the West is just a taste of things to come,'' but forgets to
tell us that all crime is down including that of Mexican-origin
people. Fast falling crime rates and a concurrent ``rise in illegal
immigration'' simply don't correlate.
 &HT;    Example 4: ``Mexican immigration is threatening California's
existence as part of America.'' Notice the constant referencing of
their enemies as illegal aliens, immigrants and Mexican immigrants
in an attempt to lump all people of Mexican-origin together into
one mass conspiratorial ``Mexican Nationalist'' cabal. There is no
distinction in the minds of VCT of native-born American citizens of
Mexican-origin, legal or illegal immigrants from Mexico. Moreover
they trash the Constitution by calling the 14th Amendment _ that
declares that all ``persons born'' in the United States are
citizens, regardless of parentage _ a ``legal loophole.''
 &HT;    Example 5: The narrator refers to a 1992 Los Angeles County
sponsored study about illegals as ``since suppressed.'' The truth:
The study was so poorly done (as are many government reports) it
was discarded. It wasn't suppressed.
 &HT;    Example 6: Hispanics (notice the change in label) kill cops just
to see how it feels, the narrator tells us, as we see two young men
with Spanish-surnames arrested for allegedly killing two police
officers. No mention if they were convicted; no mention of any
other cops being killed and by whom. Logical question: Have
non-Hispanic American citizens ever killed a cop? VCT doesn't say.
 &HT;    Example 7: Five million Californians voted to pass Proposition
187 in 1994, the narrator says. He forgot to mention that almost 5
million voted against it because of its fascist wording and
philosophy and that seven judges (six White males and one White
female) enjoined it or declared it unconstitutional.
 &HT;    Example 8: ``Art Torres (the State Democratic Chairman) is an
anti-American, pro-Mexican racist.'' Why? Because the narrator says
he is. Proof? His statement that Prop. 187 was the last gasp of
White America (VCT?) in California.
 &HT;    Example 9: ``Some in California say the term Democrat leader and
traitor are synonymous,'' solemnly declares the narrator. ``Some,''
clearly means Glenn Spencer and the VCT.
 &HT;    Example 10: Los Angeles State Sen. Richard Alarcon has ``very
close ties to the Communist Party,'' the video tells us. Proof: His
sister is a member of the Communist Party. Is he? No. But, thus, he
has ``close ties'' to the Party, according to VCT.
 &HT;    There are at least 50 more examples of deceptive and gratuitous
assertion techniques in this 45-minute videotape. The most
egregious is the constant lumping in together of anyone of
Mexican-origin into this ``invasion,'' as they call it. They
include all immigrants from Mexico, legal and illegal into a giant
invasion and conspiracy to take over California in alliance with
native-born Mexican origin people.
 &HT;    The video refers to all these people, American citizens
included, as a ``cultural cancer that is eating at the very heart
of our nation, American and Western Civilization.''
 &HT;    Substitute the word Jew for Mexican in this video and we
experience a horrible `deja vu' all over again.
 &HT;    VCT and its leader Glenn Spencer claim they will save America
from the ``cultural cancer'' with this videotape, at $9.95. Proof?
Ask them.

 &HT;    It was already a done deal on Dec. 1, the day the Board of
Fellows _ a small group of Notre Dame officials entrusted with
defining the school's Catholic character _ unanimously decided not
to add the category of ``sexual orientation'' to the university's
non-discrimination policy.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, more than 100 students staged a three-day hunger
strike, supporting a resolution before the full board of trustees
earlier this month, a proposed policy change that would have banned
discrimination against gays on the South Bend campus.
 &HT;    Even celebrity alumnus Phil Donahue weighed in with his support
of the resolution. ``What sort of inclusion is it if they say that
you are gay, you are a member of the Notre Dame family, but they
won't even give you a room to meet in,'' Donahue said at a
student-sponsored speak out, referring to the gay student group
that has been banned from campus for several years.
 &HT;    Gay alumni wrote to each of the 55 trustees, urging them to
approve the change. ``We believe it is time for the university to
explicitly adopt a policy which commits the university to refrain
from using sexual orientation as a criterion in the hiring,
retention, and promotion of faculty and staff, and in the admission
and treatment of students,'' wrote the chairman of the 750-member
lesbian and gay alumni organization.
 &HT;    The proposed change enjoyed widespread support among students
and faculty, receiving endorsements from various student government
organizations and both the Faculty Senate and the Academic Council,
the university's highest representative governing body.
 &HT;    But in the end, Notre Dame trustees _ the final authority on the
matter _ unanimously rejected the proposal, saying in a statement
released after the vote they did not ``believe that the university
should leave to civil courts the interpretation and application of
Church teaching.'' Making sexual orientation a ``protected
category'' could inhibit the school in its ability to ``make
decisions which are necessary to support Catholic church
teaching,'' according a statement, released by the trustees on Feb.
5, the day of the vote.
 &HT;    The trustees' action caps a nearly five-year old struggle for
civil rights protection. That struggle erupted during the 1994-95
academic year when the vice president of student affairs outlawed
the self-governing gay student group. Because the gay students
failed to adopt chastity as one of their organizing principles (no
other student or alumni group is expected to endorse chastity) the
vice president denied them official recognition by the university
and banned them from meeting on campus.
 &HT;    Last year an openly gay Notre Dame priest resigned under the
national news media spotlight because he had been removed from
preaching at the university's main church, an action he alleged to
be discriminatory.
 &HT;    More recently, the dean of the business college disclosed that
one highly qualified candidate for a teaching position was denied
the job, solely on the basis of his sexual orientation.
 &HT;    In 1997 the administration issued a ``spirit of inclusion''
statement strongly condemning anti-gay harassment but falling short
of banning discriminatory practices. ``We choose not to change our
legal non-discrimination clause, but we call ourselves to act in
accordance with what we regard as a higher standard _ Christ's call
to inclusiveness, coupled with the gospel's call to live chaste
lives,'' wrote the school's president, Rev. Edward A. Malloy, CSC,
who strongly opposed changing the policy.
 &HT;    It is truly unfortunate that the president, fellows, and
trustees insist on chastity as a rationale for defining Notre
Dame's Catholic character and as justification for refusing to
bring the university in line with other Catholic schools _ Boston
College, Catholic University, Georgetown, DePaul, and Loyola _ that
already bar discrimination based on sexual orientation. Notre Dame
misses the point: The real issue is legal protection for gays in
the classroom and workplace, not permission for sexual misconduct _
gay or straight.
 &HT;    The tradition of Catholic social justice supports such
civil-rights protection for lesbians and gay men, as Richard
Peddicord, a Dominican friar and moral theologian so eloquently
argues in his book ``Gay and Lesbian Rights: A Question: Sexual
Ethics or Social Justice.''
 &HT;    ``Gay and lesbian participation in society is not a matter to be
decided by Catholic sexual ethics,'' Peddicord said last fall at a
national forum.
 &HT;    ``Sexual ethics is concerned with the values related to human
sexuality and the goals associated with human sexual functioning.
It is manifestly incapable of answering questions concerning human
and civil rights and determining who will or will not be allowed to
share in the concrete goods of society. In traditional Catholic
morality, all of these are regulated by the primary social virtue,
that of justice,'' he said.
 &HT;    Isn't it about time that Notre Dame establish the virtue of
social justice as fundamental to her Catholic character?

<P>
   It has been 38 years since John Fitzgerald Kennedy uttered that
famous phrase, ``Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what
you can do for your country.'' With his historic election as the
youngest president of the United States and the first to break the
WASP tradition the charismatic Kennedy inspired an entire
generation of Americans to public service.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1963, an Arkansas teenager had a fateful meeting on the
White House lawn with President Kennedy. That encounter and
handshake with JFK solidified William Jefferson Clinton's own
desire to pursue a career in public service.
</P>
<P>
   Like many baby boomers, President Clinton was strongly motivated
by a combination of his desire to change the world for the better
and to make history for himself. Unfortunately, his impeachment
will guarantee a place in history, even if it is not in the way
Clinton would have wished to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond the scandals, however, I am drawn to an aspect of
Clinton's presidency that has often been overlooked: Clinton has
tried to inspire a renewed call for public service. Especially
considering the social climate in this generation of apathy,
cynicism and anti-government sentiment, Clinton strove to engage
all Americans to solve the nation's problems together. And at least
one positive contribution of his presidency will outlast the
negatives.
</P>
<P>
   Some might recall that Bill Clinton and Al Gore campaigned in
1992 on, among other issues, the need for change in the way our
government works. So, as the first baby boomer to reach the White
House, Clinton brought new ideas and energy to the way government
services were delivered to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton believes that the government should provide conditions
and tools to empower people to meet their own challenges.
Therefore, as chief executive officer of the nation, he indeed
tried to make the government a partner to the people, and over the
past six years, many of his cabinet and other agencies created
dozens of new programs to serve the people in ways that were never
tried before.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also knew how to capitalize on human resources. From the
beginning of his administration, Clinton tapped enormous talent
from the private sector, academia, and state and local governments
to bring their expertise and experience into the federal
government. He also placed Gore in charge of ``Reinventing
Government,'' reviewing the efficiency of every agency at the
federal level, and recommending major overhauls. As a result, the
federal government under Clinton became much smaller in workforce
and bureaucracy, but produced better service than before.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of Clinton's rethinking on the role of government
involved active engagement of the citizenry. Starting with
AmeriCorps, like the Peace Corps, his Kennedy-esque call for
volunteerism; One America _ The President's Initiative on Race; and
his notoriously long, fact-and-data-filled State of the Union
lectures, Clinton has always attempted to nudge the American people
into action.
</P>
<P>
   He also traveled more than other presidents and held hundreds of
townhall meetings, connected with ordinary Americans from all walks
of life, and encouraged children and young Americans to dream big.
</P>
<P>
   Having followed this president closely over the years, I saw
that so much of what Clinton worked for simply did not resonate
with the Korean American (KA) community. Particularly frustrating
is that whenever the president engaged the government to develop
people-friendly programs or initiatives, the KA community failed to
live up to its end of the partnership, like participating in
townhall meetings, even in towns or cities with large KA
populations, or attended White House conferences on issues
important to Korean Americans, or appeared at briefings on the
President's Initiative on Race.
</P>
<P>
   Also, even though the administration appointed more Asian
Pacific Americans to important agencies and positions than any
other president in history, very few Korean Americans ever put
themselves forward to serve in Clinton's government, or even
volunteered in AmeriCorps or other public service programs.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't born when Kennedy was assassinated, so I never had the
opportunity to see or hear the man in person. The current president
of the United States, however, is still around, and regardless of
how some Americans feel, he is still our duly elected leader. And
this president has revived and reissued Kennedy's call for active
civic participation to our generation.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it time for each of us to ask, ``What can I do for my
country?''

 c. 1999 Hispanic magazine 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Last November, Puerto Ricans on the island and in the United
States celebrated, protested, or ignored the 505th anniversary of
the ``discovery'' of Puerto Rico by Cristobal Colon (Christofer
Columbus). But on that Fall day in Brooklyn, N.Y.in a large
auditorium, a different gathering took place in contrast to the
controversial holiday.
 &HT;    Men, women, and children in traditional indigenous clothing came
together to sing, dance, feast, and pray as Tainos _ the same
people supposedly eradicated by the conquistadors.
 &HT;    Taino Nation of the Antilles (Nacion Taina de las Antillas) held
its Day of the Taino People to commemorate and celebrate the sixth
anniversary of the restoration of a people thought to be extinct by
most traditional scholars. But Nacion members from the Greater
Antilles and the Unites States feel far from extinct.
 &HT;    The Tainos are the indigenous people of the Greater Antilles _
Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Cuba. According to
most scholarly accounts, the Tainos became extinct in the mid- to
late 16th century because of the genocidal wars of conquest, as
well as from disease and suicide. Some prominent anthropologists,
including Irving Rouse of Yale and Ricardo Alegria of the
University of Puerto Rico, concede that a few Tainos did escape the
Spanish invasion by fleeing to the mountains.
 &HT;    In the last few years, however, members of the Taino Nation and
a growing number of scholars have refuted the extinction theory,
known in Taino circles as the extinction myth. ``We purposefully
chose this day (November 19) for the declaration of the restoration
in 1992,'' asserted Rene Cibanakan Marcano, a chief [kacike or
cacique] of the Taino Nation. ``We are taking it away from Columbus
and using it for this special areito [celebration].''
 &HT;    At the areito held in New York, there were many people who had
never accepted the extinction stories and had kept their feelings
to themselves before finding one another. Nacion members like Nancy
Jawar Lion-Storm had been told as children of their ``Indio''
heritage. But she quickly discovered that there was no one to share
her feelings with. Most people dismissed the idea or were openly
contemptuous of such an assertion. Lion-Storm is the Walnut Creek,
Calif. field office representative of the Cultural Center of the
Taino Nation.
 &HT;    ``I always thought of myself as Puerto Rican Taino,'' Jawar
asserted. ``And throughout my whole life, when I mentioned to other
Puerto Ricans that I was part Taino, they replied that I couldn't
be. They said the Tainos are extinct and we're all a blend. This
same thing happened when I was in college, where professors told me
that I couldn't possibly be Taino. But I knew they were wrong,''
she stated. Jawar kept her eyes and ears open, and on a 1996
research trip to New York she came across a copy of the Nation's
newsletter at the National Museum of the American Indian in
Manhattan. In the Boletin Informativo, started in 1992, she found
her connection.
 &HT;    Announcements and articles published in the Boletin report news
of alliances with other tribes and native nations, and scholarly
articles on the recovery of ancient traditions and language. For
instance, anthropologist Lynne Guitar and archaeologist Peter
Ferbel have provided solid counterarguments to the Taino extinction
theory while writer/activist Jose Barreiro, of the American Indian
Program at Cornell University, emphasizes the living aspects of the
culture.
 &HT;    Ferbel, director of archaeological and anthropological studies
at the Historical Archives of Santiago, Dominican Republic, wrote
``The Politics of Taino Indian Heritage in Post-Quincentennial
Dominican Republic: When a Canoe Means More than a Water Trough''
for his 1995 doctoral dissertation at the University of Minnesota.
In an interview last year, Ferbel expanded on some of his main
points.
 &HT;    ``The indigenous heritage survived principally in the country
(el campo) ... so the culture is there, the race [or bloodline] is
there but not the identity. ... You have people in the Antilles who
live very similarly to Tainos even though they may not make casabe
(cassava bread), but they work the higuiro (calabash) and they
don't say, `I'm Taino,' they say, `I'm Dominican or Puerto Rican or
Cuban.' ... History is often written by the people who won the
wars. In this case it's the Spanish. ... Taino heritage still
exists, it is still strong in the face of incredible adversity,''
Ferbel asserted.
 &HT;    Nation members like Fernando Nixiwei Flores are working on
providing more proof and fortifying the living culture by studying
archaeology and scuba diving, among other things. ``We'll do what
is necessary and it will be a long journey,'' he stated.

   BLACK CHURCH: CALLED TO JOIN THE FIGHT AGAINST AIDS. The black

``Instead of preaching sermons of understanding and compassion and
offering assistance, too many black pastors merely rail and
condemn,'' he writes. ``Simply stated, the black pulpit has

SPORTS COLUMN: THE COMFORTS OF HOME CAN BE CLINGING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The homecoming Stephon Marbury fantasized about did not include
a tunnel or a turnpike. Sometimes these things don't turn out
exactly the way you wish them to. Marbury, a Coney Island kid who
dreamed of being a Knick, leveraged his way out of Minnesota and a
sure-thing playoff run, and wound up Thursday with the Nets, in New
Jersey, in last place.
</P>
<P>
   He jumped at the chance, anyway, proclaiming on sports talk
radio that, in the final analysis, there's no place like home. ``I
will be signed tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is an emerging star stepping into a dowdy arena on a
shell-shocked team. His parents have a home he purchased for them
in a Baltimore suburb, near his mother's sister, but Marbury's
three older brothers and a sister remain in New York. His
4-year-old daughter lives with her mother in Brooklyn. He has
friends and acquaintances all over, and they will be close enough
to drop by now, to congratulate him on the $70 million he will sign
on for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some will inevitably come with their hopes up, and hands out.
Queens' Kenny Anderson, who as a Net spent more time hanging out
than he did in midair, could tell Marbury that sometimes these
romantic notions of playing for the home folks don't turn out the
way you wish them to, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it's the best thing for him to come back East
right now,'' said Bob Hartstein, who handed Marbury the ball as a
14-year-old at Brooklyn's Abraham Lincoln High School and watched
him become the sport's purest young point guard. ``From a
basketball point of view, I thought Minnesota was a great place for
him, a good team on the verge of being very good. There were no
distractions. He flourished there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong. He's an intelligent kid, and he's always
been pretty good at blocking things out. But it's a concern. He's
22, with millions of dollars, and you know how many people there
are in this city who are thinking their man is coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned to Hartstein that the best line I've ever heard
about those so-called distractions came from Len Elmore a few years
ago, on why he had quit the agent business. With no acknowledgments
to the creators of ``Star Trek,'' Elmore said, ``I got tired of
fighting the cling-ons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And those cling-ons,'' Hartstein said, ``never stop
clinging.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably with that in mind, Marbury's mother, Mabel, preferred
him to remain in Minnesota, with Kevin Garnett, whom he had
befriended a few years ago at a summer camp in Chicago. Garnett was
going straight to the pros from high school and helped talk Marbury
into joining him the following year after just one season at
Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett hooked Marbury up with his agent, Eric Fleisher, who
went to work on draft day and landed Marbury in Minnesota by way of
Milwaukee. Marbury was exultant that night, saying he and Garnett
were going to be the next Stockton and Malone, the brightest stars
in the northern sky, 21st-century money players.
</P>
<P>
   Except Garnett got $126 million and Marbury's hopes for a
competitive deal, an equal partnership, were crushed by the union's
lockout defeat. By the standard of who makes more, which is the
standard that translates to peer-driven status, Minnesota would
always be Garnett's team. So Fleisher was fired, David Falk hired.
Falk told Marbury he could move him to an endorsement-rich market,
and soon. Marbury decided not to wait around another month and a
half to see what the impressive young Timberwolves could become.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a couple of years, that team could have been one of the
best,'' Hartstein sighed.
</P>
<P>
   Falk told Marbury what he wanted to hear, the way Fleisher did
when Marbury was at Georgia Tech, the way Bobby Cremins did when
Marbury was at Lincoln. That is the way it is with the gifted
players. , Hartstein, who doesn't coach anymore, was settled in
front of his television, watching the other basketball madness,
when the news broke of Marbury's trade to the Netskees, partners of
George Steinbrenner, who will need some baseball financing to pay
Marbury, Kerry Kittles and Keith Van Horn. For now, Marbury has
come home to the most expensive 3-victory team in the history of
sports. &QL;

A MIXED VERDICT ON BIG EUROPEAN MERGERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Europe's three big hostile-takeover battles veered off
into different directions Thursday, as investors viewed a three-way
French bank combination as increasingly possible, prospects for an
Italian telephone acquisition seemed to dim, and signs of an
amicable truce emerged between two luxury-goods giants.
</P>
<P>
   On the Paris Bourse, shares in the three banks involved in a
now-$38 billion hostile bid by Banque Nationale de Paris for its
two French rivals, Societe Generale and Paribas, rose in heavy
trading, as investors appeared to give Banque Nationale's offer a
fighting chance.
</P>
<P>
   In Milan, Franco Bernabe, chief executive of Telecom Italia, the
nation's biggest phone company, announced defensive measures to
repel a $60 billion hostile bid by its major domestic rival,
Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   In the third corporate struggle, the month-old assault by the
big French luxury-goods group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton for
control of Gucci, the fashion house, appeared headed toward
resolution. Next week, both companies will send representatives to
Amsterdam in an attempt to settle their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci said it was sending its chief financial officer, Robert
Singer, to meet Pierre Gode, a member of LVMH's executive board.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flared in January, when LVMH, which makes such items as
Louis Vuitton bags and Moet &AMP; Chandon Champagne, amassed 34.4
percent of Gucci, but refused to bid for all the shares and
demanded a seat on Gucci's board.
</P>
<P>
   Defending itself, Gucci issued shares to an employee fund that
diluted the LVMH holding to 25 percent. LVMH took Gucci to court in
the Netherlands, where Gucci is incorporated. The court suspended
both companies' voting rights pending a decision in April.
</P>
<P>
   At next week's meeting, Gucci and LVMH are expected to discuss
ways to insure Gucci's independence. Gucci's chief executive,
Domenico De Sole, has said that a bid by LVMH for the rest of Gucci
would be the preferred solution; barring that, a noninterference
agreement might be negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   Any sign of friendly resolution appeared far off in the two
other takeover fights. In a surprise move on Tuesday night, Banque
Nationale de Paris made its offer for Societe Generale and Paribas,
which had agreed last month to merge.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken by the intrusion, the Paribas board met Thursday night,
reaffirmed its commitment to the Societe Generale merger and called
the Banque Nationale proposal unacceptable. But at least one board
member was known to have favored the Banque Nationale bid _ Claude
Bebear, chairman of the huge French insurance group AXA, which has
significant banking equity holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does an early solution appear likely in the battle by
Olivetti for control of Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts watched trading Thursday in five separate securities _
Olivetti, and ordinary and nonvoting shares in Telecom Italia and
in its mobile phone unit, Telecom Italia Mobile _ and said
investors seemed to be saying that while they were impressed by
Telecom's steps to block Olivetti, they would not be fully
convinced until Bernabe disclosed more details of his industrial
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, Bernabe won approval from his board for a
plan to sell assets and raise fresh capital, in order to buy out
the mobile phone company and convert nonvoting shares to common
stock. Estimates varied, but analysts said the moves would raise
Telecom Italia's ordinary share capital to as much as 89 billion
euros, or $97 billion, from 53 billion euros now.
</P>
<P>
   The plan requires shareholder approval, but if successful it
would likely put Telecom Italia beyond the financial reach of
Olivetti. It provoked an angry response from Olivetti's chief
executive, Roberto Colaninno, the quarterback of the hostile bid.
Bernabe's actions, he told reporters, were the ``behavior of a
monopolist,'' and he implied that Bernabe's job would be at stake
if Olivetti triumphed. ``False promises can lead to people getting
fired,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti moved up its plans to next week to present its own
industrial strategy for Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the fireworks, Olivetti shares rose 2.8 percent,
while Telecom's common stock dropped 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Deirdre Ernest, an analyst at the Caboto brokerage house in
Milan, said investors needed ``more input'' from Bernabe about
Telecom's industrial strategy. And while the share price movement
could reflect technical factors, it could also mean that investors
were ``betting Bernabe doesn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, shares in Banque Nationale de Paris rose 7.2 percent
and in Societe Generale, 13.3 percent. The sharpest gains were by
Paribas, which rose 18.1 percent, to 101.55 euros. That evidently
reflected the 18 percent premium Banque Nationale said it would pay
above the offer for Paribas made last month by Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Pebereau, Banque Nationale's chairman, says he wants a
three-way combination to form the world's largest bank, by assets,
but Paribas and Societe Generale reject the offer.

BMW CHARTS A NEW COURSE MUCH LIKE THE OLD ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ Few car companies have been the object of
as much unwanted attention lately as BMW AG, the Bavarian company
best known for its muscular but luxurious sedans and sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   First there were the continuing problems at Rover, the British
manufacturer of Land Rovers, MGs and Minis, which BMW bought in
1994 and which may have lost nearly $1 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the feuding and finger-pointing within BMW's top
management, which led to the surprise departures on Feb. 5 of its
chief executive, Bernd Pischetsrieder, and his chief rival on the
board, Wolfgang Reitzl.
</P>
<P>
   Last but not least, there has been the incessant speculation
about BMW as a takeover target. Despite repeated insistence by the
company and its biggest shareholders that the company wants to stay
independent, the conventional wisdom has been that BMW was simply
too small, too desirable and too rattled by management problems to
hold out for long. At a minimum, analysts have argued, the company
needs to trim back Rover or find it a partner.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in their first public appearances since last month's
shake-up, BMW's top executives are firing back. Their message,
delivered here this week at the annual Geneva Motor Show: No need
to change the basic strategy and no need to sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great strength of BMW is its independence,'' said Jochim
Milberg, the relatively unknown production chief who took over as
chief executive. ``BMW has the substance, the power and above all
the will'' to chart its own course, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milberg said BMW would continue to invest in Rover, even though
it has already consumed more than $4 billion. The plan assumes that
the British government will contribute more than $200 million to
modernize Rover's big factory in Longbridge, and BMW's total
investment is likely to be several times that much.
</P>
<P>
   BMW also plans to push ahead with new versions of Rover's
midpriced cars, the biggest source of the company's problems.
</P>
<P>
   The new boss did not open himself up to questions, and he left
some big ones unanswered. If BMW's board essentially dismissed
Pischetsrieder because of Rover, what is the new management going
to do differently?
</P>
<P>
   And if BMW wants to compete against the likes of DaimlerChrysler
on everything from subcompacts to luxury limousines, where will it
get the heft to do so? Many analysts have argued BMW is stretching
itself too thin, that it needs to be much bigger to survive on the
thin profit margins available in comparatively inexpensive
mass-market cars.
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Panke, a BMW board member in charge of research and
development, argued that the conventional wisdom was wrong. Rather,
he said, bigger is not necessarily better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about economies of scale,'' he said in an
interview. ``But tell me, where are they?''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Panke said, experts argued that manufacturing
costs were the main reason for companies to get bigger. Instead,
new technology has allowed companies to build factories that reach
their peak efficiency with smaller volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Painting shops used to be at peak efficiency if they had a
volume of about 200,000 cars a year, he said; today, the optimal
volume is less than half that.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is size an inherent advantage in procuring parts or
marketing, Panke argued. Companies use common parts in many
different models, but there are clear limits to the similarities
between a Chrysler Eagle and a Mercedes S-Class. And in marketing,
DaimlerChrysler has itself kept its Mercedes and Chrysler dealer
network separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the 1980s, the big story was diversifying into
aerospace or electronics,'' Panke added. ``But they found that
didn't work either.''
</P>
<P>
   BMW executives admit they have big problems. Though the company
has set a goal of making Rover profitable next year, they admit
that may not happen until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of Rover's current difficulties stems from exchange
rate differences. The British pound soared in value against other
European currencies last year. That made Rover cars much more
expensive in other European countries and severely hurt exports out
of Britain. It also drew in an avalanche of imports, driving down
British car prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Panke and other executives admit that is not the whole
story. So they have abandoned the old strategy of letting Rover
remain as ``British'' and as independent as possible. The new
approach calls for tighter integration of functions like body
design, research and information-processing.
</P>
<P>
   But those are tactical and managerial changes. On the more basic
questions, Milberg is veering little from the path charted by
Pischetsrieder. BMW will still try to offer a full range of cars
and it will not try to rearrange or consolidate its brand names.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that sense, the strategy has been confirmed,'' Panke said.

WITH HEAVIER HEAVYWEIGHTS, HOLYFIELD'S NO SURE THING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ Even while steadfastly standing by his prediction that
he will knock out Lennox Lewis in the third round at Madison Square
Garden Saturday night, Evander Holyfield's ``the bigger they are,
the harder they fall'' approach doesn't seem to hold much weight.
</P>
<P>
   A look at Holyfield's record against heavyweight opponents who
substantially outweighed him and had a significant height advantage
indicates that Lewis has a good chance of remaining upright
throughout the 12-round bout for the undisputed heavyweight
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the 6-foot-5-inch Lewis can knock out the 6-2 Holyfield
or win a decision is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who has a 6{-inch reach advantage, weighed in Thursday at
246 pounds, against 215 for Holyfield. ``He's a big target,''
Holyfield said on Wednesday at the final news conference before the
fight. ``When a person is a target is when a person can get hit.
What to do? Hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31 pounds is the most Holyfield has given up to an opponent
since he yielded 49 pounds to George Foreman (208 pounds to 257) in
April 1991. Holyfield won a 12-round decision over Foreman, who was
42 years old at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In heavyweight title bouts in which Holyfield (36-3) has given
up 15 pounds or more to his opponent, he is 4-3 with just one
knockout _ a third-round knockout of a grossly out of shape Buster
Douglas (246 pounds) in October 1990 to win the undisputed
championship. The three other victories were all in 12-round
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   One of Holyfield's three losses was an eighth-round technical
knockout to Riddick Bowe in November 1995. Bowe weighed 240 pounds
for that bout and Holyfield 213. It was the last time Holyfield
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's camp is not worried about the weight and size
differential against Lewis. ``Joe Louis gave up a lot of weight to
Primo Carnera,'' Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer, said. ``What does
it matter?''
</P>
<P>
   When boxing fans talk about Holyfield's trouble with larger
heavyweights, they typically refer to his bouts against Bowe,
against whom he went 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   In their first fight, in November 1992, the tall Bowe was a
young, strong heavyweight with an outstanding jab. The questions
about him involved his stamina and desire. This is the fight on
Holyfield's resume that most closely resembles his match against
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield weighed 205 pounds for that first Bowe fight and Bowe
235. Lou Duva, Holyfield's co-trainer at the time, said he and his
teammate George Benton had scripted the perfect plan for Holyfield,
which involved staying away from Bowe's strong jab.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him to circle him, jab and move,'' Duva said. ``But as
soon as he got hit, he went toe-to-toe with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield lost a 12-round decision. But it was the fight that
defined Holyfield as a warrior. After getting pummeled by Bowe in
the 10th round and looking out on his feet, Holyfield rallied with
a barrage of punches that stunned Bowe.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' trainer, Emanuel Steward, who guided Holyfield to a
victory in his second fight against Bowe in 1993, said that he and
Lewis had not really concentrated on the Bowe-Holyfield fights,
because Bowe fought more of an inside fight against Holyfield.
Steward said he did not expect Lewis (34-1) to stay inside against
Holyfield.

TWO APPROACHES TO TAX RESENTMENT

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14)  
 (af)  
 By DEBORAH STEAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One is respectable, one irreverent. But appropriately enough,
this being tax season, two quite different books are asking the
same question: How can we keep more of our money for ourselves?
</P>
<P>
   For one of the authors, Amity Shlaes, an editorial writer for
The Wall Street Journal, the answer is to reform the tax system.
For the other, a high-profile private investigator, the solution is
simpler: flee it.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Greedy Hand: How Taxes Drive Americans Crazy and What
to Do About It'' (Random House, $22.95), Ms. Shlaes argues that we
are being taxed as never before in peacetime history and are thus
hobbled both at home and at work.
</P>
<P>
   To show that the system is chaotic and burdensome, Ms. Shlaes
uses illustrations from everyday life, from marriage and babies to
schools and shopping. But despite her highly readable prose and a
good eye for historically interesting detail, the author often
fails to be persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that she is ideologically stubborn; conservative views
underpin the book, yet it is not a mere polemic. The problem is
that while Ms. Shlaes complains that the tax system is Procrustean,
she too often tortures her own examples into the service of a
point.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter titled ``Your Clothes,'' for example, she cites the
crowds at Mall of America near Minneapolis, a tax-free shopping
center-cum-amusement park, as shocking proof of just how far people
will go to avoid a sales tax. But what about our well-known
national proclivity toward recreational shopping, which the Mall of
America surely satisfies?
</P>
<P>
   In ``Your Accountant,'' an otherwise interesting and unusual
glimpse into H&AMP;R Block, she charts the rise of this street-corner
chain and concludes that its success is a result of the hopeless
muddle of tax rules and the misery of the average taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with ``Your Baby,'' a chapter that discusses the
so-called nanny tax, the rule that people must make Social Security
and other payments on behalf of some household employees. It's one
thing to argue that this is an onerous, and widely ignored,
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Shlaes again stretches the point to conclude that the
reason day care chains like Kindercare Learning Centers have done
so well is that ``parents are so eager to shift the burden of the
nanny laws onto someone.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same reductionist manner, she blames the tax system for
the shortage of good day care centers in this country. Where some
might see the lack of a national consensus over child care's future
as the main cause, Ms. Shlaes sees a reluctance among potential
operators to ante up their share of Social Security and other
payments in a labor-intensive business.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that Ms. Shlaes has no ammunition. She smartly
skewers the Internal Revenue Service for announcing last year that
any fan catching Mark McGwire's record-breaking home run ball might
be taxed on its hefty market value. (The IRS quickly backed off
what she calls this ``tax on joy.'')
</P>
<P>
   And she recounts, with appropriate revulsion, a grieving
parent's receipt of an IRS letter in the wake of his son's death in
the 1988 crash of a Pan Am jet in Lockerbie, Scotland. (The letter
was sent to alert survivors that any settlement award from the
airline would be taxed.)
</P>
<P>
   She also knows how to draw a wince, reporting that Americans on
average now have to toil until May 10 just to pay their taxes for
the year, according to the Tax Foundation, a research organization
based in Washington. (It was Jan. 31 in 1902, March 8 in 1940 and
May 2 in 1974.)
</P>
<P>
   Her chapters on ``Your Retirement'' and ``Your Death'' make some
solid points, too. Estate taxes _ even with the new $1 million
floor _ undermine family businesses, she asserts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she says, they rank second only to the death of the
founder as the main culprit in the failure of such enterprises in
the second generation, according to the American Family Business
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   And she has a flair for historical accounts, especially the
story of Beardsley Ruml, the former Macy's official who in 1942
came up with the idea of withholding income tax. A retailer at
heart, he called it a ``pay-as-you-go'' plan. Ms. Shlaes refers to
it as a ``bait and switch'' ploy that was aimed at masking how much
people were paying in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   We're still paying too much, she says, calling for self-managed
Social Security accounts and taxes that are easier on the
productive middle and upper classes. And, of course, individual tax
rates should be lower _ no higher than 25 percent at the federal
level.
</P>
<P>
   The second book rails against taxes, too. But its author, Edmund
J. Pankau, a high-profile private investigator, posits that the
choices are simply to ``pay up or bug out.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hide Your Assets and Disappear'' (Regan
Books/HarperCollins, $22), Pankau, who has had both the hunters and
the hunted as clients, gives detailed advice on everything from
getting a new identity to leaving the country without leaving a
trail.
</P>
<P>
   The book details how to change your appearance, in which
countries you can stage your phony death for a fee, complete with
newspaper coverage, and which financial trackers are to be feared.
(Hint: The private sector can be more relentless than government.)
</P>
<P>
   The author also offers a kind of Baedeker guide to potential
``host'' countries, complete with tables rating banking services,
extradition rules and weather. ``It's hard to beat Latin America,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Pankau warns that if you really intend to ``disappear'' into
another country with your assets, you can't give in to homesickness
and return _ or make long-distance calls to those you left behind.
The same goes for a new identity. Once you have it, you must live
it, he counsels.
</P>
<P>
   One way to get that new identity, he writes, is to visit a local
cemetery to find a dead soul who would be about your age if he or
she were alive today. The idea is to get a driver's license, Social
Security card and passport using a copy of the dead person's birth
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the graveyard trick has been known and used for a
long time, many states will still send you a birth certificate
without trying to verify the identity of the person making the
request,'' the author writes. He does add a reminder that obtaining
government documents for fraudulent purposes is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   All the advice is backed by what seems to be field-tested
research. Pankau is experienced; he has hunted down white-collar
bank crooks and reached other criminals' hidden assets. But the
tough-guy tone deteriorates at times into immaturity. (Women are
either babes or hideous ex-wives; the IRS is the ``infernal''
revenue service.)
</P>
<P>
   And the numerous copy editing lapses are disconcerting. It's
difficult to take breathtakingly risky advice from a book that
refers to the Unabomber, Theodore ``Kazinsky,'' the South American
country ``Columbia'' and ``Jonny Cochoran,'' that famous lawyer who
defended O.J. Simpson.

MY BONUS IS SMALLER THAN YOURS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Ohio)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I am a manager at a company that regularly uses cash
rewards and other recognition to single out employees for
outstanding work. The program was a big morale builder in my group,
until word got around that the winners in the marketing department
received much more money than those in other departments, including
ours. (It was news to me, too.) Short of getting the president to
balance the awards, which he has so far refused to consider, how
can I relieve my staff's resentment and restore the incentives'
effectiveness?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ouch. You have been put in an ugly, uncomfortable position _
and the damage control will probably require a combination of
sympathy, creativity and brutal honesty.
</P>
<P>
   First, the painful reality: ``The marketplace doesn't see all
functions as being equal in terms of bonus levels,'' said Kenan
Abosch, compensation business leader for Hewitt Associates, a human
resources consulting firm based in Lincolnshire, Ill. Bonuses tend
to vary among departments, just as budgets and salaries do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not feel good, but part of it has to do with the
company's philosophy,'' Abosch said. At a consumer products
company, for example, marketing often gets more attention and
resources than it does at an engineering firm.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure you understand the issue, sit down with your boss
and ask him to explain the reasons for the disparity. It may be
that marketing hands out fewer bonuses, or that its criteria are
tougher. Or the marketing staff may contribute so much to the
company's bottom line that the company will do anything to keep
them happy.
</P>
<P>
   Next, in the gentlest way possible, try to help your employees
see the logic of this policy. They may not necessarily agree with
it, but at least it won't seem so arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   To help ease the sting, try to shift your employees' focus to
the broader marketplace, advised Jorg Kasparek, compensation and
benefits vice president for NCR in Dayton, Ohio. In other words,
forget what the clowns in marketing are making and ask a different
question: What kinds of bonuses are people receiving in departments
like yours at other companies?
</P>
<P>
   If you find that your employer lags behind the market norm, you
can use the research to lobby for more money. If your company isn't
behind the curve, you can try supplementing the rewards program
with other, though smaller, incentives.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Abosch said, the real value of periodic spot bonuses
lies not so much in their size as in their immediacy, as well as in
the recognition they confer. As such, rewarding employees with
pizza parties, movie passes or gift certificates can bolster morale
without breaking your budget.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, a free pizza can't take the place of an extra-fat bonus
check. Such a gesture could even be derided as a sop. But any
additional effort you put forth on your staff's behalf can help
soothe their wounded egos and show them that someone is on their
side. &QL;

 &HT;    MIAMI _ Imagine Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
piling stacks and stacks of dollars on the front lawn of the
Palacio de Planalto, his official residence in Brasilia, dousing
them with gasoline, and torching roughly US$35 billion. The scene
is a crass simplification of the country's mighty fight during the
past year to avoid a devaluation of the Real, but Cardoso had spent
that much of the country's reserves by the middle of January to
support an exchange rate policy that the market simply would not
buy.
 &HT;    Wrong move, say analysts and economists. As Brazil and other
Latin American nations brush up on their crisis management skills,
financial professionals who monitor Latin America say the key to
minimizing future outbreaks lies in establishing sound economic
policies, such as a realistic exchange rate. Above all, the pundits
say, governments should avoid the temptation to try to control
capital flows with restrictions on foreign currency transactions.
 &HT;    Regional riptide. Such steps do not contain all outflows and
they can scare domestic and foreign investors, says Bertus Meins,
the Inter-American Development Bank's regional economic adviser for
Mexico and Central America. Latin America is unable to
realistically impose controls because the region has ``become more
and more a part of the world's trading environment,'' he says.
 &HT;    Moreover, the region cannot afford to put obstacles in the path
of capital flows. According to the Institute of International
Finance, a research group based in Washington, D.C., net capital
flows to Latin America will fall by roughly a third to just under
$70 billion in 1999. The group expects private creditors, such as
banks and other financial institutions, to pull back in a big way
to reduce exposure, slowing lending down from to an estimated $42
billion in 1998 to little more than $10 billion this year.
 &HT;    To turn the tide, Latin American governments will have to woo
investors back with privatizations, independent central banks, and
reductions in budget and trade deficits to a point where they can
be financed domestically, says Thomas Trebat, managing director of
emerging markets at U.S. investment bank Salomon Smith Barney. He
says that the cycle ``begins with Latin American governments taking
measures to please domestic investors.'' He adds, ``You need
capital from abroad, but if we see Brazilians moving money out of
the country, not buying stocks and not rolling over government
bonds, why should foreigners not do the same?''
 &HT;    Foreigners, especially the so-called ``hot money'' managers who
deal in assets like stocks that are easily sold, may be just doing
the same as the locals, but their actions tend to do more damage
and receive more attention.
 &HT;    Chilean controls. The IDB's Meins and numerous other analysts in
the United States and throughout Latin America feel that some
countries could lessen the boom-bust cycle by setting reserve
requirements on inflows.
 &HT;    The most cited example is Chile, which in 1991 began requiring
foreign investors to put $20 in a one-year, non-interest bearing
account with the Central Bank for each $100 invested in Chilean
stocks and bonds. Investors who sold securities in less than a year
would receive their gains but would forfeit the funds in the
account. For most of the 1990s, capital flowed into the country
without huge, abrupt ebbs.
 &HT;    The lack of major bouts of capital flight, however, may have
more to do with Chile's strong and orderly economic performance
than the reserve requirements on inflows. When the economy stalled
last year, some $975 million fled the country through the first 10
months of 1998, according to Chile's Central Bank.
 &HT;    Foreign investors leaving the country accounted for about 95
percent of the capital flight, says Valentin Carril, Santander
Investment's chief economist in Santiago. In September, the
government finally scrapped the reserve requirement for foreign
investment. While Carril believes that the requirements did help to
prevent large swells in capital flows to some degree, he notes that
even well-run Chile cannot afford to put any obstacles in the way
of investment. ``There has been a need to attract capital,'' Carril
says.
 &HT;    For countries, like Brazil, where authorities are still
struggling to get the basic macroeconomic indicators under control,
instituting any sort of restrictions on foreign currency
transactions would probably be as effective as trying to put out a
fire with gasoline. As ably demonstrated by Brazil's President
Cardoso in recent months, when policymakers try to control capital
flows or exchange rates, they usually get burned.

 Por DEREK REVERON 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Durante muchos anos, las regulaciones gubernamentales y la falta
de tecnologia limitaron a los televidentes latinoamericanos del
cable a sus programas locales y a retransmisiones de viejos
programas norteamericanos. Pero ahora, un creciente grupo de
cadenas de television por cable con sede en Miami transforma la
television latinoamericana al ofrecer un gran volumen y variedad de
programas a la region.
 &HT;    En los seis ultimos anos, mas de 30 cadenas han iniciado desde
Miami sus operaciones latinoamericanas. Buscan una participacion en
este nuevo y prometedor mercado, para lo cual han decidido producir
programas que reflejen las culturas y los gustos de America Latina.
 &HT;    La TV por cable llega a unos 15 millones de los mas de 150
millones de nucleos familiares latinoamericanos. Sin embargo, el
sector crece a un ritmo del 20 por ciento anual, y los expertos
pronostican que unos 20 millones de nucleos familiares tendran
cable en el 2000. Actualmente, Mexico y Argentina son los mayores
mercados de la region, pero Brasil se acerca a toda velocidad.
 &HT;    En los ultimos anos, Brasil ha aprobado leyes para permitir la
expansion de su sistema de cable y las firmas estadounidenses del
sector envian cada vez mas programas a ese pais. ``Tarde o
temprano, Brasil se convertira en el mayor mercado de TV por cable
en America Latina, si la economia se mantiene y no hay mayores
contratiempos,'' dice Luis Peraza, vicepresidente de programacion y
produccion de Cisneros Television Group, de Estados Unidos. CTG,
que tiene una presencia importante en America Latina, es una filial
del Grupo Cisneros, de Venezuela.
 &HT;    Las companias de cable se instalan en Miami debido a su cercania
a Latinoamerica y a la gran cantidad de profesionales que hablan
espanol. Lo que es mas importante, la ciudad tiene una notable
infraestructura de cable dirigida a Latinoamerica. Hay agencias de
actores, instalaciones de produccion, compradores de medios y
companias de difusion con grandes negocios.
 &HT;    A principios de los anos 90, el sector latinoamericano del cable
era practicamente inexistente. Ahora las empresas del sector con
operaciones en Miami representan mas de US$600 millones en ingresos
anuales, segun funcionarios del condado Miami-Dade. GlobeCast North
America, proveedor de servicios de satelite, es un ejemplo de ese
crecimiento. En 1997, la compania distribuyo 17 redes de cable a
Latinoamerica. Para fines de 1998, casi habia duplicado su base de
clientes. La empresa, filial del gigante France Telecom, invertira
US$18 millones en los proximos tres anos para ampliar sus
operaciones y recientemente compro un edificio de casi 8.000 metros
cuadrados que aumentara sus operaciones en mas del doble.
 &HT;    La norteamericana TransAmerica Media Group, un grupo de compra
de medios en espanol, afirma que sus ingresos de la publicidad
latinoamericana se duplican anualmente gracias en parte al auge del
sector del cable en la region. ''[Miami es el Hong Kong del sector
latinoamericano del cable,'' dice Jose del Cueto, director
ejecutivo de TransAmerica. ``Es donde se hacen los convenios. Los
operadores de cable y los proveedores de senales estan aqui, y
cientos de companias con posibles anunciantes estan aqui``.
 &HT;    Abundancia de programas. Las estaciones norteamericanas de cable
apenas han comenzado su mision de llenar la television
latinoamericana con la variedad de programas que hay en Estados
Unidos. ``Ahora hay mas mercadeo especifico y seleccion de
segmentos de audiencia [en America Latina,'' comenta Robert Behar,
director ejecutivo de GlobeCast North America. ``Hay canales
especializados, canales musicales, canales deportivos, canales de
carreras de autos, canales de peliculas, documentales, viajes y
noticias. Esta evolucionando casi igual que el mercado
norteamericano..'
 &HT;    Las companias de cable esperan atraer televidentes subrayando la
sensibilidad cultural. Los ejecutivos norteamericanos del cable
dicen que el clamor en America Latina por mas programas refleja su
realidad. ``En Mexico, los operadores y distribuidores del cable
dicen que no transmitimos suficientes productos mexicanos. En
Argentina y Chile dicen lo mismo,'' senala Yolanda Ramirez Foster,
vicepresidenta de programacion en Gems International Television.
 &HT;    Gems, que se dirige a las mujeres latinoamericanas, aumenta este
ano su programacion original en un 10 por ciento. Consulte a su
doctor, un nuevo programa de medicina en el que el publico puede
hacer llamadas, presentara a profesionales de la salud de distintas
partes de America Latina.
 &HT;    Con el respaldo del caudal de su compania matriz, CTG planea
incrementar su numero de canales de cable latinoamericanos de ocho
a 11 el ano proximo. La empresa produce alrededor del 5 por ciento
de sus programas pero proyecta aumentar notablemente esa cifra. CTG
produce novelas, comedias y dramas originales, y la mayor parte de
ellos los producira en Miami. La compania tambien planea crear
programas originales para su Canal Latinoamericano de Playboy, con
talentos de la region.
 &HT;    Discovery Networks Latin America/Iberia dice que en 1999
producira mas que nunca antes programas originales, que ahora
representan una decima parte. La empresa norteamericana producira
sus primeros documentales de una hora dirigidos especificamente a
America Latina. Varios programas exploraran el periodo de la
ocupacion francesa en Mexico, senalaran el quinto centenario del
descubrimiento de Brasil y observaran como los latinoamericanos se
enfrentan al problema de los sistemas informaticos en el ano 2000.
Otros programas trataran sobre la arquitectura latinoamericana,
casas famosas y sus ocupantes pasados y presentes. Otras cadenas
siguen la pauta. Entre las companias de cable que apuntan a la
region estan MTV, Sony TV, HBO, Nickelodeon, USA Network, The
Weather Channel, The Travel Channel y las redes de compras HTV y
QVC.
 &HT;    Limites locales. La cantidad de programas originales con un
enfoque local que los operadores de cable pueden hacer tiene un
limite, debido a los altos costos de produccion y transmision. Por
eso las companias buscan un equilibrio entre apuntar a
Latinoamerica en su conjunto y apuntar a paises especificos, sobre
todo a los grandes mercados del cable que son Argentina y Mexico.
GEMS, por ejemplo, tiene cuatro fuentes: Argentina, Mexico, el
resto de America Latina y Estados Unidos. La estacion planea lanzar
este ano una senal en portugues para Brasil. Todos los dias, cada
region recibe los mismos bloques de programas, pero GEMS varia el
contenido dentro de cada bloque diario. Menu del Dia, un programa
de cocina, puede presentar recetas argentinas un dia y colombianas
el siguiente. Consulte a su doctor puede tener un pediatra peruano
hoy y un ginecologo mexicano manana. Perspectivas, un programa de
entrevistas producido en Los Angeles, presenta a diario una
variedad regional ya que sus tres anfitriones son de Argentina,
Mexico y Espana. ``Buscamos dar un aire internacional a nuestros
programas,'' dice Foster. ``Preferimos ese enfoque a tener 30
fuentes para complacer a todo el mundo en America Latina. Nos
concentramos en las cosas que las mujeres tienen en comun, como las
modas, el arreglo del hogar y otras cuestiones de importancia como
la salud..'
 &HT;    Los canales de cable con contenido historico y cultural quiza
sean los mas interesados en producir programas que reflejen a
Latinoamerica. ``Hacemos un gran esfuerzo por tener en cuenta la
sensibilidad de nuestras audiencias,'' afirma Rick Rodriguez,
vicepresidente de programacion de Discovery Networks Latin
America/Iberia. ``El espanol neutral no funciona en estos
programas..' Cuando Discovery transmitio en vivo la exploracion de
los restos del Titanic, se utilizo a interpretes de espanol y
portugues para traducir al presentador angloparlante. Pero en las
retransmisiones del especial, Discovery hizo mas traducciones
adaptadas a giros regionales de America Latina.
 &HT;    Ciertos programas basados en un aspecto de una cultura
latinoamericana especifica tienen un atractivo continental. Un
ejemplo es la version de CTG de la serie de dibujos animados Dr.
Katz, del canal Comedy Central. El programa se transmite en la
cadena Locomotion de CTG, un canal de dibujos animados que
transmite las 24 horas y que llega a mas de dos millones de hogares
en America Latina, Espana y Portugal.
 &HT;    En la version en ingles, Dr. Katz es un siquiatra neoyorquino
que atiende a pacientes norteamericanos famosos. En CTG, es un
siquiatra argentino que atiende a celebridades latinoamericanas,
entre ellas una Miss Universo venezolana. El Dr. Katz de CTG da una
vision humoristica de la opinion generalizada en America Latina
sobre la fascinacion de los argentinos con la sicoterapia, explica
Peraza, de CTG.
 &HT;    El enfoque etnico no siempre funciona. Con South Park, una
satira de la vida de los ninos en las Montanas Rocosas, CTG uso
primero expresiones mexicanas. Mas tarde los ejecutivos decidieron
que ese experimento no permitia que el sarcasmo del programa
tuviera un gran atractivo en toda Latinoamerica. Al final CTG opto
por un acento neutral en espanol, mas apropiado para que los
latinoamericanos vieran el programa como una peculiar satira
norteamericana de los problemas de la infancia.
 &HT;    Los proveedores de programas piensan que los programas dirigidos
a culturas especificas atraeran a mas suscriptores, pero no estan
muy seguros. Latinoamerica tiene un sistema estandar para medir la
sintonia de la TV pagada, pero las audiencias medidas son tan
pequenas que es dificil juzgar el verdadero impacto de los
programas.
 &HT;    ``Todavia no hemos visto una correlacion en ese campo, pero esos
indices son tan inmaduros en este mercado que no ofrecen mucha
informacion,'' senala Rodriguez. ``Sin embargo, sobre la base de lo
que vemos en cobertura de prensa, publicidad adicional y respuestas
a estos programas, podemos decir que captan el interes del
televidente.''

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ Imaginense al presidente de Brasil, Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, amontonando dolares en el jardin del palacio presidencial.
Cuando termina de colocar los billetes, rocia la montana con
gasolina y le prende fuego. En la pira ardieron unos US$35.000
millones. Esto es una simplificacion exagerada de la batalla que
libro Brasil en 1998 para evitar una devaluacion del real, pero a
mediados de enero Cardoso ya habia gastado gran parte de las
reservas de divisas en mantener una politica cambiaria que el
mercado se negaba a aceptar.
 &HT;    Muchos expertos dicen que la decision fue un error y senalan que
la clave de poder controlar nuevas devaluaciones violentas es
establecer politicas economicas correctas, como tasas cambiarias
realistas. Pero sobre todo, agregan, los gobiernos deben evitar la
tentacion de controlar el flujo de capital restringiendo las
transacciones en divisas.
 &HT;    Corriente regional. Esas medidas no controlan la salida del
capital y pueden asustar a los inversionistas, dice Bertus Meins,
asesor del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo para Mexico y
Centroamerica. Latinoamerica no puede imponer controles de manera
realista porque ``se ha convertido cada vez mas en parte del mundo
comercial,'' explica.
 &HT;    Lo que es mas, la region no puede darse el lujo de obstaculizar
el paso al flujo de capital. Segun el Institute of International
Finance, un grupo de investigaciones de Washington, el flujo neto
de capital hacia America Latina bajara en 1999 en una tercera
parte, a un poco menos de US$70.000 millones. El grupo espera que
los bancos y otras instituciones financieras reduzcan su
exposicion, lo que haria disminuir los prestamos de unos US$42.000
millones en 1998 a unos US$10.000 millones este ano.
 &HT;    Para hacer frente a la situacion, los gobiernos latinoamericanos
tendran que atraer nuevamente a los inversionistas con
privatizaciones, bancos centrales independientes y reducciones del
deficit fiscal y la balanza comercial hasta un nivel que puedan
financiarse a nivel nacional, afirma Thomas Trebat, director
gerente de mercados emergentes en el banco estadounidense de
inversion Salomon Smith Barney. Trebat agrega que el ciclo
``comienza cuando los gobiernos de America Latina empiecen a tomar
medidas para satisfacer a los inversionistas nacionales. Hace falta
capital foraneo, pero... si vemos que los brasilenos sacan su
dinero del pais, y no compran acciones ni bonos del gobierno, por
que entonces se debe esperar que los extranjeros no hagan lo
mismo?''
 &HT;    Los extranjeros, especialmente los gerentes del llamado 'dinero
caliente', que manejan activos como acciones, pudieran estar
haciendo lo mismo que los nacionales, pero sus acciones tienden a
provocar mas dano y a recibir una mayor atencion.
 &HT;    El control chileno. Meins y otros analistas en Estados Unidos y
toda America Latina opinan que algunos paises pudieran atenuar las
consecuencias del ciclo de auge y depresion al exigir cierto nivel
de reserva sobre el capital que entra al pais.
 &HT;    El ejemplo mas citado es Chile, que en 1991 comenzo a exigir a
los inversionistas extranjeros que depositaran en el Banco Central
US$20 en una cuenta a un ano que no genera intereses por cada
US$100 que invirtieran en bonos y acciones chilenos. Los
inversionistas extranjeros que vendian valores antes de cumplirse
un ano recibirian las ganancias pero perderian los fondos
depositados en la cuenta de reserva. En la mayor parte de la decada
de los 90, el capital entro en el pais sin irrupciones enormes y
abruptas.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, que no haya habido una gran fuga de capital tal vez
se deba mas al vigoroso y ordenado desempeno economico de Chile que
a los requisitos de reserva. Cuando la economia se estanco el ano
pasado, unos US$975 millones salieron del pais en los primeros diez
meses de 1998, segun el Banco Central.
 &HT;    Los inversionistas extranjeros fueron causantes del 95 por
ciento de la fuga de capitales, afirma Valentin Carril, jefe de
economistas de Santander Investment en Santiago de Chile. En
septiembre de 1998, el gobierno por fin anulo el requisito de
reserva a la inversion foranea con el objetivo de detener la
sangria. Aunque Carril opina que la exigencia si ayudo a prevenir
grandes fugas, afirma que incluso economias tan bien aceitadas como
la de Chile no pueden obstaculizar las inversiones. ``Ha habido
necesidad de atraer capital,'' dice Carril.
 &HT;    Pero en el caso de los paises, como Brasil, donde las
autoridades todavia batallan por controlar los indicadores
macroeconomicos basicos, instituir cualquier tipo de restriccion a
las transacciones en divisas probablemente seria tan efectivo como
tratar de apagar un incendio rociandole gasolina. Como demostro el
presidente Cardoso en meses recientes, cuando los politicos tratan
de controlar el flujo de capital o las tasas de cambio, por lo
general se equivocan.

   INGLEWOOD _ Sixty-one wins and the wrong end of a playoffs sweep
wasn't good enough for the Lakers, so they traded their starting
point guard and hired a veteran replacement. That wasn't enough, so
they hired the best rebounder in the NBA and fired their coach.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't enough either, nor was a nine-game winning streak,
so on Thursday, the Lakers introduced the next (and final?) piece
of their drive for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all the pieces to the puzzle, we just have to go out
and do it,'' said new Laker and puzzle solver Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-changing face of the Lakers morphed once more with the
swap of All-Star Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell to Charlotte for
sharpshooter Rice and J.R. Reid.
</P>
<P>
   It was, even in the words of Lakers executive vice president
Jerry West, a risk.
</P>
<P>
   Starting tonight, the Lakers will see what that gamble nets
them. They have exchanged Jones' defense and transition-game
fireworks for Rice's dead-on 3-point shooting, instantly improving
their half-court game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to bring us a dimension that we feel we have not
had here in a long, long time, maybe since Byron Scott,'' West
said.
</P>
<P>
   And although this was not a trade players enthusiastically
embraced when it was announced 24 hours earlier, still stung by the
loss of Jones, the Lakers are hopeful Rice will open up the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought (O'Neal) was definitely one of the big
guys in the league that is pretty much impossible to stop,'' Rice
said, ``and teams have been double-teaming. Now I don't think
they're gonna want to do that as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kobe Bryant, a slasher who should also benefit from Rice's
presence, ``what that does is it makes us even more dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   For O'Neal, it's another wish come true. He demanded a
``thuggish rebounder'' and got Dennis Rodman. He ached for a
3-point shooter to draw away the extra defenders, and now he has
Rice.
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't already true, anything short of a championship now
will certainly be deemed a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ain't no excuses now,'' O'Neal said. ``Now we should
really push to go all the way. We've got a lot of veterans here, so
everybody's hungry. We have a lot of great players, a lot of great
talent, we've got some deadly shooters. There should be no excuse
now.''
</P>
<P>
   And no competition for the ball, vowed Rice, Bryant and O'Neal,
the three top offensive threats. O'Neal said he'll gladly give up
shots, Bryant said he's not worried and Rice said he's fine
dropping from the first to third option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very comfortable with that,'' Rice said. ``I'm comfortable
with the thought of my chances of getting a ring as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte came calling with this trade weeks ago, but the Lakers
did not immediately jump on it, despite Rice's status as one of the
league's top shooters. And with the optimism surrounding his
arrival, there remain legitimate concerns over what they gave up in
continuity, chemistry and Jones' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I wouldn't say (all the changes are) necessary
because we got to the Western Conference finals, but to get over
the hump, to be a championship team I guess they felt we needed to
make the changes,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   So a different team, yes. And improved one?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be debated, for the rest of the season,'' said
Rick Fox. ``We won't drop off, if anything. Whether we are better
remains to be seen.''

RICE WON'T HAVE TO ELBOW FOR TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Glen Rice practiced with his new teammates for the
first time Thursday, and there was only one word to describe the
hailstorm of 3-pointers he poured through the Forum nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pure,'' Derek Harper said. ``He looked like a pure shooter. He
can shoot the ball, man. You enjoy watching a guy like that shoot.
I like to think I'm a pretty good shooter, but I'm a poor man's
version of Glen Rice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice will be in uniform tonight and playing significant minutes,
though not necessarily starting yet. He hasn't played since last
season, but Rice said he's kept in shape by running, and his elbow
is 100 percent healed after undergoing arthroscopic surgery in late
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked very good,'' coach Kurt Rambis said. ``I don't think
he's in game shape, but with the time he's gonna be getting, he
soon will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Here to stay: Rice was only the latest star to leave Charlotte
over money, the Hornets unwilling to pay him the $10-$14 million he
wants in a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice and Lakers executive vice president Jerry West both
said the plan was for Rice to retire a Laker.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers will pay him their share of a prorated $5.4 million
this season and have a $7 million option for 1999-2000, but figure
to give him a contract extension this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Laker, and I would like to hang my shoes up here,'' the
31-year-old Rice said. ``This is a great organization, and I would
love to be a part of that until it's time to call it quits. And
hopefully get a couple rings in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice admitted he initially wanted a trade to Miami, his original
team, or Orlando, in order to remain close to his wife, newborn
daughter and extended family. But he dropped his opposition to
playing in California in exchange for the shot at a title, then got
extra encouragement when Shaquille O'Neal called a couple weeks
back and lobbied for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``(That) made me feel more comfortable,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Missing: Robert Horry didn't make it to Thursday's practice in
order to fly home to Houston and attend to undisclosed personal
matters. He is expected back in time for tonight's home game
against Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had permission from me,'' Rambis said. ``He told me he had
some stuff he needed to do. I believe in that, if a player's got a
lot of business to take care of and family matters to take care of,
if they can go see their family, I think that helps free up a
player's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Reid, traded with Rice, missed his morning flight and did
not make practice. He was expected in town by late afternoon and
will be in uniform tonight.

SCANDAL HITS MINNESOTA AND GONZAGA PROVIDES THE KNOCKOUT PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KEN GURNICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Minnesota's 75-63 loss to Gonzaga officially occurred
mid-afternoon Thursday here, but the fate of the Golden Golphers
might have been determined several hours earlier when the school's
basketball program imploded because of an academic scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Back east in Minneapolis five hours before game time, four
Golden Gophers players _ starters Kevin Clark and Miles Tarver and
reserves Antoine Broxsie and Jason Stanford _ were declared
ineligible by the university president, Mark Yudof, in response to
academic misconduct allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published in Wednesday's editions of The Saint
Paul Pioneer Press, a former university employee said that she had
written papers for past and current athletes, with four former
players confirming her story.
</P>
<P>
   Tenth-seeded Gonzaga, the West Coast Conference champion from
Spokane, can now celebrate its first tournament victory and prepare
for second-seeded Stanford, which struggled before pulling away
from Alcorn State, 69-57. Minnesota and its coach, Clem Haskins,
now go home to face the investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``You prepare all week and all of a sudden they slap you in the
face and you can't play your starters,'' Haskins said after the
loss. ``To me, life goes on. You make adjustments. Our team played
hard and I'm proud of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss concluded a trying 48 hours for Minnesota. Clark, a
senior guard and the team's No. 2 scorer at 14.7 points a game,
suffered a seizure on the flight to Seattle on Tuesday. On
Wednesday, the day the allegations were published, Kyle Sanden
sprained his ankle in practice. By the time the game started,
Minnesota was down to eight players.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the bench in warm-ups were Clark, Tarver, a senior
forward who led the team in rebounding at 7.1 per game; Broxsie, a
sophomore center who had played in all 27 games this season, and
Stanford, a senior reserve forward. By game's end, two more
Minnesota players had fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with Minnesota's Quincy Lewis, the Big Ten scoring champion,
swarmed by Gonzaga's defense, a redshirt walk-on freshman helped
put the Golden Gophers back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Rychart, who averaged only eight minutes a game during the
season, finished with a team-high 23 points as Minnesota cut the
lead to 2 points with 1 minute 43 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The players were ruled ineligible Thursday following an
investigation by the university's general counsel and its NCAA
compliance officer.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's article in The Pioneer Press quoted a former office
manager, Jan Gangelhoff, as saying she wrote papers, did take-home
exams and other course work for the four current players and at
least 16 former players. The newspaper also quoted four former
players as confirming that work was prepared for them in possible
violation of the student code of conduct and NCAA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   STANFORD 69, ALCORN STATE 57
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded Stanford withstood a furious second-half rally by
undersized but persistent Alcorn State. Forward Mark Madsen led the
Cardinal with 23 points and 13 rebounds, 16 of the points in the
first half when the Cardinal appeared headed for an expected rout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA 75, PENN 61
</P>
<P>
   Florida, seeded sixth in the regional, methodically erased a
13-point deficit and pulled away to defeat the Ivy League champion.
The youthful Gators utilized a balanced scoring attack, led by the
freshman forward Mike Miller's 15 points. Freshman guard Teddy
Dupay had 13 and the junior guard Kenyan Weaks had 11. &QL;

M.R. SHUGRUE, WHO TRIED TO SAVE AIRLINES, DIES AT 58  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin R. Shugrue Jr., an airline executive who played a pivotal
and at times controversial role in unsuccessful attempts to keep
Pan American World Airways and, later, Eastern Airlines from
failing, died on Sunday. He was 58 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Shugrue died at his home in Houston of a stroke, a spokesman for
the family said.
</P>
<P>
   A gregarious executive who had a knack for getting along with
union leaders and the rank and file, Shugrue was appointed trustee
of the troubled Eastern Airlines in April 1990 by Judge Burton R.
Lifland. The step was front-page news because Judge Lifland took
control of the airline away from its chairman, Frank Lorenzo, who
had tried to get the company out of bankruptcy but had racked up
losses of $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The losses and Lorenzo's confrontational style with the unions
cost Eastern the support of creditors, but the judge was determined
to revive the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Shugrue, whom Lorenzo had discharged from his post as president
of Continental Airlines, relished the chance he was given. With a
big ego and a flair for dramatic moves, Shugrue followed the
example of Lee A. Iacocca, who had used a splashy television
campaign as part of his strategy for turning Chrysler around in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   That June, Shugrue, nervous, clutching two packs of Camels, shot
a series of television commercials in which skeptical business
travelers asked him why they should fly Eastern when continuing
labor strife and huge losses made them unsure of its safety.
Shugrue bravely asserted that despite three years of labor and
financial turmoil the airline had not had one serious incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one,'' the trim former Navy aircraft carrier pilot said
firmly.
</P>
<P>
   For a time the national campaign increased bookings and
persuaded some business travelers to give the airline another
chance, particularly since they could get a first-class seat by
paying full coach fare. But the airline could not stem its losses,
and some unions continued to question its safety and maintenance
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Then the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990 sent jet fuel
prices soaring, and the losses deepened. Still, Shugrue had the
support of Lifland, who continued to release tens of millions of
dollars from an escrow fund to keep the airline flying. Shugrue
even persuaded the court to increase his salary from $425,000 a
year to $600,000, arguing that his pay should be more in line with
executives of other major airlines _ a move for which he was widely
criticized.
</P>
<P>
   By January 1991, even Lifland acknowledged that there was no
hope for the carrier. Shugrue began to sell off its assets.
</P>
<P>
   Even after liquidating Eastern, Shugrue could not give up his
dream of building an airline. He put up some of his own money and
with other investors raised more than $40 million to restart Pan
Am, which he had tried to turn around in the 1980s before it was
liquidated. The revived Pan Am flew two of the most heavily
traveled and competitive routes in the nation _ New York-Los
Angeles and New York-Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Shugrue's plan was to rely on the Pan Am name and to offer
quality service at lower fares. The carrier attracted passengers,
and at first its stock price soared. The fares were too low to make
a profit, however, and Pan Am filed for bankruptcy in February
1998. The airline continues to operate as a charter.
</P>
<P>
   Shugrue was born in Providence, R.I., and graduated from
Providence College. After serving in the Navy as a pilot, he joined
Pan American World Airways in 1968 and rose through the ranks. But
the airline itself was losing money.
</P>
<P>
   When Edward Acker was brought in in 1981 to help revive Pan Am,
he hired outside executives but kept Shugrue, who was made vice
chairman in 1984 and chief operating officer in 1985. The two had a
falling-out late in 1987, however, when Acker tried to sell the
airline. Shugrue opposed him and tried to keep it independent,
winning further concessions from the unions. The board asked both
executives to resign in January 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Shugrue is survived by his wife, Marianne, and their two
children, Marika and Martine, of Houston, and by two children,
Catherine, of Brooklyn, and Michael, of Roselle Park, N.J., from
his marriage to Eleanor Dalton, who is deceased. He is also
survived by his father, Martin R. Shugrue of Providence, three
sisters and two brothers.

HARRY FORD, BOOK DESIGNER AND POETRY EDITOR, DIES AT 80  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harry Ford, whose unerring ear and impeccable taste
made him one of the nation's leading poetry editors, died on Friday
at his home in Manhattan. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said the cause was apparently a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation in which poetry is more revered than read, Ford was
a splendid anomaly, a man who not only read poetry with
discriminating delight but could reliably pick out the gold from
the dross in a pile of manuscripts. Since 1987 he had been the
senior poetry editor at Alfred A. Knopf, a company he had joined in
1947.
</P>
<P>
   It is a reflection of his taste that in a career that included a
28-year stint at Atheneum, he edited poets like Wallace Stevens,
Langston Hughes, Richard Wilbur, Howard Moss, W.S. Merwin, James
Merrill, Mark Strand, Anthony Hecht, and more recently, Mary
Kinzie, George Bradley, Jill Bialosky and Edgar Bowers.
</P>
<P>
   If those are not all household names, it is at least partly
because poetry is not high on the reading list in the average
American household.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been a recent upsurge in poetry's popularity,
it is an index of its continued lowly standing that at Knopf, whose
active roster of some 40 poets makes it perhaps the leading trade
book publisher of poetry, only seven of some 200 books on its
current list are new books of poetry. Nobody knew better than Ford
why poetry had such a paltry showing on commercial lists. As he put
it in 1993, ``it is a money-losing proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford, a native of Philadelphia, apparently developed
such an early passion for literature that he dropped out of
Columbia after concluding that the college's literary standards did
not measure up to his own, he seems to have gravitated to poetry
almost by accident.
</P>
<P>
   After working at a series of bookstores he got a job in 1945
with the old publishing house of Reynal &AMP; Hitchcock, where a
legendary editor, Albert Erskine, guided him into poetry, though
not at the expense of his main duties in production and design.
</P>
<P>
   Ford had such an artistic flair for designing books and their
eye-catching jackets that it long remained his major specialty in
publishing, one that won him considerable acclaim in the industry
even as he was developing his reputation as a poetry editor.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined Knopf in 1947 it was as assistant production
manager and design director. His work with poets was a sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he left Knopf in 1959 to join the new publishing house
of Atheneum created by Alfred Knopf Jr., he started out as
production design director and only gradually took over and built
what became such an impressive list of poets that when he rejoined
Knopf in 1987 (after Macmillan had bought Atheneum and shown
disinterest in poetry) he brought along so many established poets
that Knopf turned out 13 of their books in his first year.
</P>
<P>
   A man who loved poetry so much that he assembled a vast library
of fine volumes, Ford had other interests as well. Friends who went
out to eat with him knew that he would select the best restaurant,
order the perfect dish and accompany it with the finest of wines.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because poetry is such a perennial stepchild of
publishing, Ford's devotion to poetry and his loyalty to poets
helped make him a beloved figure. In 1991, after Joseph Brodsky,
the Russian-born poet who became an American citizen in 1977, was
named the fifth Poet Laureate of the United States, succeeding Mark
Strand, a member of Ford's stable, Ford called it ``a slap in the
face to an awful lot of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who could be equally blunt in telling poets why he was
rejecting their latest submission, seems not to have offended many
of them, and poets were forever dedicating their works to him. In
1986 he received the PEN American Center's Eighth Biennial
Publisher Citation, and the next year the Academy of American Poets
sponsored a reading in his honor. In 1992, when the National Poetry
Series created an Editor's Award, Ford was the first recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, whose wife, Kathleen, died last year, leaves no immediate
survivors.

SHARES OF NISSAN PLUNGE AND ITS CREDIT RATING FOLLOWS SUIT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Shares of Nissan plunged Thursday and the automaker's
credit rating fell after the collapse on Wednesday of its merger
talks with DaimlerChrysler AG. The failure of the negotiations
signaled serious problems not only for Nissan but also for many
other automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the Nissan Motor Co. fell 11 percent in Tokyo
Thursday, while shares of its truck-building unit, Nissan Diesel,
dropped 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service downgraded Nissan's credit rating
Thursday to junk-bond quality while Standard &AMP; Poor's, another
rating agency, said it was prepared to lower Nissan's rating to
junk-bond status, too, but would wait for the outcome of Nissan's
efforts to raise money by selling a stake to Renault of France.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Nissan's merger talks with DaimlerChrysler
underlined how difficult it was to achieve real consolidation in
the global automotive industry and made it likely that the industry
would continue to be plagued by excess factory capacity for years
to come.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said Thursday that a key sticking
point was Nissan's reluctance to give full management control to
DaimlerChrysler, which might have allowed it to close excess
factories in Japan, lay off workers and drastically cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   The big mergers that have taken place over the last year _
Daimler-Benz AG's takeover of the Chrysler Corp. and the Ford Motor
Co.'s pending purchase of the car operations of Volvo AB _ have
combined successful automakers that did not need to close any
assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   But these transactions did nothing to address the auto
industry's biggest problem: the world's consumers buy only 50
million cars and light trucks a year, yet there are enough assembly
plants worldwide to build 75 million vehicles a year. And new
factories are opening practically every month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deals that have occurred so far are really to grow the
business and not to pare the business,'' said Michael E. Robinet,
the director of forecast services at CSM Worldwide Inc., an auto
consulting firm in Farmington Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Without commenting on the details of DaimlerChrysler's aborted
plans for Nissan, Juergen E. Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's
co-chairman, hinted in an interview Thursday that the resistance of
Nissan's managers to losing control had been an issue.
DaimlerChrysler had been reluctant to accept a compromise that
would have given it only 25 percent of Nissan now and deferred any
DaimlerChrysler control of the company until later, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schrempp also said that DaimlerChrysler had become concerned
about the difficulties of embarking on another big merger so soon
after last November's combination of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler.
``We would have been overstretched,'' Schrempp said.

<P>
   International auto industry mergers face huge political and
cultural obstacles because automakers tend to be symbols of
national strength. The political obstacles can become
insurmountable when, as in the case of DaimlerChrysler and Nissan,
the merger is likely to entail closing factories and dismissing
thousands of workers.
</P>
<P>
   While Nissan has also been in talks with Renault, those talks
have reportedly involved a smaller equity stake in Nissan and
relatively little loss of control for its Japanese managers.
</P>
<P>
   Even when weak automakers are bought, few factories are closed.
Korea's Kia Motors was auctioned last year after its excessive
expansion and factory construction left it insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   But while Ford bid for Kia and would have been likely to cut its
costs somewhat, the winning bidder was Hyundai, another Korean
automaker that has emphasized rapid growth, sometimes ahead of
profits.
</P>
<P>
   European automakers are not immune. BMW of Germany is struggling
because it did little to cut costs in Britain's struggling Rover
unit after taking it over in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a merger with DaimlerChrysler increases the pressure
on Nissan to undertake a more ambitious cost-cutting program than
anything it has tried so far. Nissan said in a statement Thursday
that it was ``taking additional measures such as reviewing and
cutting domestic production capacity'' in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some auto analysts think that DaimlerChrysler would also have
found it hard to reduce Nissan's costs. ``You can't rule out the
possibility that if less equity is given to Nissan, they'll have to
close capacity quicker because they'll have more financial
distress,'' said Scott F. Merlis, an auto analyst at Wasserstein
Perella Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's distress could become worse in the coming months. David
S. Andrews, a senior vice president for corporate finance at
Moody's, said that Nissan's debt might be downgraded even further
if it did not reach an alliance with Renault.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Nissan said the downgrading would not pose a
problem because the company had increased its cash on hand and had
set up lines of credit, including a $700 million line extended by
the Japanese government, which is worried about the problems at one
of Japan's biggest employers. The company criticized Moody's
decision, saying that it would have no problem financing its
activities even in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrews said that competition was so tough in the auto
industry that it would be hard for an already weakened automaker
like Nissan to improve its profitability.
</P>
<P>
   The world has too many factories making small and midsized cars,
and Nissan and Renault mainly compete in these overcrowded and
usually unprofitable segments. Nissan has been weak in the world's
two strongest auto market segments _ sport utility vehicles in the
United States and luxury cars worldwide _ while Renault does not do
business in the United States and is only just now entering the
luxury market.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly because of the strength of sport utility vehicle and
pickup truck sales here, Ford and DaimlerChrysler separately raised
their forecasts Thursday for total car and light truck sales in the
United States this year, predicting that this would be one of the
strongest years ever. DaimlerChrysler's profitable Jeeps and
Mercedes cars would have made it a financially stronger potential
partner for Nissan than Renault.

CLIPPERS FAIL TO MAKE DEAL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NBA's trading deadline rolled past Thursday,
and the Clippers avoided driving away with a lemon off the NBA's
used player lot.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not like that 0-17 start failed to remind them that a
change or two wouldn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   One league source said the Clippers attempted to close a deal
that would have sent Lorenzen Wright and Pooh Richardson to
Portland in exchange for deluxe shooting guard Isiah Rider. The
Blazers, looking for inside depth from Wrigh, have Jim Jackson
playing behind Rider. But Rider stopped being trade bait when his
inspired play helped Portland rise to the top of the Pacific
Division. The Blazers changed their minds about that deal 10 days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another near-miss trade would have delivered power forward Chris
Gatling and salary-cap throw in Brian Evans from New Jersey. But
that pair joined Sam Cassell in a three-way deal that sent them to
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The next deadline arrives Saturday, when teams either must have
offered contract extensions to their own players or wait until July
1 to tender an offer. (Or not make an offer.) Clippers currently
cashing paychecks in the final year of their contracts include
Wright, Lamond Murray, Rodney Rogers, Eric Piatkowski, Stojko
Vrankovic, Darrick Martin, Sherman Douglas and rookie free agent
Tyrone Nesby.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers are not expected to offer any extensions this week.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead `Mo' money
</P>
<P>
   One Clipper who will have a year remaining on his current deal
when this season ends is second-year forward Maurice Taylor.
Taylor, who has played his way up to the status of
star-on-training-wheels, hasn't ruled out re-signing with the
Clippers when they make their re-enlistment pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not exactly a lock to stay put, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be against that,'' said Taylor when presented with
the hypothetical prospect of signing a six-year deal for maximum
loot. ``A lot depends on what other changes are made between now
and then. I'm still going to keep my options open, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was referring to roster adjustments that could make
winning a bit easier than it is now. At their current rate, the
Clippers should have a lovely shot at the first pick in this year's
draft. And while underclassmen aren't eligible for selection until
they declare themselves available by sending a letter to the
league, Taylor's vote goes to Rhode Island freshman Lamar Odom.
</P>
<P>
   Odom is a 6-foot-10 playmaking southpaw best classified as a
``point forward.'' According to scuttlebutt around the league, Odom
is expected to enter the draft, despite recent reports that he
hasn't completely ruled out staying at Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clippers' personnel team continues to evaluate
potential lottery selections, they are committed to retaining
Taylor ... owner permitting.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead Old hands for Kings
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento Kings brought several familiar faces to the
Sports Arena. The active roster included center Vlade Divac, who -
prior to duty with the Charlotte Hornets - bridged the Lakers'
center gap between Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Kings assistant coach Byron Scott was drafted by the Clippers in
1983, pouted his way into a trade to the Lakers, and now has three
NBA championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   Two other assistant coaches became popular thanks to March
Madness. Steve Fisher directed Michigan to the NCAA crown in 1989
after Bill Frieder was chased off the bench for having agreed to
coach at Arizona State the following season.
</P>
<P>
   Former Princeton coach Pete Carril is remembered for leading the
Tigers through the back door and into a first-round upset of UCLA
in 1996.

BLAKE CALLS PLAYERS-ONLY MEETING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
<TEXT>

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ In nine seasons with the Kings, Rob Blake
had never called a players-only meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kings coming off an important victory over Detroit two
days earlier but still seven points behind San Jose and Edmonton
for the final Western Conference playoff berth with 17 games
remaining, the Kings' captain concluded the time was right.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Blake declined to discuss details of the
meeting, saying, ``What happens in the room belongs in the room. It
really concerns the 25 guys in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake admitted calling the meeting was difficult, and added,
``It's probably 50 games too late. We won a game, but we might as
well have lost because we didn't move anywhere in the standings
(San Jose also won Tuesday night). I'll tell you at the end of the
year if I was too late or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Tuesday morning's skate before the Detroit game, Blake
approached Coach Larry Robinson and told him he wanted to call a
meeting. Robinson said he was pleased to see Blake take the step.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unlike myself in that we don't like doing those
things, yet it's our job to sometimes stand up and maybe hurt a few
feelings, say what you really feel,'' Robinson said. ``You're put
in a position of taking responsibility and giving responsibility.
I've said all along that I thought he's matured more this year than
he has in the past few years and this is just another example of
his maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first thing is to get over the fear of hurting
somebody's feelings or the fear of maybe not thinking you're worthy
of doing what you're doing. I think that's all part of maturing and
becoming a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 17 games will reveal whether Blake was able to get
through to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a speech like that,'' center Ian Laperriere said.
``We know we've been playing awful for most of the year. Blakey
said, `Great game against Detroit. But we didn't win the Stanley
Cup, we didn't get back in the playoffs, and it doesn't mean
anything if we start losing again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Peter Demers said wingers Vladimir Tsyplakov (knee
injury) and Steve McKenna (abdominal injury) have medical clearance
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Status quo (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Steve Duchesne, who has struggled most of the season
after signing a three-year, $11.25-million contract as a free
agent, was a healthy scratch Tuesday against Detroit, and may not
be in the lineup for Saturday's home game against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're asking me right now,'' Robinson said after
Thursday's practice, ``I'll probably go with the same lineup (as
Tuesday). You're not going to get a better 60 minutes than we
played the other night. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked following Tuesday's game why he'd scratched Duchesne,
Robinson said, ``He's still not willing to pay the price to make a
play. We can't afford to wait. We've got to win.''
