YANKS BEAT MARLINS 5-1
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As defending World Series champions, the Florida
Marlins should be the crown jewel of the major leagues this season.
Having squandered their valuables in trades, however, the Marlins
are baseball's gypsies, scrounging for victories and a new identity
as they search for a new and permanent home in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But the Marlins almost stole a game from the Yankees Friday
night. Almost. Andy Pettitte allowed just one unearned run and
pitched a complete game, outdueling rookie Joe Fontenot, 5-1,
before 28,085 at Yankee Stadium. After taking their first
interleague game of the season, the Yankees (42-13) have won five
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied, 1-1, after the Marlins scored in the top of
the seventh. But Darryl Strawberry blasted a high drive over the
wall in left field in the bottom of the inning, and the Yankees
added another run in the seventh and two in the eighth to beat
Fontenot (0-3) and the Marlins, who sport baseball's worst record
at 17-42.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte (7-5), who has struggled lately, Friday night allowed
five hits and only one walk while striking out four in a
complete-game victory that was aided by the Marlins' batters.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the likes of Gary Sheffield and Moises Alou have
been replaced by bad players as Florida's front office hacked away
at the team's payroll. Most baseball executives believe that the
Marlins' roster is loaded with talent _ very young talent, rookies
cutting their teeth with every major-league at-bat. But the Marlins
are learning on the job, and there was no greater evidence of that
Friday night than the quality of their at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling for command the first two months of this season,
Pettitte has averaged 16.8 pitches per inning, an usually high
number. Ken Kaiser, Friday night's plate umpire, typically calls a
small but consistent strike zone. Given those factors, the Marlins
might have had a chance to drive up Pettitte's pitch count, forcing
him to work and possibly make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the young and aggressive Marlins swung freely, to
Pettitte's benefit. He needed just six pitches to get through the
first inning, eight pitches to get out of the second, only 34 for
the first four innings. Of the first 14 Florida hitters, only one _
Craig Counsell, in the third inning _ had an at-bat of more than
three pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte, looking for a way out of his maze-like slump,
won't care whom he pitched against, how he got them out or how much
they helped him with their reckless at-bats. He needed a boost of
confidence, which arrived in teal packaging Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte allowed seven runs in two and two-thirds innings in his
previous start, pushing his perpetual self-examination into
overdrive. After throwing in the bullpen and, according to others
in the organization, making minor changes in his delivery, Pettitte
backed off, in a sense. He determined that, rather than trying to
make the perfect pitch, he should just concentrate on throwing the
ball over the plate, forcing the hitters to put the ball in play.
He had walked seven in six innings on May 26 and thrown a whopping
70 pitches in the eight-out start on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   But he changed that Friday night against the Marlins. Pettitte
allowed only three hits and a walk in the first six innings, and in
the two situations when Florida had a runner in scoring position,
Pettitte pitched out of trouble. In his previous outing, the Red
Sox were 5-for-7 with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Marlins' inexperience meant that the Yankees knew virtually
nothing about Fontenot, who was 2 years old when Tim Raines broke
into the big leagues in 1979. Fontenot, 21, began the season in
Class AA, but after losing on May 16 to Norwich, the Yankees'
Eastern League affiliate, the right-hander was promoted to the
major leagues and lost his first two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, however, Fontenot changed speeds expertly and kept
the ball down in the strike zone. Kaiser often called strikes and
generated stares from the perplexed Yankee hitters, and Kaiser
looked right back at them as if to say: Hey, what can I tell you,
it was a strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had two runners in the first inning, another reached
scoring position in the second, and Chuck Knoblauch singled to
start the third. At any time, it seemed, Fontenot would crumble
under an inevitable flood of runs from the Yankees, who are
averaging more than six a game.
</P>
<P>
   But Fontenot shut out the Yankees in the first five innings,
allowing just two hits and striking out two; he struck out two more
to open the sixth, fooling Scott Brosius so badly that Brosius
twice launched bats into the stands on the third-base side as he
flailed away. (It appeared that no fans were injured.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Paul O'Neill rapped a single through the middle with
two outs in the sixth, took second on a wild pitch and scored when
Tino Martinez dropped a broken-bat looper into short right. The
Yankees led, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins tied the game in the top of the seventh. With
runners at first and second and one out, Derrek Lee hit a chopper
back to Pettitte, who turned and fired to second, where shortstop
Luis Sojo and Knoblauch appeared confused as to who should take the
throw. Knoblauch stepped in to get the ball and threw wildly to
first, the ball hopping into the stands. Todd Zeile trotted home
with the first unearned run allowed by the Yankees in 89 innings.

FORMER L.A. MAYOR SAM YORTY DIES AT AGE 88
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News Staff Writer Eric Moses contributed to this story.) 
By DAVID R. BAKER AND RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sam Yorty, Los Angeles' hard-charging mayor during
the turbulent but prosperous 1960s, died Friday morning at his home
in suburban Studio City. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   The boisterous politician, who relished his reputation as the
``Maverick Mayor,'' died peacefully from complications of a May 24
stroke, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   City flags were lowered to half-staff in his honor, and the City
Council adjourned in his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Yorty presided over a period of rapid growth in Los Angeles
after his election in 1961 and unabashedly took credit for the
city's rise to international prominence.
</P>
<P>
   But his 12-year tenure in office was marred, perhaps doomed, by
the Watts riots of 1965, which left 34 people dead and more than
1,000 injured. Yorty ran two racially tinged campaigns against Tom
Bradley, winning in 1969 before being ousted in 1973, when voters
elected the city's first African-American mayor.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Yorty was remembered as an exuberant man who, in
spite of his reputation for two-fisted politics and sometimes
insensitive remarks, tried to unite the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the type of person who made every effort to bring this
city together,'' said Celes King III, state chairman of the
Congress of Racial Equality and a longtime friend of Yorty's. ``He
was a great mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   City Council President John Ferraro, who knew Yorty for more
than 50 years, called him a colorful man with a love of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived life and played politics to the fullest,'' Ferraro
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yorty came to the Mayor's Office after a career that included
stints as a California assemblyman and U.S. representative. At
every turn, he defied expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1909 in Lincoln, Neb., Yorty's fascination with politics
surfaced early.
</P>
<P>
   In a ninth-grade composition, he wrote that his goal was to
become a politician. His teacher told him to concentrate on
becoming a statesman instead.
</P>
<P>
   Yorty moved to Los Angeles after high school and in 1936 won a
seat in the state Assembly. As a young Democratic lawmaker, he
earned the enmity of conservatives by championing pro-union
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, he enraged his own party by backing Richard Nixon's
1960 presidential bid over John F. Kennedy's. Furious Democratic
leaders refused to help Yorty become mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a man of contradictions and great complexity,'' said Ed
Edelman, a former councilman and county supervisor who frequently
sparred with Yorty. ``He couldn't be pegged as a liberal or a
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Without his party's support, Yorty won the mayor's seat by
railing against what he called a clique of downtown interests that
ruled Los Angeles. That approach struck a chord among San Fernando
Valley residents, African-Americans and Latinos, all of whom felt
excluded from local government.
</P>
<P>
   Once elected, Yorty began increasing the number of minorities in
city government, said King, whom Yorty appointed to a commission on
race relations in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the person who partially opened the door,'' King added.
``Tom (Bradley), of course, pushed it wide open, but if it hadn't
been for Sam, the beginning wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those efforts, the riots that ripped through Watts in
1965 became one of the most important events in Yorty's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state officials complained that he hadn't cooperated
with their plans to prevent such violent disturbances. Yorty
countered that the federal government had raised the hopes and
expectations of African-Americans without providing opportunities
to fulfill them.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley waged two hard-fought campaigns to unseat Yorty. The
incumbent mayor _ who had ushered minorities into his
administration _ responded by countering that African-Americans
usually vote for candidates of their own race. He also warned
voters about a political bloc of ``black-power (advocates),
left-wing radicals, and if you please, identified Communists.''
</P>
<P>
   Several City Council members said Yorty's memory should not be
clouded by the bitterness of his last campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played hardball politics and did what it took to win,''
said Councilman Richard Alatorre, who worked on Bradley's first
campaign against Yorty. ``Although I didn't agree with his later
politics, early on in his career he was fighting for the
workingman. And he served as mayor at a time that would be hard for
anybody with the riots and anti-war demonstrations going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan praised Yorty for trying to bring people
from the suburbs into the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Mayor Yorty's service, Los Angeles first became known as
the city of the future,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman described Yorty as a fair man and skilled administrator
who always had his city's best interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very colorful person who felt he had something to say
about everything, and that got him into a lot of trouble,'' Edelman
said. ``But underneath, he cared about this city.''

COMEDIAN HOPE SURVIVES FALSE TALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEX ROTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When word spread around the world that Bob Hope
was dead, the legendary comedian did what comes naturally: He
started cracking jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Hope, 95, was alive and well enough to be eating a quiet
breakfast at home in Toluca Lake when The Associated Press' Web
site mistakenly posted Hope's prewritten obituary Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of Hope's death spread around the globe instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The news was flashed to the floor of the House of
Representatives, where Rep. Bob Stump, R-Arizona, shocked his
colleagues with the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is with great sadness,'' Stump solemnly told his
colleagues, ``I announce that Bob Hope has died.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope's neighbors in suburban Toluca Lake were beside themselves
with anguish as the news spread through the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Hope's secretary, Annette Siegel, was besieged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been crazy,'' she said. ``Those words came from
someone (Stump) with a lot of credibility. Believe me, people
believed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope, who celebrated his birthday last week, took it all in
stride, she said, making jokes that she wouldn't repeat.
</P>
<P>
   At Eleanor Rodriquez's Toluca Lake barbershop, customers were
discussing how well Hope looked at the 75th anniversary parade last
weekend when they heard the news _ and then the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so glad it wasn't true,'' Rodriguez said. ``He was in
such good form last Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident is yet another cautionary tale in an age when
information _ and misinformation _ can spread around the globe as
quickly as it takes to click a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   It all began when somehow Hope's obituary got onto AP's online
site. ``Bob Hope, tireless master of the one-liner, dead at x,''
the headline read.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure how it happened,'' said Mike Silverman, AP
deputy managing editor in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late: A staffer for House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, spotted the obituary and passed it to him on the
floor of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, Armey handed the story to Stump, an ardent Hope fan,
and told him: ``Make the announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   News organizations all over the world flashed the news based on
Stump's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Stump said he apologized later to family members, and AP issued
an urgent correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is fine,'' Hope's publicist Ward Grant said. ``He's
eating breakfast at his home in Toluca Lake.''

CRASHES PAINFUL FOR DRIVERS AT TMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM PEDLEY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ John Timber was in tears as he quickly
strode through the garage area at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't tears of joy.
</P>
<P>
   Timber trotted up to driver Boris Said and a stream of apologies
flowed with the tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry,'' Timber said as he burrowed his
head into Said's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Said assured Timber more than once that there was no problem and
no need for apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for him,'' Said said after Timber wandered off,
mumbling.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional scene was set by a fourth-lap crash during the
Pronto Auto Parts 400K last night.
</P>
<P>
   Said explained what happened and what precipitated Timber's
emotional state. He said a truck or trucks in front of him broke
loose and began to spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see a thing,'' Said said. ``My spotter said `Go
low, go low.' I went low and somebody was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Timber was Said's spotter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for him,'' Said said. ``It's hard for a spotter.
I've been a spotter. You've only got a couple of seconds to make a
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Said, who finished second last year at the TMS event, started
the race in the 16th position on the outside of row eight. He said
he had worked his way past five or six trucks and was feeling
pretty good about attaining his goal of finishing in the top 10.
``I think we may have been in the top five by the way (the truck)
felt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the crash ended the hopes of Said and his team, it
prolonged an agonizing run of bad luck for Mike Bliss and his team.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss had had a couple of very good days at TMS. He qualified
fifth and was running strong when his night ended on the fourth
lap.
</P>
<P>
   He was also running strong in Portland and Phoenix this year
when engine blew.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is frustrating because of all the bad luck we've had this
year,'' said Jim Smith, owner of Bliss's truck. ``We are a top team
that is down on its luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss' bad luck at TMS is in its second year. In 1997, Bliss won
the pole and led the first 112 laps, but a cut tire handed the race
to Kenny Irwin Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dominated,'' Smith said of the 1997 race.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss's bad luck didn't end with a wrecked truck last night. He
also sustained a broken right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the crash was not entirely caused by bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would have turned it around tonight, but a rookie
got in front of us,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie was Scot Walters.
</P>
<P>
   Said and Smith said Walters started the events when his truck
spun.
</P>
<P>
   A crew member of Walters' was asked whether his driver was
available to talk about the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, because there he goes,'' the crew member said, nodding
toward an ambulance headed out of the garage area.
</P>
<P>
   Walters had a chin cut and was complaining of neck pain after
the wreck. He was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-lap accident was the first of the night but not the
last. In all, nine trucks were eliminated from the race by crashes
and there were nine caution periods.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers cited various causes for the accidents _ high speeds,
poor driving, debris on the track _ but nary a suggestion that the
freshly resurfaced track was a cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so fast out there,'' veteran Winston Cup driver
Jimmy Hensley said. ``A lot of guys just don't have the trucks'' to
go that fast. ``It's pretty fast for a pickup. And there is a lot
of stuff being kicked up out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hensley crashed on the 58th lap.

Interleague interruption
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astros' winning ends when American League arrives
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Baseball purists don't care much for interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, neither do the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals, behind the pitching of righthander Tim
Belcher, resembled an American League version of the Atlanta Braves
in a 3-0 victory over the Astros on Friday night before a crowd of
27,895 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   After experiencing one year of ``The Great Interleague
Experiment,'' the Astros are no closer to finding a way to beat an
AL club, even the Royals, who entered the game in the AL Central
cellar with the third-worst record in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are 4-12 in interleague play since the concept of the
NL and AL playing each other during the regular season was adopted
last season.
</P>
<P>
   So what do the Astros really think of this interleague stuff?
</P>
<P>
   ``Interleague play killed us last year, so if we would have
taken a vote if we were in favor of it this season, everybody would
have said no,'' second baseman Craig Biggio said.
</P>
<P>
   While the novelty of interleague play has worn off, the Astros
couldn't help but notice the ramifications as the Chicago Cubs
pulled into a first-place tie in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you have to score runs to win in either league. And
the Astros didn't, wasting a solid performance by lefthander Pete
Schourek, whose seven-inning outing was his longest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, who lasted only two innings in his start May 30 at
Colorado, settled down after allowing Dean Palmer's run-scoring
double in the first inning and did not allow a hit over the next
six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, between the first and ninth innings _ the two innings
the Royals pushed across their runs _ Astros pitchers did not allow
a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek (2-4), who did not permit a runner to reach second base
after the first inning, scattered two hits, four walks and eight
strikeouts in seven innings. He struck out the side in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been progressively getting better,'' said Schourek, who
hadn't pitched beyond 5 innings in his first five starts. ``I was
looking for something like this to eventually happen. I feel like I
could have thrown all my pitches at any time and all three were
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually if I can get out of the first inning, I can settle
down and realize what my best pitch and second-best pitch is from
then on. I was kind of struggling with my command early on
(Friday). That's just the way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   On any other occasion, he likely would have been good enough to
win. But Belcher was equally impressive. Belcher (5-6) held the
Astros to seven hits and worked out of several jams _ including one
in the third inning when the Astros stranded two runners, including
the potential tying run at third base.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had at least one runner reach base in eight of the
nine innings but came up empty-handed each time in losing their
second consecutive game. It was their third shutout loss of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher is 10-3 with a 2.68 ERA in 20 career appearances against
the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good veteran pitcher, but if he pitched 10 times
against us, we'd score nine times,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said. ``I don't think he could (shut out us out) again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have scored only one run in their last 20 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we have to start swinging the bats a little
better,'' Dierker said. ``We didn't have that many opportunities,
but what opportunities we did have we didn't get any clutch hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of times we hit the ball sharply, but most of the
time we didn't. We're kind of in an offensive funk right now, and I
hope we come out of it soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who snapped a four-game losing streak, scored the
only run they needed in the first inning when Palmer lined an RBI
double to the right-field corner that scored Jose Offerman, who had
singled.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros put runners on first and second with one out in the
ninth when Bill Spiers singled and Ricky Gutierrez walked off
Royals reliever Jeff Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   They appeared to have loaded the bases when Gutierrez seemed to
beat Montgomery's throw to second off Brad Ausmus' grounder to the
mound. But Gutierrez was ruled out, and Montgomery got his 10th
save when pinch hitter Dave Clark grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really couldn't get anything to fall in or get many breaks
going our way,'' Biggio said. ``We had a couple of guys in scoring
position, we hit the ball hard, but tonight wasn't supposed to be
our night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had a good scoring shot in the third inning, and
leadoff singles in the fifth, seventh and eighth also failed to
produce any runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the NL or AL, that's the formula for a loss.

REAL QUIET WILL FINISH HIS BLAZE OF GLORY 
BY LARRY STUMES
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real Quiet is the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the injuries that knocked out many of his opponents
along the Triple Crown trail, forget about his early record that
included two defeats at Santa Fe Downs in New Mexico, forget about
his $17,000 purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet will win the Belmont Stakes Saturday at Belmont Park
to become the 12th horse to sweep the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors will say he isn't deserving of the honor, that he
couldn't have run with the likes of Secretariat, Citation or
Affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he couldn't have beaten them, but he is beating the horses
they put in the starting gate with him. In 20 years, no one will
remember who Real Quiet ran against; his name will be there with
the other Triple Crown winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people criticizing this horse, but he's run well
every time at 1 1/16 miles or longer on a fast track,'' said Mike
Pegram, who bought Real Quiet for $17,000 through trainer Bob
Baffert at a yearling sale in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet has four wins, two seconds and five thirds in 14
starts. But since losing a one-mile maiden race in his sixth start,
the bay colt has four wins, two seconds and a third in seven starts
on a fast track.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Real Quiet's early losses came in the Indian Nations
Futurity Cup and a trial heat at Santa Fe Downs. Both races were
run at seven furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a greedy owner and a foolish trainer,'' Pegram said.
``They were giving away $600,000 (in purse and bonuses), and we
threw him in there. We were asking him to do something he didn't
want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't tell Patrick Ewing to shoot nothing but
3-pointers and then say he was a lousy basketball player because he
couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Real Quiet broke his maiden going 1 1/16 miles on October
18, he finished a strong third in the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes
at Churchill Downs and then won the Hollywood Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran in a position most young horses don't accept,'' jockey
Kent Desormeaux said. ``He was behind horses getting dirt in his
face. I needed him to go through a hole on the inside, and he
really went through there. I thought then that he was the best
chance I ever had to win the Kentucky Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet opened his 1998 campaign by finishing last _ 221/2
lengths behind victorious Clover Hunter _ in the Golden Gate Derby
on January 18 at Golden Gate Fields. Rain poured all that day, and
the track was a quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up in the director's room, and going into the first turn
I was back sitting down finishing my beer,'' Pegram said. ``It was
obvious he wasn't going to run in that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet finished second, a head behind Artax, in the San
Felipe Stakes on March 14 at Santa Anita and second again, 21/4
lengths behind stablemate Indian Charlie, in the Santa Anita Derby
on April 4.
</P>
<P>
   Then he broke out, winning the Kentucky Derby by a half-length
over fast-closing Victory Gallop and making an awesome move on the
second turn to take the Preakness by 21/4 lengths over Victory
Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Derby, I told Kent to move from the three-eighths pole
to the eighth, and he made a huge quarter-mile run,'' Baffert said.
``Then he ran unbelievable in the Preakness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont Stakes distance of 11/2 miles is the longest of the
Triple Crown; the Kentucky Derby is 11/4 miles and the Preakness is
1 3/16 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the most awesome, fluid style,'' Desormeaux said of
Real Quiet. ``He can just snap off those 12-second eighths (of a
mile) so easily. He's really matured. If there's any horse today
that can get 11/2 miles, it would be him.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve horses will be trying to knock off Real Quiet Saturday.
Look for Yarrow Brae, Victory Gallop, Thomas Jo and Grand Slam to
provide the strongest competition. But that is all they will be,
competition.

PAC-10 HAS REAL SURE THING  
 ASU, USC MEET FOR BASEBALL TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ Pat Murphy likes to say the Pac-10 schedule is a
perfect tune-up for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Jeez, he wasn't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State traveled hundreds of miles, beat up some of
college baseball's biggest powers and used some of its finest
strategy for this: the opportunity to meet one of its Pac-10
Southern Division brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State vs. Southern California. For the national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone had just said something, we could have settled this
back home,'' Trojans Coach Mike Gillespie joked.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, today's game is about more than the College World
Series crown. It is about two of college baseball's most successful
programs going head to head.
</P>
<P>
   USC has won 11 titles, its last coming in 1978. ASU has won
five, but not since 1981. The Trojans advanced by knocking off, on
consecutive days, Louisiana State, a team that has won four
national crowns in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The ghosts of ASU baseball have some scores to settle. In 1972
and '73, USC beat the Sun Devils for the title in one-run games.
</P>
<P>
   If the regular season is any indication, this contest will be
just as close. These teams split their six meetings with home
sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   If there's an advantage, it's that the Sun Devils are
well-rested. They haven't played since Wednesday. The Trojans will
be competing for a third straight day.
</P>
<P>
   ASU will start its ace, Ryan Mills, who said earlier this week
that his arm was dead. Asked how it felt Friday, he said, ``At this
point, it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be nitro or anything. I'll be able to give
everything I've got. Whatever that is, I don't know. Our whole
bullpen is rested, and I think that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   USC is expected to go with Rik Currier, who was 5-1 during the
regular season with a 5.23 ERA. His last appearance was against
Mississippi State, when he went eight innings and allowed one run
and four hits while striking out 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do everything,'' ASU Coach Pat Murphy said. ``They hit
with power, they run, they bunt, they play defense, they pitch
well. They're a solid ballclub all the way around.''
</P>
<P>
   It may say something about college baseball that the two teams
with the least power in the tournament advanced to the final.
</P>
<P>
   Both schools are capable of hitting home runs _ ASU has five in
three Series games _ but both are better known for manufacturing
runs: stealing bases, bunting, turning to the hit and run.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like us,'' Mills said. ``They do the little stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's really been a case of David vs. Goliath
when we play people,'' shortstop Michael Collins said. ``We can hit
home runs if we have to, but it's just that we can produce runs in
a number of ways. That's how we keep finding ways to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the key for ASU, though, during this series is its
consistent defense. The Sun Devils have made two errors vs. 11 by
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, Willie Bloomquist (.533) has led a charge of five
players hitting better than .400 in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   This title game is a surprising finish to a season that many
thought would have Stanford as the only Pac-10 representative here.
</P>
<P>
   Few expected ASU to be here. At the season's midpoint, the Sun
Devils were only two games better than .500.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils' last national title came in 1981, a 7-4 victory
over Oklahoma State. ASU lost a 1988 championship to another Pac-10
rival, Stanford, 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun Devils are here without a roster of big-name players
_ like Barry Bonds _ that often dotted past lineups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true, but I think it's just that there's not that many
big names in college baseball anymore,'' Murphy said. ``The pros
take a lot of the great ones. You've got to win with scrappy guys,
but that's one of the more enjoyable things about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win with a (Mikel) Moreno, a (Rudy) Arguelles, a Richy
Leon. They all make it go, and it's really beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, the biggest name on the team, said he would spend Friday
night on his own, and that he prefers not to talk to too many
people before he pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But he did realize the opportunity that has been presented him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many kids dream about this, being in Omaha,''
he said. ``This is why I came to college. I feel good about this
game. One thing about this team, we always come through. We have a
lot of heart, a lot of hard-nosed players. That will make the
difference.'' &QL;

CORA BROTHERS REUNITED IN SEATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ New Dodgers began arriving Friday and none with a
better story than infielder Alex Cora.
</P>
<P>
   Cora's contract was purchased Thursday after Todd Hollandsworth
was placed on the 60-day disabled list with torn cartilage in his
left shoulder. He thought when he was scratched for the second
consecutive game at Triple-A Albuquerque that he was in trouble.
Instead, he was joining the Dodgers in the city where his brother
Joey plays second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest day of my life,'' Joey Cora said.
``Seeing him here is better than the playoff games or the All-Star
games. I've been smiling all day. I cried last night with joy.
Since we are 11 years apart, I never thought we would ever play in
the big leagues at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Cora, 22, was batting .232 in 51 games as Albuquerque's
shortstop. When he got word he was headed to the big leagues he
called Puerto Rico for his mother, Iris, who then got a call from
Joey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty down when I got home last night because we
lost,'' Joey Cora said. ``But this news turned everything around.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Alex's flight to Seattle from Albuquerque was
canceled, then he was re-routed through Phoenix, arriving here at 4
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to him last night and he was so excited,'' Alex said
of Joey. ``I think he was more excited than me. This is great. I
got to know a lot of these guys the last two spring trainings, and
they were all great when I got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki arrives: First things first. Dave Mlicki is not Bob
Milacki or Mike Bielecki, although the three were part of the same
pitching staff for the Cleveland Indians in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But Mlicki, acquired by the Dodgers on Thursday from the New
York Mets in the Hideo Nomo deal, is the Dodgers' starting pitcher
today in a nationally televised game against the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki, who turns 30 on Monday, arrived here at 3 p.m. from
Boston, where the Mets were opening an interleague series against
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard my name mentioned a lot, but I had heard it last
year, too,'' Mlicki said. ``Until it happens, you never are really
prepared for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki, who says he is constantly called Bob Milacki, now in the
Houston farm system, also had the reputation of having the best arm
in the Mets' organization. That, however, did not translate into
much success. He was 8-12 last year, but he did lead the Mets with
32 starts and 157 strikeouts. This season he was 1-4 with a 5.68
ERA in 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets had so many rainouts this year that I was going seven
or eight days between starts,'' Mlicki said. ``It was very hard to
get any rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire comment: Dodgers executive vice president Fred Claire
said Friday that former club owner Peter O'Malley did not sway him
into sending Nomo to the Mets. He also said Nomo's agent, Don
Nomura, was not seeking a contract extension when the two met
during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter O'Malley had nothing to do with the trade, and he has
not tried to influence me on player moves at any time during the 12
years that I have had this job,'' Claire said.

DEVILS CAN TOUCH TITLE TROPHY TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA _ The College World Series trophy rests inside a display
case in the lobby of Arizona State's downtown hotel. Bathed in soft
light, the Waterford crystal bat and ball sparkle like crushed
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   ASU players are drawn to the trophy's glow. They view the
elegant object with respectful silence, their eyes wide and
unblinking, like children gazing wishfully into the front window of
a toy store.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived here 10 days ago. They won their first game. Won
their second. Won their third, circling the bases for 14 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever dreamed we'd be in ``this'' position?'' ASU pitcher
Ryan Mills said. Now only a pane of glass separates these kids from
their prize.
</P>
<P>
   While watching them gaze at the trophy, you thought of the pop
fly drill the Sun Devils performed Friday during their final
practice of this magical season. Head thrown back, eyes to the gray
sky, third baseman Andrew Beinbrick waved other infielders away and
sang out as he lifted his glove, ``Mine! Mine! Mine!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep saying it!'' Coach Pat Murphy demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine!'' Beinbrink shouted. ``MINE!!''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, it will be theirs very soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very big,'' Doug Schreiber, an ASU assistant coach
said, viewing the trophy with a critical eye. No, but what it
represents is huge. If ASU beats Southern California today the Sun
Devils will win their first baseball national championship in 17
years.
</P>
<P>
   Has it been that long?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe, but yes. In the 1980s ASU sent four teams to
Omaha. Barry Bonds played in the College World Series. So did
Oddibe McDowell. But in 1983 and '84 and '87 and '88 the Devils
fell short.
</P>
<P>
   Now the school has an opportunity to write more history with a
spirited group of players and a gung-ho coach who had never been
here before.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen years?
</P>
<P>
   The last time ASU won the College World Series, Jim Brock's
successor was in college. ``Playing at Florida Atlantic
(University),'' Murphy said, grabbing an imaginary bat and striking
a hitter's squinty pose.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 most of the players Murphy recruited were preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what ASU was,'' said Mills, then age 4. Now the
junior left-hander stands 6 feet 5. His final start for his alma
mater will be the biggest game of his college career.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the old man on this team, 26-year-old Rudy Arguelles,
was the youngest and smallest player on his Little League club. The
9-year-old second baseman has a picture of himself sitting in the
dugout, his legs dangling off the edge of the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody else,'' Rudy recalled, ``had their feet on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooted in fundamentals, this team grew up together this year. A
tough schedule prepared the Devils for the rigors of the NCAA
tournament. Steady pitching and hot bats have carried them to the
championship game, where they will face a familiar opponent. This
season ASU and USC split six games, the Devils taking the last
three. On April 11 _ their last meeting _ the Devils won 24-4,
which means nothing, of course, unless ASU allows itself to go into
the title game feeling overly confident.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Murphy, he won't allow that. ASU's fourth-year coach has
a team-as-fortress mentality. He preaches about playing each game
one pitch, one inning at a time, while guarding against possible
distractions, for which he coined a name.
</P>
<P>
   ``FUMPS,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Fumps?
</P>
<P>
   The coach ticked them off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans. Umpires. Media. Nothing personal,'' he said, smiling.
``Parents. Scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans should pose more threat to the Devils than the
FUMPS. USC made the title game the hard way, twice beating two-time
defending champion LSU.
</P>
<P>
   But how can you not like ASU's chances? The Devils are hitting
everything. They're rested. And their ace, who throws 95 mph, says
he can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   Murph, is there anybody you'd rather have on the mound than
Mills?
</P>
<P>
   The coach thought a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Gibson,'' he replied. &QL;

BULLS EVEN SERIES AT 1-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Michael Jordan read the newspapers and watched
television on Thursday. He came upon several stories and statistics
pointing to his eventual doom and decided, enough already.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have inner strength and confidence,'' Jordan said Friday
morning. ``One game does not deteriorate that. One game does not
dictate how this series is going to end. If you want to write us
off, go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold the Bulls' obituary for another day.
</P>
<P>
   Creating artificial motivation as only he can, Jordan led
Chicago past the Utah Jazz in Game 2 of the National Basketball
Association finals Friday night. Before a silenced throng at the
Delta Center, the Bulls evened the four-of-seven-game series with a
93-88 victory and return to Chicago with home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The series shifts to the United Center for Games 3, 4 and 5
beginning on Sunday night, giving the Jazz two days in which not to
tick Jordan off. He was angry during and after Game 1, an 88-85
overtime loss on Wednesday that was supposed to signal the demise
of a dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   But deposing the king was an impossible chore for Karl Malone,
John Stockton and the Jazz in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan scored 37 points, 23 in he second half, on 14-of-33
shooting and received help from Scottie Pippen and Toni Kukoc, who
combined for 34 points.
</P>
<P>
   Utah was led by Jeff Hornacek's 20 points. Malone had 16 poins
but shot just 5 for 16.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago led at halftime, 50-46, and Jordan, Pippen and Kukoc had
combined for 40 points.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the game, the emergence of Hornacek helped the Jazz,
too. Battling a slew of minor injuries _ from a nagging back to a
strained Achilles' tendon _ the veteran guard sparked Utah in the
third period with his marksmanship and uncanny knack for finding a
way to get around his defender.
</P>
<P>
   With Malone shackled by Dennis Rodman down low, Stockton
consistently found Hornacek running off screens for jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   Utah took a 73-70 lead into the final period, after a wild few
minutes in which the Bulls fell apart on both ends of the court and
surrendered a lead of 61-53.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton and Hornacek directed an 11-0 run to put Utah in
charge. Whether Stockton was taking the ball away from Steve Kerr
and leading the break or Hornacek was making improbable 3-pointers
and lean-in runners with hands in his face, everything was working.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz went ahead by 64-61 after Stockton drove the length of
the floor and hit a layup underneath Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   The run came after the Bulls went up by eight points midway
through the third quarter and seemed to be on the verge of blowing
the Jazz out. But Utah, as it always seems to do in this building,
caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   First, Malone bulled over Rodman, drew a foul and made two free
throws. Then after a missed Jordan layup in heavy traffic, Stockton
found Bryon Russell on the right baseline. He dropped in a
3-pointer to bring Utah within 61-58.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Hornacek converted a 3-pointer on the right wing to
give the Jazz the lead, bedlam consumed the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of game from the start.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shandon Anderson cut the Chicago lead to 85-83 with 2 minutes 12
seconds left, making two free throws. But the Bulls would not
relent.
</P>
<P>
   They rebounded well, especially their own missed shots. With
less than 3 minutes left, 16 of their 31 rebounds had come on the
offensive end. Rodman, after a quick trip to Las Vegas, after a
subpar showing in Game 1, returned with resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Malone picked up his fifth foul for holding Steve Kerr as the
Bulls guard tried to fight through a pick-and-roll with less than 7
minutes left. Then Jordan gave the Bulls the impetus they needed to
close the door, it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a near-impossible jump shot from the free-throw line,
with Hornacek draped around him. The ball swished. He drew the foul
and made the free throw to put the Bulls in front, 81-74.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jerry Sloan chose an unusual lineup to begin the fourth
quarter: Adam Keefe, Anderson, Antoine Carr, Howard Eisley and
Chris Morris. Within minutes, he reinserted Stockton and Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson countered with Jordan with less than 9 minutes
left.
</P>
<P>
   Points were at a premium the first five minutes of the fourth
quarter, with non-calls on each side leading to several turnovers
and forced shots.
</P>
<P>
   The teams went at each other like prizefighters in the first
half, the Bulls shooting 52.5 percent from the field and the Jazz
hitting 54.3 percent of its shots. The two best-executing teams in
the league were passing, moving without the ball and getting easy
baskets inside. They combined for 54 points in the paint after two
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc went on a personal tear, scoring 13 points in the first
half on 6-of-11 shooting. He was posting up Anderson, scoring over
Russell from the outside and making all the right decisions in
Chicago's triple-post offense.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan needed a break, especially after having to take 29 shots
in Game 1. Pippen provided relief, driving to the goal and doing
everything he could to disrupt the Jazz's defense. The Bulls made
several adjustments from Game 1, including making sure Pippen and
Kukoc drove to the basket. Pippen also was matched up against
Malone at times in the post. His reach and quickness disrupted
Malone from making his move inside on several possessions.
</P>
<P>
   And rather than let Kerr take his chances against Stockton,
Coach Phil Jackson employed Harper's athleticism and Kukoc's size
to help quell the playmaker's penetration.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls played as if their season was on the line, with the
same passion and desire they did against the Indiana Pacers in Game
7 of the Eastern Conference finals. The Jazz seemed to feed off of
that intensity, repelling every Bull run with one of its own.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the classic playoff games in recent memory, neither
team would budge. And when it was over, the series was all even.

RAINES TOPS ROOKIE TO WIN TRUCK RACE
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Motor Speedway is good to rookies
driving trucks, but there's something to be said for a little bit
of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Houston made a bid to become the second rookie to win a
NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race at TMS, but second-year driver
Tony Raines was able to hold him off.
</P>
<P>
   Raines took the checkered flag at the Pronto Auto Parts 400K
last night at TMS, finishing 0.241 seconds ahead of Houston. It was
the second victory on the circuit this season for the driver of the
No. 19 Pennzoil Ford, and the third in his two seasons racing the
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is awesome,'' Raines said. ``This is really neat. I like
Texas. It's a big state, a big racetrack and it pays a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines won $56,400 for the victory before an estimated crowd of
60,000, the largest in the four-year history of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin Jr., also a rookie, won the inaugural truck race at
TMS last year. Instead of joining him, Houston settled for the best
finish of his brief career. The previous best for the 27-year-old
driver of the No. 60 Addington Racing Chevrolet was a fourth in the
third race of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony had me beat there at the end of the race,'' Houston said.
``But we hung in there all night, and it was a good run. You're
never satisfied running second, but we stayed out of trouble all
night. We were a little tight in the end or we might have been able
to pull it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The duel for the victory was set up an incident involving
another couple of first-year drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Raines passed rookie Wayne Anderson for the lead with 21 laps
remaining, and fellow rookies Houston and Greg Biffle also closed
in.
</P>
<P>
   Houston went low and Biffle went high, giving the track a brief
taste of three-wide racing. But it didn't last long. Anderson and
Biffle made contact, and Biffle went sideways.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just pushed up into my door and turned me,'' Biffle said.
``I'm sure he didn't mean to do it. It was unintentional contact.
We're both rookies.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston got through before the contact, and the caution flag
allowed him to close up on Raines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like (Biffle) spun, and I was lucky to get out of
the way of it,'' Houston said. ``It was a hairy moment, but it all
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   When the green flag dropped after the caution with 12 laps to
go, it quickly became a two-truck duel.
</P>
<P>
   Raines and Houston broke away from the pack on the restart with
Houston all over Raines' rear spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie took a look inside but couldn't find any room. He
took a look to the outside, but Raines wouldn't let him by. Houston
was stuck, a couple of feet behind Raines when the checkered flag
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Andy was getting too close and would be able to
draft,'' Raines said. ``But I was able to hold him off.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran driver Joe Ruttman finished third after starting 31st.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just thrilled to death,'' Ruttman said. ``When we
started, I felt like we locked in a traffic jam in Dallas. That's
how far back we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlington-based racer David Starr, driving the Reher-Morrison
Chevrolet, finished a career-best 18th.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the race belonged to the favorite, Jack Sprague. He
led with 32 laps remaining but was bumped from behind by Biffle and
narrowly avoided a horrendous wreck. He went onto the infield grass
and almost went airborne when two wheels lifted, but he was able to
keep it on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   That incident brought out one of the nine cautions for assorted
wrecks and debris on the track. But unlike the two crash-marred
Winston Cup races at TMS, nobody blamed the reconfigured track.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it might have been that the new track was too good. The
trucks went faster than ever before, making aerodynamics a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the trucks appeared to like the repaved race
track. They were able to race, and the lead changed hands 13 times.

<P>
   BLANDING, Utah _ As hundreds of law-enforcement officers combed
miles of desert canyon near here for two armed men wanted in the
killing of a Colorado police officer, officials conceded Friday
that the pair seemed to have vanished as completely as the mirages
on the blacktop highways.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials had thought that the suspects, Alan
Pilon, 30, of Dove Creek, Colo., and Jason Wayne McVean, 26, of
Durango, Colo., whom officials described as survivalists, were
trapped in a seven-by-two-mile area of brush and woods near the San
Juan River. Officials zeroed in on the area after a San Juan County
sheriff's deputy was shot on Thursday by a man in camouflage
clothing near the town of Bluff.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the shooting, the body of a man believed to be an
accomplice of the two, Robert Matthew Mason, 26, of Durango, was
found at a campsite along the river, about five miles east of
Bluff. The police believe he shot himself to death.
</P>
<P>
   Police found pipe bombs near the body of Mason, who was wearing
camouflage clothing and a ski mask.
</P>
<P>
   With the shooting of the Utah deputy, 200 National Guardsmen and
300 local, state and federal officers converged on the area, set up
roadblocks, searched with helicopters and evacuated 230 residents
of Bluff. At the middle school here where they spent their day
until being told they could return home Friday night, residents
wondered how they would feel when they got back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared,'' said Charlotte Gray, 31, as she sat with her
6-year-old daughter, Authia, on the front lawn of the school. Mrs.
Gray was at work at the Kokopelli Inn in Bluff when someone ran
past her on Thursday shouting, ``Lock your doors! The killers are
here!'' Then she heard sirens and helicopters, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With help from her brother, she retrieved her three children,
only to abandon the family truck, with its engine running, when
another panicked resident warned, ``Everybody get back inside,
they're just around the corner.'' Eventually, she said, a friend
brought them to Blanding, where they spent the night at the school.
</P>
<P>
   David Florence, the manager of the Red Cross field office in
southeastern Utah, said he had an hour to prepare the middle school
gymnasium for the residents. But residents and churches brought
food and toys and opened their homes, and 150 people stayed at the
gymnasium on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dennison Bellson, a carpenter, said he was building a house when
a neighbor told him shots had been fired. He climbed to the roof
and saw helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife came to Blanding, but worried all night about
their three children, who were staying at their grandparents' home
about 15 miles south of Bluff, on the Navajo Nation Reservation.
Friday morning, he said, they went to get them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were out playing and running around in the sun,'' he
said, smiling with relief. ``And I saw three Navajos out on their
lawn chairs, watching the helicopters go by.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The search area Friday included hundreds of thousands of acres
in southern Utah and 22 miles of river between Bluff and Mexican
Hat.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, Sheriff Mike Lacy of San Juan County warned,
``We may be here a couple more days at least. It's hard to say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to go on at this particular time,'' he added.
``We are not 100 percent sure that they are out of the area or
still in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   All four roads to Bluff were closed Friday, and disappointed
tourists and boaters were turned away. On the 11 miles of road
north of Bluff, only crows and helicopters moved in the still
desert landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The manhunt, which now includes hundreds of police and National
Guardsmen began May 29 after police officer Dale Claxton, 45, was
shot to death in Cortez, Colo., by three gunmen armed with machine
guns and dressed in camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   Two Montezuma County sheriff's deputies were wounded in the
ensuing chase and gun battle. The gunmen fled on foot and
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that in a statement obtained by
KUSA-TV in Denver, Mason's brother Gary Charles Mason, 27, of
Aurora, told the La Plata County Sheriff's Department in Colorado
that he believed his brother was involved in the shootings and had
``a lengthy background in anti-government feelings and anti
law-enforcement statements.'' He said his brother was heavily
armed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that his friends have the same type of thinking that he
does,'' Gary Mason said. ``They sort of feed off each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Mark Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law
Center, said that at least one of the gunmen, Pilon, has been
associated with the Four Corners Patriot Militia, which he
described as a ``shadowy, paramilitary organization'' that has been
active for at least three years, has about 25 members, and has no
official headquarters.

RED WINGS ELIMINATE STARS WITH 2-0 VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ A littany of banners hangs above the ice at Joe Louis
Arena:
</P>
<P>
   Central Division Champions, 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   Western Conference Regular-Season Champions 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents' Trophy Champions 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But not until last season did the modern era Red Wings raise the
Stanley Cup championship banner _ their first since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars took a look at those banners last night as they walked
from the building that has been their Waterloo. After a 2-0 Game 6
loss in the Western Conference finals that ended the Stars' season
and sent the Red Wings to their third Stanley Cup Finals in the
past four seasons, the Stars said they learned a lesson from the
masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have learned what others like us are trying to learn,
that there's an awful high price to pay to win at this level,''
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I think what impresses me most
about (the Red Wings) is their resolve. They got pushed to the
limit _ they knew it, we knew it _ but they responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by goalie Chris Osgood, who bounced back from a horrendous
overtime gaffe in Game 5 when he allowed an 80-foot goal to create
the need for a Game 6, the Red Wings closed out the series 4-2 and
gave themselves a few days off before facing the Washington
Capitals on Tuesday in Detroit. Osgood had 26 saves and collected
his second shutout of the series. They were bookends in games 1 and
6, and they showed just how much the Wings understand the pressure
of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the series was decided, it's strange to say, when we
were able to win in Dallas,'' Wings coach Scotty Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   After taking Game 1, the Wings then simply held service on home
ice, running the Stars' desperation at Joe Louis Arena to 1-17-2 in
their past 20 visits _ including 0-6 in the playoffs. Had the Stars
been able to pull off an upset in The Joe just once, they would be
back at Reunion Arena for Game 7 tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But maybes don't win Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were close, but close isn't good enough,'' veteran Stars
center Bob Bassen said. ``Tonight, they were the better team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings left no doubt about that last night. All the talk
of lucky bounces and bad penalties and fluky goals was put aside.
The Red Wings dominated early, took a lead and never backed off.
They received controlled play from their stars and their role
players. They simply did not yield anything to a Stars team that
Bowman called ``the toughest we have played in the past two
(playoff) seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock returned the compliment to the Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played their best game of the series, and they played it
when they needed it most,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there was still room for controversy. Wings defenseman
Larry Murphy scored the key first goal _ the team scoring first won
every game in the series _ on a shorthanded rush when he magically
jumped off the bench and into wide open ice. The Stars said there
was no one within 20-feet when Murphy, a defenseman, slipped out
the forward door _ a transgression, if true, was cause for a
penalty on the Wings. Detroit players claimed defenseman Bob Rouse
was coming off and clearly on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig had the best theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's (the play) we're going to look back on or
blame the game on,'' Ludwig said. ``We've got to score a couple of
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars didn't, and maybe couldn't. With a hobbled defense,
they often struggled to move the puck out of the defensive zone.
With a frustrated offense, they couldn't break through against a
Red Wings team that has been one of the best at defensive hockey
for the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars scored 11 goals in the six-game series, just slightly
below the 2.3 goals-per-game average they had for the playoffs. No
team has advanced to the conference finals scoring that few goals
since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to score more goals,'' Hitchcock said. ``You can't
go along thinking your goalie can be the first star every night of
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in the end, Stars goalie Ed Belfour certainly was not. He
let in a soft goal from Wings center Sergei Fedorov at the 1:48
mark of the second period and that started the death knell.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Stars had come back from a 2-0 deficit before. But
this Stars team was tired. This team was injured, this team didn't
have the same experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very close, I don't think anyone is going out of here
thinking we were clearly outplayed,'' defenseman Darryl Sydor said.
``We played hard, we really thought we could win.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet they didn't. Maybe, they couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you've had your heart broken in this game, you really
don't know what you're missing out,'' said center Mike Modano, who
stood with his chin on his stick while his teammates were lining up
for the final handshake. ``You can talk to guys who have won it and
been there until in you're blue in the face. But until you
experience it yourself, it's hard to understand the words. You need
experience to learn and be better from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way,'' he added. ``But we've got a long way
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   As they walked out, the banners called to the Stars, telling
them to look ahead, not look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge price to pay, mentally, physically and
emotionally,'' Hitchcock said. ``And you can stand there and talk
about it and you can beat on it all you want. But until; you
experience it, until you understand the level of commitment that is
necessary, until you go through it, then all the talk really
doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Stars stopped talking, and started living.

BEST WISHES FLUTTER UPON DYING STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ When you wish upon a Star, alas, you have to take the
whole Star.
</P>
<P>
   The paucity of firepower. The ailing defensemen. The
suddenly-turned-sour power play. The goaltender who picked the
worst of times to blink.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will not live happily ever after, we discovered last
night. The Detroit Red Wings, the reigning kings, playing like
kings, snuffed the Stars' every precocious whim.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 months the Red Wings have carried the load of the Stanley
Cup on their shoulders. But in this series, abruptly concluded last
night with a 2-0 Wings victory, they wore it well.
</P>
<P>
   What a hockey team. What a deep and talented hockey team. What a
poised and well-coached hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars can take solace that they lost only by the misfortune
of a disputed goal and another that goalie Eddie Belfour should
have clutched, but didn't.
</P>
<P>
   But that's hockey. That's the playoffs. That's Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   If you're scoring along at home, that now makes eight teams in
the past nine seasons who have posted the league's best
regular-season record and then failed to win Lord Stanley's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   You can't sip champagne from the Presidents' Trophy. But maybe
in its reflection, the Stars will see themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A good team. At times, an outstanding one. And a short-handed
one, to be sure, for these past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the self-assured Red Wings, the Stars are a team that
still has to get over a hump _ the final hump.
</P>
<P>
   They missed leading scorer Joe Nieuwendyk dearly. But a Stanley
Cup wannabe can't point to ifs and buts until it figures a way to
win more than one of its last 20 games on its chief rival's ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of adversity _ injuries _ that we've been
dealing with all year long,'' defenseman Richard Matvichuk said.
``We lost Joe, and we had the best power play in the league during
the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Matvichuk's partner on defense, Derian Hatcher, said in
the quiet locker room, ``It doesn't really matter much now.''
</P>
<P>
   Around Hatcher, trunks were being packed for the final ride
home. When the end comes for a hockey team, it comes suddenly. When
it comes like it did last night, in front of 19,983 at Joe Louis
Arena, it leaves little but a loud ringing in the losers' ears.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars didn't even feel the urge to wring their hands over
the two goals that were scored. The first resembled a David
Copperfield trick, with Detroit's Larry Murphy suddenly
materializing _ when? From where? _ to take Darren McCarty's pass
for the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens all year long,'' defenseman Craig Ludwig said.
``I don't think any of us in here are going to dwell on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've still got to score a couple of goals to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The second Detroit goal allowed the Red Wings to blanket the
neutral zone and ride the clock to the end. More than anything,
though, it underscored the difference between the two goaltenders
in this conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Without Belfour, the Stars would have never seen Joe Louis Arena
in these playoffs. With him, they saw it only long enough to earn a
trip home.
</P>
<P>
   In the most vital Stars game of the postseason, Belfour was
roundly outperformed by counterpart Chris Osgood. The Wings goalie
incurred the wrath of the headline writers and the home fans for
the long-distance goal he allowed in overtime Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But, in truth, he outplayed Belfour in the series. The one game
that coach Ken Hitchcock thought Eddie could steal for the Stars
never came.
</P>
<P>
   As the clock ticked down to the final six minutes, the crowd at
``The Joe'' came to its feet, chanting, ``Oz-zie! Oz-zie!''
</P>
<P>
   You got the feeling that the Stars could have stayed here
another 60 minutes and still not scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Washington has got its hands full,'' the Stars' Mike
Modano predicted. ``I think these two teams were the best in the
league. Washington is pretty much going to be a whipping boy for
them, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Stars locker room carpeted in whispers, Red Wings
fans still howled and cheered. The Wings won all three games played
here during this conference final series.
</P>
<P>
   The message is obvious: Until the Stars say otherwise, the road
to any Stanley Cup has to pass through The Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is, until this series they were .500 at home
in the playoffs,'' Modano said. ``But if you expect to win a
Stanley Cup, you have to be good on the road. We have to win
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But like the power play that went sour and the goaltender that
flinched, those are questions that the Stars would pack in the
trunk and fly home with.
</P>
<P>
   Six months of glory ended with a thud. When you wish upon a
Star, you'll have to live with that.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The results of a precautionary examination
Rangers closer John Wetteland underwent yesterday afternoon will be
known today.
</P>
<P>
   But the naked eye revealed what the Rangers already suspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great,'' said Wetteland, who converted the 15th of 16
save opportunities this season in an 8-7 victory against the San
Diego Padres last night at The Ballpark in Arlington. ``There were
no problems. I wasn't even thinking about it in the bullpen
beforehand. I was just thinking about getting a good night's
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland and the Rangers may rest easy, but the Padres made it
uneasy in the ninth inning. Center fielder Steve Finley and pinch
hitter Mark Sweeney produced consecutive one-out singles against
the hard-throwing right-hander, and each advanced 90 feet on a
groundout by catcher Carlos Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   That brought shortstop Chris Gomez to the plate with two outs,
the potential tying run at third and the potential game-winning run
at second. Gomez, though, entered the confrontation against
Wetteland 0-for-3 with two strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Make that 0-for-4 with three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland required only four pitches to retire Gomez and to send
the Padres into a first-place tie with the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun to face a few hitters and compete,'' said
Wetteland, who combined for two innings of scoreless relief with
left-hander Scott Bailes and right-hander Danny Patterson. ``It's
been a while since everything was flowing. I wasn't locating my
fastball at all, but that's not abnormal for me. I didn't put the
pitches where I wanted, but my slider worked well for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers left-hander Darren Oliver took his best stuff to the
mound, but it is difficult to explain his performance. Oliver
matched his career-best with 10 strikeouts in pitching 62/3
innings, but he surrendered six runs on nine hits and one walk and
hit three Padres batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oliver had his best stuff all season,'' Rangers manager Johnny
Oates said. ``When I went to take him out, I looked at the
scoreboard and couldn't figure out how he allowed six runs. His
velocity, his movement and his location were the best they've been
all year, and his curveball was the best since the Yankees playoff
game in '96.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who received no decision, was also at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great, the best since the day game in Boston,'' said
Oliver, who surrendered only two runs in a complete-game effort May
3 in the Rangers' 2-1 defeat at Fenway Park. ``It's funny, though.
As good as I felt, I still gave up six runs. But when I wake up in
the morning, I'll be able to look in the mirror and know that I
pitched my best.''
</P>
<P>
   The infielder who drove in what proved to be the game-winning
run told all how well the Rangers and Padres played their first
interleague game of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Fernando Tatis, whose seventh-inning single off
Padres right-hander Donne Wall (2-2) scored shortstop Domingo
Cedeno with the winning run, promptly found himself the target of a
successful pickoff throw by Padres Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers received low marks for artistic value, but it proved
to be enough to beat the best the National League West could offer.
</P>
<P>
   The game included 28 hits, two errors, three batters hit by
pitch and a couple of mistakes on the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out on top of it,'' said Rangers first baseman Will
Clark, who went 2-for-5 and drove in the Rangers' first run with a
two-out, run-scoring single against Padres right-hander Kevin
Brown. ``That's all anybody cares about in here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers chased Brown, who entered the game with the National
League's eighth-best earned-run average at 2.27, after the fifth
inning. Brown, who also received no decision, allowed six runs on
11 hits and four walks. Every member of the Rangers' offensive
lineup collected at least one hit against Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, everyone contributed,'' Oates said. ``We were
patient against Kevin, and scored a few runs early. If you don't
score early against Kevin, you're not going to score at all.''

TOUGH GOING FOR A TRUE CHAMPION  
 LOTS OF BAD BREAKS FOR BOBBY ALLISON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobby Allison has wept more than one father should be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after a violent crash in a 1988 race at Pocono
International Raceway ended his career and nearly his life, Allison
buried son Clifford Allison, who was killed Aug. 13, 1992, in a
crash at Michigan International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The next summer, NASCAR Winston Cup star Davey Allison, Bobby's
oldest son, died from injuries suffered when the helicopter he was
piloting crashed on takeoff from the infield at Talladega (Ala.)
Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   Two sons. Two tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   More followed.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Allisons (Bobby and wife Judy) auctioned off
much of their personal property to help pay for Bobby's mounting
medical bills. Bobby Allison, who suffered a broken leg and a
concussion that left him mostly unconscious for two months, still
can't recall winning the 1988 Daytona 500 and also suffers from
additional memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the financial strain and the mental anguish of
losing two sons had an immeasurable impact on the elder Allisons'
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby and Judy separated in 1996 and no longer live in the same
state.
</P>
<P>
   The Allison saga has affected many, including Phoenix
International Raceway officials, who earlier this week announced a
new 5,000-seat grandstand being constructed in Turn 2 will bear
Bobby Allison's name.
</P>
<P>
   Four other grandstand sections are named after Richard Petty,
A.J. Foyt and Jimmy Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Allison is one of the classiest people I've ever met,''
said Dennis Wood, who formerly owned Phoenix International Raceway
and now is director of special projects. ``We could never do enough
to repay him for what he's meant to PIR. This is just one small way
of trying to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison clearly was moved by the gesture, readily approved by
International Speedway Corp., which purchased PIR from PIR
President Buddy Jobe last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's overwhelming,'' Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood only wished more could be done for one of stock car
racing's greatest drivers. Allison, who has 83 career wins and is a
member of racing's International Hall of Fame, was instrumental in
helping build PIR's popular Copper World Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best story I have of Bobby Allison is one that really says
a lot about who this man is,'' Wood said. ``I think it was 1982 and
Bobby called me from Hueytown (Ala.) and said they were having a
big ice storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm the only one in Hueytown with electricity,
there's 45 people living in my house and Judy's trying to make an
upside-down cake in the fireplace. Can I come to the Copper World
Classic?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now this is from someone who's already won one Daytona 500 and
he wants my permission to come out and race. He didn't want any
appearance money. He said, `I'll fly my airplane out there and have
my car towed.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison thought he would be returning home almost as soon as he
arrived, after suffering a blown motor in qualifying. Then, in a
last-chance race in an attempt to crack the starting grid, Allison
started last and was up to third when another car put him into the
wall and out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, `I can't believe this,' '' Wood recalled. `We
have the great Bobby Allison and he's not in the race. What am I
going to do?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But Bobby didn't want to be treated any differently than
anyone else. He was willing to go home, because in those days we
didn't have promoter's options. But we went to the drivers' meeting
and I asked them if Bobby could start last. I said, `If the vote
isn't 30-0 to let him in _ and Bobby agreed _ we won't allow it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The drivers let him in and Bobby personally thanked each one
of them. He's a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobe already knows that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have all those problems heaped on him, he's a lot better
man than I am,'' Jobe said. ``I don't know if I could have handled
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Allison blames no one.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if life has been fair, Allison said, ``I don't think life
has to be fair. And I don't think life is fair to a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had lots of good times. And I've had some bad times. At
least, I've had those good times and I have had an opportunity to
have those good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so I have to appreciate that rather than worry about
whether life has been fair to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true champion. &QL;

PROUD DAD CHEEVER RIDING HIGH  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   E &UR; ddie Cheever was in Rome at the moment another  &UR; Eddie Cheever
was crossing the finish line at the Indianapolis 500. They didn't
know it, but each raised a clenched fist into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Like father, like son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't surprise me he won,'' said the elder Cheever, the
younger Cheever's 70-year-old father. ``I thought he could have won
a couple of years ago, but someone took him out in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it. Indy is a lottery. Anything can happen. But
when (Eddie Jr.) finally won, it made me very, very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   The win also allowed Cheever Jr., a 40-year-old Phoenix native,
to fulfill a father's wish 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie wanted to quit high school when he was 15 or 16 to go
racing full-time,'' said Cheever Sr., reached by telephone Tuesday
in Rome. ``I didn't really object because he wasn't really getting
anything out of it. But I told him if he was going to win one race
in his life, win the Indy 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   The road to Indy actually began about 30 years ago in Rome, when
the Cheever matriarch purchased matching go-carts for her husband
and son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time either of us raced,'' Cheever Sr. said.
``Eddie became very good very quick. I crashed, hurt my shoulder
and that was the end of me.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years earlier the Cheevers still were living in
Phoenix. At the time, Cheever Sr., a former champion weightlifter
who was born in Globe and crowned Mr. Arizona in 1955, was managing
a string of health clubs.
</P>
<P>
   But the company went bankrupt in 1959, and the elder Cheever
decided to move the family to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself and four partners borrowed $25,000 and opened some
health clubs in Sydney,'' Cheever Sr. said. ``It was all new back
then. We were the pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, we moved to Italy when Eddie was about 4 and opened more
health clubs. I had one in Berlin and London, four in Milan, two in
Turin and one in Naples. They were all great locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have just two, but they're beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever Sr., however, never was too busy to keep up with his
oldest son's racing prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when we was just starting out, some important
person in the Italian racing business complimented Eddie one time
after a race,'' Cheever Sr. said. ``He said, `That kid knows what
he's doing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon, Eddie was on the Italian Racing Team driving with
Ricardo Patrese.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Cheever Jr. became so proficient he was offered a
full-time Formula One ride with Osella Ford in 1980. In 1983,
Cheever Jr. drove for Renault, and his teammate was the great
French driver Alain Prost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad for Eddie because the Renault team never let him
set the car up,'' Cheever Sr. said. ``They never let him take part
in the debriefing. I remember one time he passed Prost at Monte
Carlo and the crew held up a sign saying to let Prost go around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tired of the Formula One grind, where he didn't win in 132
career starts, Cheever Jr. returned to the United States in 1990 to
pursue an Indy car career. He remained winless until last year,
when he won at Walt Disney World Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   In that race, Cheever Jr. never led a green flag lap.
</P>
<P>
   At Indy two weeks ago, Cheever Jr. led more laps (76) than any
driver in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost couldn't watch the race those last few laps,''
Cheever Sr. said. ``I kept thinking something bad was going to
happen.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
One cup sugar, please &QL; 
 &QL; 
Car owner  &UR; Jonathan Byrd of Litchfield Park has replaced Indy
Racing League driver  &UR; Mike Groff with  &UR; John Paul Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't working,'' Byrd said. ``Sometimes, you have to
change the recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   Groff finished 14th last season and had his year interrupted
after suffering a broken leg in a crash at Texas Motor Speedway,
the site of tonight's race.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Double duty &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rookie IRL driver  &UR; J.J. Yeley of Phoenix is staying busy.
</P>
<P>
   He's in Memphis today to qualify for a U.S. Silver Crown race,
then returns to Texas for tonight's IRL race. Yeley is back in
Memphis on Sunday for the USAC race, then returns to Fort Worth,
where he will test for IRL car owner John Menard. &QL;

ANDERSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ It was one year ago, just before Game 2, when a
telephone ring jolted Shandon Anderson from the surreal world of
playing in the finals. Reality crashed down on him the moment he
was told that his father, Willie, had lost his six-year struggle
against cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While the Jazz played on and lost to the Bulls in Game 2,
Anderson dashed home to his family in Atlanta, Ga. He mourned and
cried and wondered why could not he have just a little more time
with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the finals, and that was supposed to be this great
time in your career,'' Anderson said before the Jazz fell to the
Bulls, 93-88, in Game 2 of the National Basketball Association
finals Friday night at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really tough time. As difficult as it was last year,
there's some comfort now. I know he's watching me.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was very visible Friday night. He was part of a bench
that went hand-in-hand with a supporting group of starters that
were ready to help their stars, Karl Malone and John Stockton, get
through Game 2. The Bulls' duo of Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen
were searching for a hand as well. Jordan and Pippen scored 54 of
their team's 85 points in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a two-man game in some respects,'' Jordan said. ``It
should have been more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a plea for help. And in the end, it was Steve Kerr who
came through. Kerr took an off-balance 3-point, missed but was not
blocked out. He got his own rebound, handed it to Jordan
underneath. He made the layup, was fouled, and hit the free throw
with 47 second left to give the Bulls an 88-86 lead.
</P>
<P>
   At first Toni Kukoc, who was a quiet starter in Game 1 with 9
points, came through for 13 first-half points. Kukoc cooled, but it
was the oddball Dennis Rodman who came through in the fourth. He
put down a rare jumper to tie the score at 74 to with 7 minutes 40
seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   That basket seemed to push the Bulls, who took a seven-point
lead. While Malone was flustered by Rodman's presence and was in
foul trouble, it was Bryon Russell who came into hit a 3-pointer to
score the first basket for the Jazz in 7 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a back-and-forth to see which auxiliary player could
provide the game-turning support in this game. After the Bulls took
a six-point lead, Anderson came in for a layup and a foul as he
barged inside with 3 minutes left. But he missed the free throw,
and the Jazz were down by four points. Anderson then drew the sixth
foul on Luc Longley with 2 minutes left. Anderson stood at the
free-throw line and hit both to pull the Jazz to within two points.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Anderson, joined by Howard Eisley on the floor,
quickly took advantage of the Bulls underneath in the first half.
Anderson muscled around whomever the Bulls could throw at him in
the second quarter and scored six consecutive points in the post.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the Jazz close to a Bulls' team that was getting much
more help from its supporting group as well. At least from Kukoc.
Malone and Stockton, have had much more aid from their auxiliary
players than the Bulls. That was evident in the third quarter, when
the Jazz went on a 11-0 run. There was Bryon Russell putting down a
3-pointer, and a limping Jeff Hornacek delivering runners.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the fourth quarter, Eisley, who was giving Stockton
a breather, sank a 3-pointer with 8 seconds left in the third to
give the Jazz a 73-70 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Every point was going to have an impact. And no one knew this as
much as Anderson. Last year, when he returned to the team for Games
5 and 6 last year, he was a bit bleary-eyed and distracted. In the
deciding Game 6, Anderson was on the floor in the closing minutes
of the close game. He was a rookie under pressure. And pressure can
make something as simple as one plus one turn into long division.
</P>
<P>
   He had an open layup. And he missed it. A few possessions later,
with the Jazz having an opportunity to take the lead, Anderson
caught a crafty pass from John Stockton in the paint. With Scottie
Pippen dashing in to block him, Anderson maneuvered around and was
in position for another layup. Another miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to make it a personal thing, but I really want to
have a good finals this year,'' Anderson said. ``You go through
hard things, and there is a lot of hurt. But then you have some
peace of mind. Last year is over. I know that now I have a second
chance.''

MOM PACKS MEAN PUNCH  
 TUCSON BOXER MIXES FAMILY, WORK, SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The teacher called the student's home because she didn't believe
the third-grader. Lionel Salazar was telling stories about his mom.
Said Mom was a boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I am,'' said Lailani Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, and the teacher once knocked out Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the teacher my son wasn't lying, that I really was a
fighter,'' Salazar said. ``But nobody would believe me, so I had to
go to the school and show the kids some of my videotapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Show-and-tell proved to be a huge victory for Salazar. That's no
surprise to anybody who knows her. Effective combinations of the
unlikely are her speciality.
</P>
<P>
   Although no longer a novelty, a woman in the traditionally male
domain of professional boxing is still unusual, especially if the
woman is a mother of three with cake decoration as a trade and a
background that is equal parts Polynesian and desert-Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Lailani Salazar of Tucson is that woman.
</P>
<P>
   She is half-Hawaiian. She was born in Tucson, where her father
was stationed with the Air Force. She sometimes works as a model.
She has appeared in at least one televised ad.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband also run a business that specializes in
weddings. She decorates the cakes, which her opponents probably
wish she threw in their faces instead of punches. She is as precise
and disciplined in the ring as she is diverse out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love boxing,'' said Salazar, 24, who was scheduled to
fight Saturday night at Las Vegas. ``I enjoy the physical contact.
It's hard to explain, I guess. For me it's a stress reliever. But
it's also something I like more and more as I do it. It's like
giving a child some ice cream for the first time. One taste, and
they want more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   The 119-pound Salazar, winner of her first two pro bouts by
knockout at the Valley's Midnight Rodeo, represents the latest wave
of young women to attempt pro boxing. During the couple of years
since Christy Martin landed on the cover of`` Sports Illustrated''
after a bout on the undercard of a Mike Tyson victory, women in the
pro ring have become as regular a sight as blood and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   The circus aspect is beginning to vanish, although skepticism
re-emerged in New York a few days ago when a Martin opponent, Maria
de las Nievas-Garcia of Mexico, was disqualified because she was 21
weeks pregnant, a first in ringside medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, there are heightened expectations for proficient
skills in an often brutal pursuit. In many ways, Salazar reflects
the new businesslike approach. First and foremost, she's a fighter.
Smart girl. Punches know no gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing it simply because I love it,'' said Salazar, who
follows Yvonne Trevino of Peoria as the second woman from Arizona
to try pro boxing. ``A lot of women look at it as a man's sport but
that, `Hey, you can do it. Hooray for you.' But I really don't look
at it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Salazar said there was some skepticism, if not
resistence, a couple of years ago when she decided to give-up
kick-boxing for the more traditional style, which she favors
because she says it demands more athletic skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, my husband (Lionel Sr.) said, `You're crazy. You
can't do that,'' said Salazar, who last year emerged as one of the
nation's best female amateurs while training in Tucson for Hank
McCadden, a former New York welterweight. ``But I told him, `Oh
yeah. Well, you watch me.' He still worries. But now he supports me
in every way because he knows how stubborn I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she's stubborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father figures I can make it in boxing, and he always says
it's because of the Hawaiian in me,'' said Salazar, who started in
karate and other martial arts when she was at Sunnyside High
School. ``A lot of people always say, `Oh, you're going to ruin
your face.' Stuff like that. But my father says, `No, not if it's
really in your heart.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar has a nickname, ``Kekoa.'' What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``Woman warrior,'' said the Arizona-born fighter with
combinations that have convinced at least two professional
opponents and a class of third graders. &QL;

COYOTES WON'T RAISE TICKET PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Phoenix Coyotes confirmed Friday they will not raise ticket
prices for the 1998-99 season, their third in Arizona, but that
doesn't mean the team is content with its financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes officials said they can't make money under their current
lease at America West Arena, which runs for three more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The team raised ticket prices an average of almost 9 percent
last season, but owner Richard Burke and team President Shawn
Hunter said it's unfair to continue to ask the fans to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our most valuable asset as an organization is our fans,''
Hunter said. ``In just a very short time, Coyotes fans have
demonstrated an unequaled level of passion and enthusiasm for their
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are unhappy with their lease at America West Arena
and the 4,300 obstructed-view hockey seats in the facility. Because
those seats have to be sold at a discount, Burke said, the cost of
other seats is higher than it normally should be.
</P>
<P>
   The average price of a Coyotes ticket will be $36, which is less
than the 1997-98 NHL average of about $41. Ticket prices will range
from $9.50 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Coyotes, the City of Phoenix and the arena
are studying a plan to renovate the arena. It would involve moving
the ice, knocking out a wall of the lower bowl and installing an
innovative seat design, which could be changed to accommodate
basketball and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   The design would eliminate the obstructed-view seats. If that
happens, Burke has said, it's possible the price of some of the
other hockey seats could be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   But the renovation plans are far from being approved. No one is
sure how much it would cost, although the price tag figures to be
at least $20 million. No one is sure how to pay for it, and no one
is sure how long the arena would have to be shut down during
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation could take parts of at least two summers to
complete, but construction likely would interfere with the arena's
summer tenants, the Rattlers of the Arena Football League and the
Mercury of the WNBA. It also could disrupt other events, such as
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope to settle on a renovation plan by the end of this
summer and then spend the coming months figuring out the costs and
how to pay for it. &QL;

CARDINALS WILL BENEFIT IF CHARGERS FALTER AGAIN  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody in the Cardinals organization will come right out and say
it, but officials are hoping the Bolts turn out to be dolts this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Each loss by the San Diego Chargers will be cheered because the
Cardinals own the Chargers' first-round draft pick for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   With a rookie quarterback (Ryan Leaf), the Chargers, 4-12 last
season, are expected to struggle and finish last again in the AFC
West. But the Chargers could be worse than imagined _ it's not
possible they could have the top pick in the draft next year, is
it? _ after trading their best offensive player of a year ago, wide
receiver Tony Martin, to Atlanta last Wednesday for a second-round
draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   Can you name the five Chargers wide receivers?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a hint: three of them weren't in the NFL last year.
</P>
<P>
   The three in question are Webster Slaughter, Tyrone Brown and
rookie Mikhael Ricks. The others are Brian Still and Charlie Jones,
who combined for one touchdown a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Take away Slaughter, who was out of football last season, and
the Chargers have a combined career total of five scoring grabs.
General Manager Bobby Beathard, who has traded away his '99 and
2000 first-round picks, acknowledges he has taken a big risk by
trading away Martin, who had 14 touchdown receptions in 1996.
(Martin didn't endear himself to Kevin Gilbride when he criticized
the rookie head coach last year).
</P>
<P>
   So now the Chargers are left with their motley receiving corps,
and until Leaf is ready to start, they could line up with Craig
Whelihan at quarterback. Super Bowl champion Denver must be scared.
Kansas City coaches, who have possibly the best defense in the NFL,
are going to stay up late worrying about how to stop the Chargers'
attack.
</P>
<P>
   But the big winners could be the Cardinals, who could have
another top-five pick, if the Chargers are as bad as they appear on
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Who would you want?
</P>
<P>
   Texas running back Ricky Williams, Ohio State linebacker Andy
Katzenmoyer or Wisconsin offensive tackle Aaron Gibson, a
380-pounder? Imagine this scenario: Quarterbacks Brock Huard of
Washington, Tim Couch of Kentucky or Daunte Culpepper of Central
Florida are available when the Cardinals/Chargers are to pick.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? How about trading down for a second-round 1999
pick, a first-rounder in 2000 and two players? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Slim pickings &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The June 1 date has come and gone without much talent set free.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Vinny Testaverde, released by the Baltimore Ravens,
is the best available free agent and likely will end up in
Cincinnati or Oakland. Offensive tackle Greg Skrepenak, cut loose
by Carolina, is an intriguing prospect who could help the
Cardinals, but he has priced himself out of the market. If you like
players with heavy baggage, middle linebackers Bryan Cox and Robert
Jones are available.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are cornerbacks Larry Brown, a bust with the Raiders
after being the Most Valuable Player in Super Bowl XXX at Sun Devil
Stadium, and Donnell Woolford, whose game has slipped.
</P>
<P>
   There still could be some good players cut _ linebackers Eddie
Robinson and Terry Wooden, wide receivers Horace Copeland and
Willie Green and cornerback Terry McDaniel. But those who predicted
a bonanza of talent to become free in June were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Teams haven't had to dump players because few are having
salary-cap problems, with the cap having gone up to $54.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, for instance, still are $7.612 million under the
cap, but $4.3 million of that is to sign draft picks. Only one
other team, Cincinnati, at $9.345 million, has more money
available. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nice and slow &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers won't let future Hall of Fame receiver Jerry Rice make
the same mistake.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to come back from knee surgery in 3{ months last
December but reinjured the knee and missed the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Rice showed up at minicamp last week but was
held out of most drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to do a little more, but Steve (Coach Steve
Mariucci) is being very cautious, and he's really driving me crazy,
too, because I believe in practicing and getting yourself ready,''
Rice said. ``I have no choice. Steve's controlling everything. If
it was left up to me, I would probably take the same approach (as
the last time).''
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to by 100 percent by the start of the regular
season in September. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cracks in the foundation &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe America has grown tired of the team from the Dairyland,
the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Only 5,000 fans in Jackson, Miss., bought tickets for an August
preseason game against the New Orleans Saints, so the game is being
moved to another location in the South. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Facing reality &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Broncos quarterback John Elway returning for his 15th
season, third-year pro Jeff Lewis is accepting the possibility he
might spend the entire season on injured reserve or the first six
weeks on the physically unable to perform list.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the Horizon High School and Northern Arizona product,
suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in a pickup basketball
game last February in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos don't need him this season. They have Bubby Brister,
Doug Nussmeier and rookie Brian Griese to back up Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of time to think about this,'' Lewis said.
``The bottom line is I want to be here this year. If it comes down
to competing for a job (in 1999), then that's fine. You'd get a
year to come back, and then I'd come back bigger, faster and
stronger.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at Towson (Md.) State was pleased that Baltimore
owner Art Modell was the speaker for the school's commencement
exercises. Wrote Todd Jacobson, sports editor of the school paper:
``Are jealousy and greed the characteristics Towson has tried to
instill in its graduates? No, but their last act at Towson will be
hearing a man with no conscience lecture them on what it is like to
be in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   When the bumbling Ravens cut Testaverde, they sent him a letter
they incorrectly dated May 5, 1997. He received the letter on May
31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Bradshaw, Raiders director of marketing, is tired of the
bad publicity the team gets because of gangs wearing the team's
gear. ``I get really sick of turning on ``America's Most Wanted''
or ``Cops'' and seeing someone wearing our stuff being busted.'' &QL;

FIREFIGHTER IS KILLED BATTLING BLAZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One firefighter was killed, another critically
injured and at least four others hurt Friday night in a five-alarm
fire that consumed a city-owned apartment building in Brooklyn, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began at 8:20 p.m. in the back of the wood-frame
structure at 2530 Atlantic Ave. at the corner of Hinsdale Street in
the East New York section, fire officials said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they could not yet determine the cause of the
fire, but residents said that workers had been at the house earlier
in the day to repair a gas boiler. While it was unclear Friday
night whether the work was linked to the fire, residents said the
fire started in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   None of the firefighters' names were released Friday night, as
family members and city officials, including Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, gathered at the three hospitals where the firefighters
were being treated.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Brian Dixon said early Friday that a firefighter who had
been taken to Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn had died.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters on the scene reported immense flames leaping out
the windows of the three-story building.
</P>
<P>
   The first crew entered with hose and nozzle when firefighters
outside witnessed a flash. They were uncertain whether it was a gas
explosion, a ceiling collapse that spewed embers or some other
calamity.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, firefighters were dragging out injured men, some
with severe burns, others with lungs laced with smoke and still
others with head and neck damage.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Richard Pagona of the Fire Department said that four other
attached buildings had been damaged by the fire and that the
ceiling and top floors had collapsed in the building where the
firefighters were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze quickly leapt to the neighboring wood-frame row
houses, and within minutes, 225 firefighters using 52 ladder
trucks, engines and ambulances were battling the flames from the
exterior.
</P>
<P>
   The flames were extinguished by 10:45 p.m., fire officials said.
But not before they exacted a high toll.
</P>
<P>
   The six firefighters were injured inside the building while
fighting the blaze. Besides Brookdale Hospital, the injured were
taken to New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan and
Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   At Cornell, one firefighter was in critical condition with burns
to his face, hands and legs; another was listed in stable condition
with burns to his face, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Another firefighter, also in critical condition, was taken to
Jacobi to be put in a hyperbaric chamber, which is used to treat
victims of severe smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   At Cornell Medical Center Friday night, officials said the
firefighters' bunker gear, heavy protective suits designed to
shield firefighters from flame and severe heat, had remained
intact.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that the heat may have been so intense that
firefighters were burned by their own perspiration, boiling inside
the suits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of the other firefighters at Brookdale Hospital, said Ruth L.
Richman, a spokeswoman for the hospital, one man suffered head and
neck injuries when a ceiling partially collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   He was in stable condition, Ms. Richman said, but he could not
be moved because of the nature of spinal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The building, two blocks south of the sprawling Cemetery of the
Evergreens, is city-owned, said Lizzy Pearl Warren, who has lived
there for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Warren lives on the third floor with her adult children, and
her daughter Casandra lives on the second floor with two young
sons. The first floor is a vacant restaurant space.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Hester, 31, a friend of the family who lives nearby, said
that the city had recently renovated the house, installing new
stairs, doors, windows and walls.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the boiler had been acting up. ``The gas company
was here all day,'' Ms. Hester said. ``They left and the building
caught on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   That is when the injuries occurred, the firefighters said,
asking that their names not be used.
</P>
<P>
   There were no fire doors, and the walls did not appear to retard
the fire, firefighters said. They questioned whether the city-owned
building was up to fire code.
</P>
<P>
   The family members escaped unharmed, and as investigators picked
through the rubble Friday night, orange embers could still be seen
burning along the roof line and the smell of charcoal hung in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Warren was asleep when the fire broke out, but by the
time firefighters from Engine Company 233 and Ladder 103 arrived on
the scene just minutes later, the wood-fed flames were roaring out
of the windows and the heat warped the air like a fun-house mirror,
witnesses reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother called me out,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, another nine firefighters suffered minor
injuries in a blaze at a waste transfer station at 123 Varick St.
</P>
<P>
   The flames were noticed at 6:15 p.m., Cillo said. The
firefighters were taken to Brookdale Hospital with minor injuries.
The fire was pronounced under control but was still being
extinguished late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Raymond Nakovics, 49, a firefighter for 27 years, died
after having a heart attack at the scene of a fire at a Manhattan
apartment house.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, Louis Valentino, 37, was killed when the roof
of an auto body shop in Brooklyn collapsed on him as he searched
for people inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   His death was the third in a six-week period in 1996. The
unusual string of on-duty deaths in the Fire Department began when
a firefighter fell through the floor of an abandoned house in
Queens that the police said was being used by squatters and drug
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, another firefighter died in an apartment fire,
also in Queens.

DODGERS SHUT OUT IN SEATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Dodgers talked to the Seattle Mariners all week,
but when it finally came time to meet, they never showed.
</P>
<P>
   Their 4-0 loss to the Mariners in front of 39,053 on Friday
night at the Kingdome was less about their failed attempt to
acquire left-hander Randy Johnson than it was a miserable showing
after one of their most inspired victories of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Against Billy Swift and particularly reliever Mike Timlin, the
Dodgers got just two batters to third base. On Thursday, they left
home after coming from behind to defeat St. Louis and thought all
the distractions were over.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they can only hope it doesn't happen today when the two
teams play again in front of a national TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   This is supposed to be one of the marquee interleague matchups
in baseball. Instead, the Mariners raised their record to 3-0
against the Dodgers at home.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason was the Mariners' bullpen, which like the Dodgers,
is the club's weak spot. But after Timlin took over for Swit (5-3)
with one in the seventh, he worked out of a bases-loaded situation
then retired the Dodgers in order in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Heathcliff Slocumb pitched a perfect ninth as the Dodgers fell
to 29-31, 7{ games behind San Diego and now San Francisco, which
moved into a tie for first place.
</P>
<P>
   Swift breezed through the first six innings, but allowed a
single to Jim Eisenreich to open the seventh. Charles Johnson
followed with a base hit to left, putting runners at first and
second. After left-fielder Thomas Howard struck out, Eric Young
singled to center, but Eisenreich was held at third.
</P>
<P>
   In came Timlin, who had blown four of five save opportunities
and retired just 16 of the 28 first batters he has faced. This was
the guy who the Mariners got for top prospect Jose Cruz, Jr. last
season and there were quite a few boos when he entered the game.
</P>
<P>
   But he struck out Jose Vizcaino then retired Gary Sheffield on a
grounder to third to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who had a single and a double, was ahead in the count
3-1 and thought he had a walk on a Timlin breaking ball up. As
Sheffield walked to first, home plate umpire Marty Foster called
the pitch a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later, the Mariners were out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Ismael Valdes (4-7) lost, but didn't have much
support. The middle of the order, Eric Karros, Raul Mondesi and
Bobby Bonilla were a combined 0 for 11.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who moved from first base to designated hitter in the
American League park, had a chance to give the Dodgers an early
lead when he came up with runners and first and third and one out
in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Karros had six RBI in his previous two games, but he popped out
to second, setting the tone for the rest of the night. His
nine-game hitting streak ended.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who lost here 8-2 last June to Sunday's starter Jamie
Moyer, went 71/3 innings, allowing nine hits and three earned runs,
three walks and four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers came into the Kingdome after a zany week of trades,
non trades, and general mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   They thought a chance to get out of town would help, especially
after scoring all three of their runs against St. Louis with two
outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, going on the road was probably the best thing right
now,'' manager Bill Russell said. ``We had a good win on Thursday
and we're confident that it will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't start that way on this night as the Dodgers fell
behind 2-0 in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui opened by reaching on a fielding error by Bobby
Bonilla at third and later scored on a single to left by Glenallen
Hill. Rob Ducey, who reached on a fielder's choice, scored on a
base hit by catcher Dan Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes settled down until the fifth when Joey Cora opened with a
triple and later scored on a single by Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes quickly got in trouble in the sixth when Ducey opened
with a double to the gap in right-center and moved to third on
Hill's fly ball to right.
</P>
<P>
   With Ducey breaking for home on the pitch, Wilson squeezed a
bunt in the air toward the third base line. Valdes dove for the
ball but dropped it as Ducey scored.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 6:
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago New York City police officers attending a
convention in Washington brought shame on their city when they
trashed their hotels, harassed other guests and cavorted, drunk and
naked, in public. Now New York firefighters have replicated this
behavior at home, staging a rampage at a restaurant in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The outrageous behavior occurred on Wednesday night at the
Bryant Park Grill behind the New York Public Library. The day had
begun as a celebration of heroism in which Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
praised the firefighters as ``greater heroes than the Yankees'' and
cited two officers for valor in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Between 50 and 100 firefighters ended up afterward at the Bryant
Park restaurant, where many of them drank heavily for hours, their
moods growing uglier as the evening advanced. The firemen urinated
publicly, exposed themselves, ran through a women's restroom and
bloodied each other in violent fights. Patrons ran for cover, and
the restaurant's managers stood by terrified, fearful of being
harmed if they intervened.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters were in uniform, leaving no question about
their identity. But althought there were several witnesses to this
behavior, the only person immediately arrested was the restaurant's
bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the police officers' brawl in Washington
was slow off the mark and took almost a year to run its course.
Giuliani and Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen will need to do
better than that to quell public outrage. The firefighters who
participated in this latest brawl need to learn swiftly that
drunken hooliganism is a career-ending offense.

Jordan &AMP; Co. ratchet up heat 
as Jazz goes cold in 4th period
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ The mystique. The magic. The Michael. They were
all back in force for the Chicago Bulls on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Swatting away speculation they have lost their reputation as
crunch-time kings, the Bulls leveled the NBA Finals at a win apiece
as Michael Jordan scored 37 points to anchor a 93-88 victory over
the Utah Jazz at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan converted a go-ahead three-point play with 47.9 seconds
left, saving the Bulls from falling into a 2-0 hole, something they
never have faced in a Finals series.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz, which went seven minutes at the start of the fourth
quarter without a basket, shot just 4-for-15 in the final period,
had seven turnovers and surrendered six crucial offensive rebounds
to the Bulls, which they turned into eight key points.
</P>
<P>
   None was bigger than Steve Kerr's retrieval of his missed
3-pointer with 49 seconds left, his first rebound of the series.
Kerr then quickly shoveled the ball to Jordan, who scored from
point-blank range and was fouled by John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   The free throw put Chicago up 88-86, and after Karl Malone
missed from 20 feet, Kerr hit two free throws with 14.5 seconds
left to clinch it.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the Bulls served notice their dynasty, while
wobbling, is far from crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always felt that way,'' Jordan said. ``People talk about
our age or whatever, but we're here. I've always believed in what
we can accomplish. You don't become champs five times without
having some type of mental advantage. We certainly are mentally
strong to defend what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz knew it could put itself in a commanding position with
a win. But Utah allowed the Bulls to grab control of the game
early, and its fourth-quarter problems doomed the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got outhustled,'' said Utah's Jeff Hornacek, who
had a team-high 20 points. ``They're still the champs until
somebody beats them. We knew they'd come out not wanting to go down
2-0. We didn't respond to that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls' trademark moxie had been questioned after their loss
in Game 1, but they came back with a vengeance, making all the
crucial plays down the stretch, particularly on defense and in the
rebounding department.
</P>
<P>
   Utah was awful in the first seven minutes of the fourth quarter.
The Jazz scored just one point on its first nine possessions of the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, it had trouble getting the ball. Chicago grabbed four
offensive rebounds in the first nine minutes of the fourth and
turned those extra possessions into six crucial points.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman, who did a superb job of battling Malone all
night, got a pair of offensive boards, and Toni Kukoc got two.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls weren't exactly lighting up the scoreboard, but they
did outscore the Jazz 11-1 to go up 81-74 with 5:10 to play. Utah
finally got its first basket of the quarter when Bryon Russell
canned a 3-pointer with five minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago kept the lead at four or six points until Jordan
uncharacteristically missed consecutive shots as he tried to work
his magic. After he missed a fadeaway, the ensuing fast break led
to two free throws by Shandon Anderson, which cut the lead to
85-83.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan then missed a post-up from 12 feet, and the Jazz took the
lead with Hornacek's 3-pointer with 1:46 left.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the crowd was at an eardrum-breaking level.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls opened the door further when Kukoc and Scottie Pippen
missed, but Stockton threw away the ball with just more than a
minute left.
</P>
<P>
   That set up the heroics by Jordan and Kerr, who combined to
score Chicago's final eight points.
</P>
<P>
   After Jordan's three-point play, Utah couldn't get a good shot
and Malone had to fling up a 20-foot prayer that had no chance of
going in. Rodman rebounded and called time out with 23.4 seconds
left. Kerr's free throws clinched it with 14.5 ticks to go.
</P>
<P>
   Utah knew this would not be a repeat of Game 1, when it got away
with some crummy basketball and still managed to go up 1-0 in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know,'' Stockton said after that game, ``that we're going
to have to play a whole lot better to beat this team in Game 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton couldn't have known how right he would be.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls came out with a tenacity on their offensive end that
made them look like a different team than the one that shot 41.5
percent in Game 1, including 3-for-16 (18.8 percent) from 3-point
range.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was getting into the paint whenever he wanted, and Jordan
was his usual self.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls were better because of people such as Kukoc and
Luc Longley, who had lively stretches, particularly during the
first half. A pair of Longley baskets sandwiched around a 3-pointer
by Scott Burrell put Chicago in front 36-30.
</P>
<P>
   On Utah's end, things were out of sync. Chris Morris missed an
uncontested layup after Antoine Carr made perhaps the best pass he
can make, over the shoulder to the cutting Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Plays like that tend to haunt a team. And the Jazz stammered
along throughout the first half, which ended with Chicago up 50-46.
</P>
<P>
   If not for some spirited play by Greg Ostertag, who had seven
points and three rebounds in just six second-quarter minutes, the
Jazz might have been worse off than it was.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, the Delta Center crowd was sitting on its hands,
fearing _ expecting, perhaps _ a letdown by the Jazz after the Game
1 win.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan slammed with 6:30 left in the third quarter, Utah
was in a 61-53 hole, the Bulls' biggest lead of the game. Utah
looked to be cooked.
</P>
<P>
   But things changed. In a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Longley had picked up his fourth and fifth fouls early in the
third period, and, though it took awhile, the Jazz took advantage,
starting with a pair of Malone free throws with 5:42 left in the
third after Rodman fouled him.
</P>
<P>
   It was the start of an 11-0 blitz by the Jazz. After Malone's
free throws, Russell knocked in a wide-open 3-pointer from the
right corner. Suddenly, the crowd came alive.
</P>
<P>
   After Stockton stripped Kerr, Hornacek buried a trey in
transition. The Bulls were busy missing three shots and committing
two turnovers, which was enough of an opening to put Utah up 64-61
with less than four minutes left in the third frame.
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek had his best quarter in at least two playoff series,
hitting four of five shots in the third for 10 points. And Howard
Eisley saw to it the Jazz finished off the period strong. He scored
the Jazz's last seven points, including a 3-pointer with 8.9
showing on the clock that sent Utah into the fourth quarter up
73-70. &QL;

Kerr's late heroics provide 
atonement for Game 1 sins
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ For the better part of two days, Steve Kerr had
gotten more air time than the cast of Seinfeld. He showed up in
every replay of John Stockton's triumphant runner at the end of
Game 1. He had the very best view in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr was the poor sap with the desperately flailing arms up in
the air and the hopeless look painted all over his face.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, as the clock again ticked down inside the final
minute Friday night, the game _ and maybe the balance of the NBA
Finals _ wound up once more staring Kerr in the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it is in sports. At the most hurtful times, the
spotlight will always manage to find you.
</P>
<P>
   But things change in the space of a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, Kerr was the defibrillator who brought the Bulls back
to life. He didn't score a field goal in the fourth quarter. He
merely saved the game.
</P>
<P>
   First, Kerr climbed right back on the horse who was Stockton,
practically getting inside his skin as Utah tried to protect a
one-point lead in the final minute. He got nose-to-nose,
chin-to-chin on defense and eventually forced an uncharacteristic
turnover from Stockton as Toni Kukoc picked off a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr then raced across midcourt and received the ball. He
fearlessly pulled up on the fast break and fired up a 3-pointer. It
missed. But then, Kerr did what every kid who ever played the game
is always told to do by every coach from the first time he walks
onto the floor. He followed his own shot.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr grabbed the offensive rebound _ his only rebound of these
first two games _ and then slipped a pass inside to Michael Jordan
for a layup and a three-point play with 48 seconds to go that put
the Bulls in front for good.
</P>
<P>
   It was instant atonement. A turnaround that hit with the
swiftness of a lightning bolt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Kerr's play killed us,'' Utah's Jeff Hornacek said.
``Just killed us.''
</P>
<P>
   And so what could have been a difficult uphill battle for the
Bulls going back to Chicago turned into a 93-88 Bulls victory and a
1-1 split in the series.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it so often turns out for playoff teams that have to
face the Bulls. They spend so much time and so much effort and so
much energy trying to throw a rope around Jordan and Scottie Pippen
that one of the other guys slips through the cracks to make the big
play.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr did it a year ago in the Bulls' title-clinching Game 6
victory over the Jazz, stepping outside to hit the winning basket
on a pass from Jordan. Way back in 1991, at the beginning of the
Chicago championship run, John Paxson hit the big jumpers that
wrapped up the Bulls' first title over the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have faith in Steve Kerr,'' Jordan said. ``We have faith in
all of the guys that we put out there on the floor. You have to
deal with all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan finished with 37 points, but it took him 33 shots to get
there. Pippen finished with 21 points but was quiet for most of the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when the Jazz let the home-court advantage slip away,
it was Kerr and another supporting cast member by the name of
Dennis Rodman who turned the whole thing around for the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   While Kerr's Game 1 nightmare was being replayed on TVs all
around Salt Lake City, Rodman was drawing attention and criticism
for his late-night jaunt to Las Vegas after the loss. His
Weirdness' escapades at the Hard Rock Hotel Casino, where he played
with $1,000 chips into the wee hours, were detailed. Here were the
Finals, and here was Rodman being a distraction again.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until the second half, when he grabbed all of his nine
rebounds, tossed in a key jumper from the top of the key and tied
up Karl Malone in knots with his active defense. The Mailman spent
another night in the dead-letter office, shooting only 5-for-16
from the field. Malone has shot 14-for-41 and scored a total of 37
points in two games, and now the Jazz goes to Chicago with the
situation turned around.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr knows all about that. He had to deal with the images left
over from Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, John Stockton is one of the greatest point guards ever to
play the game,'' he said. ``I didn't lose any sleep over that play.
I made him take a tough shot, and he made it. I went home and slept
fine. And I'll sleep fine again tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that 3-point shot, I knew Karl Malone was in front of me
and that he didn't really want to come out that far and guard me.
Taking 3s is my main job, so I took the shot. It felt good. I
thought it was in. But when it didn't, I went to the boards and
grabbed the rebound. As soon as I got it, I saw Michael underneath.
Actually, it was a very easy play. It felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   Atonement usually does.

BULLS YANK UTAH BACK TO EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ After beating the Los Angeles Lakers four
straight games, then opening the NBA Finals with a win over the
Chicago Bulls _ making for a 3-0 record this season against the
champs _ the Utah Jazz were flying at sufficient altitude to be
offered headsets to watch the movie.
</P>
<P>
   But after one brief moment of turbulence Friday night, the Jazz
and their fans are pinned to the ceiling, screaming.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it works in the NBA playoffs. Please stay buckled
up. You never know.
</P>
<P>
   From a fourth quarter in which they missed 11 of 15 shots and
committed seven turnovers, the Jazz not only lost Game 2, 93-88,
but all the supposed advantages that created the best chance in
years for a Western foe to finally topple the Bulls' empire.
</P>
<P>
   The series goes back to Chicago 1-1 with an opportunity for the
reinvigorated Bulls, despite all of their fatigue, controversies,
suspicions, age and hair colors, to do in the Jazz without a return
to the Delta Center earache salon.
</P>
<P>
   While that might not be possible, the odds do go in the Bulls'
favor if the Jazz cannot convince their star, Karl Malone, to
remove his ballerina outfit and slap on the tool belt and hard hat.
</P>
<P>
   Malone had a second straight game of uncharacteristic delicacy,
missing 11 of 16 shots, nearly all of the errant tosses from
outside. He missed all four field-goal attempts in the mess the
Jazz made of the fourth quarter, never once taking his mammoth self
hard to the hole where he would draw fouls and create mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   After a mediocre first game, Malone continues to squander the
Jazz's great opportunity. He is the first to admit it, more manful
in his post-game discourse than he was against the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any excuses,'' he said after a 16-point night
that was a dozen below his average. ``There's a lot of things I
could have done. I take responsibility for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on these shoulders, and when I don't do it, I face the
firing squad, which is you guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it isn't merely reporters lining up with shots. If
Malone continues his timidity, it will evoke images of his mediocre
Finals of a year ago, as well as his shortcomings against the
Sonics in the 1996 Western finals.
</P>
<P>
   The mail simply isn't getting delivered in June, which would be
a wretched legacy for an otherwise remarkable career.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Utah can win with Malone playing this way, Malone owned
up: ``No. Point-blank, no. We will not win this series if I don't
play better.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of certitude would be even more impressive if it came
while he was in shorts instead of street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   There was more at work Friday night than Malone's shortcomings,
principally a tepid first quarter for Utah that restored the Bulls'
resolve after four consecutive road losses in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was decided in the first part,'' said Utah coach
Jerry Sloan. ``When (Toni) Kukoc drove around us and went to the
basket, that tells you we weren't ready to compete. I don't like
losing, but I hate to see guys not competing. We came out very
soft, and they were the aggressors.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was that contrast more evident than the fourth-quarter
disposition of the club's stars. While Malone, burdened with fouls,
was passive, Michael Jordan demanded the ball and slashed to the
basket, sometimes recklessly but always knowing he would create
something.
</P>
<P>
   He scored seven consecutive points for an 83-77 Chicago lead
with four minutes remaining. Even though he forced up bricks on two
straight possessions that allowed the Jazz to take a temporary
lead, his continued pressure forced the Jazz to make all sorts of
compensations. Meanwhile, the Bulls could leave Dennis Rodman alone
on Malone, without repercussions because the big guy was content
with jump shots that have deserted him this week.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive moment came just inside one minute, when
fast-breaking Bulls reserve guard Steve Kerr missed a pull-up trey
over Malone, then scooted around him for the rebound, which he
dished to Jordan for a lay-in and free throw that made for an 88-86
lead that was good to go to Chi-town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Karl in front of me, and I didn't think he wanted to
come out to me,'' said Kerr, admittedly surprised to find himself
in the game's pivot point. ``The rebound happened to bounce my way.
I don't think Karl expected me there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many things were unexpected in that fourth quarter, mostly
because the Jazz had won 60 consecutive games in which they led
entering the final period. They showed in Game 1 they have
sufficient moxie to match the Bulls clutch for clutch. But they
went the first seven minutes without a field goal, a profound
drought against a club as resourceful as the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's semi-stupor was partly attributable to Rodman, who
shook off his own Vegas-induced daze in the first half to come up
with nine boards in the second half as well as push Malone to the
perimeter and the Jazz to their discomfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm content with the perimeter,'' said Malone.
``All year I make those jump shots. (Missing them) comes at a
(expletive) time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could make a lot of excuses, but I can't. I didn't
play well the first two games. We got away with the first one,
tonight we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the salt flats there sits a big pile of mail,
undelivered.

DODGERS' VALDES PROVES SKID-STOPPER FOR MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   For a few brief hours on Tuesday, Ismael Valdes was a Mariner in
somebody's fantasy league. Friday night, he was an unwelcome
Kingdome guest, shoved out the door with a 4-0 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   He got the Seattle club turned around, and didn't have to switch
uniforms. He simply served up run-scoring hits to Glenallen Hill
and Dan Wilson (twice) and came in second-best on the mound to
Billy Swift.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome helped ease the strain for the Mariners, ending
their four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of our better games of the year, if not the
best,'' Mariner manager Lou Piniella concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, allegedly the focal part of a Dodger trade package for
Randy Johnson that was widely splashed across the Internet but left
on the table, probably doesn't know what to believe anymore. He
didn't relocate to the Pacific Northwest. And Friday, there was a
rare Mariner bullpen sighting.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting Swift's handiwork, Mike Timlin pulled his team out of
a one-out, bases-loaded jam in the seventh with nary a drop of
blood spilled. Timlin also pitched a 1-2-3 eighth. Heathcliff
Slocumb, a surprise closer, went three-up and three-down in the
ninth. No giveaways on this night for the crowd of 39,053.
</P>
<P>
   Slocumb replaces Bobby Ayala, assuming a post he hasn't held for
two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him after the way he threw the ball in the Baltimore
series, we were going to use him in that role,'' Piniella said.
``He's had three or four real nice appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella also made a bullpen move after the game, sending rookie
Steve Gajkowski back to Class AAA Tacoma and recalling outfielder
Charles Gipson. That leaves the Mariners with an 11-man pitching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   The manager has had few worries lately with the tail end of his
rotation. In 61/3 innings, Swift (5-3) spaced nine hits, walked one
and did just enough to keep the Dodgers off balance.
</P>
<P>
   Tied with Johnson and Jeff Fassero for the team lead in wins,
the 36-year-old right-hander was his usual annoying self, using his
trademark sinker. He retired Los Angeles on three popups in the
first, three grounders in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can stay healthy, I can do the job,'' Swift said. ``I'm
in a good groove right now.''
</P>
<P>
   His approach apparently is catching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself to throw the ball like Billy was doing, with the
sinker and slider,'' Timlin said. ``It was working. If I can throw
the ball like him, I might make some money.''
</P>
<P>
   Swift was backed by superlative defense, something missing for
the Mariners in recent weeks. Rob Ducey made a lunging third-inning
grab in right. In the same inning, first baseman David Segui
started and finished a slick double play, flagging down a
bullet-like grounder. Alex Rodriguez leaped high to stab a liner at
short in the fifth. And Joey Cora made a sliding stop on a grounder
to second to end the sixth inning, leaving runners at first and
third.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes had no such luck, or support. Certainly not the comfort
zone he would have preferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very weird week,'' said the right-hander, a
24-year-old from Mexico. ``There's always going to be rumors, but
you're never going to believe it until it happens. It takes away
from your concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (4-7) got stung in the second inning for two runs. Bobby
Bonilla's lack of concentration, not the pitcher's, was
responsible. The Dodger third baseman booted a ball by Segui to
open the inning. After a walk and fielder's choice, Hill singled
home the only run the Mariners would need and Wilson plated
another.
</P>
<P>
   A triple by Cora and a Rodriguez groundout made it 3-0 in the
fifth, and Wilson's squeeze bunt accounted for the final run in the
sixth. The Mariner catcher dinked a popup near the third-base line
that a diving Valdes got a glove on but couldn't hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got the sign, I realized it was a good situation right
then,'' Wilson said. ``I don't think they expected it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Valdes: ``I almost got it. I did my best effort. I thought
I had it for a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella marveled at the pitcher's athleticism and almost
sounded as if he wished he'd snapped up Valdes in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get involved in that, but Valdes threw the
ball well,'' Piniella said. ``He spotted his fastball and he had a
pretty good breaking ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodger pitcher was lifted in the eighth, completing a
126-pitch outing and a strange 72-hour journey.

DODGERS, BONILLA STRUGGLE IN SEATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Without Randy Johnson or Hideo Nomo to worry about,
the Dodgers have shifted their concern to Bobby Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only problem in Friday's 4-0 loss to the Seattle
Mariners, just the most glaring. Since joining the team three weeks
ago today, Bonilla has provided leadership into the clubhouse, but
not big hits in the Dodgers' long search to right their season.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla was expected to give the Dodgers a left-handed power
hitter in a lineup top heavy with right-handers but has just one
extra-base hit in his last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby just isn't swinging the bat with authority,'' said
Dodgers manager Bill Russell, who will rest Bonilla in today's
game. ``He just isn't himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla said after going 0 for 4 against Billy Swift and two
relievers that he has been battling the flu for more than a week.
But his problems go back much further.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Dodgers in the May 15 blockbuster trade with
Florida, Bonilla is batting .204 (15 for 73). He had game-winning
hits in his first three games at Dodger Stadium, but does not have
a home run since May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting instructor Reggie Smith said Bonilla's problems stem
from wrist and Achilles injuries that forced him to miss most of
spring training and early April.
</P>
<P>
   At age 35, Bonilla has a daily ritual of lengthy ice treatment
and rehabilitation. The wrist still is tender from offseason
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Bonilla has started all but one game at third
base. But with the Dodgers facing left-handers the next two days,
the switch-hitting Bonilla could be sitting for the rest of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you miss spring training they way he did, this becomes
your spring training,'' Smith said. ``His timing is off and he
doesn't have the bat speed he usually does. I think he'll be okay,
but he's been through a lot already this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Eric Young and Gary Sheffield had two hits apiece
Friday, the heart of the Dodgers order _ Eric Karros, Raul Mondesi
and Bonilla _ were a combined 0 for 11.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who moved from first base to designated hitter in the
American League park, has moved into the cleanup spot during
Bonilla's slump.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's game still close in the sixth inning, Bonilla had
a chance to get something going with runners at first and third
with two outs. He appeared to have a base hit between first and
second, but Joey Cora made a diving stop and threw out the
slow-footed Bonilla to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will come around,'' Bonilla said. ``I'm not going to get
down.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for Bonilla, the attention might have shifted to starter
Ismael Valdes, who was offered to Seattle for Johnson earlier this
week. He allowed three earned runs in 71/3 innings, but made bad
pitches in the second when the Mariners scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (4-7) wasn't helped when Bonilla started the second by
making an error. But the Mariners' seventh and eighth hitter,
Glenallen Hill and Dan Wilson, had RBI singles and Valdes then
walked the next two hitters.
</P>
<P>
   All of that could have been overcome with a little timely
hitting. Against Swift and particularly relievers Mike Timlin and
Heathcliff Slocumb, the Dodgers got just two runners to third base.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the shutdown was the Mariners bullpen, which is
the club's weak spot. But Timlin took over for Swift (5-3) with one
in the seventh, worked out of a bases-loaded situation then retired
the Dodgers in order in the eighth. Slocumb pitched a perfect
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers fell to 29-31, 7{ games behind San Diego and San
Francisco, which moved into a tie for first place Friday with a
victory over St. Louis.

LATE-INNING MAGIC DOES TRICK FOR A'S 
BY RON KROICHICK
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Kenny Rogers deserved the starring role. He christened
the interleague portion of the A's schedule Friday night,
introducing the Arizona Diamondbacks to his hypnotizing array of
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   And for his effort, Rogers got a hearty pat on the back.
</P>
<P>
   The A's won the game long after Rogers departed. Mike Blowers
knocked home the winning run in Oakland's 2-1 victory at the
Coliseum, with a bases-loaded single in the bottom of the 11th
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitchers, Rogers and Bob Wolcott of Arizona,
slapped two tidy rows of zeroes on the scoreboard. They each
pitched eight shutout innings, then turned over the game to the
bullpens.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers collected his fourth consecutive no-decision. He's 6-2
with a 3.43 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny should be closing in on 10 wins, the way he's been
pitching,'' A's manager Art Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   The A's had help in putting together their decisive rally. Scott
Spiezio led off the 11th with a walk _ after Diamondbacks catcher
Damian Miller dropped Spiezio's foul popup for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Grieve followed with a rocket-like single to left-center off
Russ Springer, moving Spiezio to third. Springer intentionally
walked Matt Stairs, loading the bases for Blowers.
</P>
<P>
   He promptly launched an 0-2 pitch over left fielder David
Dellucci's head to end the game. Dellucci was drawn in on the play,
as was the rest of Arizona's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Blowers is making a strong case to remain the starting third
baseman, even when Dave Magadan (sprained hand) returns from the
disabled list. Blowers is hitting .279 and ranks third on the A's
with 33 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since he's gotten the opportunity, Mike's made the most
of it,'' Howe said. ``He's had a lot of big hits for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters replaced Rogers in the ninth; Rogers had thrown 121
pitches and his back was stiff. Fetters relinquished a two-out
infield single to Matt Williams, when the ball glanced off Blowers'
outstretched glove.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Lee followed with a single to left field, sending
Williams to second. He scored on Jay Bell's single, putting the
Diamondbacks ahead 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The A's tied the score in their half of the ninth, against
Arizona closer Gregg Olson. Rickey Henderson walked _ he's Rickey,
after all _ and moved to second on Spiezio's sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Olson walked Grieve on a 3-2 pitch, putting the winning run on
base. Stairs then struck out looking, leaving the A's on the verge
of wasting their last chance.
</P>
<P>
   They came perilously close, when Blowers barely checked his
swing on a 1-2 pitch from Olson. First-base umpire Mike Reilly
ruled in Blowers' favor _ and he promptly blooped a single into
right field on the next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona manager Buck Showalter was furious about Reilly's
non-call. Showalter said Blowers ``obviously'' did not check his
swing in time; the Diamondbacks could have secured the victory
right there.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, who had stolen third base during Blowers' at-bat,
instead strolled home to tie the score. The run was the 1,949th of
Henderson's career, tying him with Stan Musial for sixth place on
the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Mays is fifth at 2,062. Henderson holds out remote hope
of playing long enough to catch Ty Cobb, the all-time leader at
2,246.
</P>
<P>
   ``The runs record is probably more important than the
stolen-base record,'' Henderson said. ``That's your job as a
leadoff hitter _ to get on base and score runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's nearly won the game when the next batter, Jason Giambi,
smoked an Olson pitch to deep center field. Arizona's Devon White
raced back and made a nice, staggering catch near the warning
track.

BULLS ARE BACK EVEN WITH JAZZ 
BY DAVID STEELE
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ After the Utah Jazz took a harrowing 88-85
victory over the Chicago Bulls in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on
Wednesday, a Salt Lake City columnist declared the series ``over
... Done. Finished.'' With 1:46 remaining in Friday night's second
game, the columnist looked like a prophet.
</P>
<P>
   At the final buzzer, however, it was the Delta Center that
resembled a mausoleum, while the five-time champion Bulls looked
very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what they consider being dead,'' said the Bulls'
Michael Jordan, ``then I wouldn't mind being dead for a little
while longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's Bulls dominated the final stretch, especially on
defense, and pulled out a 93-88 win that tied the series at one
game apiece and snatched home-court advantage going into the next
three games in Chicago. While Jordan scored 37 points, 13 in the
fourth quarter, it wasn't him who revived the Bulls at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan can thank Steve Kerr for his big rebounding, Dennis
Rodman for his timely scoring, and a swarming defense that made
Karl Malone invisible and John Stockton error-prone. Once again,
the world's most photogenic team won a big game in a most
unglamorous way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long playoff, I can see it in the making,'' said
Bulls coach Phil Jackson. ``It's going to be one of those playoffs
that's going to be very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult for the Bulls, even as Jordan exploded again,
and as Toni Kukoc came out of the gate by scoring all 13 of his
points in the first half, and with Scottie Pippen again doing a
little of everything with 21 points, six rebounds and four assists.
With three minutes to go, they led 85-79 and seemed completely in
control; Jordan had a hand in the last nine Bulls points, scoring
seven of them and dishing to Pippen out of yet another double-team
for a jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Then all of a sudden, the Jazz found all kinds of ways to
compensate for another awful Malone performance _ 5-for-16 shooting
overall, 6-for-9 free-throw shooting, five fouls and 16 meek
points. (Malone correctly pointed out afterward, ``We will not win
this series if I don't play better. That's a fact.'')
</P>
<P>
   Shandon Anderson scored off a clever Bryon Russell pass in
traffic, Jordan missed a jumper, Anderson drained two free throws
on Luc Longley's sixth and final foul, and following another Jordan
miss in the lane, Jeff Hornacek buried a 3-pointer from the right
wing that put the Jazz up 86-85 with 1:46 to go.
</P>
<P>
   On their home court, the Jazz seemed in perfect position to take
control and take a 2-0 lead to Chicago. But, as several Bulls
mentioned, the champs have been there before. ``I think we went
back to the huddle, and everybody was quiet and focused, and we
came back out and took control,'' Kerr said. ``Everybody was very
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Confident enough to completely shut the Jazz down; they didn't
score again until a virtually meaningless basket with three seconds
left. Rodman _ who played as well against Malone as he ever has _
beat the Mailman to a Kukoc miss to save a possession. Kukoc halted
a Jazz break by intercepting a Stockton pass intended for an open
Russell beyond the three-point line.
</P>
<P>
   And when the ball went the other way, Kerr measured a 3-pointer
from the right wing. He was short, but he drove between Malone and
Stockton, grabbed the rebound on the baseline, dribbled once and
fed Jordan underneath for a layup, a foul and a three-point play.
Jordan hit the free throw and, with 47.9 seconds left, the Bulls
were up for good, 88-86.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve strictly made a hustle play,'' Jordan said. ``He had an
opportunity to make the three, and I guess he had a feel in terms
of the shot not going in, and he chased the rebound. I'm sure Karl
was surprised, but that's true desire, to get those loose balls and
offensive rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was maybe my first rebound of the series,
probably,'' Kerr added. He was right; it was also only his 15th of
the entire postseason. Kerr called it ``ironic,'' but it wasn't any
more so than Rodman's turnaround jumper from the key with the shot
clock winding down that had tied the game at 74 midway through the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman was much more potent on the glass, with five offensive
rebounds and nine overall (the Bulls beat the Jazz 18-9 on the
offensive glass), and on defense, where he made Malone shrink on
every possession. Malone took two shots in the fourth quarter and
scored exactly one point. He also played the last 6:20 after
picking up a silly fifth foul, raising an elbow into Kerr on a
pick-and-roll. On the ensuing possession after Jordan's three-point
play, Malone all but avoided the ball as Stockton kept working the
ball all around; Malone finally settled for a one-legged fallaway
18-footer with the shot clock winding down that clanked harmlessly
away with 23.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls commenced to hit five of eight free throws from then
on, and the Jazz were done.

RODMAN'S FIERY COLOR COMES OUT AGAIN 
BY BRUCE JENKINS
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Many of them stuck around the Delta Center,
helpless now without their exploding fireworks, out-of-context
music and preposterous mascot, with nothing to watch but Dennis
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   He was standing around midcourt after the Chicago Bulls'
victory, soaking it all in with a couple of interviews. Here was
the man who went to Vegas, who ridiculed all things Mormon, who
outplayed Karl Malone. They tried a little sarcasm earlier; one
sign read, ``Welcome Back, Brother Rodman,'' but now the Utah fans
were plainly baffled. They observed Rodman as if he had just
stepped off a space ship in their own back yard.
</P>
<P>
   He was wearing a purple towel over his head: Jazz colors. The
shoes were gone. Socks only. He wore a look that only Rodman
understands, the kind of serenity this man derives from a 6 a.m.
gambling mission in another state on the morning of a team practice
with a woman on each arm. Dennis Rodman brought his world to Salt
Lake City last night, and Karl Malone was just another face in the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't Rodman's game specifically; not by any means.
Michael Jordan scored 37 points, Scottie Pippen had 21 and Steve
Kerr had some fine, brazen moments near the end. But Rodman
symbolized how it all went wrong for the Jazz in a loss they
couldn't afford. If Malone is going into a shell, the Bulls put
Pippen on John Stockton and Rodman is standing there with a
gigantic smile on his face, Utah can't feel too great about playing
the next three games in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Utah coach Jerry Sloan was clearly disgusted afterward, although
he pointed no fingers. He just said this: ``When Toni Kukoc comes
out of the gate and goes right around everybody, like there's
nobody else on the floor, that tells you we're not ready to
compete. We came out soft. Simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact about Malone is that he's had a number of
disappearances in big games, particularly in last year's Finals.
He's a Hall of Famer and maybe the greatest power forward of all
time, but in situations like this, he is neither. There's too much
evidence to the contrary. He doesn't act the way great players act.
You've got numbers if you want 'em: Malone is shooting 34 percent
in the series, and he was 0-for-2 from the floor in the fourth
quarter Friday night, but it's more than that.
</P>
<P>
   As the stretch drive unfolded, Malone got into a pattern of
silly fouls, to the point where he had five and could no longer be
a defensive force underneath the basket. These weren't necessary
fouls on Pippen or Luc Longley inside, but inexplicable bumps and
elbows on people like Kerr, far from the basket.
</P>
<P>
   There had been a stunning sequence with 48 seconds left when
Kerr, after missing a pull-up 3-pointer, got his own offensive
rebound between Stockton and Malone. What an image. The skinny
red-haired kid, well past his prime, stepping right into the heart
of Utah lore. Kerr got the ball to Jordan, who cashed in a
three-point play for an 88-86 Chicago lead.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, Stockton had the ball. It wasn't Kerr guarding
him (like Game 1), or even the long-armed Ron Harper, but Pippen,
one of the best defensive players in league history. It was a
brilliant move by Bulls coach Phil Jackson, and it meant just one
thing: Malone had to step up.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. Malone was shifting idly inside, looking for a pick
to set, until the clock got to Stockton and he kicked the ball out.
Malone had an outside shot, the type he has consistently missed
through the first two games, and it kicked off the rim. The Jazz's
chances went right along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, such as the Warriors' playoff upset over
Utah in '89, Malone was sullen and arrogant after a big loss. He's
learned a lot since then. He's mature and gentlemanly, and the
first thing he said when he entered the interview room last night
was, ``Sorry for making you guys wait.''
</P>
<P>
   He then proceeded to tell it straight, the only way he knows
how. ``I'm not playin' well right now, and it's an unfortunate
time. We will not win this series if I don't play well that's a
fact. I don't have any excuses. There's a lot of things I coulda
did. But I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``All year,'' he went on, ``I make those shots. Right now I'm
missing 'em. Comes at a really (crummy) time, too (laughter). But I
don't shy away from the responsibility. When you don't do it, you
gotta face the firing squad. That's you guys.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Malone went back to the locker room. Somewhere nearby,
Rodman was dressing hurriedly. You never know with this man, but he
was probably getting ready for another Vegas run. With any luck
he'd be there by 2 a.m., his mind just right. There would be
wisecracks and revelry, and undoubtedly talk of that improbable
17-foot shot he buried with about eight minutes left in last
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a 37-year-old man now, I don't run up and down the court
like an antelope any more,'' Rodman said with a smile. ``You know
how it goes. If I miss that shot, it's all my fault. If it goes in,
it was Michael's game. I can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but you can, Dennis. You just did.

GIANTS CONTAIN CARDS _ 7TH STRAIGHT VICTORY 
BY MARK CAMPS
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire's pursuit of the single-season home run
record resumed with a bang Friday night, but he'd probably trade
every one of those long balls for something the Giants attained: a
share of first place.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire's Cardinals continue to sputter, the Giants
continue to surge. Backed by strong pitching from Orel Hershiser
and another remarkable job by the bullpen, the Giants won their
seventh in a row, 3-2 at Busch Stadium. The victory, coupled with
the Padres' 8-7 loss at Texas, gave the Giants a share of the top
spot in the West for the first time since April 7.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen, who in the Giants' last game here gave up a game-tying
home run to McGwire, this time blew him away on strikes in the
ninth inning. Nen then did the same to Brian Jordan to end the game
and record his league-leading 17th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Nen's night tonight. It was McGwire's last time,'' said
Giants manager Dusty Baker, whose team is a season-high 13 games
over .500. ``Finally we won a close, one-run game in this ballpark.
Usually it goes the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's victory was the Giants' second in a row in St.
Louis, their first two-game win streak at Busch since August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who was coming off a three-game layoff because of back
spasms, did not take long to show the baseball community he is just
fine. In the first inning, on a 1-2 sinking fastball, McGwire
launched a low line drive that carried well over the wall in
straightaway center that gave the Cardinals a short-lived 2-0 lead.
It was McGwire's 28th home run of the year, putting him on pace for
75.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good pitch to a great hitter,'' Hershiser said. ``I
got a little too arrogant thinking I could get him out, and I went
right after him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the only serious mistake made by Hershiser, who has now
won six consecutive starts. He walked five batters in his six
innings, at times looking like he was one batter away from getting
pulled, but the reigning pitcher of the month would not give in. In
the sixth, after the first two St. Louis batters were retired, the
Cardinals loaded the bases on a double by Royce Clayton and two
walks. Hershiser got out of the jam by striking out Delino
DeShields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orel had a real gutsy performance,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants did all their scoring in the third inning. A two-run
single by Jeff Kent and a run-scoring grounder by J.T. Snow
accounted for all the runs.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Baker said his goal was to get into the
Cardinals' overworked bullpen _ 10 innings from the relievers in
their past two games. To make matters worse for St. Louis, injuries
to starters Donovan Osborne, Alan Benes and Matt Morris have forced
manager Tony La Russa to use relievers as starters on several
occasions. Kent Bottenfield, who went the first three innings, was
making his first big-league start since June 1994.
</P>
<P>
   By knocking out Bottenfield early, Baker's objective was
achieved, and the Cardinals' soft, white underbelly was exposed.
And although the Giants had numerous chances _ they put runners in
scoring position in the fourth, sixth (bases loaded) and seventh _
they failed to pad their 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But with the pitching of Hershiser and relievers Jim Poole,
Steve Reed, Rich Rodriguez and, finally, Nen, the Giants' bullpen
was just as resilient. The Giants' seven-game winning streak is the
longest since winning nine in a row early last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like a seven-game win streak,'' said Baker.
``It just seems like we're playing like we're supposed to.
Hopefully it can go on and on.''

he was told to abstain from alcohol and be chaste. This time,

broken wheel that derailed Inter-City-Express 884, a rare example
of mechanical failure in a land that prides itself on its
engineering prowess.
</P>

crash shook the nation. As if to acknowledge widespread fears,
German Rail withdrew 60 of its 104 high-speed trains for

   Even when the news about Nazi gold is good for the Swiss, it's
not so good for the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   The United States State Department turned out a final report
detailing how other countries that remained neutral during World
War II _ Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkey _ took
looted gold in return for providing Hitler with much-needed war
materiel, including the ores that were used in making
armor-piercing shells. Their actions likely prolonged the war.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, like a Swiss commission that issued its findings
in May, found that more gold was stolen from the victims of the
Holocaust than previously believed. And much of it went first to
Switzerland, chiefly the Swiss National Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in New York, the three major Swiss commercial banks,
which have been charged with obstructing Holocaust survivors and
their heirs from recovering their accounts, reportedly offered to
settle a series of suits for more than $1 billion. Negotiations are
continuing.

   A well-known Bordeaux wine chateau, Giscours, was charged by the
French government with fraudulent winemaking practices. According
to indictments handed down in Bordeaux, Giscours' winemakers
stretched their good stuff by using wine from a lesser region,
mixing one year's wine with another's, adding sugar to boost
alcoholic content and soaking wood chips in the vats to simulate
aging in a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   What worried Bordeaux was not Giscours troubles but the
possibility that wine buyers around the world, fed up with the
staggeringly high prices of Bordeaux wines, would use the scandal
as an excuse to take their business elsewhere _ perhaps someplace
like the Napa Valley.

   One joy of working at The New York Times is the interchange with
readers _ smart, well-educated folks who care, a lot, about their
newspaper's standards. But it's an endless revelation to discover
what, precisely, floats their boats.
</P>
<P>
   A picture caption last Sunday about the world's largest cruise
ship incorrectly described its relationship with a nearby sailboat.
The ship was at anchor. It was not edging past the sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   What an uproar ensued! No mistake in years has prompted such an
outpouring. You'd think a photograph of Fidel Castro had been
misidentified as Jesse Helms.
</P>
<P>
   Readers seemed eager to underscore the clarity of it all, with
most letters wielding the word ``clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ship is clearly at anchor,'' one reader wrote. ``The
starboard anchor chain is clearly visible.'' One charitable reader
tempered this to ``possibly,'' while another upped the ante to
``obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   And listen to the condemnation of the errant caption writer:
``Nautically challenged.'' ``Landlubberly.'' ``Are you slipping?''
``Should be assigned extended time at a shore resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most instructive was Rear Adm. David C. Brown, who
advised that ``the daytime signal indicating the vessel's anchored
status, a black ball, is clearly visible near the bow.''
</P>
<P>
   The editors got out their magnifying glass and, sure enough,
there it was! They hang their heads in landlubberly shame.

   The FBI's Most Famous &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Mantle, Thurgood Marshall, Adolf Hitler, John Lennon,
Cardinal Francis Spellman, Paul Robeson and Pablo Picasso are just
some of well-known public figures whose FBI files just appeared on
the agency's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   They join Lucille Ball, Elvis Presley and other celebrities
whose dossiers were previously transferred to the FBI site
(http://www.fbi.gov). These nearly three dozen files are the most
frequently sought out and are open to the public at the J. Edgar
Hoover building.
</P>
<P>
   Also available on the Web site are files on the Hindenburg
explosion, the escape from Alcatraz and the Basque intelligence
service.
</P>
<P>
   Long available to scholars, the files provide little new
historical information but cast an intriguing light on the dark
side of the agency under Hoover, when agents were preoccupied with
leftist activists and chased gossip and scandal as assiduously as
they tracked down criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman's warm correspondence with Hoover is there, along with
background reports on Marshall before he became a Supreme Court
justice. So are reports from informers asserting that Picasso once
said he was a communist, and statements from people who claimed to
have seen Hitler alive long after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ball, the star of ``I Love Lucy,'' earned a file in the
early 1950s when she was investigated by the House Un-American
Activities because she registered to vote as a communist _ at the
insistence of her grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also investigated legitimate extortion attempts and
threats like one against Mickey Mantle, the legendary New York
Yankee, who received a threatening note in 1960 suggesting that he
might be shot during a game. ``I have a gun with a microscopic
sight,'' a man wrote him, ``and I'm going to get you through both
of your knees and it's going to happen soon.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Money is the mother's milk of politics,'' is the
maxim coined by Jesse Unruh, the liberal Democrat who reigned as
speaker of the California state Assembly in the 1960s, and indeed,
cash has always been an essential commodity in campaigns. The
primary in California last week was the most expensive statewide
election in U.S. history, with $100 million spent on races for
governor, United States senator and a handful of ballot
propositions.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened: The rich guys lost.
</P>
<P>
   The resounding defeat of Al Checchi, a half-billionaire
businessman who spent $40 million of his own money in the race for
the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, brought forth a certain
populist euphoria _ a new conventional wisdom across the land that
even in flashy California, money can't buy you voters' love.
</P>
<P>
   But tempting as it might be in light of current campaign-finance
scandals to conclude that voters rejected the corrosive power of
money in politics, the reality is considerably more complex, and
less uplifting.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the winning candidate, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a
23-year veteran of state politics, is himself a relentless
fund-raiser, one often accused of blending his campaign-finance
outings with his official duties. And even if he seemed a pauper
compared to Checchi, his campaign spending still broke the old $9
million record for a gubernatorial primary campaign here, set in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a contrary example of the power of money loomed
just as large here last week: A $20-million campaign by organized
labor managed to defeat a ballot measure that would have required
unions to obtain annual written consent of their members before
using dues for political purposes. The measure was favored in early
public opinion polls, but its opponents outspent supporters 3 to 1,
and union members went to the polls in unusually large numbers,
helping Davis in the process.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much evidence that the rules of wealth and politics
have dramatically changed. Since at least the days of Andrew
Jackson, Americans have been ambivalent toward the wealthy in
politics, celebrating the triumph of log cabin little guys and
viewing elites with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, wealthy candidates, from Roosevelts to Kennedys to
Rockefellers to Bushes, have often been elected, though generally
when they managed to cloak their wealth in a populist noblesse
oblige and emphasize their empathy with the people. There was, for
example, Nelson Rockefeller's invariable ``Hiya, fella!'' and
George Bush's public fondness for pork rinds when his private taste
ran to popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those candidates spent money in ways that would almost
certainly be subject to intense media scrutiny now; for example, by
trading favors or greasing the palms of local political bosses. But
since the 1976 Supreme Court ruling that the First Amendment right
to free speech bars limits on a candidate's spending of his or her
own money, millionaires have had an unchallenged license to test
the political waters.
</P>
<P>
   Money can buy name recognition for political newcomers like
Checchi but it is no guarantee of success. A study by the Center
for Responsive Politics in Washington found that of 149 candidates
for the House and Senate in 1995-96 who put more than $100,000 of
their own money into their campaigns, only 19 won. Still, the U.S.
Senate remains a virtual millionaires' club, and in recent years,
wealthy candidates from Ross Perot to Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin
have managed to turn their private wealth into a campaign plus;
they boast that they are free from the hold of special interests,
as Kohl did when he won office in 1988 spending $7.5 million, most
of it his own, with the slogan, ``Nobody's senator but yours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He called to congratulate us,'' said David Doak, Kohl's
longtime media consultant, who worked here this year for Davis.
Doak said his old boss, commenting on the California race, noted
that it's one thing to use your own money to talk about yourself,
``but you have to be real judicious about attacking somebody else,
because people see it differently, and it can cross over into
bullying.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, politicians here and around the country said, Checchi's
money had less to do with his defeat than how he chose to spend it.
Even after 18 months crisscrossing the state talking to voters and
3 months of television commercials touting his private sector
accomplishments and teaching voters how to pronounce his name
(CHECK-ee), he drew about as many unfavorable ratings from poll
respondents as favorable ones _ not good news for any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Rep. Jane Harman, herself a millionaire, entered the
race and promptly took the lead in public opinion polls, Checchi
unleashed a relentless barrage of commercials attacking her, often
in misleading terms. That helped destroy Ms. Harman, who spent some
$16 million of family money on her campaign. But, in a kind of
murder-suicide, it also quadrupled Checchi's own negative ratings
and created an opening for Davis, who had been saving his
advertising money for the final stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for the Republican Senate nomination to challenge
Sen. Barbara Boxer, Darrell Issa, a multimillionaire car alarm
manufacturer who spent about $10 million, lost to state Treasurer
Matt Fong, but only after a wave of harshly critical news accounts
raised questions about Issa's business record and tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Rich candidates have lost spectacularly in the past, of course,
including the cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, who spent $14 million
in the 1989 Republican mayoral primary in New York City, and lost
to Rudolph Giuliani, who spent $2.5 million and won 67 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In California, former Rep. Michael Huffington, a Republican oil
heir, set the previous national record for individual spending here
four years ago, by pouring nearly $30 million of his family fortune
into a nearly successful campaign against Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   But Checchi's resounding defeat still set off ripples of shock,
precisely because Huffington, who was widely regarded as a
political and intellectual lightweight, came so close, and because
Checchi, an altogether more serious figure, spent about 30 percent
more in the primary alone than Huffington spent in his primary and
general election combined.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In general in recent years, polls have shown that most voters
are neutral-to-positive about candidates who finance their own
campaigns, while support for public campaign financing is often
tepid. But as this year's campaign wore on, voters here seemed
taken aback by the sheer reach of Checchi's record-breaking effort.
</P>
<P>
   A poll in April by the Public Policy Institute of California
found that 6 in 10 voters were indifferent to a candidate's
decision to finance his own campaign, but by May, voters indicated
a marked preference, 52 percent to 34 percent, for candidates who
took the conventional route of collecting money from supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In his final days on the campaign trail, Checchi went low-tech,
riding a yellow school bus around the state to highlight his
proposals for fixing the state's troubled schools, and publicly
lamenting that his rivals had outfoxed him by turning the race into
a debate about his money instead of his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But Checchi was also the victim of his own promises to shake up
the state's political establishment. Over and over again in
campaign appearances, he told audiences, ``If you don't want
change, don't vote for me,'' and voters appeared to take him at his
word. Surveys of voters leaving the polls found that two-thirds
thought California was on the right track after years of economic
collapse and natural disasters, and polls repeatedly found that
voters preferred candidates with experience in government.
</P>
<P>
   Experts cautioned against reading too much into Checchi's
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of negativity in American politics, and
it's not going to go away,'' said Herbert E. Alexander, a retired
professor or political science at the University of Southern
California and an expert on campaign finance. ``In my view, that
would mean candidates would have to get a bigger bang for the
dollars that they can spend. The high cost of television means now
that you have to go for the jugular, and in those circumstances, it
would lead to even more negativity than we've experienced now.''

BUZZ WORDS: WHO'S AFRAID OF THE ISLAMIC BOMB?

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For more than two decades, the prospect that a
Muslim country could possess nuclear weapons has often been summed
up in two words _ ``Islamic bomb'' _ a phrase that captured the
imagination of some and terrified others.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase appeared as far back as the early 1970s, uttered in
private conversations by Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in
reference to his country's hopes to go nuclear. In the atmosphere
of the time, it seemed a serious warning: that once one Islamic
nation had nuclear weapons, it would enhance the power of them all.
</P>
<P>
   So when Pakistan set off nuclear explosions in the Baluchistan
desert in the last two weeks, the phrase was heard again. In
Karachi, a mockup of an atomic bomb, with ``Islamic Bomb'' painted
on the side, was paraded jubilantly through the streets, and in
Islamabad, crowds shouted for ``holy war'' against India.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now we have an Islamic bomb as of today,'' said Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., a former ambassador to India. ``And it is
fitted with a missile, which can mean the destruction of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   But is there such a thing as a bomb that exists for the sake of
Islam and for the destruction of Israel? Or do the phrase and the
oratory about it reveal other things instead _ a hunger and rivalry
for greatness by major Islamic countries, and the depth of Israel's
anxieties?
</P>
<P>
   There is, today at least, no special reason to believe that
Pakistan's newly declared ability to build a nuclear arsenal will
provide a nuclear umbrella for other Islamic societies, or that
those other countries will find it easier to go nuclear themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the idea of a global pan-Islamic community with a common
divine mission on earth has been trumpeted in Islamic oratory over
the years. But so far national interests have prevailed. Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini learned that lesson after he tried _
and failed _ to export his Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Pakistan got some help from Muslim countries like Libya
and Saudi Arabia years ago for its nuclear program. But much more
important support came from other places: blueprints, enriched
uranium, tritium and scientific know-how from China; technology
(stolen) from the Netherlands. And the United States gave its tacit
consent all during the years that Pakistan's help was needed in the
Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Pakistan, which desperately needs financial aid, has
offended the United States by staging its nuclear tests, it would
seem to be in Pakistan's interest to keep its technology from
spreading _ something that would only offend the United States
more. Even if Pakistan decided to export its technology at a future
point, the reasons would most likely have nothing to do with
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people talk about an Islamic bomb?'' Pakistani
Information Minister Mushahid Hussain said in an interview with the
German news magazine Der Spiegel. ``This is a Pakistani bomb. In
the case of India, you don't talk of a vegetarian bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Fouad Ajami, author of ``The Dream Palace of the Arabs,''
agrees. ``Bombs are not devout,'' he said. ``Bombs in Russia are
not Orthodox bombs. Bombs in India are not Hindu bombs. And bombs
in Pakistan are not Islamic.''
</P>
<P>
   So why does the label persist?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the utterances of Muslims themselves, who over the
years have publicly declared the need for an Islamic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, who ousted Bhutto and had him hanged,
condemned the rest of the world in 1986 for branding Pakistan's
bomb Islamic but in the same breath promoted the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why must they call Pakistan's bomb, supposing we have it, an
Islamic bomb?'' he said. ``You can see the mentality. They are
fearful that if an Islamic country such as Pakistan acquires this
technology they will spread it. In fact, if the Islamic world
possessed this technology, it means that 900 million Muslims
possess advanced technology. Hence comes the aggressive campaign
against Pakistan and the aggressive talk about the Pakistani
nuclear bomb. It is our right to obtain the technology. And when we
acquire this technology, the entire Islamic world will possess it
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   That same year, in the aftermath of U.S. air attacks on Libya,
its leader, Muammar Gadhafi, declared that the Arab world should
become one ``homeland,'' possessing missiles and even nuclear
bombs. And a few years later, Iranian Deputy President Ataollah
Mohajerani _ now the minister of Islamic guidance and culture and a
close ally of President Mohammed Khatami _ declared that because
Israel has nuclear facilities, Muslim countries needed them too.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the notion persists is that Israel and its
supporters have long found it convenient to demonize Islamic states
and movements whose leaders find it convenient to assert
religion-based claims to Jerusalem. For the Israelis, the idea that
Islamic fervor could go nuclear provides a justification for
maintaining its own unacknowledged nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Israel justified its bombing of Iraq's nuclear weapons facility
in the desert near Tuwaitha in 1981 in part by declaring that it
needed to destroy an ``Islamic bomb'' before it was built, even
though Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was the most secular of
leaders and never had much affection for his Islamic brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The tension over the prospect of an Islamic bomb continues
today.
</P>
<P>
   In Islamabad last week, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
said Muslims worldwide were happy about the Pakistani explosions.
``Muslims now feel more confident that Pakistan's nuclear
capability would play a role of deterrence to Israel's nuclear
capability,'' he said. (By Thursday, after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the visit, Kharrazi had shifted his
tone; he told a disarmament conference in Geneva that ``this was
one genie that was much better to have stayed confined in a
bottle.'')
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run, the most serious impact of the nuclear
explosions by Pakistan _ and India _ within the Islamic world may
be to revive the lust of rivals among the Islamic nations to
possess their own nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is, after all, a peer of a number of Middle Eastern
countries with grand ambitions and an even grander sense of their
place in the world's history _ Iranians who identify with ancient
Persia, Iraqis who remember Nebuchadnezzar, Egyptians who hark back
to the pharoahs and Syrians prideful of the ancient glories of
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   All can ask: Who are these upstart Pakistanis to think they lead
the Islamic world? What about us?
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Egypt has underscored that the recent nuclear tests
prove just how urgent it is the make the Middle East a nuclear-free
zone. But some Egyptian commentators implied that Arab countries
made a mistake in signing on to the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear capacity has become the guaranteed deterrent to defend
national rights and the right of self-determination,'' wrote Salama
Ahmed Salama, a columnist for the semi-official newspaper Al Ahram.
</P>
<P>
   She said nothing about Islam.

   In Islamabad last week, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
said Muslims worldwide were happy about the Pakistani explosions.
``Muslims now feel more confident that Pakistan's nuclear
capability would play a role of deterrence to Israel's nuclear
capability,'' he said. (By Thursday, after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the visit, Kharrazi had shifted his
tone; he told a disarmament conference in Geneva that ``this was
one genie that was much better to have stayed confined in a
bottle.'')
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run, the most serious impact of the nuclear
explosions by Pakistan _ and India _ within the Islamic world may
be to revive the lust of rivals among the Islamic nations to
possess their own nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is, after all, a peer of a number of Middle Eastern
countries with grand ambitions and an even grander sense of their
place in the world's history _ Iranians who identify with ancient
Persia, Iraqis who remember Nebuchadnezzar, Egyptians who hark back
to the pharoahs and Syrians prideful of the ancient glories of
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   All can ask: Who are these upstart Pakistanis to think they lead
the Islamic world? What about us?
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Egypt has underscored that the recent nuclear tests
prove just how urgent it is the make the Middle East a nuclear-free
zone. But some Egyptian commentators implied that Arab countries
made a mistake in signing on to the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear capacity has become the guaranteed deterrent to defend
national rights and the right of self-determination,'' wrote Salama
Ahmed Salama, a columnist for the semi-official newspaper Al Ahram.
</P>
<P>
   She said nothing about Islam.

   UNITED NATIONS _ It has become an article of faith among those
who oppose abortion in the United States that promoting abortion
anywhere else, particularly in the world's poorest countries, is
tantamount to an attack on the cultures of those countries. It is a
new argument from the conservative right, but it echoes charges
that the radical left used to make, to the effect that family
planning programs targeted at the Third World were a kind of
neo-imperialistic genocide.
</P>
<P>
   A statistical look around the world shows that if cultural
sensitivities are reflected in laws about abortion, there is a
remarkable divide between richer countries and poorer ones where
abortion and its effects are concerned. But other statistics
demonstrate that the pattern of legality does not reflect how women
in those societies choose to act.
</P>
<P>
   In the global south, where abortion laws are the most
restrictive, abortion rates are still quite high; deaths from
abortion are much higher there than elsewhere, because the
abortions tend to be unsafe. The industrial countries of the global
north are almost universally less restrictive in their abortion
laws. They also have the lowest rates of abortion-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Of about 20 million unsafe _ sometimes legal, but more often
illegal _ abortions estimated to take place each year worldwide, 90
percent occur in developing countries, according to the World
Health Organization. Of the 80,000 deaths that result, 95 percent
are in poor nations. That number does not include women who die of
miscarriages due to health problems or poor prenatal care; such
data do not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-colonial case has been made forcefully by Rep.
Christopher Smith, R-N.J., who has blocked U.S. payments to the
United Nations with an amendment denying money to any organization
that lobbies for liberalized abortion laws in any country. Smith, a
supporter of international child survival programs, says helping
poor children, not preventing them from being born, should be the
priority of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   His legislation, which President Clinton has vowed to veto when
it reaches his desk, has created alarm among family planning and
women's health organizations, who see its bar to advocating
abortion as a challenge to free speech and a chilling factor that
would reduce the amount of money going to all types of population
work, including contraception, in the poorest countries, where they
think it is needed most.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said in a telephone interview that he drew a distinction
between contraception and abortion. ``We have made it clear we
would put more money into family planning,'' he said. ``We offered
the administration $100 million dollars more in family planning aid
if they would get out of the abortion business.'' He added:
``Family planning is preventive and its use is up to the
individual. But those of us who respect the lives of unborn
children recognize that whether it be dismemberment, abortion or
chemical poisoning, abortions, legal or illegal, are violence
against children everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Family planning organizations and women's health groups do not
argue that abortion should be encouraged as a method of birth
control. But they do argue for less restrictive laws in many
countries on the ground that such laws would cut deaths. They also
say family planning and community health groups in Africa, Asia and
Latin America have to deal with the results of botched and
life-threatening abortions, sometimes by completing the process of
clearing the womb _ a procedure that would put them on the wrong
side of U.S. law if Smith's proposal were adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Smith argues that he would rather spend money on programs like
immunizations, nutritional health for mothers and other forms of
health care that would help children in developing societies
survive, rather than aiding organizations that are associated with
abortion. When asked about the problems posed by unsafe abortion,
he said, ``We need positive alternatives like the 4,000 crisis
pregnancy centers here, where women who have difficulties can be
helped in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of family planning respond that the overall effect of
his proposals could be to harm the ability of mothers to care for
their families. ``Public health experts will be the first to tell
you that child survival is most enhanced by enabling women to space
their childbearing,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America, the oldest and largest family
planning organization in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N. Populations
Fund, said the argument that family planners from richer nations
are coercing the women of the developing world should be turned
upside down. The real coercion in many places, she said, ``is that
women are being forced to have children by their families or by
social pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that women are getting choices, people seem to be starting
to object,'' said Sadik, a physician from Pakistan. ``It's being
made out that a woman wants to be pregnant all the time. That's not
what all the detailed surveys and research show. Most women don't
want to be serially pregnant. They want to have, if not two
children, maybe four children, not eight children _ and they don't
want to have them every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Because family planning services are not available to millions
of women who want them _ more than 350 million in the developing
world, according to surveys _ they turn to abortion, even where
illegal, and will continue to do so as a last resort, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to public belief, most of the unsafe illegal
abortions take place among married women,'' Sadik said.

   WASHINGTON _ It's getting tougher to be a hero in today's
military.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Pentagon still hands out plenty of Purple Hearts
and Bronze Stars. But the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest
honor, has been awarded only twice for valorous action since the
Vietnam War: to two Army sergeants killed in Somalia in 1993 as
they tried to help wounded comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Eight World War II veterans, including seven who were denied the
medal because they were black, have also received the medal in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Medal of Honor, authorized by Congress during the Civil War,
is awarded for ``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk
of life above and beyond the call of duty in action with the
enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   In wars past, that meant a bloodied pilot flying a crippled
bomber back to base in war-torn Europe, miraculously saving the
lives of his crew. Or a lone infantryman in an Asian jungle
fighting off hostile forces to rescue injured comrades behind enemy
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Bravery like that is hard to come by now, when the conflicts
that U.S. troops engage in are typically brief affairs in which
unmanned Tomahawk cruise missiles have replaced firefights and tank
battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity for people to be placed in those situations
has diminished,'' said Stanley Arthur, a retired admiral who
commanded allied naval forces in the Persian Gulf war and flew more
than 500 combat missions in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., a former Navy SEAL who is the only
Medal of Honor recipient in Congress, said, ``It's just a matter
of, thank God, we're not fighting as many wars.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Congressional Medal of Honor Society meets this weekend
in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., more than half of the 163 living
recipients are expected to attend. Since 1863, 3,399 people have
received the award, including one woman, Mary Walker, a Civil War
surgeon from Oswego, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   While Pentagon officials insist the stringent requirements in
the statutes have not changed, some retired brass fear politics has
colored the selection process recently. There was even some
surprise at the Pentagon when President Clinton and Congress
approved the awards for the sergeants killed in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Was there a chance that rewarding the soldiers' unquestionable
gallantry was a way to salve the wounds of a nation badly shaken by
the tragedy? Absolutely not, say Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   Given the reverence for valor in the military culture, it is
hard for civilians to understand the prestige the medal bestows on
its recipient. There are concrete benefits: an extra $400-a-month
pension and a lifetime pass for military aircraft. But the
intangibles are equally significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are revered,'' said Wayne Downing, a retired Army
four-star general who commanded the special forces that fought and
died in Somalia. ``There's an unwritten rule that they warrant a
salute, even from their superiors.''
</P>
<P>
   And recipients say it changes them. ``People expected more of me
and I expected more of myself,'' said Jack Jacobs, a retired Army
colonel who won the Medal of Honor for saving an American adviser
and 13 South Vietnamese soldiers during a firefight in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different kind of conflict now,'' said Jacobs, who used
to keep his medal in a sock drawer. He now hangs it in a closet
with his tuxedo.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To Republicans intent on damning the tax code as an
inequitable tangle that is strangling the American family, Sharon
Mallory's appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee a
few months back was just the ticket. Miss Mallory, a 41-year-old
factory worker from Indiana, testified that she and her live-in
boyfriend, Darryl Pierce, would like to get married but could not
afford the $3,700 in additional taxes it would cost them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl and I love each other very much and want to be
married,'' Miss Mallory said. ``But the IRS won't let us. We're
victims of the marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by such anecdotal outrage, Congress is well on its way
toward overhauling the tax-law provisions that push many two-income
couples into a higher tax bracket than they would be in if they
were single.
</P>
<P>
   The House took a big step in that direction Friday, adopting a
budget plan that makes eliminating the marriage penalty the No. 1
Republican tax goal this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all traces back to one simple question: Do Americans feel
that it's right to tax a working couple more just because they live
in holy matrimony?'' said Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But if the political appeal of attacking the marriage penalty is
clear, the policy arguments are less so.
</P>
<P>
   More couples actually get a break from the way the tax code
treats marriage than pay a penalty. Single people _ who are already
at an economic disadvantage to couples, since they cannot spread
their living costs over two incomes _ would get nothing.
</P>
<P>
   And the cost of eliminating or substantially reducing the
penalty for those who do pay it would be huge. Many Republicans
worry that it would crowd out other tax-cutting priorities, and
Democrats fret about lost spending opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Making the case for keeping the marriage penalty is a
treacherous business for members of both parties, few of whom are
willing to risk being seen as undermining a venerated institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, anybody want to defend the marriage-penalty tax?''
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott asked facetiously last week as
the Senate prepared to grapple with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The budget plan approved by the House on Friday would provide as
much as $100 million over the next five years to eradicate or
substantially reduce the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, both parties are seeking ways to use some of the
revenues that would be generated by the proposed tobacco
legislation to reduce the marriage penalty. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, is developing a plan that would give a break to couples
earning less than $50,000, including those who are not affected by
the marriage penalty. Democrats are developing a narrower version
intended to help only couples who pay more because of the marriage
tax.
</P>
<P>
   But the growing momentum for a quick fix belies the complexity
of addressing the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the penalty is hardly universal. While more than
20 million couples paid more in taxes in 1996 than they would have
if they were single, 25 million couples got a marriage bonus: They
paid less as a couple than they would have if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bonuses already go to the very families that social
conservatives consider the most traditional _ those in which the
husband works and the wife stays home. That is because the husband
would be entitled to more exemptions and deductions than he got
when he was single. For 1996, total bonuses of $32.9 billion, or
$1,300 per couple, outweighed total penalties of $28.8 billion, or
$1,380 per couple, by $4.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, substantially reducing or eliminating the penalty
without raising taxes elsewhere would cost the federal government
at least $20 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   And while social conservatives want to allocate as much money as
possible to reducing the penalty, business groups and supply-side
Republicans and economists are queasy about allowing the issue to
crowd out cuts in other areas, like income tax rates, capital gains
taxes and inheritance taxes. Cuts that target a specific group are
considered by many economists to be an inefficient way of promoting
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most fundamentally, lawmakers have long found it
difficult to address the marriage penalty without creating some
other perceived inequity. Most of the proposals would do nothing
for single people. Most of the proposed fixes would also give more
help to people at the top of the income scale than those at the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the proposals would complicate the problem by
levying different amounts of taxes on couples with the same
combined incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The current law is the product of decades of swings in policy
and public opinion about how to treat the income of married couples
in a way that is fair to two-income families, single-earner
couples, unmarried people and people across the income spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get a perfect system,'' said Iris Lav, deputy
director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal-leaning research organization. ``I think that where we are
right now is largely a reasonable compromise given the competing
demands of the tax system.''
</P>
<P>
   When the federal income tax was established in 1913, it was
levied on individuals, with no special provision made for married
couples. Starting in the 1920s, when relatively few married women
worked, some states passed laws allowing married couples to split
their income and pay at a lower rate than the husband would if he
had to file as an individual.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Congress responded by changing the law to allow joint
filing, widening tax brackets enough that most married couples paid
less than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Michael J. Graetz recounted in ``The Decline (and Fall?)
of the Income Tax'' (W.W. Norton, 1997), what couples saw as a
bonus, single people saw as a penalty. So in 1969, following years
of protests, Congress changed the tax brackets to reduce the amount
single people paid _ causing some married people, for the first
time, to pay more as a couple than they would if single.
</P>
<P>
   Soon protests about the marriage penalty were heard. Best known
of the protesters were David and Angela Boyter, federal employees
from Baltimore who would divorce for tax purposes each December and
then remarry early in the new year to reduce their taxes. Congress
responded by creating a two-earner deduction in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But the deduction was eliminated in 1986. Since then, as the
number of two-income couples has increased, more people have became
subject to the marriage penalty. And the pressure to fix the
marriage penalty has increased accordingly.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To Republicans intent on damning the tax code as an
inequitable tangle that is strangling the American family, Sharon
Mallory's appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee a
few months back was just the ticket. Miss Mallory, a 41-year-old
factory worker from Indiana, testified that she and her live-in
boyfriend, Darryl Pierce, would like to get married but could not
afford the $3,700 in additional taxes it would cost them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl and I love each other very much and want to be
married,'' Miss Mallory said. ``But the IRS won't let us. We're
victims of the marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by such anecdotal outrage, Congress is well on its way
toward overhauling the tax-law provisions that push many two-income
couples into a higher tax bracket than they would be in if they
were single.
</P>
<P>
   The House took a big step in that direction Friday, adopting a
budget plan that makes eliminating the marriage penalty the No. 1
Republican tax goal this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all traces back to one simple question: Do Americans feel
that it's right to tax a working couple more just because they live
in holy matrimony?'' said Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But if the political appeal of attacking the marriage penalty is
clear, the policy arguments are less so.
</P>
<P>
   More couples actually get a break from the way the tax code
treats marriage than pay a penalty. Single people _ who are already
at an economic disadvantage to couples, since they cannot spread
their living costs over two incomes _ would get nothing.
</P>
<P>
   And the cost of eliminating or substantially reducing the
penalty for those who do pay it would be huge. Many Republicans
worry that it would crowd out other tax-cutting priorities, and
Democrats fret about lost spending opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Making the case for keeping the marriage penalty is a
treacherous business for members of both parties, few of whom are
willing to risk being seen as undermining a venerated institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, anybody want to defend the marriage-penalty tax?''
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott asked facetiously last week as
the Senate prepared to grapple with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The budget plan approved by the House on Friday would provide as
much as $100 million over the next five years to eradicate or
substantially reduce the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, both parties are seeking ways to use some of the
revenues that would be generated by the proposed tobacco
legislation to reduce the marriage penalty. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, is developing a plan that would give a break to couples
earning less than $50,000, including those who are not affected by
the marriage penalty. Democrats are developing a narrower version
intended to help only couples who pay more because of the marriage
tax.
</P>
<P>
   But the growing momentum for a quick fix belies the complexity
of addressing the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the penalty is hardly universal. While more than
20 million couples paid more in taxes in 1996 than they would have
if they were single, 25 million couples got a marriage bonus: They
paid less as a couple than they would have if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bonuses already go to the very families that social
conservatives consider the most traditional _ those in which the
husband works and the wife stays home. That is because the husband
would be entitled to more exemptions and deductions than he got
when he was single. For 1996, total bonuses of $32.9 billion, or
$1,300 per couple, outweighed total penalties of $28.8 billion, or
$1,380 per couple, by $4.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, substantially reducing or eliminating the penalty
without raising taxes elsewhere would cost the federal government
at least $20 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   And while social conservatives want to allocate as much money as
possible to reducing the penalty, business groups and supply-side
Republicans and economists are queasy about allowing the issue to
crowd out cuts in other areas, like income tax rates, capital gains
taxes and inheritance taxes. Cuts that target a specific group are
considered by many economists to be an inefficient way of promoting
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most fundamentally, lawmakers have long found it
difficult to address the marriage penalty without creating some
other perceived inequity. Most of the proposals would do nothing
for single people. Most of the proposed fixes would also give more
help to people at the top of the income scale than those at the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the proposals would complicate the problem by
levying different amounts of taxes on couples with the same
combined incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The current law is the product of decades of swings in policy
and public opinion about how to treat the income of married couples
in a way that is fair to two-income families, single-earner
couples, unmarried people and people across the income spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get a perfect system,'' said Iris Lav, deputy
director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a
liberal-leaning research organization. ``I think that where we are
right now is largely a reasonable compromise given the competing
demands of the tax system.''
</P>
<P>
   When the federal income tax was established in 1913, it was
levied on individuals, with no special provision made for married
couples. Starting in the 1920s, when relatively few married women
worked, some states passed laws allowing married couples to split
their income and pay at a lower rate than the husband would if he
had to file as an individual.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Congress responded by changing the law to allow joint
filing, widening tax brackets enough that most married couples paid
less than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Michael J. Graetz recounted in ``The Decline (and Fall?)
of the Income Tax'' (W.W. Norton, 1997), what couples saw as a
bonus, single people saw as a penalty. So in 1969, following years
of protests, Congress changed the tax brackets to reduce the amount
single people paid _ causing some married people, for the first
time, to pay more as a couple than they would if single.
</P>
<P>
   Soon protests about the marriage penalty were heard. Best known
of the protesters were David and Angela Boyter, federal employees
from Baltimore who would divorce for tax purposes each December and
then remarry early in the new year to reduce their taxes. Congress
responded by creating a two-earner deduction in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But the deduction was eliminated in 1986. Since then, as the
number of two-income couples has increased, more people have became
subject to the marriage penalty. And the pressure to fix the
marriage penalty has increased accordingly.

   Michael Jordan may be the best basketball player in history. He
may have more trophies and rings and sneaker contracts than any man
on the planet. He may even, as Fortune magazine has just
calculated, have contributed $10 billion to the global economy over
the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not yet made the big leap that, if Wall Street has
its way, is in the future for all sorts of athletes and artists:
the leap from marketable commodity to tradeable security.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone and everything seems to be turning into a
security these days. Chicacgo White Sox slugger Frank Thomas is
working on a deal with SPP Hambro Securities to offer investors a
stake in his future earnings. Dusty Springfield, the 1960s pop
singer, is cooking up something with Prudential Investments. The
songwriting team of Holland, Dozier and Holland, who penned such
Motown hits as ``Stop! In the Name of Love,'' just sold $30 million
of securities backed by their royalties (their investment banker
says the bonds got an A rating from Moody's Investors Service).
</P>
<P>
   Entertainers are the least of it. Wall Street is securitizing
virtually everything that produces a predictable stream of cash.
Typhoon insurance. Tax liens. Loans for used cars and fraternity
houses. Fax machine leases. Mutual-fund fees. Unused airline
tickets. Movies yet to be made. Even defunct power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The alchemy by which Wall Street turns stuff into securities
varies. The old-fashioned method is the stock offering, which has
been used by a number of sports teams. But there are risks for
celebrities who go public: both Debbie Reynolds' casino and Wilt
Chamberlain's restaurant chain bombed in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are derivatives, so called because their prices are
derived from the value of something else, like an index or a
security or a commodity. Some involve relatively straightforward
bets on things like the price of soybeans or Microsoft shares. The
infamous variety _ like the ones that got Orange County, Calif., in
trouble _ often involve wagers so arcane as to be inexplicable. In
the works are derivatives that let investors bet on the temperature
or rainfall in a geographic region.
</P>
<P>
   But the really big idea on Wall Street today is securitization,
which began with home mortgages in the 1980s. Banks had made a lot
of them and wanted to sell them, but to whom?
</P>
<P>
   Then someone had a bright idea. If Wall Street put together a
whole bunch of mortgages, the bundles would look almost like
traditional bonds. They would be relatively safe investments,
because even if one borrower defaulted, there would be plenty of
others still paying. Bond buyers, like mutual funds, pension funds
and amateur investors, jumped on these mortgage-backed securities.
</P>
<P>
   This led to a creative burst on Wall Street. If securities could
be made out of mortgages, why not car loans, credit-card
receivables, business loans or bad debts?
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a number of firms on Wall Street are trying to
securitize consumers' electric bills. The goal is to lower
utilities' borrowing costs, creating savings that can be passed on
to consumers, said Joseph Fichera, an investment banker at
Prudential Securities. ``It's like refinancing your mortgage,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The newest and sexiest twist involves using streams of income
from entertainers. In the first such deal, rock star David Bowie
sold $55 million of bonds last year backed by his anticipated
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Creating such deals has proved harder than many investment
bankers predicted, and the securities have been so complicated that
they are offered only to professional investors. Nonetheless,
several Wall Street firms have set up entertainment subsidiaries,
like one at Nomura that raised money for Rod Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   David Pullman, the investment banker who successfully sold the
Bowie and Motown deals, says he has more up his sleeve. Film
libraries, television syndications, literary estates _ all could be
turned into securities, says Pullman, a managing director at
Fahnestock &AMP; Co., a New York-based securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   Pullman said ticket sales at sports stadiums were another
possibility for securitization. Individual athletes' earnings are
trickier because their contracts contain too many outs like morals
clauses, he said. But he added, ``We could do it if they had no cut
contracts or endorsements.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few who might qualify is Michael Jordan, of course.
If Fortune is right, he'd be rated triple-A. Stockbrokers will be
standing by to take your call.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky has her new legal dream team. She
will also surely have bigger bills to go along with the bigger
names now defending her.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the fact that she comes from a well-off family, her
ability to carry this growing financial burden is open to question.
This is undoubtedly weighing on the 24-year-old Ms. Lewinsky and
her parents as legal activity on her behalf intensifies, and she
faces the critical decision of whether to cooperate with or fight
against the sex-and-coverup investigation of the White House by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein, whom she retained last week, are
both senior members of a select coterie of Washington lawyers.
They've performed legal triage for a host of players in past
political scandals, from Fawn Hall, the secretary caught up in the
Iran-Contra affair, to Ken Parkinson, a Watergate figure whose
acquittal Stein won.
</P>
<P>
   Their services do not come cheaply. Both men have hourly billing
rates in the range of $400 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Lewinsky is already deep in the hole. When the final
bill is tallied, she'll likely owe more than $300,000 to her first
legal team, led by William Ginsburg, the family friend who served
as her principal lawyer until he was dismissed Tuesday; so say
Ginsburg and others familiar with the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Her expensive new retinue, worthy of her star billing in one of
the biggest controversies to rock Washington, is not limited to
Cacheris and Stein. There is also Nathaniel Speights, a Washington
trial lawyer who worked with Ginsburg and will remain on Ms.
Lewinsky's legal team. And a month ago Judy Smith, a respected
lawyer who once worked in the Bush White House, was retained by the
Lewinskys as family spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky grew up in rarefied Beverly Hills and her father,
Bernard Lewinsky, who now lives in nearby Brentwood, is a
successful oncologist. Her mother, Marcia Lewis, long divorced from
her father, has apartments at the posh Watergate complex in
Washington and in New York. But despite being financially
comfortable amid trappings of wealth, family friends say, the
parents are not so rich as to absorb the six-figure legal bills
their daughter is incurring.
</P>
<P>
   In TV appearances, Ms. Lewinsky's father has said he can't
afford them. Appearing on ``Larry King Live'' in April, he
announced that the family had established a legal defense fund for
his daughter, though it hasn't raised much money yet. In an
interview Wednesday, Ms. Smith reiterated that ``the legal bills
have been a tremendous strain for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg has said that Ms. Lewinsky would eventually have no
choice but to write a book or sell her story in order to pay off
her legal bills. But no one has approached her or her family with
any such offer recently. And any tell-all deal would certainly have
to wait until Ms. Lewinsky was out of legal jeopardy, a prospect
probably months away at the very least, if not years.
</P>
<P>
   In part to minimize her legal expenses, Ms. Lewinsky did filing
and other routine office chores for Ginsburg and Speights. But this
was as much to fill her time as to make a dent in her debts.
</P>
<P>
   As the subject of intense public scrutiny, Ms. Lewinsky can't do
much of anything these days, in terms of producing income or
otherwise, except to meet with her lawyers or stay secluded with
one of her parents. When she goes out in public, a fleet of TV
cameras is almost always in tow. Several weeks ago, a camera crew
staked out a bank branch near Speights' office in downtown
Washington, where Ms. Lewinsky had been using a cash machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very disturbed that she has no life right now,'' her
father said in April. ``She's afraid she'll put all of her friends
in jeopardy if she talks to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In part to lift her sagging spirits, Ms. Lewinsky recently posed
in Malibu for a photo spread in Vanity Fair magazine. But according
to a spokeswoman for the magazine, Ms. Lewinsky wasn't paid
anything. And although she got to model some spiffy clothes, she
didn't get to keep them.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, her high-profile dinners at swank Washington
restaurants with the ubiquitous Ginsburg do not appear to have
added to her legal bills; some of the restaurants may have fed them
gratis in return for the publicity of having such celebrated
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is hardly alone in worrying about how to pay her
lawyers. After disbanding his legal defense fund, President Clinton
has established a new fund to help pay the more than $5 million he
owes to his lawyers at Williams &AMP; Connolly and Skadden, Arps, Slate
&AMP; Meagher.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Jones, who sued the president for sexual harassment only
to have her case thrown out of court this year, is in a tussle with
two of her lawyers over $800,000 the lawyers say she owes them. And
a slew of current and former White House aides have amassed
six-figure legal bills as witnesses in Starr's $40 million inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the marquee value of representing a client like Ms.
Lewinsky is considerable, and therefore her new lawyers may be
willing to discount their rates or be patient about getting paid.
There could even be lucrative book offers down the road, but last
week they vowed to maintain a lower profile than Ginsburg, by
avoiding the TV talk-show circuit.
</P>
<P>
   And for the time being, at least, the lawyers are under orders
to scrimp where they can. One specific request: no limousines to
see Starr.

as her principal lawyer until he was dismissed Tuesday; so say
Ginsburg and others familiar with the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Her expensive new retinue, worthy of her star billing in one of
the biggest controversies to rock Washington, is not limited to
Cacheris and Stein. There is also Nathaniel Speights, a Washington
trial lawyer who worked with Ginsburg and will remain on Ms.
Lewinsky's legal team. And a month ago Judy Smith, a respected
lawyer who once worked in the Bush White House, was retained by the
Lewinskys as family spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky grew up in rarefied Beverly Hills and her father,
Bernard Lewinsky, who now lives in nearby Brentwood, is a
successful oncologist. Her mother, Marcia Lewis, long divorced from
her father, has apartments at the posh Watergate complex in
Washington and in New York. But despite being financially
comfortable amid trappings of wealth, family friends say, the
parents are not so rich as to absorb the six-figure legal bills
their daughter is incurring.
</P>
<P>
   In TV appearances, Ms. Lewinsky's father has said he can't
afford them. Appearing on ``Larry King Live'' in April, he
announced that the family had established a legal defense fund for
his daughter, though it hasn't raised much money yet. In an
interview Wednesday, Ms. Smith reiterated that ``the legal bills
have been a tremendous strain for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg has said that Ms. Lewinsky would eventually have no
choice but to write a book or sell her story in order to pay off
her legal bills. But no one has approached her or her family with
any such offer recently. And any tell-all deal would certainly have
to wait until Ms. Lewinsky was out of legal jeopardy, a prospect
probably months away at the very least, if not years.
</P>
<P>
   In part to minimize her legal expenses, Ms. Lewinsky did filing
and other routine office chores for Ginsburg and Speights. But this
was as much to fill her time as to make a dent in her debts.
</P>
<P>
   As the subject of intense public scrutiny, Ms. Lewinsky can't do
much of anything these days, in terms of producing income or
otherwise, except to meet with her lawyers or stay secluded with
one of her parents. When she goes out in public, a fleet of TV
cameras is almost always in tow. Several weeks ago, a camera crew
staked out a bank branch near Speights' office in downtown
Washington, where Ms. Lewinsky had been using a cash machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very disturbed that she has no life right now,'' her
father said in April. ``She's afraid she'll put all of her friends
in jeopardy if she talks to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In part to lift her sagging spirits, Ms. Lewinsky recently posed
in Malibu for a photo spread in Vanity Fair magazine. But according
to a spokeswoman for the magazine, Ms. Lewinsky wasn't paid
anything. And although she got to model some spiffy clothes, she
didn't get to keep them.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, her high-profile dinners at swank Washington
restaurants with the ubiquitous Ginsburg do not appear to have
added to her legal bills; some of the restaurants may have fed them
gratis in return for the publicity of having such celebrated
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is hardly alone in worrying about how to pay her
lawyers. After disbanding his legal defense fund, President Clinton
has established a new fund to help pay the more than $5 million he
owes to his lawyers at Williams &AMP; Connolly and Skadden, Arps, Slate
&AMP; Meagher.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Jones, who sued the president for sexual harassment only
to have her case thrown out of court this year, is in a tussle with
two of her lawyers over $800,000 the lawyers say she owes them. And
a slew of current and former White House aides have amassed
six-figure legal bills as witnesses in Starr's $40 million inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the marquee value of representing a client like Ms.
Lewinsky is considerable, and therefore her new lawyers may be
willing to discount their rates or be patient about getting paid.
There could even be lucrative book offers down the road, but last
week they vowed to maintain a lower profile than Ginsburg, by
avoiding the TV talk-show circuit.
</P>
<P>
   And for the time being, at least, the lawyers are under orders
to scrimp where they can. One specific request: no limousines to
see Starr.

<P>
   SAFRICA-MISSING (Paulpietersburg, South Africa) _ When South
Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission began its work more
than two years ago, it first asked apartheid's victims to come
forward and tell their stories. The early days were grim with tales
of beatings, torture and murder. But in the background were other
victims, like the Mahlombe family. They came humbly forward without
any facts, but with requests for information about missing loved
ones and, in particular, for bodies to bury properly. By Suzanne
Daley.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN-GUNTRADE (Peshawar, Pakistan) _ Peshawar has for
centuries been home to an extraordinary community of gunsmiths.
With skills handed down through generations, they say they are able
to make exact duplicates of any weapon they can lay their hands on.
By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-COUNTERFEIT-FOE (Beijing) _ Wang Hai, 25, a high-school
dropout, has in three years transformed himself into China's first
consumer advocate, and a national hero. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-PILOTSTRIKE (Paris) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said
Saturday that the French government was ready to step in and push
Air France pilots and management to settle a strike that has
grounded most of the airline's flights just as hundreds of
thousands of soccer fans began to pour in for the World Cup soccer
tournament. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-HUMAN-RIGHTS (Bogota, Colombia) _ The recent raid on
the Intercongregational Committee for Justice and Peace, a Jesuit
group, appears to be part of a wave of assaults on the chroniclers
of human rights abuses in Latin America. By Diana Jean Schemo.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-DRUG-STRATEGY (United Nations) _ With President Clinton and
other world leaders coming here Monday for a special session of the
General Assembly on the world's drug problems, the United Nations'
top anti-narcotics official has submitted a two-pronged strategy
that moves beyond the conventional approach of intercepting illegal
drugs and arresting traffickers. By Christopher S. Wren.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (These stories will move with an ``a'' category code)
</P>
<P>
   NEB-HAGEL-TRADE (West Point, Neb.) _ At Harry Knobbe's Feed
Yards the other day, Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., was holding forth on
the global economy, the Asian financial crisis and the
International Monetary Fund with a dozen or so hog and cattle
farmers. Here in Cuming County, one of the largest cattle-producing
counties in the United States, the farmers were hanging on every
word. But getting his fellow senators to focus on international
matters is a lot tougher than holding that discussion with farmers
in a state that exports $1.6 billion worth of farm products to Asia
each year. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-CENSUS (Sacramento, Calif.) _ Since the beginning of
April, temporary Census Bureau employees like Cindy Jumper have
fanned out across Sacramento, interviewing residents in households
that did not return the forms mailed to them in early March. But
the number of households that will be visited is different in
Sacramento than it has been in any previous census. This river city
of about 374,000 is one of three sites where the bureau is
conducting its dress rehearsals for the next census using a method
called statistical sampling, which will be used to estimate the
size and characteristics of its population. By Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   PA-DEATHPENALTY-RACISM _ A new study on racial disparities in
death-penalty cases has found that black defendants in murder cases
in Philadelphia are nearly four times more likely than other
defendants to be sentenced to death, even when the circumstances of
killings are the same. By Fox Butterfield.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-DEATHROW-DILEMMA (Houston) _ As long as there is a death
penalty in the United States, perhaps no man would seem so ripe a
candidate for execution as Henry Lee Lucas, a former drifter now on
Death Row for the rape and murder of a hitchhiker 19 years ago.
Lucas is also serving six life terms, two 75-year terms, and one
60-year term for nine other killings. But as his execution date on
June 30 approaches, Texas officials are grappling with an unusual
legal and political problem. While there is virtually no dispute
that Lucas is a vicious murderer, there is considerable doubt about
whether he could have committed the one murder for which he was
sentenced to death. By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>

   VA-COUNTY-JOBSDRIVE (Martinsville, Va.) _ Henry County, reeling
from factory closings, has launched a campaign to draw attention to
its underutilized workforce. By Michael Janofsky.

<P>
   SCOTUS-STARR (Washington) _ Kenneth Starr's effort to bring
White House aides and Secret Service agents before his grand jury
has provided much of the recent legal drama here. But it is his
pursuit of notes from a lawyer's interview with a man who has been
dead nearly five years that, of all the disputes surrounding the
independent counsel's investigation, could ultimately matter most
to anyone who has ever consulted a lawyer about a potentially
embarrassing problem. By Linda Greenhouse.

ability to galvanize national pride and transfix the globe. A
cumulative television audience of 37 billion is expected. But in
virtually every corner of that captivated globe, a darker side of
soccer has worsened in recent years _ a dispiriting underside
disfigured by tales of lucrative gambling rings, rigged results and
a pervasive erosion of trust. By Jere Longman.

or nurses alone. And while that shift can be beneficial for both
patients and family, it has placed a growing burden on family
members, whose traditional role has been much more oriented toward

   PARIS _ Transportation strikes are an annoying fact of life in
France, yet most people sympathize with the strikers when the
subways shut down or truckers block the highways. After all, truck
drivers and railway workers don't make much money, and employers
seldom penalize workers for not showing up during transit strikes,
so it's easy to wish the strikers well.
</P>
<P>
   But the renowned Gallic sang-froid was severely tested last week
by a strike by pilots at Air France, the state-owned airline, just
days before the nation plays host to the World Cup, the World
Series of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots, whose average annual salary of $123,000 makes them
better paid than their counterparts at other major European
carriers like Lufthansa and British Airways, were protesting a
management plan to trim their pay by an average of $26,000 over the
next three to five years, and replace the income with stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   With Air France, the official carrier for the World Cup, able to
fly only a fraction of its schedule, the French public was
outraged, for the first time in years, by what many saw as greedy
pilots. A poll published by Paris-Match last week showed that only
47 percent of those polled supported holding a transportation
strike during the World Cup. In December 1995, 62 percent of those
surveyed sympathized with striking rail and transport workers; in
November 1996, 74 percent supported striking truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sad and almost ashamed,'' said Interior Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement as negotiators were trying to reach a
settlement before the games kick off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chevenement and Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin were
elected a year ago by voters who never forgave Jospin's
conservative predecessor, Alain Juppe, for trying to cut the
pension benefits of the rail and transit workers in 1995 as part of
an unpopular government austerity plan to prepare for the coming
single European currency. When strikers shut down rail and mass
transit networks, the country was paralyzed, but with Christmas
approaching many workers were just as happy to back the strikers
and stay home.
</P>
<P>
   This time things were different. The irony of a Socialist-led
government criticizing strikers is only one of many contradictions
in the latest episode in France's struggle to pull its cosseted
welfare-state economy into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Chevenement even had to deny rumors that he was considering
calling in the French equivalent of the National Guard to replace
the strikers the way that President Ronald Reagan replaced striking
American air traffic controllers in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The French feel as strongly about soccer as they do about social
justice. Taxpayers put up $450 million for a new stadium in Paris
for the World Cup, and Air France planes have been splashed with
bright color pictures of players from 32 countries. Buses in Paris
display welcome signs in many languages, and special trains have
been arranged to transport fans and players among the 10 cities in
which the 64 games will be played.
</P>
<P>
   France's national honor is at stake, the authorities keep
reminding people. No American-style private-sector improvisation, a
la Atlanta during the last Olympics and Denver during the 1994
World Cup, would do for the glory of France.
</P>
<P>
   With a sense that the eyes of the world were on them, many
French felt indignation when transportation unions started in with
business as usual _ by trying to hold up employers for ransom just
when their work was most needed.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots were not the only ones on the picket lines, though
truck drivers, who shut down the country's roads in 1997 and the
year before to get higher wages, promised they wouldn't think of
inconveniencing their fellow citizens during the World Cup, which
ends July 12.
</P>
<P>
   A union representing 30 percent of the engineers for the state
railway network called a strike to begin on the eve of the Cup
opening. Conductors struck and disrupted rail traffic around the
country Friday. Public transportation in Lyons, where five games
will be played, was shut down by a strike Tuesday, and workers on
the Paris municipal transportation system threatened another for
this week.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the pilots who bore the brunt of public resentment.
</P>
<P>
   The French are notoriously suspicious of people who are better
off than they are, to the point of making anonymous telephone calls
to Finance Ministry inspectors to tip them off to people with
lavish life styles (one reason why owners of luxury homes in Paris
often hide them behind dilapidated building facades).
</P>
<P>
   So it was difficult to muster much sympathy for the well-paid
pilots, who after all were not striking for better wages but
demanding cash instead of stock options as part of their salaries
when Air France is partly privatized later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said it needed to cut its annual payroll by $84
million to make itself more competitive in the European market, but
many French regard the stock market as a sort of untrustworthy
gambling casino. As elsewhere in Europe, there is great resistance
here to the idea of supplementing state pensions with the private
investment plans that make union pension funds such big players in
the stock market in America.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Transportation Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, a
member of the Communist Party, railed against the pilots. ``France,
the company and the World Cup must not be held hostage,'' he told
Parliament as pressure mounted on both the government and the
strikers to settle. ``We must negotiate and we must break this
logjam.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Le Canard enchaine, a left-wing satirical newspaper, lost
patience with the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their maneuvering a week from the Cup, with thousands of
passengers about to pour into the country, could easily be mistaken
for blackmail,'' the newspaper wrote, pointing out that the pilots
also showed little gratitude for the $3.4 billion taxpayers pumped
into Air France during its money-losing years to keep it going and
safeguard the pilots' jobs.

   But the renowned Gallic sang-froid was severely tested last week
by a strike by pilots at Air France, the state-owned airline, just
days before the nation plays host to the World Cup, the World
Series of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots, whose average annual salary of $123,000 makes them
better paid than their counterparts at other major European
carriers like Lufthansa and British Airways, were protesting a
management plan to trim their pay by an average of $26,000 over the
next three to five years, and replace the income with stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   With Air France, the official carrier for the World Cup, able to
fly only a fraction of its schedule, the French public was
outraged, for the first time in years, by what many saw as greedy
pilots. A poll published by Paris-Match last week showed that only
47 percent of those polled supported holding a transportation
strike during the World Cup. In December 1995, 62 percent of those
surveyed sympathized with striking rail and transport workers; in
November 1996, 74 percent supported striking truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sad and almost ashamed,'' said Interior Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement as negotiators were trying to reach a
settlement before the games kick off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chevenement and Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin were
elected a year ago by voters who never forgave Jospin's
conservative predecessor, Alain Juppe, for trying to cut the
pension benefits of the rail and transit workers in 1995 as part of
an unpopular government austerity plan to prepare for the coming
single European currency. When strikers shut down rail and mass
transit networks, the country was paralyzed, but with Christmas
approaching many workers were just as happy to back the strikers
and stay home.
</P>
<P>
   This time things were different. The irony of a Socialist-led
government criticizing strikers is only one of many contradictions
in the latest episode in France's struggle to pull its cosseted
welfare-state economy into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Chevenement even had to deny rumors that he was considering
calling in the French equivalent of the National Guard to replace
the strikers the way that President Ronald Reagan replaced striking
American air traffic controllers in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The French feel as strongly about soccer as they do about social
justice. Taxpayers put up $450 million for a new stadium in Paris
for the World Cup, and Air France planes have been splashed with
bright color pictures of players from 32 countries. Buses in Paris
display welcome signs in many languages, and special trains have
been arranged to transport fans and players among the 10 cities in
which the 64 games will be played.
</P>
<P>
   France's national honor is at stake, the authorities keep
reminding people. No American-style private-sector improvisation, a
la Atlanta during the last Olympics and Denver during the 1994
World Cup, would do for the glory of France.
</P>
<P>
   With a sense that the eyes of the world were on them, many
French felt indignation when transportation unions started in with
business as usual _ by trying to hold up employers for ransom just
when their work was most needed.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots were not the only ones on the picket lines, though
truck drivers, who shut down the country's roads in 1997 and the
year before to get higher wages, promised they wouldn't think of
inconveniencing their fellow citizens during the World Cup, which
ends July 12.
</P>
<P>
   A union representing 30 percent of the engineers for the state
railway network called a strike to begin on the eve of the Cup
opening. Conductors struck and disrupted rail traffic around the
country Friday. Public transportation in Lyons, where five games
will be played, was shut down by a strike Tuesday, and workers on
the Paris municipal transportation system threatened another for
this week.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the pilots who bore the brunt of public resentment.
</P>
<P>
   The French are notoriously suspicious of people who are better
off than they are, to the point of making anonymous telephone calls
to Finance Ministry inspectors to tip them off to people with
lavish life styles (one reason why owners of luxury homes in Paris
often hide them behind dilapidated building facades).
</P>
<P>
   So it was difficult to muster much sympathy for the well-paid
pilots, who after all were not striking for better wages but
demanding cash instead of stock options as part of their salaries
when Air France is partly privatized later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said it needed to cut its annual payroll by $84
million to make itself more competitive in the European market, but
many French regard the stock market as a sort of untrustworthy
gambling casino. As elsewhere in Europe, there is great resistance
here to the idea of supplementing state pensions with the private
investment plans that make union pension funds such big players in
the stock market in America.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Transportation Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, a
member of the Communist Party, railed against the pilots. ``France,
the company and the World Cup must not be held hostage,'' he told
Parliament as pressure mounted on both the government and the
strikers to settle. ``We must negotiate and we must break this
logjam.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Le Canard enchaine, a left-wing satirical newspaper, lost
patience with the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their maneuvering a week from the Cup, with thousands of
passengers about to pour into the country, could easily be mistaken
for blackmail,'' the newspaper wrote, pointing out that the pilots
also showed little gratitude for the $3.4 billion taxpayers pumped
into Air France during its money-losing years to keep it going and
safeguard the pilots' jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When he hit Los Angeles in 1979 as a 19-year-old
Laker rookie, his no-look passes and million-watt charisma turned
the game of basketball into Showtime, lighting up the Forum and
luring a slew of stars courtside to catch his magic.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime ended in 1991 when he shocked the world by disclosing
he was infected with the HIV virus. By then Earvin ``Magic''
Johnson was much more than a basketball player. He was an L.A.
institution, his smile as recognizable as the Hollywood sign.
</P>
<P>
   Now Showtime is back _ only on a different court.
</P>
<P>
   This time Magic _ businessman and AIDS activist _ is host of a
new late-night talk show, and he has new teammates. Gone are Kareem
and James. In are Arnold and Harrison. His opponents no longer
Larry and Michael but Dave and Jay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role I had with the Lakers is the same as I will have as a
talk-show host,'' Johnson said in an interview last week. ``I'll be
setting people up, and making them look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has no illusions that ``The Magic Hour,'' which debuts
Monday at 11 p.m. on KTTV (Channel 11), will be an easy win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get nervous,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   But nervous or not you're talking to a man who never gives up.
He led the Lakers to five National Basketball Association
championships, fought back HIV to the point that it is undetectable
in his blood and has brought jobs to the inner city with a national
chain of movie theaters, the first opening in 1995 in L.A.'s
Crenshaw district.
</P>
<P>
   Now his success will be measured in Nielsen Ratings as his show
will enter the contentious late-night war that has seen the demise
of Dennis Miller, Chevy Chase, Pat Sajak, Keenan Ivory Wayans and a
luke-warm reception for Sinbad.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has blessed me with a third career,'' Johnson says.
``Basketball, business and now this. When I first got here I
thought I'd be a businessman, but not like all this. Building up
the inner city is what I am most proud of. I'm sure I'll be very
proud once the show starts on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   And Magic's charisma is still luring celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Personal requests have secured opening-night visits from Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Whitney Houston, and get this, neither has
anything to promote.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been an ambassador of good in so many areas because he
knows how to use his charm,'' said executive producer Geovanni
Brewer. ``People know he won't put them in an unflattering light.''
</P>
<P>
   In another unusual turn, Jay Leno invited Johnson on ``The
Tonight Show'' last week to promote his new competition because,
``I like him. He's a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Ford, Michael Douglas, Gillian Anderson, Kenny G and
Arsenio Hall are also among first-week guests. In fact, Ford was
taping a ``Tonight Show'' appearance in a studio near to the one
that Johnson was taping his pilot when the superstar actor asked if
he could stop by and meet Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was as excited to meet him,'' Johnson said. ``Hopefully the
enthusiasm will come across to the viewers at home.''
</P>
<P>
   After a personal invitation from Johnson, Ford agreed to appear
on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe they heard that Johnson gave out autographed
basketballs to the guests of his pilot episode, a possible
full-time replacement for the obligatory fruit basket many
talk-show guests receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just love Magic and want to come on to talk to him,''
said Heather Russell, one of the show's bookers. ``A lot of people
are like, `Wow, Magic, I just want to come on.' They admire him,
not just from his basketball days, but because of his whole
entreprenurial aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who lives in Beverly Hills with his wife, Cookie, and
his two children, has become a spokesman for AIDS awareness, and
his foundation has raised more than $8 million to fight the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own battle, Johnson says a new combination therapy of
AIDS drugs has cleared HIV from his system, declaring himself
``healed'' _ not cured.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says he goes to his movie theaters once or twice a week
and that the feedback he gets from patrons make all his efforts
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We help put people to work,'' he said. ``People cry, and laugh
and smile when you go to the different theaters. They are thankful.
They mob me for hugs and high-fives, and say thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the theaters and a proposed shopping center, Johnson
owns Starbucks and TGI Friday restaurant franchises in the inner
cities of Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta.

<P>
   Johnson also recently partnered with singer Janet Jackson to buy
a bank in South Central Los Angeles and is among those trying to
bring the National Football League back to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is generally acknowledged that he has established
himself as a force for good,'' said Councilman Mark Ridley Thomas,
``and he continues to do those kinds of things and frankly it is
incumbant upon us all to encourage him in those pursuits.''
</P>
<P>
   So how will Johnson, as one of the few noncomedian talk show
hosts, face his newest challenge? Like he did as an athlete with a
training camp, taking speech and interviewing lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked on the pronounciation of my words and learned to
really take my time and speak clearly,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He will not, however, do a monologue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a showman, but I'm not a stand-up comic,'' Johnson
says.
</P>
<P>
   But he will be involved in some comedy bits. For instance, he
will do things in public to see people's reactions, Brewer said,
such as serving java in a local coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   Comic Craig Shoemaker will be Johnson's sidekick and
singer/percussionist Sheila E. will be the bandleader.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not deep; it's about entertainment,'' Brewer said.
``He wants people to go to sleep with a smile on their face. That's
what the agenda of the show is.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says he realizes that Leno is television's No. 1 host,
and he has no illusions of upending him. Throughout the process of
putting this show on its feet, Johnson says he has learned that
Leno and other hosts have worked hard to make it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the show doesn't last a year from now,'' Johnson said,
``I'll still be a better person and a better man for having
prepared for it.''

EPA AND STATES FOUND TO BE LAX ON POLLUTION LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho, Alaska, N.M., Wash., Mo.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The inspector general of the Environmental
Protection Agency has documented widespread failures by federal and
local officials in several states to police even the most basic
requirements of the nation's clean-air and -water laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of new reports, the environmental agency's
independent auditing arm found waste-water treatment plants
operating with obsolete permits or with none at all, inspectors
failing to visit and review factories, and states falling short of
federal goals.
</P>
<P>
   The reports blamed both federal and state officials for the
shortcomings. Investigators found that state officials failed to
enforce the laws and to report violations to the federal
government, but they also found that federal officials were remiss
in enforcing the law and in supervising the state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a nationwide examination of environmental enforcement
that began two years ago, the reports point to problems that are
probably not isolated in the relatively few states where audits
were done, senior EPA officials said. Most states may be enforcing
the laws most of the time, the officials said, but the sampling
probably uncovered conditions that exist to varying degrees all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hansen, the EPA's deputy administrator, said in an
interview that the audits showed ``a troubling trend of possible
deficiencies, at least in some states.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to find out why this has happened and how to remedy
the deficiencies,'' he said. ``And that may involve efforts that we
in the EPA have to do differently, as well as things that need to
be addressed in individual states.''
</P>
<P>
   In two states, Idaho and Alaska, the inspectors found that
federal authorities had not issued or renewed hundreds of permits
required for factories and waste-water treatment plants, often for
as long as 10 years. Officials issued only a handful of permits
each year as part of a deliberate policy of focusing attention on a
few major sources of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Very few formal enforcement actions were taken against polluters
in those states when they significantly violated the terms of their
outdated permits, an audit disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, about half the major air-pollution sources as
defined by the Clean Air Act were never inspected from 1990 to
1996. In 1995 and 1996, the state stopped reporting significant
violations of air-quality regulations to the federal government as
the rules required. Even after the federal agency complained and
the reports resumed, the state neglected to report about a third of
the violations.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, where state officials had reported that
only seven of the 178 major air-pollution sources were violating
permits, the auditors sampled 31 locations and found 17 in
violation. The state's inspections were inadequate to meet federal
standards, the auditors found.
</P>
<P>
   In 75 percent of the streams in Missouri, the state did not
adopt the Clean Water Act's central goal of making the water clean
enough for swimming, and ignored the federal requirement for
studies to demonstrate that this 25-year-old goal was unachievable.
</P>
<P>
   The state sets water-quality criteria for several pollutants at
lower levels than the federal government _ without justification _
and ``cannot be sure that the pollutant levels it allows in its
waters will not threaten human health or aquatic life,'' a report
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the reviews, investigators looked at two types of pollution:
emissions into the air from operations regulated under the Clean
Air Act, like factory boilers, and discharges into the water from
operations regulated under the Clean Water Act, like waste-water
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal was to determine whether inspections were being
conducted, permits obeyed and violations reported according to
longstanding federal regulations. As in most such audits, the
inspectors did not disclose the names of most of the pollution
sources they examined; they combined their findings and analyzed
the patterns to describe systematic failures in enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the reports raised questions about the dedication
of the states to enforcing pollution laws and the capabilities of
federal and state workers to keep up with the millions of specific
pollution-control requirements that are intended to govern
emissions from thousands of factories and treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we know what is going on out there?'' one senior
enforcement official at the agency asked. ``And when we do, are we
taking the steps to bring people into compliance? And are we
setting the right priorities?''
</P>
<P>
   While the pollution-control authorities who were criticized in
the documents generally agreed with the reports' conclusions and
promised to fix many of the problems, they appeared in some cases
to be slow in adopting the changes that they had promised, the
inspector general's office reported. The reports were completed in
March and were posted on the agency's Web page
(http://www.epa.gov/oigearth/index.htm).
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes to be told that there were any deficiencies in
their job performance, but I think it's a healthy process,'' said
Philip Wardwell, an assistant general counsel in the Environment
Department of New Mexico, one of the states that were criticized by
the inspector general. ``We accepted what they said with good
grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think EPA needs to do this kind of follow-up to make sure
that the states are doing enforcement evenly and fairly. If one
state clearly has more relaxed standards, then businesses might
flee to those states. That's exactly the function of the federal
agency, to head off that race to the bottom.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The states are responsible for most of the day-to-day
enforcement of federal laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean
Water Act, with the federal government supervising them. But in
some states where the EPA has not delegated its enforcement
responsibilities, the audits found lapses by the federal agency's
regional offices.
</P>
<P>
   A report cited the Boise River in Idaho, where development and
flooding have caused ecological damage along the entire length of
the waterway, especially downstream from the city of Boise.
</P>
<P>
   Five major sources of pollution were found to be operating on
permits that had been automatically extended years ago and were
never updated to meet the stricter requirements of the Water
Quality Act of 1987. They are a meat-packing plant, the city's
storm-water drainage system and the sewage-treatment plants of
Boise, Nampa and Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   (The agency last year sued Armour Meats, the factory operator,
for violations of its permit, but the case has yet to be decided,
regional officials said.)
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Boise was not the exception but the rule in
that region, the audit found. For Idaho and Alaska, the EPA's
regional office in Seattle had written 33 permits in two and a half
years, but there was a backlog of 1,000 permit applications.
Seventy percent of the applications were at least 4 years old.
</P>
<P>
   And although the regional office has adopted an ``aggressive''
plan to issue new permits in the next three years, the report said,
even that will provide new permits for only four out of 10 of the
major pollution sources in the two states.
</P>
<P>
   Regional officials said in an interview that one reason for the
delay in writing permits was that they were trying to coordinate
pollution controls that are placed on highly regulated factories
and water-treatment plants with controls on polluted runoff from
farms and forests, where permits are not required. Otherwise, the
polluters with permits could end up bearing the entire cost of
keeping waterways clean.
</P>
<P>
   Even when pollution discharges were known to violate the terms
of existing permits, the regional EPA office rarely took
enforcement actions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The office took no action against 19 of 25 dischargers in Idaho,
Alaska and Washington that were found to be in ``significant
noncompliance'' with permits for one or more three-month periods
between October 1994 and December 1996. Ten of these dischargers
were out of compliance for two or more consecutive quarters, but
even then officials broke agency rules and failed to explain in
writing why no enforcement action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico's programs for inspecting air-pollution sources and
reporting violations showed problems of the kind that the EPA has
detected in previous audits elsewhere, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The state was unaware of a requirement to inspect all major
sources within a five-year period, and was using software to
schedule inspections that tended to concentrate on the same places
year after year. Meanwhile, inspectors left their jobs and a hiring
freeze created a shortage of experienced inspectors. Finally, the
person responsible for sending reports of violations to federal
authorities left the job and was not replaced; nobody noticed when
the reports plummeted to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the inspector general's office began its audit and
the state resumed reporting violations, the system seemed to be
flawed. Auditors reviewed 28 facilities and found five significant
violators that the state had not detected. Four did not have the
necessary permits, and the fifth was violating its permit. One
facility, built in 1983, operated until November 1995 without a
permit. The next month, the state inspected it and found higher
emissions than were allowed. &QL;

   ``I was as excited to meet him,'' Johnson said. ``Hopefully the
enthusiasm will come across to the viewers at home.''
</P>
<P>
   After a personal invitation from Johnson, Ford agreed to appear
on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe they heard that Johnson gave out autographed
basketballs to the guests of his pilot episode, a possible
full-time replacement for the obligatory fruit basket many
talk-show guests receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just love Magic and want to come on to talk to him,''
said Heather Russell, one of the show's bookers. ``A lot of people
are like, `Wow, Magic, I just want to come on.' They admire him,
not just from his basketball days, but because of his whole
entreprenurial aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who lives in Beverly Hills with his wife, Cookie, and
his two children, has become a spokesman for AIDS awareness, and
his foundation has raised more than $8 million to fight the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own battle, Johnson says a new combination therapy of
AIDS drugs has cleared HIV from his system, declaring himself
``healed'' _ not cured.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says he goes to his movie theaters once or twice a week
and that the feedback he gets from patrons make all his efforts
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We help put people to work,'' he said. ``People cry, and laugh
and smile when you go to the different theaters. They are thankful.
They mob me for hugs and high-fives, and say thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the theaters and a proposed shopping center, Johnson
owns Starbucks and TGI Friday restaurant franchises in the inner
cities of Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also recently partnered with singer Janet Jackson to buy
a bank in South Central Los Angeles and is among those trying to
bring the National Football League back to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is generally acknowledged that he has established
himself as a force for good,'' said Councilman Mark Ridley Thomas,
``and he continues to do those kinds of things and frankly it is
incumbant upon us all to encourage him in those pursuits.''
</P>
<P>
   So how will Johnson, as one of the few noncomedian talk show
hosts, face his newest challenge? Like he did as an athlete with a
training camp, taking speech and interviewing lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked on the pronounciation of my words and learned to
really take my time and speak clearly,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He will not, however, do a monologue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a showman, but I'm not a stand-up comic,'' Johnson
says.
</P>
<P>
   But he will be involved in some comedy bits. For instance, he
will do things in public to see people's reactions, Brewer said,
such as serving java in a local coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   Comic Craig Shoemaker will be Johnson's sidekick and
singer/percussionist Sheila E. will be the bandleader.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not deep; it's about entertainment,'' Brewer said.
``He wants people to go to sleep with a smile on their face. That's
what the agenda of the show is.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says he realizes that Leno is television's No. 1 host,
and he has no illusions of upending him. Throughout the process of
putting this show on its feet, Johnson says he has learned that
Leno and other hosts have worked hard to make it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the show doesn't last a year from now,'' Johnson said,
``I'll still be a better person and a better man for having
prepared for it.''

LAWYER-CLIENT PRIVILEGE FACES A CRITICAL TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr's effort to bring White House aides
and Secret Service agents before his grand jury has provided much
of the recent legal drama here. But it is his pursuit of notes from
a lawyer's interview with a man who has been dead nearly five years
that, of all the disputes surrounding the independent counsel's
investigation, could ultimately matter most to anyone who has ever
consulted a lawyer about a potentially embarrassing problem.
</P>
<P>
   The question, which will be argued before the Supreme Court on
Monday, is whether the age-old attorney-client privilege survives
the client's death. The privilege is the basis for lawyers'
relationships with their clients on the one hand, and with the rest
of the world on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The client in this case was Vincent Foster, the deputy White
House counsel who killed himself nine days after seeking advice
from James Hamilton, a prominent Washington lawyer who took three
pages of notes during the two-hour meeting. Starr is seeking the
notes as part of his investigation into whether presidential aides
lied about any role Hillary Rodham Clinton might have had in the
dismissal of seven employees of the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   But the particular facts and political context are nearly
irrelevant to lawyers across the United States, as well as
organizations speaking for the terminally ill and for the nation's
psychiatrists, whose attention has been riveted on the opinion
issued last year in the case by the U.S. appeals court here.
</P>
<P>
   A privilege long assumed to be one of life's absolutes suddenly
turned out to be, at the end of life, porous and unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Foster had requested, and Hamilton confidently gave, an explicit
promise of confidentiality at the start of their interview on July
11, 1993. But the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled that Starr could have the lawyer's notes as long as
he could persuade a U.S. District Court that he needed them.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the context of disputed wills, where different rules
apply to enable lawyers to make known the wishes of their deceased
clients, this was the first federal ruling to lower the absolute
shield of the privilege. Lawyers say that unless the Supreme Court
overturns the decision, they will have to modify the assurances
they now give their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the fundamental aspects of the lawyer-client
relationship is that the duty of confidentiality lasts forever,''
Steven Krane, a New York lawyer who has served on several
professional ethics committees, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take your client's secrets to your grave,'' Krane, a
partner in the firm of Proskauer Rose, said he had taught his
students at Columbia Law School. ``Now, if a client leaves my
office and is hit by a bus, suddenly everything is potentially
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the appeals court's decision is binding only in the
federal courts here, the case, Swidler &AMP; Berlin vs. United States,
has been the talk of the legal profession. The cover story in the
current issue of The American Lawyer, a monthly magazine, describes
the case as ``one of transcendent importance to lawyers throughout
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association and three other national lawyers
organizations have filed briefs urging the justices to overturn the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   One of those briefs was also signed by the National Hospice
Organization, representing 48 state hospice organizations, and the
American Psychiatric Association, which successfully urged the
court two years ago to recognize a psychotherapist-patient
privilege. Society as a whole benefits from a high level of trust
between lawyers and clients, the briefs all maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association said there were ``hundreds of
thousands if not millions of Americans'' contemplating the likely
imminence of their own deaths. ``Many of these people undoubtedly
have secrets and confidences that, if revealed, would be at the
least highly embarrassing to themselves or their friends and loved
ones,'' but they might want to turn to a lawyer to help sort such
matters out while there is still time, the brief said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Disclosure of sensitive material after death ``can be
devastating to survivors,'' the National Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers said in a brief that the hospice and psychiatric
organizations also signed.
</P>
<P>
   If upheld by the Supreme Court, the brief said, the appeals
court's decision ``will come to bear every time a lawyer counsels a
client'' and a client must decide ``whether to make a full and
candid disclosure to his lawyer of the most highly incriminating,
embarrassing, or otherwise sensitive facts the client possesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no organizations have filed briefs on Starr's side, the
argument is not quite as lopsided as that fact might indicate. A
number of prominent legal scholars over the years have called for a
relaxation of the absolute privilege after the client's death, in
cases of ``exceptional need,'' as the American Law Institute, a
group of scholars and bar leaders, urged in a policy statement
adopted last month.
</P>
<P>
   Those who argue for a flexible privilege are troubled by the
occasional cases in which the truth has quite obviously been
sacrificed for the sake of a dead person's privilege. In a famous
case from Arizona, in 1976, a judge invoked the state law requiring
an absolute attorney-client privilege, to prevent two lawyers from
testifying that a deceased client had confessed to a double murder
for which another man was on trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the notorious Charles Stuart case in Boston in 1990, the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court refused to permit prosecutors
to question the lawyer for a man who had first accused an
unidentified _ and nonexistent _ black gunman of killing his wife,
and who then, as suspicion shifted to himself, jumped from a bridge
to his death a day after consulting the lawyer. The Massachusetts
court cited one of its own precedents, from 1833, insisting that
``the mouth of the attorney shall be forever sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current case, the appeals court limited its holding to
criminal investigations, concluding that because clients face no
criminal liability after their death, the prospect of posthumous
disclosure would not be particularly troublesome. The 2-to-1
majority said it expected ``the chilling effect to fall somewhere
between modest and nil.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's brief asserts that because people can be required to
testify in criminal investigations while they are alive, the only
clients who have anything to fear from the ruling are those who
perjure themselves and fear betrayal by their lawyers after they
die. The other side's ``entire theory is acrid with the odor of
presumed perjury,'' his brief says.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Frankel, a San Francisco lawyer whose 1992 law review
article on the subject has been cited by both sides, said in an
interview that at the heart of the dispute were ``different
visions'' of how a rule permitting posthumous disclosure would
affect the behavior of living people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that once you're dead, you don't care, but you do
care while you're alive,'' said Frankel, who advocates retaining an
absolute privilege. The problem, he said, is that it is ``in the
precise case where the information is juiciest'' that the
prosecutor is likely to assert the greatest need for disclosure,
even as the client is staking everything on the expectation of
confidentiality.

SHOWTIME RETURNING TO L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``a'' national   and ``s'' sports files.) 
By KEITH MARDER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When he hit Los Angeles in 1979 as a 19-year-old
Laker rookie, his no-look passes and million-watt charisma turned
the game of basketball into Showtime, lighting up the Forum and
luring a slew of stars courtside to catch his magic.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime ended in 1991 when he shocked the world by disclosing
he was infected with the HIV virus. By then Earvin ``Magic''
Johnson was much more than a basketball player. He was an L.A.
institution, his smile as recognizable as the Hollywood sign.
</P>
<P>
   Now Showtime is back _ only on a different court.
</P>
<P>
   This time Magic _ businessman and AIDS activist _ is host of a
new late-night talk show, and he has new teammates. Gone are Kareem
and James. In are Arnold and Harrison. His opponents no longer
Larry and Michael but Dave and Jay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role I had with the Lakers is the same as I will have as a
talk-show host,'' Johnson said in an interview last week. ``I'll be
setting people up, and making them look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has no illusions that ``The Magic Hour,'' which debuts
Monday at 11 p.m. on KTTV (Channel 11), will be an easy win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get nervous,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   But nervous or not you're talking to a man who never gives up.
He led the Lakers to five National Basketball Association
championships, fought back HIV to the point that it is undetectable
in his blood and has brought jobs to the inner city with a national
chain of movie theaters, the first opening in 1995 in L.A.'s
Crenshaw district.
</P>
<P>
   Now his success will be measured in Nielsen Ratings as his show
will enter the contentious late-night war that has seen the demise
of Dennis Miller, Chevy Chase, Pat Sajak, Keenan Ivory Wayans and a
luke-warm reception for Sinbad.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has blessed me with a third career,'' Johnson says.
``Basketball, business and now this. When I first got here I
thought I'd be a businessman, but not like all this. Building up
the inner city is what I am most proud of. I'm sure I'll be very
proud once the show starts on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   And Magic's charisma is still luring celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Personal requests have secured opening-night visits from Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Whitney Houston, and get this, neither has
anything to promote.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been an ambassador of good in so many areas because he
knows how to use his charm,'' said executive producer Geovanni
Brewer. ``People know he won't put them in an unflattering light.''
</P>
<P>
   In another unusual turn, Jay Leno invited Johnson on ``The
Tonight Show'' last week to promote his new competition because,
``I like him. He's a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Ford, Michael Douglas, Gillian Anderson, Kenny G and
Arsenio Hall are also among first-week guests. In fact, Ford was
taping a ``Tonight Show'' appearance in a studio near to the one
that Johnson was taping his pilot when the superstar actor asked if
he could stop by and meet Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was as excited to meet him,'' Johnson said. ``Hopefully the
enthusiasm will come across to the viewers at home.''
</P>
<P>
   After a personal invitation from Johnson, Ford agreed to appear
on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe they heard that Johnson gave out autographed
basketballs to the guests of his pilot episode, a possible
full-time replacement for the obligatory fruit basket many

are like, `Wow, Magic, I just want to come on.' They admire him,
not just from his basketball days, but because of his whole
entreprenurial aspect.''

<P>
   Johnson, who lives in Beverly Hills with his wife, Cookie, and
his two children, has become a spokesman for AIDS awareness, and
his foundation has raised more than $8 million to fight the
disease.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Niccolo Machiavelli had it right: never assume the
other guy will never do something you would never do. Too bad
Machiavelli never worked for the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The world might be less dangerous than it is today had the CIA
and its sister intelligence services foreseen India's nuclear tests
last month. Armed with that foresight, the United States might have
been able to forestall a test, as it did back in 1995, and thus
prevent an arms race in one of the planet's least pacific places.
</P>
<P>
   A report last week by retired Adm. David Jeremiah, a former vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, blamed the failure on
systemic flaws in the way the intelligence community gathers and
handles information, trains its thousands of analysts and commands
its $27-billion-a-year empire.
</P>
<P>
   But underlying those failures, Jeremiah said, was a classic
American cultural assumption: ``This `everybody thinks like us'
mind-set.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``underlying mind-set'' was that India ``would behave as we
behave,'' he said. ``We should have been much more aggressive in
thinking through how the other guy thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, U.S. analysts decided that the newly elected
Hindu nationalist political party, the BJP, couldn't possibly be
serious when it campaigned on a nuclear weapons platform.
Westerners saw good reasons for India to eschew testing and
therefore thought Indians must understand their own best interests
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence professionals have a name for this kind of
thinking: mirror-imaging. It is considered one of the most basic
mistakes in the spy manual. ``Mirror-imaging _ projecting your
thought process or value system onto someone else _ is one of the
greatest threats to objective intelligence analysis,'' a senior CIA
officer, Frank Watanabe, wrote last year in Studies in
Intelligence, the agency's in-house journal. ``Avoid mirror-imaging
at all costs,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to follow such counsel led the United States to believe
that Japan would never attack Pearl Harbor and that Saddam Hussein
would never invade Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   But no analyst in the government imagined India testing a
nuclear bomb. ``The amazing thing was the unanimity,'' a senior
State Department official said ruefully. ``There was nobody
anywhere _ no voices _ saying `Watch out!'''
</P>
<P>
   As Watanabe notes, ``When everyone agrees on an issue, something
is probably wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something peculiarly American about the trap of
mirror-imaging. Americans overseas like foreigners to speak, dress,
eat and entertain as Americans do. They may well believe that
everybody also thinks as they do. The whole world buys Big Macs _
so the ideas must come along with them, like a side of fries. This
way of thinking meant that, last month, the United States
government looked down at India from its spy satellites _ and saw
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What does this say about the state of U.S. intelligence? First,
mirror-imaging filled a void. America had few or no spies in India
reporting on the nuclear program. So its analysts had to think
without the benefit of facts.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the CIA does not always teach people to think straight,
said Mark Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House
intelligence committee. ``They don't do a lot of training,'' he
said. ``They say, `Congratulations, you're the Mali analyst, have a
nice day.' They need to spend some time on thinking about how you
think. Very few analysts come by it naturally and almost none are
taught to do it. Crisis-driven as they are, they don't have a lot
of time to step back and say: `Have I missed something? Is this the
right way of thinking?'''
</P>
<P>
   Third, group think grinds top-secret papers into intellectual
pulp, said Angelo Codevilla, a former senior staff member of the
Senate intelligence committee. ``Our intelligence community thinks
in herds _ `Stay close. Don't get out ahead. Don't be thought of as
crazy,''' he said. ``There is a tremendous lack of diversity of
mind. The most typical phrase in an intelligence estimate is `We
believe' _ the corporate belief, the office view, calibrated to
satisfy _ not `I think.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, ``we have a brain-power problem'' in American
intelligence, said Robert Steele, a former CIA officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average analyst has 2 to 5 years' experience,'' Steele
said. ``They haven't been to the countries they're analyzing. They
don't have the language, the historical knowledge, the in-country
residence time or the respect of their private-sector peers.''
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the CIA was not the only outfit in Washington
that had a mirror where its crystal ball should be. So had the
White House, the Pentagon and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's reporting on Pakistan's subsequent nuclear tests
was prescient and precise. But Jeremiah found the CIA misread
India's nuclear ambitions because it was short on insight,
expertise, training and leadership _ a strange state of affairs for
an intelligence agency created to be the deepest think tank in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, the admiral found, was not thinking clearly, and so
deceived itself.

   ``Dog bites man,'' the quintessential nonstory, morphed into a
very newsy sports dream-come-true last week.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, the New York Yankees right-hander, was nipped on the
index finger of his pitching hand by his mother's dog and had to
yield his turn in the pitching rotation to Orlando (El Duque)
Hernandez, newly defected from Cuba. Thus a minor bite by a Jack
Russell terrier named Veronica facilitated the storybook odyssey of
a gifted pitcher, from ostracism in his Communist homeland to a
victorious debut in Yankee Stadium on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Developments on the dog-bite front aren't usually so uplifting.
That was also clear last week _ for in case you didn't notice (and
it's a good bet David Cone didn't) it was National Dog Bite
Prevention Week.

   The close association between humans and domesticated dogs began
at least 12,000 years ago. Since then, people have been intimately
involved in domesticating the wild dog into hunter, guard and
companion. However, the domesticated dog retains many of its wild
instincts, including behaviors that all too often lead to human
attacks. This risk has always been present. Only now, however, are
we beginning to gain a full understanding of the impact of dog
bites on populations.

</P>
<P>
   Recent work by Sacks et al has improved the precision of
national estimates for dog bite-related mortality and for dog bites
receiving any medical attention. For the 10-year period 1979
through 1988, an annual average of about 15 fatal dog attacks was
documented in the United States, with extrapolated estimates
suggesting that as many as 20 per year may have actually occurred.
Based on a random household survey, the Injury Control and Risk
Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
it was estimated that about 800,000 bites occur annually that
require medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Of course, there are many minor bites that
go without medical attention. But by sifting national data on
emergency-room visits, the researchers were able to focus on the
most serious injuries:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The annualized weighted estimate of the incidence of new dog
bite-related injuries seen in U.S. E.D.'s (emergency departments)
was 333,687 (annually) for a rate of 12.9 per 10,000 persons. These
injuries comprised about 0.4 percent of all emergency-department
visits during the study period. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Ages of victims of dog bite-related injuries ranged from younger
than 1 year to 91 years (median age: 15 years). Incidence rates
were significantly higher among children aged 0 to 9 years,
especially among boys. The 5- to 9-year-old male age group had the
highest rate, 60.7 emergency-department visits per 10,000 persons.
The estimated 57,580 dog bite-related visits for boys aged 5 to 9
years represent 3.6 percent of all injury-related
emergency-department visits in this age and sex group.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cases in which body part area could be determined
(about two thirds of the cases), the face, neck and head (combined)
were the leading body-part sites affected (29 percent), followed by
the upper limbs and lower limbs. Among children aged 0 to 9 years,
73 percent of the injuries with attributed injury site were to the
face, head and neck, while all other ages had only 30 percent of
the injuries occur to the head, face and neck. There was a
nonsignificant trend toward a seasonal distribution of the
incidence of dog bite injuries, with the highest rates being
observed during the summer months.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)The researchers urged further study of
high-risk dogs to prevent attacks. But when the American Kennel
Club suggested in a revision of its ``Complete Dog Book'' this
spring that certain dog breeds were unsafe for children, it ran
into a host of objections and had to withdraw the edition. The
question of whether there are bad breeds as opposed to individual
bad dogs is quite complex, says Dr. Leslie Sinclair, director of
Animal Companion Care at the Humane Society. She wrote in the
summer 1997 issue of H.S.U.S. News:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Every animal is an individual and his/her character and
personality traits are determined by much more than genetic
background. Not every border collie is intelligent, nor is every
collie loyal to his/her owner. Certainly, not every rottweiler, pit
bull or German shepherd is a dangerous dog. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Data on human fatalities from dog bites do tend to implicate
specific breeds of dogs as killers. Of the dog breeds or breed
mixes known to have caused human fatalities from 1979 through 1994,
five breeds alone account for more than one of every three of those
deaths _ the pit bull (57), rottweiler (19), German shepherd (17),
Siberian husky (12) and Alaskan malamute (12). . . .
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, data linking breeds with NONFATAL bites are hard
to come by. There is no nationwide reporting agency for animal
bites; therefore, information about which breeds of dogs most
commonly bite is unavailable.

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)So what to do about preventing dog bites?

ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q. If a dog is sleeping in the yard, it is a good idea to
quietly slip by so you don't disturb the dog. True or false?
</P>
<P>
   A. FALSE. Dogs have keen senses; under these conditions, you
would probably startle the dog and increase the possibility of an
attack. The right procedure? Make a soft noise, such as a low
whistle, so the dog won't be surprised. Keep your eye on the dog,
and if you must withdraw, back up slowly and carefully to avoid a
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Turning away and retreating quickly from a dog will probably
prevent you from being bitten. True or false?
</P>
<P>
   A. FALSE. Turning and running often increases the dog's
excitement and provides an opportunity for it to bite while your
back is turned. The proper procedure? Stand your ground initially;
face the dog; use a purse, briefcase, book, coat or jacket as a
shield between you and the dog; and back away slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Q. It's a good idea to carry biscuits to make friends with dogs.
True or false?
</P>
<P>
   A. FALSE. Too often the dog will accept the treat, but still not
accept you. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)But even the Postal Service isn't completely
grim about dog bites, maybe since it has managed to reduce attacks
on its carriers through a variety of precautions. In an address in
Washington to kick off Dog Bite Prevention Week, Michael J. Shinay,
vice president of the Postal Service, noted that when it comes to
dog-bite humor, postal workers have heard it all:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   That brings to mind a classic scene from the movie ``The Pink
Panther Strikes Again'' (1976). Inspector Clouseau is standing at
the front desk of an inn, talking to the innkeeper. A dog lies at
his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does your dog bite?'' he asked the innkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the innkeeper replies.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector reaches down to pet the pup, which promptly sinks
his canines into Clouseau's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Clouseau angrily turns to the innkeeper and says, ``I thought
you said your dog does not bite!''
</P>
<P>
   With a shrug, the innkeeper replies, ``That's not my dog.''

   ``Dog bites man,'' the quintessential nonstory, morphed into a
very newsy sports dream-come-true last week.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, the New York Yankees right-hander, was nipped on the
index finger of his pitching hand by his mother's dog and had to
yield his turn in the pitching rotation to Orlando (El Duque)
Hernandez, newly defected from Cuba. Thus a minor bite by a Jack
Russell terrier named Veronica facilitated the storybook odyssey of
a gifted pitcher, from ostracism in his Communist homeland to a
victorious debut in Yankee Stadium on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Developments on the dog-bite front aren't usually so uplifting.
That was also clear last week _ for in case you didn't notice (and
it's a good bet David Cone didn't) it was National Dog Bite
Prevention Week.

   The sponsors, the U.S. Postal Service and the Humane Society of
the United States, say that each day man's best friend chomps down
on 12,000 Americans _ mostly children, but also 7 postal employees

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 7, moved Saturday in the `a' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds: DOG-BITES-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   RICH-POLITICIANS-REVIEW _ The resounding defeat of Al Checchi, a
half-billionaire businessman who spent $40 million of his own money
in the race for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, prompted a
certain populist euphoria _ a new conventional wisdom across the
land that even in flashy California, money can't buy you voters'
love. By Todd S. Purdum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ISLAM-BOMB-REVIEW _ There is, today at least, no special reason
to believe that Pakistan's newly declared ability to build a
nuclear arsenal will provide a nuclear umbrella for other Islamic
societies, or that those other countries will find it easier to go
nuclear themselves. By Elaine Sciolino. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION-REVIEW _ A statistical look around the world on
abortion shows a complex picture. Assuming that cultural
sensitivities are reflected in laws about abortion, there is a
remarkable divide between richer countries and poorer ones where
abortion and its effects are concerned. By Barbara Crosette. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEDAL-HONOR-REVIEW _ Why they don't give medals of honor
anymore. By Eric Schmitt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-TAX-REVIEW _ Congress is well on its way towards
overhauling the tax-law provisions that push many married couples
into a higher tax bracket than they would be in if they were
single. By Richard W. Stevenson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY-REVIEW _ Monica Lewinsky has her new legal dream team.
She will also surely have bigger bills to go along with the bigger
names now defending her. By Jill Abramson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASHFLOW-REVIEW _ Entertainers are the least of it. Wall Street
is securitizing virtually everything that produces a predictable
stream of cash. Typhoon insurance. Tax liens. Loans for used cars
and fraternity houses. Fax machine leases. Mutual-fund fees. Unused
airline tickets. Movies yet to be made. Even defunct power plants.
By Leslie Eaton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GINGRICH-REVIEW _ Newt Gingrich's brand of eclectic, activist
conservatism fits no distinct Republican mold. Moderates shy from
his confrontational tactics, while House conservatives tried to
oust him last year as too accommodationist. Party pragmatists
consider him too unpredictable and undisciplined. By Alison
Mitchell. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-STRIKES-REVIEW _ Transportation strikes are an annoying
fact of life in France, yet most people sympathize with the
strikers when the subways shut down or truckers block the highways.
By Craig R. Whitney. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CIA-NUCLEAR-REVIEW _ The world might be less dangerous than it
is today had the CIA and its sister intelligence services foreseen
India's nuclear tests last month. Armed with that foresight, the
United States might have been able to forestall a test, as it did
back in 1995, and thus prevent an arms race in one of the planet's
least pacific places. By Tim Weiner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOG-BITES-REVIEW _ Each day, man's best friend reportedly chomps
down on 12,000 Americans _ mostly children, but also 7 postal
employees daily on average _ for a total of more than 4 million dog
bites annually. The cost? Ouch: hundreds of millions of dollars
annually in medical bills and liability claims. A look at some
recent research and literature on the topic.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Niccolo Machiavelli had it right: never assume the
other guy will never do something you would never do. Too bad
Machiavelli never worked for the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The world might be less dangerous than it is today had the CIA
and its sister intelligence services foreseen India's nuclear tests
last month. Armed with that foresight, the United States might have
been able to forestall a test, as it did back in 1995, and thus
prevent an arms race in one of the planet's least pacific places.
</P>
<P>
   A report last week by retired Adm. David Jeremiah, a former vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, blamed the failure on
systemic flaws in the way the intelligence community gathers and
handles information, trains its thousands of analysts and commands
its $27-billion-a-year empire.
</P>
<P>
   But underlying those failures, Jeremiah said, was a classic
American cultural assumption: ``This `everybody thinks like us'
mind-set.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``underlying mind-set'' was that India ``would behave as we
behave,'' he said. ``We should have been much more aggressive in
thinking through how the other guy thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, U.S. analysts decided that the newly elected
Hindu nationalist political party, the BJP, couldn't possibly be
serious when it campaigned on a nuclear weapons platform.
Westerners saw good reasons for India to eschew testing and
therefore thought Indians must understand their own best interests
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence professionals have a name for this kind of
thinking: mirror-imaging. It is considered one of the most basic
mistakes in the spy manual. ``Mirror-imaging _ projecting your
thought process or value system onto someone else _ is one of the
greatest threats to objective intelligence analysis,'' a senior CIA
officer, Frank Watanabe, wrote last year in Studies in
Intelligence, the agency's in-house journal. ``Avoid mirror-imaging
at all costs,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to follow such counsel led the United States to believe
that Japan would never attack Pearl Harbor and that Saddam Hussein
would never invade Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   But no analyst in the government imagined India testing a
nuclear bomb. ``The amazing thing was the unanimity,'' a senior
State Department official said ruefully. ``There was nobody
anywhere _ no voices _ saying `Watch out!'''
</P>
<P>
   As Watanabe notes, ``When everyone agrees on an issue, something
is probably wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something peculiarly American about the trap of
mirror-imaging. Americans overseas like foreigners to speak, dress,
eat and entertain as Americans do. They may well believe that
everybody also thinks as they do. The whole world buys Big Macs _
so the ideas must come along with them, like a side of fries. This
way of thinking meant that, last month, the United States
government looked down at India from its spy satellites _ and saw
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What does this say about the state of U.S. intelligence? First,
mirror-imaging filled a void. America had few or no spies in India
reporting on the nuclear program. So its analysts had to think
without the benefit of facts.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the CIA does not always teach people to think straight,
said Mark Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House
intelligence committee. ``They don't do a lot of training,'' he
said. ``They say, `Congratulations, you're the Mali analyst, have a
nice day.' They need to spend some time on thinking about how you
think. Very few analysts come by it naturally and almost none are
taught to do it. Crisis-driven as they are, they don't have a lot
of time to step back and say: `Have I missed something? Is this the
right way of thinking?'''
</P>
<P>
   Third, group think grinds top-secret papers into intellectual
pulp, said Angelo Codevilla, a former senior staff member of the
Senate intelligence committee. ``Our intelligence community thinks
in herds _ `Stay close. Don't get out ahead. Don't be thought of as
crazy,''' he said. ``There is a tremendous lack of diversity of
mind. The most typical phrase in an intelligence estimate is `We
believe' _ the corporate belief, the office view, calibrated to
satisfy _ not `I think.'''
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, ``we have a brain-power problem'' in American
intelligence, said Robert Steele, a former CIA officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average analyst has 2 to 5 years' experience,'' Steele
said. ``They haven't been to the countries they're analyzing. They
don't have the language, the historical knowledge, the in-country
residence time or the respect of their private-sector peers.''
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the CIA was not the only outfit in Washington
that had a mirror where its crystal ball should be. So had the
White House, the Pentagon and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's reporting on Pakistan's subsequent nuclear tests
was prescient and precise. But Jeremiah found the CIA misread
India's nuclear ambitions because it was short on insight,
expertise, training and leadership _ a strange state of affairs for

   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ They wore baseball caps and golf shirts
and, some of them, hearing aids. They talked about wives and
ex-wives, reminisced about 10-cent bottles of beer and just laughed
a lot. Only the pointed gold medals dangling from their necks
hinted that this was a convention of old heroes.
</P>
<P>
   There was Lewis Lee Millett, his Army crew cut still sharp at
age 77, who in Korea led a bayonet charge up a hill against enemy
fire. And Ronald Ray, 56, who in Vietnam shielded his men from a
grenade by diving in front of it. And Jack Montgomery, a small,
quiet man of 80, who in World War II killed 11 Germans and captured
32 others in a single battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a bunch of old, beat-up soldiers,'' said John Finn,
a Navy lieutenant in World War II, who, at 89, was the oldest of
them all.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving from every corner of the country, the 78 men who
gathered here this weekend represented almost half of the 169
living recipients of the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest
military award for bravery. They had chosen Saratoga Springs for
their convention because of the town's rich military history, and
on Friday they paraded to the cheers of more than 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. George Patton once said, ``I'd give my immortal soul for
that medal.'' He never got the award, which is bestowed by the
president and Congress. Perhaps that helps explain the humility of
most of the men who did. If, in the public imagination, a Medal of
Honor recipient is Gary Cooper as Alvin York or Sylvester Stallone
as Rambo, what is striking in reality is how regular, how ordinary
and unassuming most of the recipients seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something had to be done,'' said Clarence Sasser, 50, an Army
medic in Vietnam, explaining why he crawled through rice paddies
under enemy fire to rescue wounded men in his company. ``Somebody
had to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   They all agreed that the Medal of Honor had transformed, if not
defined, their lives and, for many, thrust them into the public eye
without any preparation. Suddenly, someone like Nick Bacon, a
self-described country boy from Arkansas who fought in Vietnam,
found himself invited to presidential inaugurations, an honor
bestowed on all recipients. But Bacon also discovered that he was
expected to give speeches and be a role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't screw up,'' said Bacon, who is now the director of
veterans affairs for the state of Arkansas. ``You're representing
everybody and everything the medal represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has embraced the attention. Bacon said one Arkansas
veteran shunned any contact with his peers and refused to make
public appearances. Another recipient lives in the South Carolina
mountains, and has broken all contact with other Medal of Honor
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   But for most, the Medal of Honor has bound together men who were
once strangers. Ray now lives on the same street in St. Petersburg
Beach, Fla., as two other recipients from Vietnam, Frank Miller and
Gary Littrell. Others keep in regular contact. But the conventions
of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society are what brings members
together in what they describe as a family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Chartered by an act of Congress, the society was founded in
1958, and, according to its bylaws, the group is required to meet
every two years. But because at least 15 recipients have died in
the last two years, the society has begun meeting every year so
older members will have more opportunities to see one another.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the society held a formal banquet attended by
some of its most famous members, including Vice Adm. James
Stockdale, who was captured during the Vietnam War and inflicted a
near-fatal wound on himself rather than disclose critical
information to his captors. In 1992, he was Ross Perot's running
mate in the presidential campaign. At the banquet, the society
bestowed special honors on former Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas,
himself a World War II veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men arrived the previous night, many of them
bringing wives and children and grandchildren. In the lobby of the
Sheraton Hotel, they greeted each other with handshakes and
friendly heckling. When Montgomery, the World War II veteran,
carried his large piece of luggage through the lobby, another man
joked: ``You sure you don't need any help with that, Jack? Don't be
a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanging up a telephone in the lobby, William McGonagle, 72, wore
a powder-blue jacket with the Medal of Honor patch stitched on the
chest. He had been the commander of the USS Liberty, the American
ship that was attacked in the Mediterranean in 1967 during the Six
Day War between Israel and several Arab nations. Without
explanation, McGonagle said, Israeli jets attacked with rockets and
sprayed napalm. McGonagle stayed on the bridge, despite injuries,
commanding his crew and later navigating the crippled ship to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a shower not long ago, McGonagle noticed that his
washcloth had gotten tangled on his chest. An old piece of shrapnel
had come loose and was sticking through his ribs. When he pulled it
out, he crumpled to the floor of the shower screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my wife for a Band-Aid, and she said, `What do you
need it for?''' he recalled. ```You just took a shower.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Rosser served in Korea and Vietnam. In Korea, he
parachuted into enemy territory, then led repeated attacks on enemy
positions, killing 13 men. But he said he was most nervous when he
received his Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest son of 17 children, Rosser, 68, said he still
receives about 50 invitations to speak each year. He has attended
almost every presidential inauguration and inaugural ball since
receiving his medal. ``I don't think about the war,'' he said. ``I
try not to think about it.''

</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, he and Paul Bucha, a Vietnam veteran who is
the president of the society, visited an assembly of fourth- and
fifth-graders at Dorothy Nolan Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers hushed the fidgeting students at the beginning of the
assembly, but as Bucha began to speak, the children fell silent. He
talked about valor and sacrifice and how the men he had commanded
in Vietnam were actually boys, some as young as 17.
</P>
<P>
   When a small girl in the back of the auditorium asked Bucha if
he had gotten a medal, he realized she couldn't see the Medal of
Honor draped around his neck. So he passed it around to the
students and, in doing so, illustrated the point he hoped to make.
``The medal says I have the potential,'' he told the assembly,
``and since I'm like anybody else, it says that anybody else has
the potential to do something special, something really
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Though recipients include Eddie Rickenbacker, Audie Murphy and
Douglas MacArthur, the Medal of Honor initially was not very
exclusive. It was first presented during the Civil War, and
President Abraham Lincoln offered the medal to an entire regiment
(864 members) as an inducement to remain on active duty. Those
medals were rescinded in 1916, when a military panel established
that a soldier or sailor must exhibit extraordinary heroism in
combat to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason, the panel rescinded the only Medal of Honor
ever presented to a woman, Dr. Mary Walker, a Civil War medic and
surgeon. An early advocate of women's rights, Dr. Walker refused to
give it back. Only 60 years later, long after her death, did
Congress officially restore it to her. A total of 3,408 people have
received the honor, the only American military medal worn around
the neck.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main tasks of current recipients is to insure that
the medal is not misused. Responding to complaints from recipients,
the FBI discovered that the Long Island company that manufactured
the medals, HLI Lordship, was selling them to people who had not
served in the military. In December 1996, the company pleaded
guilty in U.S. District Court in Newark and was fined $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the goals of this society is to protect the integrity
of the medal and the meaning of the medal for the people who
received it to insure that it's not improperly exploited,'' said
Ronald Dake, the executive director of the society.
</P>
<P>
   One of the medal recipients most admired by his peers is Roger
Donlon, the retired Army Special Forces colonel who received the
first Medal of Honor issued during the Vietnam War. With his troops
under heavy attack, Donlon, now 64, fought off enemy gunners and
crawled on his stomach to save wounded soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Donlon is executive director of the Westmoreland Scholar
Foundation, a nonprofit group developing exchange programs between
students in Vietnam and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very close fraternity,'' said Donlon as he
greeted friends in the Sheraton lobby. ``It's kind of hard to
believe it has been 34 years that I've been with this group.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a man named Peter Perry introduced himself and asked Donlon
for his autograph. Donlon signed a copy of the 1,119-page book that
lists the citations of all Medal of Honor recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless,'' Perry said, walking away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Donlon answered. ``He has.'' &QL;

<P>
   Dorothy Knight has dressed up her son's ventilator with three
Mickey Mouse stickers, but there is no hiding the hospital in her
house. A tank of oxygen sits by the crib, a few feet from the
machine that tracks 2-year-old Jimmy's heart rate and blood oxygen
while he sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   She is casual about her dual role as mother and nurse, yet it is
still unsettling when she flips on a little electric pump _ dug out
from a pile of toys _ sticks a catheter through the tracheotomy
tube in Jimmy's throat and then suctions out the excess mucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it in the middle of the mall,'' said Ms. Knight, who
lives with her husband, another son and a daughter in Hicksville,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It is a noble and almost old-fashioned notion that families like
the Knights would care at home for their son, whose brain does not
emit the signals for him to breathe properly while he sleeps. They
would have it no other way.
</P>
<P>
   But like millions of families across the United States, the
Knights find themselves in the midst of what many experts say is a
fundamental shift in health care: Families are performing an
unprecedented amount of technical medical care in their homes, much
of which would once have been provided by doctors or nurses alone.
</P>
<P>
   And while that shift can be beneficial for both patients and
family, it has placed a growing burden on family members, whose
traditional role has been much more oriented toward providing
comfort than actual care.
</P>
<P>
   The causes are many, even if the effects or any concrete idea of
what to do about them remain largely unexplored. Technology has
made even complicated treatments possible at home, from dialysis to
chemotherapy to intravenous feeding or antibiotics. People are
living longer and can require years of care in their homes, often
from adult children with jobs and children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   And in this age of managed care, the intense pressure to reduce
health-care costs has reduced the number of people admitted to
hospitals and shortened hospital stays, which means more care is
being administered by family members who are unpaid and, in many
cases, untrained and unprepared for what is newly expected of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Knight lists her own troubles: a shortage of money and
sleep, worry over endlessly beeping equipment, battles with
insurance companies and a marriage that, she says flatly, has been
worn to the edge of divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a quantum leap for the responsibilities of families,''
said Carol Levine, a medical ethicist in New York City who recently
completed one of the few comprehensive studies of family caregiving
through the United Hospital Fund. ``It's not just that you are
asked to do a little bit more. It's a whole different set of
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levine knows her subject well. In January 1990, she and her
husband, Howard, then 61, were in a car accident in upstate New
York that left him largely paralyzed and with severe brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   As she worked to reconstruct their lives, she became overwhelmed
by practicalities, from ordering supplies _ which often involved
battles with bureaucracy _ to finding a new apartment and
renovating it to accommodate a wheelchair. She also struggled with
her metamorphosis from wife to home nurse, with little help from
doctors, insurance companies or the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something basic not happening here, and I couldn't
believe I was the only one who felt that way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levine's contention _ echoed by a rising chorus of voices in
business, medicine and academics _ is that the role of family
caregivers has been largely dismissed as one that families are
expected to undertake, willingly and lovingly.
</P>
<P>
   But, she maintains, the entire spectrum of caregiving _ from
specialized technical care to the grueling and emotional haul of
caring for a chronically ill relative _ needs to be re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the growing elderly population and the shrinking
number of people in nursing homes have implied a greater
responsibility on the part of family members, even as changes in
Medicare and Medicaid and financial controls by managed-care
companies have made it harder to get professional care in the home.
</P>
<P>
   The health-care system, though, has not fully adjusted to the
growing role of families, she says. And she contends that if the
health-care system benefits financially from the shift, it also has
a new obligation to pay greater attention to family caregivers, at
least through better training and more respect for their work.
</P>
<P>
   To the small extent that caregiving has been discussed by
politicians, many policy-makers have been reluctant to take on the
possibility of more direct help _ like tax credits _ which they see
as a hugely expensive undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is being tackled piecemeal around the country:
Employers are beginning to offer more flexible schedules; medical
schools are rotating residents through homes; hospitals are
increasingly training families for their duties after patients are
discharged; states like California and Pennsylvania have
established programs _ debated in Washington but never passed _ for
``respite care,'' or a sporadic few hours of paid home nursing to
give families a rest.
</P>
<P>
   And many experts say the needs will only grow in the coming
years, as technology becomes ever more sophisticated and the baby
boomers age, with demographically fewer of their own children to
care for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait till they get old,'' said James Weil, a vice president at
Metropolitan Life, who has studied the economic impact of
caregiving on business. ``We haven't seen anything yet.''

</P>
<P>
   The Shift Home
</P>
<P>
   Variety of Factors Help Trend Take Off
</P>
<P>
   The move toward care at home has been building for many years,
but a pivotal moment came in 1981, when President Ronald Reagan
singled out a 3-year-old girl from Iowa, Katie Beckett, at a news
conference. Reagan railed against Medicaid regulations that had
kept Katie, who suffered from viral encephalitis, in a hospital, at
a cost of $12,000 a month, rather than allow her to be cared for at
home, where it would cost $4,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the entire medical system has reoriented itself,
through changes in government rules, advances in medical machinery
and family members who have demanded that their ill relatives be
cared for at home. More recently, managed-care companies and
hospitals conscious of the bottom line have weighed in, pushing to
get patients home faster and, many critics contend, sicker.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an explosion in family caregiving, which
involves large commitments of time, for a range of chores from
cooking and cleaning to more burdensome and complicated medical
routines.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, a poll by the National Alliance for Caregiving, a
consortium of advocacy groups for the elderly, based in Washington,
found that the number of people providing free care to a family
member or friend grew to 21 million, up from 7 million in 1987.
(That increase is considerably above the 21 percent rise in the
population of people over 65 in the same period.)
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that 72 percent of caregivers are women _ in
Washington, caregiving is often tagged as a ``woman's issue'' _ and
that more people are caring for relatives who do not live with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Few people, from family members to doctors and insurers,
question that this shift has been largely for the good. Experts say
there are few horror stories of people dying or becoming much
sicker as a result of their care at home.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for sick people say managed-care companies often
turn down patients for paid home nursing, and increasingly expect
family members to provide care, even in cases where family members
are incapable because, for example, they live too far away or have
substance-abuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are asking is `When do you want to take your child
home?' rather than `Do you want to take your child home?' or `Are
you able to take your child home?''' said Dr. Arthur Kohrman, a
Chicago pediatrician who has written extensively on the
difficulties of caring for sick children dependent on technology.
``Parents who feel they can't accomplish it, it puts them in the
position of immediately being inadequate or being seen as uncaring
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``we are asking them to care way beyond the
normal evidence of what a caring parent is.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in fact, one of the many difficulties of family caregiving
is a confusing shift in family roles: Children must baby their
grown parents. Parents, in a wrenching exaggeration of the
conflicts of normal parental roles, must at times inflict the pain
and discomfort of medical procedures on the very same children they
must also comfort and calm.
</P>
<P>
   In an extreme example, Regina Cunningham, 41, of Lynbrook, N.Y.,
considered herself squeamish before her daughter, Katie, was born
with intestines that did not function properly, ultimately
requiring a transplant. But over the years, Ms. Cunningham has
tended to drains in her daughter's stomach, wrestled with tubes in
her chest and with pumps for food or antibiotics, and learned to
spot infection before doctors did.
</P>
<P>
   Katie, now 9, seemed perfectly healthy on a recent evening as
she played with two friends and showed off her headstands. But Ms.
Cunningham still must insert a catheter into Katie's bladder three
times a day _ and she remains angry at what she feels was
inadequate training from doctors, and is exhausted from duties that
have left her with chronic back problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very stressful,'' she said. ``Was I doing the right
thing? I really wasn't an expert. Was I doing everything that she
needed?''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Routine
</P>
<P>
   Caregivers Contend With Many Machines
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Kaufman of New York said she, too, has had a hard time
caring for her husband Jack, 70, a survivor of Auschwitz who came
to New York, married her and opened a kosher butcher shop. After
his second stroke in 1995, he had a feeding tube implanted in his
stomach, and the machine only added to his wife's heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kaufman said a nurse spent less than five minutes showing
her in the hospital how to use the machine; then a home nurse tried
again after her husband's discharge. But she could not make sense
of exactly what she had to do, even though she was acutely aware
that her husband's survival depended on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You understand, I'm 64 years old,'' Mrs. Kaufman said. ``In my
time, I've never learned anything about computers. And all these
buttons!
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terrified. Then it beeps. It makes noise. Every time it
beeps, I curse the machine. I'm afraid of it. Little by little, the
machine broke. Then they brought in a second one, in a different
style. And I cursed that one, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second machine lasted a little longer. And the second one
broke. Then they brought me the third machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, she has not had to contend with a fourth. ``By that
time, maybe, I was a little more experienced,'' added Mrs. Kaufman,
who later started a support group through Well Spouse, an
organization for husbands and wives of the chronically ill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Kaufman said she could never put her husband in a
nursing home, and as trying as the situation is, she said it is
better to have him home. Because of the advantages patients have at
home _ in familiar surroundings, away from the sterile atmosphere
and risk of infection in hospitals _ many cases of caregiving prove
much more joyous than painful, even if families are providing care
in a way that would have been unheard-of only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Randi Rosenberg, a 32-year-old executive in New York, recently
was given a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer and underwent a
lumpectomy at Beth Israel Medical Center. She was sent home the
same day, by a surgeon who began advocating same-day release on
therapeutic grounds long before managed care.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, her partner, Andrew Gardner, 39, was expected to
collect the fluids from the drain in her wound, something rarely
required of families several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't particularly hard,'' said Gardner, a systems analyst
who praised the hospital training. ``It was a little gross.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenberg said she was grateful to be able to recuperate at
home, where she was visited by friends and could lounge on the roof
deck of her apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be here than in the hospital,'' she said. ``Your
environment plays a big part in your recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail and David Loomar of Yardley, Pa., find the push toward care
in the home, which in their case requires a high level of
technology, liberating. They also underscore why care at home can
be easier for some: the young, people comfortable with technology
or those who already have some connection with the medical system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Ms. Loomar, 57, was given a diagnosis of colon cancer.
She now receives two types of chemotherapy, which are administered
at home rather than at the hospital, where she would have had to
spend hours on successive days for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In one, the drugs are fed to her liver through a pump the size
of a hockey puck implanted in her abdomen. In the second, the drugs
are fed through a tube implanted below her left collarbone that
hooks up to an external pump, which she wears in a fanny pack.
</P>
<P>
   There is no maintenance for the implanted pump. But at the end
of each cycle of medication, her husband, 63, who is a dentist and
is accustomed to medical equipment, tends to the portable pump.
Pulling the equipment from a shopping bag, he closes off the pump
and flushes the tubes with a saline solution, then with an
anti-coagulant. With that, his duties are finished until the next
round of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, thank God,'' Ms. Loomar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I go to work,'' her husband said. ``That's the extent of
my caregiving.''
</P>
<P>
   The Future Course
</P>
<P>
   Small Incentives, Not Big Programs
</P>
<P>
   It is a sign of the times that even the strongest advocates for
helping caregivers talk little about ambitious programs like tax
credits, more government home care or even some direct payments to
families. This is true, even as some of the same experts predict a
return to greater _ and costly _ institutionalization, if the
burdens on families grow too heavy as the elderly population
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want this debate to be a debate about something
that requires a major new cash infusion from the system,'' said
James Tallon Jr., president of United Hospital Fund. ``That
distracts people from what could be very positive steps that are
well within the purview of people delivering services, people
financing services, to make incremental, important changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levine, Weil of Metropolitan Life, and others say many of
the problems could be overcome by those small initiatives: better
training in hospitals for caregivers; more flexibility from
employers; a greater recognition from doctors and hospitals that
families are a central part of patients' care.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there have been small steps: In 1993, the Family and
Medical Leave Act allowed millions of employees to take up to 12
weeks' unpaid leave a year. Weil has been working to persuade
employers to help their workers who are caregivers. The goal is to
stem the huge cost to business _ about $12 billion a year,
according to a Metlife study _ through caregivers who arrive late,
leave early or are too exhausted to focus on work.
</P>
<P>
   On the theory that policy-makers cannot focus on anything
without a price tag, Ms. Levine's study estimated the economic
value of caregiving, with numbers from Peter Arno, an economist at
Montefiore Medical Center in New York. Using three national studies
that showed the number of people caring for adults at between 23.6
million and 27.4 million, Ms. Levine and Arno estimated the
economic value of caregiving to be between $113 billion and $286
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, total expenditures for paid home care are $30
billion a year. Nursing-home care costs $79 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, Ms. Levine says, the numbers are big enough to
prompt a deeper look at caregiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendously isolating existence,'' she said. ``And in
terms of the health-care system, there is a void.''

VICTIMS' GRAVES TELL GRIM STORIES OF APARTHEID 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAULPIETERSBURG, South Africa _ Before going to the cemetery,
Bafana Mahlombe's family gathered in front of the police station
here, laughing and joking about the 22-year-old they remembered. He
had been short and muscular. He hadn't talked much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had crossed teeth in front, like my mother,'' said his
sister Magdeline, a librarian in Durban. ``He had her whole face,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   When he went off to fight apartheid in the armed wing of the
African National Congress, he promised that he would go down
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   That was 15 years ago, and his family never saw him again. Rumor
had it that he died three years later in this town at the hands of
the security police. But the Mahlombe family never got official
word. All those years, they wondered what had really happened to
him and worried that his spirit was not at rest.
</P>
<P>
   Now they were here to watch the exhumation of a pauper's grave,
No. 281, which according to local morgue records was where Bafana
Mahlombe had been since 1986. It was time to take him home, they
said. Time to put him in a grave next to his mother's.
</P>
<P>
   When South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission began
its work more than two years ago, it first asked apartheid's
victims to come forward and tell their stories. The early days were
grim with tales of beatings, torture and murder.
</P>
<P>
   But in the background were other victims, like the Mahlombe
family. They came humbly forward without any facts, but with
requests for information about missing loved ones and, in
particular, for bodies to bury properly.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the commission has exhumed more than 50 bodies, some on
the edges of rivers or in isolated farm areas where the victims
were brutalized and killed. Many have been found because security
officials confessed to killing them to get amnesty from the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the graves themselves do the talking. In one case,
investigators digging for three bodies found 12. In another,
amnesty applicants said one victim had died of a heart attack
during a torture session. But when her body was unearthed there was
a bullet in the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bodies tell us a lot,'' said Gail Wannenburg, the
investigating officer supervising the Mahlombe case. ``If a police
officer is claiming that someone was shot because he was holding a
grenade, then the body should show signs of that, assuming the
grenade went off. We can also see broken bones and what kind of
condition they were in when they died. There is a lot of
information there.''
</P>
<P>
   Escorting the family to the grave, Ms. Wannenburg said she
believed she had all the facts in this case. Most police records
were illegally destroyed in the last days of apartheid rule, but
local morgue records remained. Bafana Mahlombe's death was recorded
there, along with those of four other guerrillas who probably
sabotaged local power stations and oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
   The records said he had been shot by police officers hunting him
down by helicopter as he ran through the fields nearby. His body
had been stripped and buried in black plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The stripping was unusual, Ms. Wannenburg said. But in the
record, at least, there was nothing else indicating that his
killing was more than a routine act of the police department, whose
tactics during the low-level guerrilla war of the 1980s shifted
from pursue-and-arrest to a more military style search-and-destroy.
</P>
<P>
   At the grave in the rundown cemetery in the black section of
town, the mood was somber. Nelson Mahlombe knelt among the tiny
enamel markers, talking softly to his brother before the digging
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here now to take you home,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the exhumations have been huge press events and showcase
gatherings of African National Congress leaders. But Bafana
Mahlombe was just a young soldier. Still, local congress officials
were out in numbers, and members of the congress' Women's League
gathered to sing traditional songs and help the family through the
hourlong wait before the body was found.
</P>
<P>
   When the family said they were ready, the grave diggers lifted
the black plastic sheeting, laid it on the ground and unwrapped the
bones.
</P>
<P>
   After staring in silence for a minute, Magdeline and Nelson
Mahlombe asked to see the teeth so they might be sure the body was
their brother's.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Fanie Molapo, who heads the commission exhumation team,
obliged, rummaging through the bones for the jaw. He found broken
pieces of skull that suggested Bafana Mahlombe had suffered massive
head injuries, he said. Inside the bag, too, were knotted ropes
indicating that he had been tied up when he died. The family
members argued over the teeth that could be found, with the older
members finally convincing the younger ones that they were indeed
Bafana's.
</P>
<P>
   Before the afternoon was over there was evidence that all five
of the people buried here had probably been shot at close range,
most of them through the forehead.
</P>
<P>
   The Truth Commission, which was created to help this country put
its brutal past to rest without the cost of expensive and
politically divisive trials, is supposed to finish most of its work
by the end of July and publish its report. But with limited money
it is unlikely to resolve all the mysteries of the era, and family
members doubt they will ever know exactly what happened to Bafana
Mahlombe.
</P>
<P>
   The commission does pay for the exhumation, however, and $500
toward the cost of reburial.
</P>
<P>
   In the late afternoon, when the bones had been placed in a
proper coffin, the Mahlombe family said they were finally
satisfied. Like many Zulus, they believe that a spirit not put to
rest will haunt the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, for many years now we have had a lot of trouble in
our family,'' said Magdeline Mahlombe. ``Now, I think it will be
better. How could he be at peace buried like that and with his
hands and legs tied?
</P>
<P>
   ``He will lie better now, and we will be a bit relieved. But we
won't be happy.''

FRENCH GOVERNMENT READY TO PUSH AIR FRANCE STRIKE SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Saturday that the
French government was ready to step in and push Air France pilots
and management to settle a strike that has grounded most of the
airline's flights just as hundreds of thousands of soccer fans
begin to pour in for the World Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   With Air France the official carrier of the games, which start
here on Wednesday, the strike over a management demand that its
highly compensated pilots take a $26,000 pay cut in exchange for
company stock has embarrassed the country.
</P>
<P>
   The strike began last Monday, and negotiations broke off early
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the World Cup that concerns me,'' Jospin said.
``It's the recovery under way of the company and its future. I
believe everyone must be concerned about this, and for that reason
if the government can be useful, naturally respecting the autonomy
of the management, we will play a role in the hours to come.''
</P>
<P>
   After skirting bankruptcy in 1994, the airline merged its
operations with those of Air-Inter, the state-owned domestic
airline. Last year it went into the black for the first time since
1989, with a profit of about $414 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Jospin's Socialist coalition government canceled the
previous leadership's plan to privatize the state-owned carrier,
prompting the chief executive who had presided over the airline's
recovery, Christian Blanc, to resign in protest. The government
decided in February to sell 20 percent of the shares to employees
and private investors later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the prime minister's office said that he had not
yet decided what to do, but it was thought that he might appoint a
mediator.
</P>
<P>
   The main pilots' union said some progress had been made toward
an agreement that would meet the airline's demand for a savings of
$84 million over three to five years in the salaries of its 3,200
pilots. Management says it needs the savings to compete with more
efficient carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Air France says it now pays the highest pilot salaries in the
world, an average of more than $10,000 a month counting payroll
taxes and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   With the government's backing, the airline had proposed giving
shares in the company when 20 percent of it is offered to public
investors. The daily Le Monde said the pilots were close to
accepting an agreement, if it was voluntary and if they received a
guarantee of what the stock they got would be worth.
</P>
<P>
   Management, now under Jean-Cyril Spinetta, has said it will give
up a two-tier salary system if new pilots reimburse the company for
their training expenses. Under the two-tier system, newly hired
pilots start at an average of $53,000 a year, $5,000 less than the
previous minimum starting salary.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, negotiators for the union that represents all
but 600 of the pilots stormed out of the talks at Charles de Gaulle
Airport outside Paris without explanation. Later, the union accused
management of trying to reach a deal separately with a minority of
the pilots, and warned that doing so would only deepen the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not find an agreement on Monday, then I would say
that the World Cup will start without Air France planes,'' said
union chief Jean-Charles Corbet.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has said it will take at least two days to get
schedules back to normal after a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, Air France has canceled most of its European
flights, and many trans-Atlantic passengers have found themselves
booked on other carriers, from British Airways to Pakistan
International Airlines, despite assurances that their planes would
fly as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Cup will go ahead as usual,'' Jospin said. ``The
French do not need to take a plane to go to the matches, nor do
Europeans, while there will be plenty of other airlines to bring
everyone else here instead of Air France.'' &QL;

THE PERILS IN REPORTING ON RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The score of soldiers and military officers
who stormed a human rights organization here recently _ holding
guns to the heads of workers, forcing them to their knees and
filming them _ said they had no shortage of reasons for the
assault.
</P>
<P>
   The troops said the organization, the Intercongregational
Committee for Justice and Peace, a Jesuit group, was a front for
Communist guerrillas, harbored explosives and weapons and had a
vague involvement in the killing of a former defense minister. Two
men suspected of being rebels had been seen frequenting the
committee's house, the soldiers said.
</P>
<P>
   But the real reason for the raid, the committee said, was
revealed by the soldiers, who went straight to the offices upstairs
where researchers have been detailing 40,000 cases of torture,
forced disappearances and killings in the 30-year-long civil war
here.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 minutes the soldiers videotaped screen after screen of
testimony on the computers, eventually locking out the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the committee said the soldier told them, ``We came
for this, and we're not going to leave without it.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony is part of a project that the group was preparing,
called Nunca Mas, or Never Again. It was conceived much like a
report from Guatemala with that name that chronicled
state-sponsored brutality and ended with the killing of a bishop,
75, the day after he issued his four-volume report.
</P>
<P>
   The raid on the committee appears to be part of a wave of
assaults on the chroniclers of human rights abuses in Latin
America. Another was in April at the office of the Mothers of the
Plaza del Mayo in Buenos Aires, a repository for the records of
30,000 cases of torture and forced disappearances in the seven
years of military dictatorship in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   In Bogota, a human rights lawyer who spent 12 years
investigating the military's actions in the guerrilla siege of the
Justice Palace in 1985 was killed in April in his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Eduardo Umana, had said that he had proof that the
military had executed 50 rebels after having interrogated and
tortured them, and that the people trapped in the siege like judges
and cafeteria workers were killed by military gunfire, not by the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cases in Argentina and Guatemala appear to have
involved atrocities in wars that have ended, the war here rages on.
Last year the United States agreed to renew material aid to the
Colombian army, provided that any unit that received aid divulge
accusations of human rights abuses against its members and
demonstrate that steps were being taken to hold the members
accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's very clear is they want to destroy this work,'' said
the Rev. Javier Giraldo, 59, the president of the Committee for
Justice and Peace. ``How? We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Giraldo said that the soldiers had videotaped all the rooms,
stairs and windows and that they had told him that they intended to
build a model of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they're going to strike us again or bomb us,'' Giraldo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of other human rights workers and government
officials involved in trying to end the violence in Colombia,
Giraldo said he believed that he was a marked man.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers who searched the office were from the Fifth
Brigade, whose commander, Gen. Rito Alejo del Rio Rojas, called
Giraldo a subversive because he had investigated military
complicity with paramilitary death squads in Uraba when Alejo was
in command there.
</P>
<P>
   Alejo was reportedly among 13 Colombian military officers and
agents who recently lost their U.S. visas, although both he and the
United States have declined to comment on the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have circulated about a list of people singled out for
death, some of whom have already been killed. Others like the head
of the Presidential Peace Commission, Daniel Garcia-Pena, have
found reasons to leave the country. Others sleep in a different
place each night.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by government agencies, human rights groups and
reporters during the two-hour raid, the chief prosecutor ordered it
suspended, but the military commanders ignored that.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Alfonso Gomez Mendez, and the military leader,
Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett, declined repeated requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   No weapons or rebels were found in the raid. &QL;

KEEPING THE DARK SIDE OF SOCCER AWAY FROM THE CITY OF LIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As the United States prepared for a World Cup soccer
qualifying match against El Salvador in November, John Harkes and
Roy Wegerle, two of the team's top players, received an alarming
telephone call at the team hotel in Providence, R.I. The caller
suggested that the players could make money by throwing their game
against El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   The American players reported the anonymous call to Coach Steve
Sampson, but they never determined whether it was a serious attempt
at a bribe or a prank. While the Americans were disturbed, they
were not entirely surprised. Nor was anyone else involved in
international soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough proof in the past, not necessarily at the
World Cup, but at the club level, that these things have taken
place,'' Sampson said. ``Referees have been bribed and players have
been given incentives to throw matches.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the World Cup, the 32-team tournament and ultimate
championship in the world's most popular sport, will start, and
with it will come celebrations of soccer's ability to galvanize
national pride and transfix the globe.
</P>
<P>
   But in virtually every corner of that captivated globe, a darker
side of soccer has worsened in recent years _ a dispiriting
underside disfigured by tales of lucrative gambling rings, rigged
results and a pervasive erosion of trust. In the last year alone,
allegations of fixed matches in domestic club leagues have been
investigated in Russia, China, Greece, Israel, Belgium and Vietnam,
all coming as the economy of soccer _ experts estimate it as a $400
billion-a-year industry _ grows more enormous.
</P>
<P>
   In Bulgaria, the government announced last month that it was
assuming control of the national soccer federation because of
widespread corruption and incompetence. In November in Greece, 123
members of Parliament backed a public statement concluding that
``championships in all divisions and team standings'' were being
``cooked up in backstage deals.'' Two months ago in Russia, Pavel
Sadyrin, who coached the country's 1994 World Cup team, told the
national soccer federation that ``there were, still are, and, alas,
always will be, rigged matches as long as the country does not
follow the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Vietnam, soccer fans are infuriated over concerns that
bookmakers, through bribes to players and referees, are fixing the
results of club league games. In fact, the Vietnamese soccer
federation recently refused to validate the score of a match
between teams from Hanoi and Haiphong because of widespread
suspicions of rigging. ``Our players have to relearn the spirit of
sport and understand that we don't play matches using deceit,''
Nguyen Tai Ngo, a member of Vietnam's committee for sports and
gymnastics, said in an Agence France-Presse report.

   ``These are merely reflections of the vastly increasing richness
of the game,'' Paul Gardner, a columnist for the magazine Soccer
America and one of the foremost authorities on the sport in the
United States, said of the spread of game-fixing scandals. ``There
is an obscene amount of money in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   While there has never been a confirmed fixing scandal in the
World Cup, the rash of recent investigations has prompted FIFA, the
French initials used to identify soccer's world governing body, to
install safeguards before the start of the tournament on Wednesday.
For example, teams and the 67 referees involved in the tournament
will stay in secure hotels or on isolated floors of hotels,
theoretically apart from danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course this is a matter of concern, but we are not
expecting serious problems,'' Michel Zen-Ruffinen, FIFA's deputy
executive director, said of the prospect of a scandal. ``There
would be serious sanctions taken. We expect people to be aware that
it is not worth destroying a career to accept money. We believe the
pride of playing for a country is stronger than the desire to
receive money.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, though, the World Cup has not been immune from
problems _ both real bribe attempts and suspicious matches.
</P>
<P>
   A Costa Rican referee, Rodrigo Badilla, was suspended from the
1998 World Cup, Zen-Ruffinen said, for failing to sufficiently
report a $50,000 bribe attempt aimed at him to fix a qualifying
match in October between Japan and the United Arab Emirates.
Badilla, who refereed the 1994 World Cup in the United States, hung
up on the caller who mentioned the bribe, and he was not suspected
of having tainted the match, Zen-Ruffinen said. However, Badilla
reported the matter only to another referee and not to FIFA
officials, Zen-Ruffinen said.
</P>
<P>
   This was the only reported case of attempting to bribe a referee
in 700 qualifying matches for the 1998 World Cup, Zen-Ruffinen
said.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA officials are particularly sensitive to attempts to
compromise the game officials because they wield enormous control
in such a low-scoring sport with the right to call, or not call,
penalties. Some soccer experts say they believe referees are
vulnerable because their salaries have not kept up with the
millions paid to top players.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another top referee, Kurt Rothlisberger of Switzerland, who
worked the 1994 World Cup and was removed after a controversial
no-call on an apparent penalty during a Belgium-Germany match, was
banned for life last year for allegedly demanding $60,000 to help
fix a 1996 European Champion League match.
</P>
<P>
   Just as worrisome to FIFA is the mere perception of rigged
games. During qualifying for the 1998 World Cup, the coach of El
Salvador, Milovan Djoric, was twice suspended for contending that
the referees had helped Mexico in its matches with El Salvador.
Horace Burrell, the president of the Jamaican soccer federation,
threatened last fall to sue the Salvadoran federation over its
suggestions that Jamaica may have offered bribes to the Salvadorans
to throw a qualifying match against Jamaica in November. The
Salvadorans later apologized and admitted the Jamaicans were
guiltless.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly disquieting incident took place in Qatar at the
1995 World Cup for players under 17 years of age. According to
Zen-Ruffinen, some players had been offered gifts by men thought to
be part of a Malaysian betting syndicate, three of whom were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not asking the players to do something in
exchange,'' Zen-Ruffinen said, adding that the players had allowed
the men to take photographs. ``The idea, most surely, was to use
the pictures at a later stage when these players became famous,
presumably in a case of extortion or something like that,''
Zen-Ruffinen said.
</P>
<P>
   In one preventive measure, match assignments for referees at
this World Cup will be handed out with little advance notice, and
referees traveling to matches will be accompanied by security
guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been approached,'' said Esse Baharmast, the lone
American referee assigned to this World Cup. ``If there is a
strange phone call coming in, the first thing I would do is go to
the authorities and tell them what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, the American coach, said he understood the need for the
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really concerned about it, but I don't want to be
naive,'' he said. ``When so much is at stake financially for
individuals and for countries, when literally the image of an
entire nation is resting on the results of how a team fares in the
World Cup, there is bound to be at least the perception that there
will be those kind of incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer experts say that there is nothing inherently corrupt
about the game, but rather that corruption in soccer is reflective
of the money and popularity of the sport and consistent with the
corruption found at many levels in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   With widespread television exposure, soccer also has become
hugely popular for bettors. In Thailand, where two men were given
three-month sentences in May for operating an illegal soccer
betting racket, a research center estimated that $1 billion would
be bet in that country alone during the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In January, 12 of China's top clubs admitted in a newspaper
survey that they had offered cash bribes to referees, some of whom
had accepted. In April, two soccer players were arrested in Vietnam
for fixing league matches last year, and published reports said up
to 74 players and team officials were suspected of rigging games.
And the Italian Parliament was suspended on April 29 when a scuffle
broke out among elected officials over the credibility of the
refereeing in a match that had significant implications for the
Italian season.
</P>
<P>
   A match-fixing scandal at the 1998 World Cup would be a painful
embarrassment for the French, who suffered through the most
notorious example of match-fixing in recent years. Bernard Tapie,
the former French urban affairs minister, was sentenced to a year
in prison in 1995 for fixing a 1993 match involving the team he
owned, Olympic Marseilles.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, two World Cup matches have aroused
suspicion of rigging. In 1978, Argentina needed a four-goal victory
over Peru to advance ahead of Brazil _ total goals counted in the
formula for advancement _ and into the final against Holland. When
Argentina won, 6-0, Brazilian reporters pointed out that the
Peruvian goalkeeper, Ramon Quiroga, was a native of Argentina.
Quiroga has continued to deny any foul play. FIFA has since changed
the tournament format to single elimination after the first round.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1982 World Cup, a 1-0 victory by West Germany over
Austria sent those two teams to the second round on goal
differential ahead of Algeria. West Germany scored early, and
neither team made any real effort to score again. To avoid this
situation again, FIFA now schedules all final games in the first
round at the same time, so teams cannot know in advance how many
goals will get them to the next round.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rothenberg, president of the United States Soccer
Federation, said he doubted games would be thrown at the 1998 World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm the classic, naive American,'' he said, ``but I
believe when players step on the field, they play hard and want to
win.'' &QL;

MAN WHO DESERVES TO DIE MAY NOT DESERVE EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As long as there is a death penalty in the United
States, perhaps no man would seem so ripe a candidate for execution
as Henry Lee Lucas, a former drifter now on death row for the rape
and murder of a hitchhiker 19 years ago. The victim, never
identified, was known as ``Orange Socks,'' a reference to the only
items of clothing left on her body when it was discovered in a
culvert off a Texas freeway.
</P>
<P>
   The notorious Lucas is also serving six life terms, two 75-year
terms, and one 60-year term for nine other killings, and in the
1980s he claimed to have committed up to 600 murders across the
United States. ``I filleted some of them like fish,'' was his
gruesome boast.
</P>
<P>
   But as his execution date on June 30 approaches, Texas officials
are grappling with an unusual legal and political problem. While
there is virtually no dispute that the 62-year-old Lucas is a
vicious murderer, there is considerable doubt about whether he
could have committed the one murder for which he was sentenced to
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is not for Henry Lee Lucas, but for our system of
criminal justice,'' said the state's former attorney general, Jim
Mattox, who reviewed Lucas' case and concluded that signed work
records, interviews with neighbors and a cashed check all offered
compelling evidence that Lucas was in Florida when the Orange Socks
murder occurred.
</P>
<P>
   No physical evidence ever linked Lucas to the scene, and his
conviction was based virtually entirely on his confession, later
recanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lucas is, of course, a totally unsympathetic individual,''
said Mattox, who is a staunch supporter of the death penalty and
says Lucas may well have deserved death for other crimes. ``But the
question is whether or not the state of Texas should execute
someone they know, in all probability, is not guilty of this
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the attorney general, Dan Morales, told The
Houston Chronicle recently that it was ``not impossible, but highly
improbable'' that Lucas committed the Orange Socks murder.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the questions swirling around Lucas' death sentence,
there has been virtually no groundswell of public support for
stopping Lucas' execution, and Morales himself recently issued a
statement saying it was inappropriate for his office to
``second-guess the jury's determination.''
</P>
<P>
   With Texas leading the nation by far in executions and with many
in the public clamoring for the pace of capital punishment to be
stepped up, some death-penalty experts say they are not surprised
by the lack of attention to Lucas' case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one reason is that the public, in general, tends to be
not all that worried about executing even someone who's innocent,''
said David Dow, a law professor at the University of Houston and an
opponent of the death penalty. ``That phenomenon is magnified to
the nth degree when that person might be innocent of this
particular crime but is not, in the broader moral sense, an
innocent human being.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lucas briefly gained fame as apparently the worst serial
killer in the nation's history, freely offering confessions that
led investigators in more than 20 states to close out unsolved
murders, he later garnered yet more notoriety when he was revealed
to be the perpetrator of an astonishing hoax.
</P>
<P>
   He recanted every single confession except the 1960 slaying of
his 74-year-old mother, Viola. ``I have killed Mother, and that is
the only one,'' he told reporters in 1985. He served 10 years in a
prison and mental institution for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   After an exhaustive review involving state officials around the
country, investigators concluded that Lucas had indeed committed
other murders, but nowhere near the number to which he originally
confessed.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether he committed the Orange Socks
killing. No physical evidence or witnesses ever linked him to the
scene, and work records indicate that he was on the job as a roofer
in Florida on the day the murder occurred in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers argue now that no group of jurors would ever have
convicted him if they had known how discredited many of his
confessions would later come to be, but state and federal courts
have consistently ruled that he received a proper trial at the time
and has no grounds for appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The two prosecutors in Williamson County who put Lucas on death
row say they remain confident that Lucas committed the crime and
was fairly sentenced to death. And they question the political
motives of Mattox, the former attorney general who is currently
running to get his old job back, though it is not immediately clear
how Mattox might gain by sticking up for one of the state's most
nefarious killers in a staunchly pro-death-penalty state.
</P>
<P>
   They say that the work records were forged by the foreman as
part of an elaborate, no-show kickback scheme, and that Lucas had
plenty of time after the murder to drive back to Florida and pick
up his paycheck, which he cashed either one or two days after the
murder occurred, according to bank records.

</P>
<P>
   ``He either confessed to a crime that he indeed committed, or
you would have a sheriff who made up the whole thing so that an
innocent man could be executed,'' said Ken Anderson, the county's
district attorney who was an assistant district attorney when he
prosecuted the case. He was referring to the sheriff at the time,
Jim Boutwell, who died several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Walsh, the district attorney who was the chief prosecutor,
said he simply refused to believe that the sheriff coerced a false
confession. ``In my mind, this has always gotten back to Jim
Boutwell,'' said Walsh, who is now in private practice in Round
Rock. ``My opinion of him was very high. I just don't think he
would have ever done something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his confession to Boutwell, Lucas said at one point: ``I know
that circumstances show that I didn't do it, but I'm still the
guilty person, regardless of what the circumstances show.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that Lucas had made dozens of false
confessions, Anderson noted that the Orange Socks killing was one
of the first and most detailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was early on,'' he said. ``Before there was any going to
Dairy Queen and getting hamburgers'' _ a request Lucas sometimes
made to accommodating prosecutors before confessing to their
unsolved murders _ ``there was a confession to this crime.''
</P>
<P>
   With courts having consistently ruled against Lucas, lawyers on
both sides of his case agree that his best hope to be spared
execution lies with the state's clemency process, though any
recommendation for a commutation by the state's Board of Pardons
and Paroles would present a delicate political question for the
state's governor, George W. Bush, who would have the final say on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is running for re-election, has yet to grant clemency
or a pardon to anyone on death row, including Karla Faye Tucker,
who this year became the first woman executed in Texas since the
Civil War and whose case attracted extraordinary attention from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made no specific comment on the Lucas case and is
unlikely to do so until the board acts. Linda Edwards, a
spokeswoman for the governor said: ``He first asks is there any
question about the guilt of the individual, and if there is any
question, he'll want to look at the evidence carefully and make
sure the courts have had adequate opportunity to review all the
legal issues involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling turning down Lucas' appeal in January, the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said, ``Much of the
evidence alleged by Lucas to be newly discovered is neither new nor
newly discovered, but in its essence and character, was presented
or available to present to the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Dow, at the University of Houston, said that Lucas ``doesn't
have any chance of generating public sympathy,'' and noted that
even some staunch opponents of capital punishment had not seized on
his case. ``They would have a really tricky time politically,'' he
said, ``trying to use Henry Lee Lucas as a poster boy.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are more than 60 empty storefronts at
Rockefeller Center these days, and the 65,000 people who work there
have certainly noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right over there, in a little store, that's where I used to
buy my ties,'' said Chuck Riley, a financial planner who works in
an office high above the statue of Atlas on Fifth Avenue. ``One
day, poof, the tie store is gone. The space is still empty, so they
must be losing a bundle. The question is, what do they think they
are doing here?''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Speyer, the man best qualified to answer that question,
says the stores are empty by design, ``just a part of the process''
of resuscitating ``the world's most famous address.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, this great architectural icon of the 20th
century, a national symbol of New York City's might and swank, was
a limestone-and-glass monument to the humiliation of bankruptcy.
The collapse of office rental rates early in the decade made it
impossible for its former Japanese owner, Mitsubishi Estate Co., to
keep up the mortgage, and it absorbed a $1 billion loss after
filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Now Speyer, the center's manager and part owner, is trying to
reinvent it as an ornament of the newest of New Yorks, the city of
the great bull market. And he has been pretty busy lately.
</P>
<P>
   As signals of his boom-time ambition, he has asked the
protectors of the city's landmarks for permission to make some
retail-friendly alterations, and he has placed the Rainbow Room,
one of the center's jewels, up for grabs _ to the restaurateur
willing to pay rent of $4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   He has persuaded Christie's to abandon Madison Avenue for 49th
Street and Cablevision to take up residence at the Radio City Music
Hall, with ambitious plans for restoration, television production
and a lot more. And he has brought office occupancy to 96 percent,
from 86 percent in 1996, and spent $20 million of a promised $100
million refurbishing the 12-building core of the complex.
</P>
<P>
   But the sum of his grand vision is this: to turn Rockefeller
Center into a year-round magnet for high-end shoppers as well as
tourists and office workers, a destination for restaurant- and
entertainment-seekers that is also a power center of video-industry
production. At night, the city-within-a-city will be driven, he
says, by the busiest theater in the world, the grandly spruced up
and polished Radio City.
</P>
<P>
   So compelling will be its glitzy gravity, he contends, that the
new center will upgrade Manhattan's retailing milieu southward on
Fifth Avenue and westward all the way to Times Square, just as
Lincoln Center transformed the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But, the critics wonder, can he do it?
</P>
<P>
   Can the realities of Rockefeller Center square with Speyer's
vision of a palace of affluence? Will tourists and tourist-wary New
Yorkers really mix? Given the revival of nearby Times Square, is
there enough boom to go around? And what will happen if the stock
market heads south?
</P>
<P>
   Owners Say Vacancies Foretell Future Deals
</P>
<P>
   If the empty shops suggest a slow transition to the new
Rockefeller Center, the owners are whistling a happy tune. ``You
see vacancies, but we see excitement, activity and deals,'' said
Daniel Neidich, a partner of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the center's
principal owner, along with Tishman Speyer, David Rockefeller and
members of the Agnelli and Niarchos families. ``Right now our
biggest worry is not that we have vacancies but that we will run
out of space.''
</P>
<P>
   Very expensive space: The prime leases on Fifth Avenue and the
Channel Garden used to go for a top price of $300 per square foot,
but recently Tishman Speyer, the company that the 57-year-old
Speyer heads, has been asking $500.
</P>
<P>
   Some brokers say they can get it, because large retail blocks in
midtown Manhattan are rarities. ``I think there are more potential
tenants than they have space,'' said Faith Hope Consolo, a senior
managing director of Garrick-Aug Worldwide Ltd. ``People just want
to kill to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Tighe, a broker at Insignia/Edward S. Gordon Co., said
that Tishman Speyer had already rejected some prospective stores
that do not attract ``all day'' crowds ``because they don't want
tenants that create a dead spot for part of the day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In promoting the center, Tishman Speyer has assets that do not
meet the eye. Roadways, loading docks and storage rooms under the
center were carved deeply into the bedrock in the 1930s and can
save retailers money ``because so much of the backstage work can be
done without worrying about loading or unloading in traffic,'' Ms.
Tighe said.
</P>
<P>
   But other brokers are less sanguine. ``The place is neither fish
nor fowl,'' said one who insisted upon anonymity. She said the
center ``still has a musty feel'' thanks to its traditional
hodgepodge of bargain stores and tourist emporiums. And she
questioned whether affluent shoppers can ever find it truly chic as
they jostle with hordes of fanny-packed tourists in shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, prospective tenants for the center's 510,000 square
feet of retail space include not Cartier, Ferragamo or Hermes, but
rather Banana Republic _ which already has a flagship store two
blocks away _ and Sephora, the European cosmetics chain.
</P>
<P>
   And next month NBC is expected to announce its expansion into a
vacant two-and-a-half-level former bank branch in 30 Rockefeller
Plaza, across 49th Street from the studio home of the ``Today''
show.
</P>
<P>
   To be called ``The NBC Experience at Rockefeller Center,'' it
will offer a 3-D theater, a cybercafe and displays of NBC
memorabilia, while serving as a staging area for studio tours and a
venue for merchandising T-shirts, hats and Peacockiana.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers say other interested retailers include Old Navy, T.J.
Maxx and a possible Saks Fifth Avenue satellite. The strategy,
brokers and Rockefeller Center officials say, is to sell large
blocks of retail space to at least five blue-chip retailing names,
establishing anchor sites. All Speyer would say is that ``it's like
working on a mosaic.''

<P>
   Objections to Changing a Building's Experience
</P>
<P>
   The final roster of retail tenants is hanging fire, waiting for
the Landmarks Preservation Commission to consider Rockefeller
Center's grand plan. The center's owners want to accommodate
merchants' penchant for multilevel stores by enlarging the center's
one-story Fifth Avenue storefronts to two-story glass bays. And
they hope to create new entrances to the underground shopping
concourse from the Lower Plaza by encroaching on the
granite-backdrop-and-basin setting of the center's cynosure, the
gilt statue of Prometheus.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will vote on the proposal this month.
</P>
<P>
   Some preservationists have opposed such alterations to what they
call an esthetic masterpiece. The proposed bays ``seem like a small
thing, but can make a major change in the experience of the
building,'' Eric Allison, president of the Historic Districts
Council, said.
</P>
<P>
   David Rockefeller, however, sees things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the bays change the basic character in any
way,'' said Rockefeller, the patriarch of the clan that gave the
center its name and currently owns 5 percent of it.
</P>
<P>
   Speyer, he said, ``is showing great imagination'' in managing
the Art Deco complex, built in the 1930s at a cost of $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   Speyer would not comment on the preservationists' objections,
save to say, ``We will not be bringing chrome to Rockefeller
Center, I promise you.''
</P>
<P>
   He made it clear that he would not tamper with the center's
classic elements: its ice rink, Channel Gardens and annual
Christmas tree festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Center's Manager Sees a New Urban Square
</P>
<P>
   To Speyer, Rockefeller Center is nothing less than ``the hub of
the wheel.'' ``It is the epicenter of New York City, the link
between upper Fifth and lower Fifth. If we are successful, we can
bring Fifth Avenue back, right down to Lord &AMP; Taylor, and all the
way to the Empire State Building. And that would be quite an
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Speyer's impulse harks back to the center's original purpose, to
create an urban square ``that will make the immediate surroundings
the most valuable shopping district in the world,'' according to
1928 Rockefeller family documents.
</P>
<P>
   But Speyer's detractors insist that rather than some grand plan
to save a stretch of Fifth Avenue, he is driven primarily by an
urgent financial imperative: High rents are needed to pay interest
on the owners' loans and earn the investors a sought-after 20
percent return on their $306 million purchase price. Speyer
counters that he is creating ``the right mix'' after years of
dogged preliminary moves.
</P>
<P>
   Speyer has won high marks even from critics for two key deals:
landing Christie's and finding a tenant for Radio City. By early
1999, Christie's will consolidate its offices and auction space on
49th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Speyer is giving both new tenants extraordinary latitude. For
example, Christie's has the right to close Rockefeller Plaza at
night ``and to treat it as a private street for dropping off
customers'' at major evening sales, said Patricia Hambrecht,
president of Christie's in North and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's may also collaborate with Cablevision Systems Corp.,
which has leased Radio City Music Hall for $13 million per year.
Cablevision plans to spend more than $25 million renovating the
65-year-old concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be far and away the busiest theater in the world when
we're done,'' said Dave Checketts, president and chief executive of
Madison Square Garden, a subsidiary of Cablevision.
</P>
<P>
   He said Radio City would also become the new headquarters of
American Movie Classics, one of Cablevision's cable channels.
Cablevision also plans to build a television production facility in
Radio City space, and will use the hall's stage for productions.
</P>
<P>
   Many Merchants Are Facing Uncertainty
</P>
<P>
   But banished from this hive of worker bees is a horde of
dispossessed merchants. ``My father and I spent our lives there; we
really felt part of the Rockefeller Center family,'' said Arthur
Sogno, a jeweler, whose father was one of the first retail tenants.
The center's management did not renew his lease, forcing him to
leave more than a year ago. The store is still vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Many remaining tenants have been given their walking papers.
``They are saying I could be out by September,'' said Jerolim
Vukich, the owner of a bustling nine-chair barbershop on the
concourse level, who may be offered a more expensive space in a
less-trafficked area. ``I hope my customers will still need their
Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   The center has its own uncertainties to face. It will continue
to require costly improvements and has high operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, restaurant veterans wonder whether the owners can
have a successful late-night restaurant-and-retail operation where
there is no residential base.
</P>
<P>
   The owners are negotiating with Restaurant Associates to create
new dining concepts in the center. And to enhance the profitability
of the Rainbow Room, the owners will eject the current operators,
who balked at paying a huge increase in their $2.8 million annual
rent.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockefeller Center neighborhood, dominated at night by
the shuttered Saks, St. Patrick's Cathedral and a stand of ghostly
office buildings, is ``one of the few places in Manhattan where the
sidewalk rolls up at night,'' said one neighborhood merchant who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, no formal Rockefeller Center master plan
is likely to be trumpeted, ``but we have a clear vision that is
evolving,'' Speyer said. Successful or not, that vision will try to
capitalize on Rockefeller Center's special status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Empire State Building or Wall Street,'' Barry
Bull, a tourist from Brisbane, Australia, said on a recent
afternoon. ``If you haven't seen Rockefeller Center, you haven't
seen New York.'' &QL;

IRAQIS' IMMUNITY TO ANTHRAX RAISED U.S. FEARS, BOOK SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 4 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 7 p.m. ET EMBARGO
for electronic media.) 
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just before the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the American military
discovered that Iraqi soldiers captured in a covert operation had
immunity to deadly anthrax, heightening fears in Washington that
Baghdad was preparing to wage germ warfare, a new book says.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Against All Enemies: Gulf War Syndrome: The War
Between America's Ailing Veterans and Their Government''
(Ballantine) by Seymour Hersh, says the secret finding of Iraqi
immunity played a role in accelerating the Pentagon's crash program
to vaccinate American troops against anthrax before the war.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, some 150,000 coalition soldiers were immunized
against the disease. Anthrax normally afflicts animals like cattle
and sheep, but it can kill humans.
</P>
<P>
   The death rate for untreated pulmonary anthrax is more than 90
percent. Pentagon officials feared an Iraqi germ attack could kill
up to 200,000 American troops, the book says.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, setting off an international
crisis. In February 1991, an American-led coalition expelled Iraqi
troops in a ground war that saw no known use of biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh, an investigative journalist, says in the book that an
elite American team penetrated deep into Iraq before the war and
kidnapped several Iraqi soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, a retired American military official and a gulf
war veteran both affirmed that a secret abduction had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty well known, but not the specifics,'' said Jim
Brown, an Army veteran who lives in Hannibal, Mo., and is director
of Gulf Watch, a veterans advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actively going on behind Iraqi lines,'' said the
retired military official, who held a senior post during the war
and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Hersh says blood samples drawn from the captured
Iraqi troops showed ``they had recently built up an immunity to
anthrax,'' one of the deadliest agents for biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon was uncertain, he added, whether the Iraqis had
been inoculated with anthrax vaccine or had developed a natural
immunity to the disease, which occurs in animal populations in
parts of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military planning had to assume the worst-case scenario _ that
the Iraqis would not be affected by a biological attack,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A formerly secret document declassified in 1996 by the Army, a
chronology of germ actions and analyses during the gulf war,
suggests that Pentagon officials were deeply interested in Iraqi
blood samples and what they might reveal about Baghdad's
preparations for germ warfare. The document was recently obtained
by The New York Times from Veterans for Integrity in government, a
group based in Centreville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defectors from Iraqi Republican Guards still in custody of
Saudis,'' the document says in a note dated Nov. 21, 1990 _ before
the war. ``Blood would reveal types and strains of BW agents they
have been protected against,'' the ``BW'' referring to biological
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, American military and intelligence officials
gathered much circumstantial evidence that Iraq had embarked on a
large program to make germ weapons, but the intelligence was
generally vague.
</P>
<P>
   In the months before the gulf war, American officials were
unsure whether Iraq was ready and willing to use germ weapons.
Thus, at least in theory, the blood samples offered key evidence of
Iraq's intentions. &QL;

MORALITY MISSION FACES CAPITAL REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Ohio)  (lb) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Soon after an opening riff of Scripture resounded
down the stony corridors of power this week, the gathering of
preachers _ all fired up to lobby on the themes of social morality
and the poor _ sadly confronted the Monica Monomania that grips the
national capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral whirligig!'' one visiting minister snarled
dismissively. He was taking the spiritual measure of a city now
peddling ``White House Intern'' souvenir T-shirts, smutty
Bill-and-Monica greeting cards and various other anecdotal evidence
that the dissing of President Clinton is trying to quietly steal
into place as his long-sought legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is calling us to talk about morality, not the morality of
the president,'' thundered one minister, the Rev. Yvonne Delk of
Chicago, pulpit-thumping in a Capitol office on behalf of poor
families now being ushered from welfare rolls across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Only one member of Congress stopped in during a daylong
preach-in by dozens of visiting ministers as the ceaseless
investigation into accusations about sex and mendacity at the White
House maintained its grip on the political capital.
</P>
<P>
   Attention was being paid elsewhere: Fresh lawyers were being
celebrated as they entered the fray like reinforcements for George
Orwell's armies that endlessly tugged back and forth on television
in his ``1984'' vision of a transfixed state.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd gathered on Connecticut Avenue to gape at a live
sighting of Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern, now
ending her fifth month of enigmatic smiles before the nation. Fresh
strategies were afoot as the independent counsel stalked the
president. The photo-op comings and goings at the grand jury
continued apace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to figure out whether or not Americans really do
give a damn about public morality,'' boomed the Rev. William
Pannell of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif.,
despairing of the ``whirligig'' he finds here.
</P>
<P>
   Official Washington showed the ministers no mercy as they
preached and sang, since disrespecting the president seems a
capital subtheme taken for granted now as the months of
investigation roll forward.
</P>
<P>
   A recent advertisement by the Washington Sports Clubs was
headlined ``Attention Bill Clinton: We too have a no-commitment
policy.'' Plastic place mats have appeared of a news photograph of
a parade float in Germany that depicted a papier-mache Clinton
groping an offended Miss Liberty. In idle moments, Washingtonians
can vie with the rest of Internet America in a rude limerick
competition rhyming Lewinsky and Kaczynski, the intern and the
Unabomber, at Clinton's expense.
</P>
<P>
   A country singer felt emboldened enough at a recent luncheon
honoring Hillary Rodham Clinton to serenade the first lady with
such songs as ``You Ain't Woman Enough to Take My Man'' and ``Is
This the Thanks I Get After All I've Done for You?'' A local
editorial cartoonist has refined his image of the president down to
a merry raincoat-clad exhibitionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's completely out of the game,'' said the Rev. Jim
Wallis, one of the hosts of the preach-in, regretfully insisting
the president had lost his edge on moral issues under the weight of
all the accusations, investigations and shameful mockeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this paralysis here in the political process, a civic
poverty,'' said Wallis, who knows Washington well as the editor
here of ``Sojourners,'' a religious magazine, and as the organizer
of Call to Renewal, a broad array of churches fighting poverty and
racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton could have taken us to a different level on so
many things, the issue of race, for example, but nothing's come of
it,'' Wallis said. ``The great shame is that all our so-called
moral attention is focused on alleged White House sex scandals and
not on tremendous tasks like integrating the poorest families into
our midst.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By the end of their preach-in, ministers were pronouncing
capital politicians oblivious to the warning that there is growing
evidence of poor families' suffering inordinately from the 1996
overhauling of the federal welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   Sheaves of press releases citing statistics about the dearth of
jobs for postwelfare recipients went unread. The antennas of news
television stayed resolutely elsewhere, staking out the Lewinsky
case. They rose delicately toward the heavens above the grand jury,
as if in search of intelligent life elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the preach-in participants found Clinton a singular
drain on the moral agenda. ``You can't just point the finger at the
president,'' said the lone member of Congress who showed up, Tony
Hall, D-Ohio, just back from a tour of poverty in Africa. ``It's a
number of factors, including both parties' losing their edge in
their ability to even talk about the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the change in the welfare law let politicians off the
moral hook so they could ignore poverty in the rest of the country
while the scandal hunts go forward in the capital. ``I recently
toured rural Appalachia and saw 1,200 people lined up at a
food-bank soup kitchen,'' he said. ``I was shocked; 1,200 working
poor, not welfare cases. And my colleagues refuse to believe me
when I try and tell them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, utterances of despair about the capital's monomania can
even be heard from principals participating in television's nightly
verbal slugfests over the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The connect-the-dot story inches forward,'' said Lanny Davis,
a former White House special counsel who is still addicted, he
admits, to the blandishments of celebrity. ``I go on again with the
pundit gang, and you know what? We'll walk out after the show, look
at each other, and say, `Don't you feel unclean?''' &QL;

 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, Neb. _ At Harry Knobbe's Feed Yards the other day,
Sen. Chuck Hagel was holding forth on the global economy, the Asian
financial crisis and the International Monetary Fund with a dozen
or so hog and cattle farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Cuming County, one of the largest cattle-producing
counties in the United States, the farmers were hanging on every
word.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the markets go down in Asia, it's not good for the United
States and it's not good for Nebraska,'' Hagel said over sodas and
sugar cookies, drawing approving nods and murmurs. ``They can't buy
your beef, pork and feed grains.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting his fellow senators to focus on international matters is
a lot tougher than holding that discussion with farmers in a state
that exports $1.6 billion worth of farm products to Asia each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of my colleagues don't understand foreign affairs, they
don't travel, they don't get out,'' Hagel said later. ``They're
scared of taking trips that will be labeled political junkets. They
don't have much interest, and they don't see the relevancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Translating the lexicon of Washington foreign policy into
nuts-and-bolts realities for constituents and other senators is a
steep challenge for Hagel. But even as the freshman Republican on
the Foreign Relations Committee, ranked 98th in seniority out of
100 senators, he is proving an influential new voice in foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the country is looking inward, Hagel, a
51-year-old self-made millionaire, is preaching the virtues of
internationalism to Congress and the public.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting his pro-business conservatism, he told a group of
Omaha mortgage bankers, ``Foreign policy is not some theoretical,
esoteric, Kissinger-esque thing hanging out there. It's foreign
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   As crises from Kosovo to Pakistan threaten stability, Hagel
says, ``now is the time for America to project its leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than 18 months, Hagel has helped broker a deal among his
colleagues for approval of $18 billion in new financing for the
International Monetary Fund. He forged an unusual alliance with
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to counter the administration's backing
of a treaty to combat global warming. And Hagel, an Army veteran
twice wounded in Vietnam, has fought against the Pentagon's use of
antipersonnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I know of any freshman senator since I've been
here who's done better work than he has,'' Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, a longtime friend of Hagel's, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel has earned a reputation as a blunt consensus-builder who
is willing to reach out to Democrats to cut a deal. ``He's
conservative,'' said Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who drafted a
health insurance bill with Hagel. ``But he's not one of the
fire-breathing, steely ideologues.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel has also shown that he is not afraid to buck fellow
conservatives on international security issues. He was an early
supporter last year of the treaty to ban the use and production of
poison gas, despite stiff opposition from rightist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Lott credits Hagel with influencing his decision to back the
chemical weapons treaty. ``When I was getting really criticized by
some of my own people,'' Lott said, ``Hagel gave me a handwritten
note that said: `Don't let the ankle-biters get you down. Do what's
right, and I'm with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel has his critics _ particularly environmentalists who
oppose his position on the global warming treaty. ``Hagel seems to
be a new leader of the head-in-the-sand crowd on Capitol Hill who
want to ignore critical environmental problems,'' said Gene
Karpinski, executive director of U.S. Public Interest Research
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The senator started his political career in the early 1970s as
an aide to Rep. John McCollister, R-Neb. There he struck up some
valuable friendships: another young House aide named Trent Lott,
and a young Republican congressman, Thad Cochran, now the senior
senator from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   During Ronald Reagan's presidency, Hagel served as deputy
administrator of the Veterans Administration and was an influential
backer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Leaving government, he
became a founder of what grew into a large cellular telephone
company, Vanguard Cellular Systems.
</P>
<P>
   In the emerging cell-phone business, and in consulting work
later, Hagel became an outspoken supporter of free trade,
installing cellular systems in Costa Rica, Saudi Arabia and
Britain. He puts his net worth at about $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   A long-shot candidate for the Senate in 1996, he upset the
popular Democratic governor, Ben Nelson. With his military and
overseas-trade background, he took aim at his first committee
choice: Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't hard to get,'' said Hagel, who is chairman of the
International Economic Policy, Export and Trade Promotion
Subcommittee. ``No one wanted to be on Foreign Relations.''
</P>
<P>
   From his sometimes lonely bully pulpit on the committee, he has
criticized the Clinton administration and its national security
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the president has ever had a philosophy about
foreign policy or thought through what role the United States
should have in the world,'' he said. ``The administration's foreign
policy has been to ricochet from crisis to crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel's biggest challenge was shepherding the $18 billion
financing for the IMF through a skeptical Senate, a task Lott
assigned him. Hagel learned a lesson in Senate hardball when
opponents of the financing went around him to attach conditions
that would have killed a delicate compromise.
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted a powerful ally, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to restore the original
deal. The financing passed, 84-16, but the House has bottled up the
package.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Nebraska, Hagel finds support for the IMF among big
exporters like Valmont Industries, an irrigation equipment and
lighting pole manufacturer in the town of Valley. For these
executives, the $18 billion for the IMF is not even an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not the IMF, who would do it?'' asked Valmont chairman
Mogens Bay. ``The United States can't do it alone.'' &QL;

   RAMSEY _ While Colorado police are eager to have a grand jury
address the JonBenet Ramsey case, hoping it will force testimony
from those resistant to talk, at least one legal expert believes
the move will probably solve nothing and could end the
investigation. ``I don't see it (a grand jury) getting much from
any suspect,'' said William Pizzi, a former federal prosecutor and
a criminal law professor at the University of Colorado Law School.
In fact, should the process add nothing to the case, Pizzi believes
the grand jury may decide no charges are warranted. ``This may be
the last chapter'' of the story, said Pizzi. (Schneider, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   NEW ORLEANS _ It's 3:30 p.m. on Friday and les bon temps are
rolling at Galatoire's. Lawyers in seersucker are smoking big
cigars and drinking champagne and telling tall tales. Blondes in
flowered chiffon dresses and strappy heels are doing business on
cell phones and drinking white wine and flirting with gentlemen at
nearby tables.
</P>
<P>
   I'm supposed to be over at the Fairmont Hotel at the annual
convention of investigative reporters. I should be attending very
serious panels with very serious journalists on the state of
investigative reporting. Like ``The Clinton Presidency: From the
Lincoln Bedroom to Monica,'' ``Nuts and bolts of the Freedom of
Information Act,'' ``Medic! Dangerous doctors and deadly nurses,''
``Census 2000: It's not too early to get ready'' and ``Digging into
city and state records.''
</P>
<P>
   But the thought of digging in this heat and humidity is enough

investigative reporting. There is more of it than ever _ much of it
excellent. But it has less impact than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old Woodward and Bernstein days, reporters who dug
up scandal could break a president and make their careers. Now,
they can't get any traction. No matter what story they uncover
about the White House _ Whitewater, Lincoln Bedroom, Buddhist
temple, Monica, China missiles _ Americans yawn.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, investigative reporters are victims of their own
success. They yanked the veil back in so many realms, they exposed
so many clay feet, the public grew jaded. The only startling story
these days is not a corrupt official, but an honest one.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does President Clinton not sink. He gets more popular
with each hit. Investigative reporters, once seen as glamorous and
heroic, are now painted as destructive and partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Lanny Davises and Sidney Blumenthals and Larry
Klaymans on the left and the right, the substance of a charge
quickly gets overshadowed by the issue of who leaked it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investigative reporters in Louisiana were always
frustrated, because no matter what manner of hedonism or
pocket-lining they uncovered about the charming rogues in office,
the public was unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks in part to the charming rogue in the Oval Office,
the rest of the country has taken on Louisiana's tolerant and
bemused attitude.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans woke up Friday morning to a huge front-page expose
in The Times-Picayune detailing the multi-million-dollar gambling
profits reaped by Louisiana's former governor and scandal
impresario, Edwin Edwards, and his friends. The smooth Edwards, who
has eluded reporters and prosecutors for more than a decade, merely
dismissed it as ``flap trap.''
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that one of the legends in journalism, Seymour
Hersh, lionized for breaking the My Lai massacre, was reduced to
investigating sex stories about a dead president. He appeared on a
panel here called ``Reporting the past: Why challenge the JFK myth
and history?'' He says that when he gets nostalgic for the golden
days, he just pops his Nixon resignation tape into the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lewis, who heads the Center for Public Integrity and who
has just been awarded a MacArthur genius award for his work in
helping reveal official corruption, is discouraged about the
``numb'' public.

   ``We live in this bland yuppified era when people just care
about fresh-squeezed orange juice and watching the stock numbers in
the paper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Bunting of The Los Angeles Times agreed. ``We want to break
good old-fashioned gotcha stories that grab the readers by the
lapel,'' he said. ``But we can't seem to break through. The readers
think they've heard it all before.
</P>

   ``It used to be that I'd go to a cocktail party and people would

they say, `You're the one that did that story? You're the bad

</P>
<P>
   The old image of swaggering investigators in trench coats, noble
watchdogs over a political system inexorably drawn to sin, has

COMMENTARY: AT WHAT COST?
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has a nice name, the ``African Growth and Opportunity Act,''
and a clever slogan, ``trade not aid,'' but a bill now before
Congress is in fact an enormous benefits package for thriving
multinational corporations and a threat to the very sovereignty of
the sub-Saharan nations that sponsors of the bill say they want to
help.
</P>
<P>
   The bill narrowly passed the House in March, where it was
introduced and pushed hard by Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., who has
referred to some developing African countries and their leaders as
``retards.'' (A spokeswoman told me on Friday that the congressman
had not intended to offend anyone.)
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor in the Senate, which has yet to vote on the measure,
is Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. The bill has the strong backing of
the Clinton administration, as well as such giant corporations as
Texaco, Coca-Cola and Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the bill is to liberalize trade between the United
States and Africa. It would, among other things, allow duty-free
and quota-free exports to the United States for 10 years, support
the creation of a U.S.-sub-Sahara free-trade agreement and
encourage the Overseas Private Investment Corp. to set up funds to
stimulate private development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill also makes some demands. In essence, participating
countries would have to adhere to the harsh and often inhumane
requirements of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, these underdeveloped and often very poor countries would
have to undergo a radical economic restructuring that would include
cuts in corporate taxes, reductions in government spending and
privatization of some of their most valuable assets _ mines,
forests, harbors, oil wells and the like _ with the multinationals
and other wealthy foreign investors ready to snap them up at
fire-sale prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does this mean to the people on the ground in these
countries?'' asked Randall Robinson, the president of TransAfrica
and an opponent of the Crane-Lugar bill.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that IMF structural adjustment programs are already
under way in some African countries and studies of those programs
have shown disturbing effects. Ghana is one example. It is cited as
an IMF success story.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as Robinson pointed out, public spending on education,
health and agriculture _ in accordance with IMF dictates to limit
spending _ has been falling. Health care for the poor has taken a
particularly heavy hit, even though children are dying in
staggering numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all deaths in Ghana in recent years have been of
children under 5, though that age group makes up just one-fifth of
the country's population.
</P>
<P>
   In Senegal, under the guidance of the IMF, spending on education
has been cut. One might ask what sense this makes in a country in
which more than 65 percent of adults and 77 percent of all women
are illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   From the point of view of the IMF and the multinationals, it
makes economic sense.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill also requires participating countries to join the
World Trade Organization, even though many African countries have
chosen not to join. The Organization for Economic Development, a
supporter of the WTO, has reported that sub-Saharan Africa would be
a loser under WTO rules because countries that import more food
than they export would inevitably be hurt by requirements to cut
domestic agriculture subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a small matter. Four in 10 Africans suffer in some
degree from hunger or malnutrition. Agricultural subsidies can be a
matter of life and death in such populations.
</P>
<P>
   But the trade bill fashioned in Washington says simply: you will
join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to amend the bill _ to modify the most onerous
requirements _ have been beaten back. President Nelson Mandela of
South Africa has characterized the bill as ``not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   But most sub-Saharan leaders, faced with desperately poor
populations and desperately high unemployment, have signed on. They
appear to hope that in some way, somehow, a trade agreement with
the big boys, with the United States and its great corporations,
will alleviate their economic suffering.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation ripe for wholesale exploitation. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As the United States prepared for a World Cup soccer
qualifying match against El Salvador in November, John Harkes and
Roy Wegerle, two of the team's top players, received an alarming
telephone call at the team hotel in Providence, R.I. The caller
suggested that the players could make money by throwing their game
against El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   The American players reported the anonymous call to Coach Steve
Sampson, but they never determined whether it was a serious attempt
at a bribe or a prank. While the Americans were disturbed, they
were not entirely surprised. Nor was anyone else involved in
international soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough proof in the past, not necessarily at the
World Cup, but at the club level, that these things have taken
place,'' Sampson said. ``Referees have been bribed and players have
been given incentives to throw matches.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, the World Cup, the 32-team tournament and ultimate
championship in the world's most popular sport, will start, and
with it will come celebrations of soccer's ability to galvanize
national pride and transfix the globe.
</P>
<P>
   But in virtually every corner of that captivated globe, a darker
side of soccer has worsened in recent years _ a dispiriting
underside disfigured by tales of lucrative gambling rings, rigged
results and a pervasive erosion of trust. In the last year alone,
allegations of fixed matches in domestic club leagues have been
investigated in Russia, China, Greece, Israel, Belgium and Vietnam,
all coming as the economy of soccer _ experts estimate it as a $400
billion-a-year industry _ grows more enormous.
</P>
<P>
   In Bulgaria, the government announced last month that it was
assuming control of the national soccer federation because of
widespread corruption and incompetence. In November in Greece, 123
members of Parliament backed a public statement concluding that
``championships in all divisions and team standings'' were being
``cooked up in backstage deals.'' Two months ago in Russia, Pavel
Sadyrin, who coached the country's 1994 World Cup team, told the
national soccer federation that ``there were, still are, and, alas,
always will be, rigged matches as long as the country does not
follow the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Vietnam, soccer fans are infuriated over concerns that
bookmakers, through bribes to players and referees, are fixing the
results of club league games. In fact, the Vietnamese soccer
federation recently refused to validate the score of a match
between teams from Hanoi and Haiphong because of widespread
suspicions of rigging. ``Our players have to relearn the spirit of
sport and understand that we don't play matches using deceit,''
Nguyen Tai Ngo, a member of Vietnam's committee for sports and
gymnastics, said in an Agence France-Presse report.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are merely reflections of the vastly increasing richness
of the game,'' Paul Gardner, a columnist for the magazine Soccer
America and one of the foremost authorities on the sport in the
United States, said of the spread of game-fixing scandals. ``There
is an obscene amount of money in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   While there has never been a confirmed fixing scandal in the
World Cup, the rash of recent investigations has prompted FIFA, the
French initials used to identify soccer's world governing body, to
install safeguards before the start of the tournament on Wednesday.
For example, teams and the 67 referees involved in the tournament
will stay in secure hotels or on isolated floors of hotels,
theoretically apart from danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course this is a matter of concern, but we are not
expecting serious problems,'' Michel Zen-Ruffinen, FIFA's deputy
executive director, said of the prospect of a scandal. ``There
would be serious sanctions taken. We expect people to be aware that
it is not worth destroying a career to accept money. We believe the
pride of playing for a country is stronger than the desire to
receive money.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, though, the World Cup has not been immune from
problems _ both real bribe attempts and suspicious matches.
</P>
<P>
   A Costa Rican referee, Rodrigo Badilla, was suspended from the
1998 World Cup, Zen-Ruffinen said, for failing to sufficiently
report a $50,000 bribe attempt aimed at him to fix a qualifying
match in October between Japan and the United Arab Emirates.
Badilla, who refereed the 1994 World Cup in the United States, hung
up on the caller who mentioned the bribe, and he was not suspected
of having tainted the match, Zen-Ruffinen said. However, Badilla
reported the matter only to another referee and not to FIFA
officials, Zen-Ruffinen said.
</P>
<P>
   This was the only reported case of attempting to bribe a referee
in 700 qualifying matches for the 1998 World Cup, Zen-Ruffinen
said.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA officials are particularly sensitive to attempts to
compromise the game officials because they wield enormous control
in such a low-scoring sport with the right to call, or not call,
penalties. Some soccer experts say they believe referees are
vulnerable because their salaries have not kept up with the
millions paid to top players.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another top referee, Kurt Rothlisberger of Switzerland, who
worked the 1994 World Cup and was removed after a controversial
no-call on an apparent penalty during a Belgium-Germany match, was
banned for life last year for allegedly demanding $60,000 to help
fix a 1996 European Champion League match.
</P>
<P>
   Just as worrisome to FIFA is the mere perception of rigged
games. During qualifying for the 1998 World Cup, the coach of El
Salvador, Milovan Djoric, was twice suspended for contending that
the referees had helped Mexico in its matches with El Salvador.
Horace Burrell, the president of the Jamaican soccer federation,
threatened last fall to sue the Salvadoran federation over its
suggestions that Jamaica may have offered bribes to the Salvadorans
to throw a qualifying match against Jamaica in November. The
Salvadorans later apologized and admitted the Jamaicans were
guiltless.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly disquieting incident took place in Qatar at the
1995 World Cup for players under 17 years of age. According to
Zen-Ruffinen, some players had been offered gifts by men thought to
be part of a Malaysian betting syndicate, three of whom were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not asking the players to do something in
exchange,'' Zen-Ruffinen said, adding that the players had allowed
the men to take photographs. ``The idea, most surely, was to use
the pictures at a later stage when these players became famous,
presumably in a case of extortion or something like that,''
Zen-Ruffinen said.
</P>
<P>
   In one preventive measure, match assignments for referees at
this World Cup will be handed out with little advance notice, and
referees traveling to matches will be accompanied by security
guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been approached,'' said Esse Baharmast, the lone
American referee assigned to this World Cup. ``If there is a
strange phone call coming in, the first thing I would do is go to
the authorities and tell them what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, the American coach, said he understood the need for the
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really concerned about it, but I don't want to be
naive,'' he said. ``When so much is at stake financially for
individuals and for countries, when literally the image of an
entire nation is resting on the results of how a team fares in the
World Cup, there is bound to be at least the perception that there
will be those kind of incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer experts say that there is nothing inherently corrupt
about the game, but rather that corruption in soccer is reflective
of the money and popularity of the sport and consistent with the
corruption found at many levels in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   With widespread television exposure, soccer also has become
hugely popular for bettors. In Thailand, where two men were given
three-month sentences in May for operating an illegal soccer
betting racket, a research center estimated that $1 billion would
be bet in that country alone during the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In January, 12 of China's top clubs admitted in a newspaper
survey that they had offered cash bribes to referees, some of whom
had accepted. In April, two soccer players were arrested in Vietnam
for fixing league matches last year, and published reports said up
to 74 players and team officials were suspected of rigging games.
And the Italian Parliament was suspended on April 29 when a scuffle
broke out among elected officials over the credibility of the
refereeing in a match that had significant implications for the
Italian season.
</P>
<P>
   A match-fixing scandal at the 1998 World Cup would be a painful
embarrassment for the French, who suffered through the most
notorious example of match-fixing in recent years. Bernard Tapie,
the former French urban affairs minister, was sentenced to a year
in prison in 1995 for fixing a 1993 match involving the team he
owned, Olympic Marseilles.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, two World Cup matches have aroused
suspicion of rigging. In 1978, Argentina needed a four-goal victory
over Peru to advance ahead of Brazil _ total goals counted in the
formula for advancement _ and into the final against Holland. When
Argentina won, 6-0, Brazilian reporters pointed out that the
Peruvian goalkeeper, Ramon Quiroga, was a native of Argentina.
Quiroga has continued to deny any foul play. FIFA has since changed
the tournament format to single elimination after the first round.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1982 World Cup, a 1-0 victory by West Germany over
Austria sent those two teams to the second round on goal
differential ahead of Algeria. West Germany scored early, and
neither team made any real effort to score again. To avoid this
situation again, FIFA now schedules all final games in the first
round at the same time, so teams cannot know in advance how many
goals will get them to the next round.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rothenberg, president of the United States Soccer
Federation, said he doubted games would be thrown at the 1998 World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm the classic, naive American,'' he said, ``but I
believe when players step on the field, they play hard and want to
win.'' &QL;

   PESHAWAR, Pakistan _ Across India and Pakistan, most people are
talking of little but nuclear weapons. But here along Pakistan's
rugged northern frontier, the weapons of choice are still
old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, Peshawar has been home to an extraordinary
community of gunsmiths. With skills handed down through
generations, they say they are able to make exact duplicates of any
weapon they can lay their hands on.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of brigands, guerrillas, tribal warriors and
swashbucklers have bought their weapons here. Not coincidentally,
people who live in the surrounding mountains are among the most
heavily armed in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atomic bomb?'' one gunsmith mused quite seriously as he
stroked his beard on a recent afternoon. ``I couldn't build one
without the uranium. But get me a pouch of uranium and a blueprint,
and I'll make you one better than any in India.''
</P>
<P>
   In bazaars and along roads leading north toward the Hindu Kush
mountains and the foothills of the Himalayas, hundreds of shops
offer a dazzling array of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Some are original, part of the overflow left by conflicts great
and small that have shaken this region for longer than anyone here
has been alive. Others are identical copies made one at a time by
men with primitive but obviously well-suited machine tools.
</P>
<P>
   A brand-new AK-47, the legendary assault rifle favored by
insurgents around the world, sells for $220 if it comes from a
Chinese or Russian factory, half that if it is locally made. Other
favorite items range from a five-shot pistol that can be concealed
in a palm and sells for $12 to an original M-16, the standard-issue
assault rifle of the U.S. Army, priced at $565.
</P>
<P>
   For the truly ambitious, there are rocket launchers, anti-tank
weapons and high-caliber machine guns powerful enough to blow a
hole through a thick tree trunk at 50 paces.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the weapons sold here find their way into neighboring
Afghanistan, where war has been raging almost continually for more
than two decades and seems unlikely to end soon.
</P>
<P>
   Others are bought by the smugglers, drug dealers and arms
traffickers who are the biggest winners in such conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The most regular customers, however, are Pathan tribesmen.
Vendettas and blood feuds are a way of life for many Pathans, and a
male Pathan villager without a weapon might as well be naked.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a Pathan a gun is like jewelry,'' said a dealer who sells
not weapons but handmade leather holsters and bandoleers. ``It's
their culture. They don't need bread, but they need guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun vendors are only part of the dazzling carnival that is
modern Peshawar (pronounced puh-SHAH-wur). Its bazaars are more
authentic and tumultuous than those of Cairo and Istanbul, which
tourists have already discovered.
</P>
<P>
   It is exceedingly rare to see a European face among the
medicinal herbs, fox and mountain lion pelts, peacock feathers,
melons, nuts, teas and countless other products that spill out into
the twisting alleys.
</P>
<P>
   Heroin is sold in more than a few back rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In others, spies from faraway lands meet their informers and buy
information about what is happening in the remote countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Awnings shield shoppers from the blazing sun, which at this time
of year pushes temperatures past the 100-degree mark at mid-morning
and keeps them rising steadily until dusk.
</P>
<P>
   The air is dusty, streets are clogged with motorized rickshaws
and gaily decorated buses bearing names like Road Liner and Air
Wolf, and not even the Muslim call to prayer brings the bustle to a
pause. Few women are seen outside the bazaar reserved for them; all
cover their hair and many their faces.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many people live in Peshawar. A decade ago
there were said to be 300,000, but so many Afghan refugees have
arrived since then that the number might now be twice that.
Old-time residents have come to resent the Afghans, who they say
are more industrious and more willing to work for low wages than
they are.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here are encouraged by the progress of the
militantly Islamic Taliban army in Afghanistan, not necessarily
because they share its religious fanaticism but because they hope
its final victory might bring at least a temporary peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``War in Afghanistan brings us three gifts: guns, drugs and
refugees,'' said Gulu Itashim, who deals in lapis lazuli and other
gems. ``Anything that pacifies Afghanistan is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Peshawar is just a day's camel ride from the fabled Khyber Pass,
gateway to the subcontinent and invasion route of Alexander,
Genghis Khan and Tamerlane. The craft of making weapons is honored
and practiced in nearly every village along the way, and regardless
of whether there is war or peace in Afghanistan, or how Pakistan's
nuclear rivalry with India unfolds, the craft will probably
continue to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Might does not make right,'' says a sign in a gunsmith's
window. ``It only makes history.'' &QL;

U.N. AIDE WOULD FIGHT DRUGS WITH `ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With President Clinton and other world leaders
coming here Monday for a special session of the General Assembly on
the world's drug problems, the U.N.`s top anti-narcotics official
has submitted a two-pronged strategy that moves beyond the
conventional approach of intercepting illegal drugs and arresting
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Pino Arlacchi, the executive director of the U.N. International
Drug Control Program, proposes the ambitious target of eliminating
opium poppies and coca plants, the raw ingredients of heroin and
cocaine, in 10 years as well as substantially reducing marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this, he advocates so-called alternative development
programs that would induce opium and coca growers to switch to less
profitable legal crops by bringing roads, hospitals, schools and a
better life into remote rural areas that depend on drug crops to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Arlacchi has proposed that nations reduce the
demand for drugs by half over the next decade through prevention
and treatment programs. Neither idea is new, but Arlacchi said they
had proved promising enough to try on a broader scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two cards have not been played in full,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative development has sometimes been viewed as costly and
unrealistic, since opium and coca growers are reluctant to grow
legal crops that would earn less income and be harder to take to
market. Middlemen make the rounds of peasants to buy their raw
opium and coca paste.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed, Arlacchi said, is political authority to enforce
eradication and development involving more than crop substitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would propose an alternative way of life,'' he said. ``They
can be rich peasants if they grow opium, but they can die if they
don't have roads and hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Peru and Colombia have tried alternative development, Arlacchi
said, and Peru has reduced its coca fields by 40 percent in two
years. Bolivia has promised to phase out its coca over the next
five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi said the cost would run far less than potential donors
like the United States anticipate. With some programs already in
place, he estimated that alternative development would require an
additional amount of less than $250 million a year over the next
decade. In comparison, the U.S. government's annual drug control
budget exceeds $16 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the Clinton administration's anti-drug
chief, said that he agreed with demand reduction, but was not
persuaded that it would be easy to get Afghans and Burmese, who
together grow 90 percent of the world's opium, to change to other
crops. But McCaffrey added in a telephone interview from
Washington, ``We're supportive of Pino Arlacchi's focused
high-energy leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi, whose enthusiasm belies a tough reputation earned
fighting the Mafia in his native Italy, cited what he said were
some conspicuous successes against drug trafficking in the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We destroyed the myth of the invincibility of the drug
cartels,'' he said. He said that the Medellin and Cali cocaine
cartels in Colombia had been crushed and that some Asian opium
warlords surrendered by striking deals with the military government
in Burma that let them keep their freedom and money. Thailand
virtually eliminated opium production through alternative
development, he added, and Pakistan had sharply cut back opium
growing as well. &QL;

TREMORS KEEP ROCKING THE DODGERS' CLUBHOUSE AND FRONT OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let the Dodgers' season begin. If you're Fred Claire, you're
saying, ``Please let our season begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking the other day, Claire, the Los Angeles Dodgers'
beleaguered general manager, actually said: ``We're starting our
season on the fifth of June. I want to let this club play for a
couple of months. Normally, the first couple of months would be
April and May. Our first two months will be June and July. We have
good talent. I want to give it a chance to settle in.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a city shaken by earthquakes and aftershocks, the Dodgers
hope they can now relax, regroup and recover from the series of
tremors that struck them in the space of three weeks. The
blockbuster trade that sent Mike Piazza away was the big one that
registered high on the Richter scale. The pursuit of Randy Johnson,
the erroneous news reports that emanated from it, other wild and
equally inaccurate reports and the trade of Hideo Nomo were the
aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
   Claire met with the players before their game last Tuesday night
to explain various matters, including his own status, and to tell
them where the team was headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was letting them know I believe in this team and I felt we
had to give this team a chance to settle down in view of all that
had happened,'' he said. ``No team could go out and play in the
environment we had. We were totally disrupted. I felt like we were
the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers began interleague play with a record that was one
game under .500 at 29-30. They haven't been more than one game over
.500 in a month. They experienced a winning spurt after Gary
Sheffield, Bobby Bonilla and Charles Johnson joined their lineup
from the Marlins in place of Piazza and Todd Zeile but quickly
squandered their gain with a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Piazza trade, while intended to ignite the lethargic,
underachieving Dodgers, created a problem in the team's operations.
Claire, who is in his 12th season as general manager, did not make
the deal. Chase Carey, one of the Fox executives who oversee the
team, put it together in conversations with Don Smiley, the Florida
Marlins' president. Claire was reluctant to discuss the issue, but
felt it was major enough to make it one point in his address to the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run,'' he said in a telephone interview, ``that
will be beneficial for our baseball organization because I think
even the Fox people would acknowledge that could have happened in a
different fashion. In summary of that, if your general manager
isn't being held totally responsible, then that's not a good
situation. I believe in responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Graziano, the Dodgers executive whom Fox named president
when it bought the team from the O'Malley family, acknowledged that
the ``mechanics could have been handled better.'' But, he added,
``We have assured people it was an aberration, a one-time type of
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire was indeed the club official trying to pry Johnson from
the Seattle Mariners. But his efforts led to two television reports
that proved to be 100 percent wrong. The first report had a deal
virtually done in which the Mariners would have got Nomo and
outfielder Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Claire heard about it when Don Nomura, Nomo's agent, awoke him
at 3 a.m. after he had returned with the team from a road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a story on a completed trade where we had never
mentioned either player to Seattle at that point in time,'' Claire
said. ``That's a great part of what fanned this fire. There wasn't
a night when there weren't 50 to 100 media people on the field
before the game. If anyone says our team wasn't distracted, just
look down on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week later, a second report had a Johnson trade
virtually completed for Ismael Valdes and Wilton Guerrero. Except
the report came after the Dodgers' deadline for a trade passed
without response from the Mariners on Claire's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson no longer a factor in the Dodgers' plans, Claire
turned his attention to trading Nomo, whose request for a trade and
subsequent designation for assignment threw another bomb into the
team's on-field efforts. After the unhappy pitcher was traded
Thursday night, a newspaper report introduced another element into
the front office situation.
</P>
<P>
   Claire, the report said, had been told to trade Nomo to the Mets
by Peter O'Malley, who remains chairman of the Dodgers. Claire
could not have denied that report more vehemently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely totally false,'' he said. ``In 12 years as general
manager, right up to today, Peter never one single time ever
instructed me on a player transaction to do anything. He always
gave me full, total, complete responsibility. This idea that he
instructed me to do anything is absolutely false.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another newspaper report last week triggered a seismic jolt.
It said that Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski and manager
Jim Leyland would replace Claire and manager Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Claire called the report a nonissue. ``My main concern was to
get Bill Russell settled down,'' he said, ``but it was hard for me
to settle him down when I was in the same story.''
</P>
<P>
   A Fox official and Graziano said there was no basis to the
report. ``With the change in ownership, there's all kinds of
speculation,'' Graziano said, ``just as there was when we were
going through the sale process. We have not contemplated any
changes. It has not been discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of the season, Graziano said, will be a time for
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always gone through an evaluation at the end of the
year,'' he said. ``Peter O'Malley did it at the end of last year,
an evaluation of how the team ended up and are we positioned
properly for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   First, though, the Dodgers want to concentrate on the rest of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to say I won't take phone calls,'' Claire said, ``but I'll
guarantee you that trade rumors involving the Dodgers won't stem
from any calls I make in the near future. Give this team a chance
to see what we're all about. It never could happen in the
environment we were in.''

THE NEXT MIKE PIAZZA?  
 THE AGENT NO ONE WANTS TO DEAL WITH  
 HALL OF FAME AND THE UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Next Mike Piazza?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Mike Piazza was No. 1,390 in the amateur draft.
Last week, Aaron Alvarez was the 1,390th player drafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh really? Oh my gosh,'' a stunned Alvarez exclaimed when he
learned that he was Piazza a decade later. ``I'm a catcher, too.
Well, we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, a high school senior from Duluth, Ga., an Atlanta
suburb, was chosen by the Florida Marlins in the 47th round. He was
hoping the Braves would pick him, but he was excited nonetheless.
``I'm still on Cloud 9,'' he said. ``It's been a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old Alvarez said he spent the past season working on
his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start catching until I was 13,'' he said. ``I
couldn't stand catching. But my rec team didn't pick a catcher for
the team, and I was the biggest one on the team and they asked me
to catch. I said I'd try it for a game, and I loved it and never
quit.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to spend at least a year at Middle Georgia Junior
College working on his offense. ``The Marlins want to see me get a
little better with my offense,'' he said. ``They drafted me for my
defense. They have me under draft control. If I do good enough next
year, they can still sign me before next year's draft. If I think I
can do better, I'll go back into the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he wouldn't be No. 1,390.
</P>
<P>
   The Agent No One Wants to Deal With  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott Boras, the agent whose $10 million demand the past year
sent J.D. Drew through the draft a second time, continues to be the
scourge of the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do your draft board,'' one general manager said,
``you mark the guys who may play football or go to college. Now you
have to add Boras clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Five players were selected lower than the possible first-round
picks they had been projected to be because clubs thought they were
Boras clients. The two left hanging the longest were Mark Teixeira,
a third baseman, whom Baseball America rated as the 12th-best
position player, and Brian Sager, who was ranked 22nd among
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Boston took Teixeira in the ninth round as the 265th player
selected, and Arizona drafted Sager No. 403 in the 13th round.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame and the Union  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame has opened an exhibit marking an enlightened
departure from the baseball establishment's usual thinking. It
depicts the labor relationship between owners and players
throughout the game's history and acknowledges the impact made by
Marvin Miller and the Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers have a long history of organizing and acting together
to achieve better working conditions and better pay,'' the exhibit
notes. ``The relationship between professional baseball players and
team owners is similar to that of other American workers and
business owners.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing part of the exhibit text, Miller pronounced it
``pretty fair, pretty accurate.'' After hearing the exhibit's
description of the reserve clause, which before free agency left
players at the mercy of their employers, the retired labor leader
said: ``That's pretty good. That's not bad. At least it says what
it was.''

</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, the temperature at Amarillo, Texas, dropped to a
record 41 degrees, marking the town's fourth coldest June reading
on record. The trail of record chill extended north along the
western High Plains and the Front Range of the Rockies to Denver
and Casper, Wyo., where the thermometer registered 34 and 30
degrees respectively. The cold dawn was fostered by a seasonably
strong high pressure system with a barometric pressure near 30.21
inches of mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the stalwart high will become a chameleon Sunday as
it drifts toward the Tennessee Valley, pumping warmer, more humid
air northward into areas it chilled less than 24 hours earlier. As
a result, scattered showers and thunderstorms will flare from
western Texas to western Kansas along a boundary that separates dry
air from the Rockies and returning Gulf moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of showers and thunderstorms will develop across
northern Kansas, western Nebraska, northeast Colorado, southern and
western South Dakota and eastern Wyoming as a disturbance racing
ahead of an upper-level low over Nevada lifts returning moisture.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada low will spark scattered showers and thunderstorms
from California's central Sierra Nevada eastward to parts of Idaho,
western Wyoming and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a pool of high-altitude cold air will swing east from
the Great Lakes, setting the stage for cool showers across the
Northeast, with snow showers at high elevations in the Adirondacks
of New York. Farther south, isolated thunderstorms will speckle
southern Florida. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HUMID BUT DRY
</P>
<P>
   In the steamy air that settled over the Texas coast, nighttime
temperatures have been stifling. Friday morning, with the air
teeming with water vapor, the low temperature at Corpus Christi was
81 degrees. Despite the recent rash of high humidity, rain has been
sparse. Indeed, the .01 inches of rain that fell late Friday ended
a dry streak of 38 days. The last time it rained was April 27, when
a scant .02 inches were measured. Moreover, since March 17, only
.05 inches had fallen before Friday's sprinkle, marking the city's
second longest period with a total of .05 inches of rain or less. &QL;

FOR LANCE ARMSTRONG, EVERY DAY IS A SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Pa.)  (bl) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ There were times during that awful siege when
Lance Armstrong, whose self-confidence had always matched his
extraordinary cycling ability, was not sure he would live, let
alone race again. The testicular cancer he had ignored had spread
to his abdomen and brain, and doctors gave him at best a 50-50
chance to survive.
</P>
<P>
   After surgery in October 1996, extensive chemotherapy and 18
months away from competition, he has survived and is racing again.
But the ordeal has changed him.
</P>
<P>
   He is no longer the brash wunderkind who, at age 21, won the
world and U.S. professional road-racing championships and a stage
of the Tour de France. At 26, the brashness has diminished, partly
because of his health travails, partly because of natural maturity,
partly because of the added responsibilities of his recent
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, too, because he had seldom wondered about his future.
Now he wonders. To start with, he is unsure what will make his
comeback successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all relative,'' he said in an interview this week.
``How do you relate a success or failure? Do I get back to the
level I was at previously? No. That probably will never be. But I
survived a deadly illness when I should have died. That's success,
so it wouldn't be fair to call my return a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's uncertain. It will be very tough and I'm just very
cautious. I want to be realistic. I don't want to raise my
expectations too high and be disappointed. It's better to be
conservative and shoot for minor objectives for now. It's really
like starting over.''
</P>
<P>
   The starting over began in March in the seven-day Paris-Nice
race in France. Halfway through the first day, he realized his mind
was not ready, so he quit the race and returned home to train more.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is back, stronger mentally and physically. He is the
leader of the U.S. Postal Service team, one of the favorites in
Sunday's $120,160 U.S. pro championship in Philadelphia. The
156-mile race, with 10 trips up the Manayunk Wall and its 17
percent grade, is built for the old Armstrong, but race fitness
comes through extensive racing, and he is not there yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started training again in February,'' he said, ``my
lack of fitness gnawed at me. It's in perspective now. It's not
going to come back overnight. I'm sure it will come back if I give
it enough time, but I don't know how much time is enough. It's
better to do a day at a time. I can see just riding out this year
and creating some base. The early indication is that it's not
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was fit enough to have raced Tuesday in Lancaster,
Pa.; Wednesday in Wilmington, Del., and Thursday in Trenton, N.J.
He finished second in Lancaster to Frankie Andreu, a longtime
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lancaster wasn't a World Cup or anything,'' Armstrong said,
``but I hadn't done seven race days this year and most riders there
had done 30 or 40. But clearly I was in the race. If that is any
indication, I can come back.''
</P>
<P>
   That Lancaster performance impressed Andreu.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing good,'' Andreu said. ``He's a little more relaxed
than he used to be, but I don't know if he's enjoying it more.
Maybe he doesn't feel he's under as much pressure. Before, he felt
he had to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gorski, the manager of the Postal Service team, said
Armstrong had made immense progress in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing great,'' Gorski said. ``I think he's adjusted. In
Paris-Nice, he learned he was not ready to compete at his old level
and may never be. I think he has accepted that. I think he's at
peace with himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he will be back to his old level, and I'm not
disappointed in that. What he's doing now is a huge accomplishment.
It would be unfair to him to expect more.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are new interests. Last week, the Lance
Armstrong Foundation for cancer research, awareness and education
grossed almost half a million dollars in fund-raisers in Austin,
Texas, where Armstrong lives.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he visited with cancer patients at a children's hospital
Friday and took part in a cancer-facility fund-raiser Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I leave a hospital,'' he said, ``I feel so thankful that
I was once there and lived that life and have come out of it and am
hopefully cured. At the same time, it's always hard for me because
I relate. I don't think I'm that far from going back.'' &QL;

NEWT GINGRICH: A BREAKER OF MOLDS NOW TRIES TO FIT IN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ask Newt Gingrich about former House speakers as
serious candidates for president and, ever the historian, he would
recall the likes of Henry Clay and James K. Polk.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was before the Civil War. But Gingrich has
defied historical trends; he helped break the Democrats' half
century of control over the House.
</P>
<P>
   And signs persist _ like his recent pledge before the Israeli
Parliament to support Jerusalem as the capital of Israel _ that the
54-year-old Georgian is considering a bid for the Republican
presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Some might call the idea nothing short of delusional. Gingrich
still faces an ethics complaint relating to benefits he may have
received from Gopac, the Republican political action committee. And
while his public standing has improved, aides in his press office
groaned when a recent ABC News survey flashed onto a television
screen showing that only 37 percent of those polled thought that
the speaker was honest and trustworthy, compared to the 38 percent
who credited the embattled President Clinton with those attributes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gingrich's brand of eclectic, activist conservatism
fits no distinct Republican mold. Moderates shy from his
confrontational tactics, while House conservatives tried to oust
him last year as too accommodationist. Party pragmatists consider
him too unpredictable and undisciplined.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gingrich has fervent supporters among Republican
grass-roots campaigners and small donors. And should he choose to
jump into a crowded primary field, he would, his strategists say,
do well precisely because in a race full of niche candidates he
would not be limited to any of his party's distinct constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are buckets full of every pond that Newt can dip into
and scoop out support,'' said Rich Galen, a Gingrich ally who now
heads Gopac, which Gingrich once ran.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the Christian
Coalition who is now a consultant, agreed: ``Newt's constituency is
not a piece of the pie. It's more like cake icing. It's spread
evenly throughout the party.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom, reasserted after Bob Dole's loss to
Bill Clinton, is that a legislative leader is a bad presidential
candidate. A speaker risks being defined not by his own positions
but by the legislation his majority passes. And the making of laws,
especially in a feuding, fractious House, is messy.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways Gingrich's dual roles, as a speaker seeking to
broaden his congressional majority and as a candidate needing a
wider constituency, fit together. They encourage him to be an
apostle of a Big Tent Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's close colleagues say it is in the ``center-right''
of the Republican Party that Gingrich feels most comfortable _ not
with the social conservatives but a few notches over with the
economic conservatives. He is a tax cutter who believes government
should invest in science, technology and highways.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans define his core constituents as the fans of
Rush Limbaugh who are probably anti-abortion but more interested in
pocketbook issues. They are the county commissioners, salespeople
and small-business owners who were the movement conservatives
before the religious right loomed so large in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who like Newt the most remember him when he was fighting
to get the majority,'' said Don Fierce, a Republican strategist.
``They remember when he came up with the Contract With America
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a funny way, Newt can cut across party lines pretty well,''
he added. Other Republicans point out that when conservatives tried
to oust Gingrich from his post, his base of support became
committee chairmen and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   But watching him construct his brand of Republicanism can be
like staring at a de Kooning canvas. It's bold and eye catching,
but it's also hard to discern the pattern. One day, over objections
from conservatives, Gingrich is pushing through the House a bill to
allow a referendum on Puerto Rican statehood. A few months later,
to the dismay of moderates, he is aligning with the Christian
Coalition and promising to cut off funds for the National Endowment
for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Setting himself apart from Clinton and appealing to Jewish
voters, he recently called Secretary of State Madeleine Albright an
agent of the Palestinians, and in a speech before the Israeli
Parliament parted with U.S. policy on Jerusalem. But days later, he
popped up in Bosnia to support America's mission there.
</P>
<P>
   Some House Republicans say Gingrich is trying to balance his
needs for the congressional elections this year with the
presidential election in 2000. ``The constituency for '98 we are
most concerned about this very minute is the hard right that we
need to have not angry with us,'' one House Republican said. ``He's
playing to that group today but trying to do it without
antagonizing the left-righters he needs for 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's confidantes say he is focused only on 1998, aware he
has no future if he does not keep the House majority. If this
year's election imperatives require him to ditch the high-toned
policy speech he began the year with so he can sharpen a partisan
confrontation, which might also drive up his personal negatives, so
be it.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich says he will not decide whether to run for president
until Labor Day of 1999. Critical in his decision is whether his
wife, Marianne, is comfortable with a presidential bid. Unlike
other candidates, he has not put operatives into early primary
states.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike others, Gingrich's star power, fund-raising base and
speaking ability give him the luxury to make a decision late in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of candidates will be able to raise $10 million, which
is the threshold just to run,'' said Republican pollster Frank
Luntz. ``Only a few _ maybe a half dozen _ reach the $20 million
threshold to carry all the way through. More than $20 million makes
you truly credible. And Gingrich's Gopac, and his fund-raising
capability, is truly incredible.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MORE FROM THE BIG BLUFFER IN THE BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The voice is familiar. So is its blustery bluff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics,'' the voice growled, ``has driven more teams from
New York City than any of us care to remember, most recently the
football Giants and Jets to New Jersey. I do not want to move the
Yankees from New York, but I must warn: he is bringing us
dangerously close.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice is that of George Steinbrenner and ``he'' is Peter
Vallone, the City Council speaker who has dared to disagree with
the Yankees' principal owner over New York's civic wisdom in the
much debated issue of building a new ball park for the Yankees on
Manhattan's West Side. To the principal owner, Vallone's
unpardonable sin was suggesting a referendum on whether city money
should be used to build new ball parks for both the Yankees and the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   To that familiar voice, the City Council speaker, in defiance of
the principal owner's pal in a Yankee cap and Yankee jacket, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, dared to want to put to a taxpayers' vote whether
maybe as much as $600 million of taxpayers' money be gift-wrapped
for ball parks.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Mets' owners have indicated a willingness to
contribute a fair share toward the cost of a new stadium near Shea
Stadium. But as yet, the familiar voice of the Yankees' principal
owner has not been heard offering any whip-out to defray any cost.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to that familiar voice bark that the City Council
speaker is just trying to hype his gubernatorial campaign, you
would think the principal owner was referring to a Yankee manager,
a player, even a secretary. Somebody the principal owner could fire
at the drop of a pop fly.
</P>
<P>
   The principal owner should know that he can't fire the City
Council Speaker the way he fired Billy Martin and Yogi Berra and
Dick Howser and Buck Showalter. He can't let the City Council
speaker depart as a free agent, as Reggie Jackson did. He can't
trade the City Council speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The principal owner should also know that he can't buy the City
Council speaker, as he did Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez. And
everybody else should know that whenever the principal owner talks
about taking his team anywhere, he's bluffing.
</P>
<P>
   To hear him hint about moving the Yankees to New Jersey, you
would think there were a stadium in the Meadowlands already built,
or at least under construction. But there is not only no stadium in
New Jersey, there's also no proposal for a stadium, no plans, no
financing, no nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In growling at Vallone, the principal owner acknowledged that he
hasn't talked to Gov. Christie Whitman about the Yankees for
``about a year,'' but added, ``if it's impossible to stay in New
York, I will accept her invitation,'' presumably to transplant his
team to the Garden State.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's invitation to what? To discuss if the Yankees will win
120 games this season? To her credit, Whitman has never sounded in
favor of spending state money to lure the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The principal owner had his chance in 1987, but New Jersey
voters rejected a referendum on a $185 million bond issue to
finance a stadium in Lyndhurst near the Meadowlands Sports Complex
as soon as a major league club committed to locate there and use
the words ``New Jersey'' in its name.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the principal owner doesn't want a New York
referendum. He knows that too many city taxpayers believe that
money would be better spent on schools, hospitals, housing,
transportation and real-world issues. He knows other cities have
rejected similar referendums.
</P>
<P>
   As for the principal owner's line that New York politics
prompted the Giants and Jets to move to New Jersey, it wasn't New
York politics. It was New Jersey politics, inspired by Sonny
Werblin's creation of the sports complex, that persuaded the Giants
and Jets to go there.
</P>
<P>
   As for the principal owner's line that New York politics
prompted the Dodgers to jump from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1957,
it wasn't New York politics. It was Los Angeles politics, in
gift-wrapping land for Dodger Stadium there, that made Walter
O'Malley an offer he couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few years, the principal owner has promised
every so often to announce his plan beyond the expiration of the
Yankee Stadium lease in 2002, but he has yet to announce anything
specific. Now he complains that the issue has become ``too
emotional and too political.''
</P>
<P>
   But the principal owner hasn't announced a ball park plan
because there is no plan. There is no West Side stadium, there is
no New Jersey stadium. There is only Yankee Stadium in the Bronx,
where the Yankees belong and should stay.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else the principal owner proclaims, he's bluffing.

FINDING FAKES IN CHINA, AND FAME AND FORTUNE TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ On an afternoon stroll down bustling Jianguomenwai
Street, the rumpled young man broke off conversation in midsentence
and hustled away to examine the rows of aviator-style Ray-Ban
sunglasses at a roadside stand. Holding a pair just inches from his
nose, he meticulously checked lenses, hinges and frame. He fingered
a tiny black plastic hanging tag, reading front, then back, then
front again.
</P>
<P>
   A small white licensing seal was missing from the tag!
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fake,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Such is shopping with Wang Hai, 25, a high school dropout who in
three years has transformed himself into China's first consumer
advocate, and a national hero. An odd cross between Ralph Nader and
Robin Hood, Wang crisscrosses China ferreting out and exposing the
legion of stores that are selling counterfeit name-brand products.
Whether it is fake cold medicine in Harbin or fake mobile phones in
Tianjin, Wang is there.
</P>
<P>
   He writes a popular consumer column in the newspaper China Youth
Daily, and his recent autobiography, ``I Am a Rogue,'' is a best
seller. In this country notorious for counterfeits _ from imitation
Compaq computers to imitation Fendi handbags _ there is even a
budding group of what Chinese newspapers call ``imitation Wang
Hais,'' other would-be consumer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps no surprise that Wang has achieved near-mythic
fame in today's China, where shopping is a national pastime and
producing counterfeits a big business; surveys invariably list fake
goods as the country's top consumer gripe. But Wang said China's
fast-changing political atmosphere was also behind his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this work is about protecting individual rights and I
think people are responding to that,'' he said on a recent shopping
trip in Beijing. ``In the past, our planned economy emphasized a
person's contribution to society, not fighting for his interests.
That's changing now.''
</P>
<P>
   A serious, slightly stout man who speaks as if he is perpetually
under cover, Wang is not at first glance the stuff of which myths
are made. But his cunning modus operandi has earned him the
gratitude of the Chinese public, who tend to view him as a sort of
David for the people against the store owners' Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   It has also made him a good living.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, China approved a consumer-protection law stating that
if a store sells a counterfeit product, the customer can return it
for double the purchase price. So, since 1994, Wang has been
scouring stores for counterfeit goods, buying in bulk and demanding
double refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Based on this simple _ and profitable _ technique, his operation
has grown from a one-man show to a company with 10 employees,
including a lawyer to sue any stores that balk at refunds.
</P>
<P>
   His Beijing Dahai Commercial Consulting Co. also has a
nationwide network of 200 informers who call to report suspected
fakes, and a widely publicized hot line where bilked consumers can
call for help. (Informers are paid for each tip and the company
takes a part of any refund it obtains.) Wang says that fake compact
discs and medicines are a particular problem these days. Pirated
CDs account for 90 percent of the Chinese market, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Wang says he is not against the legion of street hawkers who
sell obviously counterfeit goods _ like pirated videocassettes of
the film ``Titanic'' _ for a tiny fraction of the name-brand price.
What irks him are stores' attempts to pass off fake goods as real,
so customers do not get their money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being cheated,'' he said. ``These products aren't
as good.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's splashiest success to date was the exposure last
year of 200 stores selling counterfeit mobile phones and licenses.
These phones, which cost about $1,000 each, are a mainstay of
China's emerging business class.
</P>
<P>
   During an aggressive media campaign alerting consumers to the
problem and telling them how to identify the fake phones, Wang's
office was receiving 1,000 phone calls a day.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Wang got a tip that state-owned drugstores were
selling an antibiotic tablet that carried the Chinese logo of
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, the Swedish-based drug company whose Chinese
headquarters are in Shanghai. Wang discovered that the company did
not make this antibiotic in pill form in China, only for
injections.
</P>
<P>
   So Wang went out and bought thousands of pills from a variety of
pharmacies _ $12,500 worth of medicine. He has since demanded
double compensation from the stores and one has already reimbursed
him $2,500. His investigators even found the factory where the fake
medicine was being produced, although it had already stopped making
the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I started buying it, most of the medicine has
disappeared from the market,'' he said. ``But there will always be
something else.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wang concedes that this business was not born of noble goals.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in the seaport of Qingdao, Wang moved to Beijing after
dropping out of school at age 16 to work as a representative for
his father's picture-frame factory, and later as the Beijing
representative for a Shanghai light-fixture factory.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993 he invested all his family's savings in an ill-fated
restaurant _ ultimately losing $25,000. Disgraced and embarrassed,
he was desperate to find a new income stream.
</P>
<P>
   He found it one afternoon while shopping for headphones with his
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Wang said he was immediately suspicious of the ``Sony''
headphones his cousin selected. The edges of the headphones were
``too rough,'' he said, and the packaging was ``too ugly.'' Wang
bought two pairs, and spent the next weeks carrying them to various
government agencies for examination. Ultimately, the Technology
Inspection Bureau confirmed his hunch.
</P>
<P>
   So Wang went back and bought 10 more headsets, and immediately
set about demanding compensation. Ten months later he had a double
refund and a new career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first reason I did this was that I was skeptical that this
new law would be carried out,'' he said. ``The second was for
financial gain.'' But since then his sense of mission has evolved.
``I like the idea of doing something to help society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's detractors say his work is all about making money for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   According to prevailing myth, he owns a big house and drives a
Mercedes. In fact, Wang said, he lives in a rented apartment in
Beijing and does not own a car. ``This is not a very good way to
make money,'' he said, ``but it's interesting and important work.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Wang has become the darling of name-brand
manufacturers, who pay his company to ferret out counterfeits
bearing their tags. But he is the nemesis of counterfeiters and
store managers, who have threatened him with physical violence;
they keep his picture posted in their offices and refuse to sell to
him.
</P>
<P>
   He now wears wigs and a mustache in television appearances. In
stores, his eyes dart this way and that, and the nondescript Wang
does his best to remain, well, nondescript.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, a legion of blue-suited sales people in
the stylish SciTech Department Store looked on nervously as Wang
scoured shelves of compact discs. Was it Wang Hai, this ever so
strange shopper, who was too intently tugging on battery plugs and
peeling up the label edges on CDs to see if the underside was the
proper shade?
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later he had found a few fakes, but said the
store was too empty for him to pull off inconspicuously the little
round silver labels from the CD packages, which would yield the
ultimate proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to attract too much attention,'' he said. ``This
work can be a bit dangerous.''

</P>
<P>
   ``In a funny way, Newt can cut across party lines pretty well,''
he added. Other Republicans point out that when conservatives tried
to oust Gingrich from his post, his base of support became
committee chairmen and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   But watching him construct his brand of Republicanism can be
like staring at a de Kooning canvas. It's bold and eye catching,
but it's also hard to discern the pattern. One day, over objections
from conservatives, Gingrich is pushing through the House a bill to
allow a referendum on Puerto Rican statehood. A few months later,
to the dismay of moderates, he is aligning with the Christian
Coalition and promising to cut off funds for the National Endowment
for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Setting himself apart from Clinton and appealing to Jewish
voters, he recently called Secretary of State Madeleine Albright an
agent of the Palestinians, and in a speech before the Israeli
Parliament parted with U.S. policy on Jerusalem. But days later, he
popped up in Bosnia to support America's mission there.
</P>
<P>
   Some House Republicans say Gingrich is trying to balance his
needs for the congressional elections this year with the
presidential election in 2000. ``The constituency for '98 we are
most concerned about this very minute is the hard right that we
need to have not angry with us,'' one House Republican said. ``He's
playing to that group today but trying to do it without
antagonizing the left-righters he needs for 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's confidantes say he is focused only on 1998, aware he
has no future if he does not keep the House majority. If this
year's election imperatives require him to ditch the high-toned
policy speech he began the year with so he can sharpen a partisan
confrontation, which might also drive up his personal negatives, so
be it.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich says he will not decide whether to run for president
until Labor Day of 1999. Critical in his decision is whether his
wife, Marianne, is comfortable with a presidential bid. Unlike
other candidates, he has not put operatives into early primary
states.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike others, Gingrich's star power, fund-raising base and
speaking ability give him the luxury to make a decision late in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of candidates will be able to raise $10 million, which
is the threshold just to run,'' said Republican pollster Frank
Luntz. ``Only a few _ maybe a half dozen _ reach the $20 million
threshold to carry all the way through. More than $20 million makes
you truly credible. And Gingrich's Gopac, and his fund-raising
capability, is truly incredible.''

SALVAGING HOLYFIELD FIGHT WILL BE COMPLICATED MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after his heavyweight championship fight was
canceled, Evander Holyfield was relaxing in Atlanta, watching his
children compete in a track meet. Meanwhile, his lawyer, Jim
Thomas, and officials at Showtime and New York's Madison Square
Garden were left sifting through the rubble of a postponed boxing
show that may or may not be salvageable.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield was supposed to fight Henry Akinwande, the World
Boxing Association's No. 1 contender, at Madison Square Garden on
Saturday night. But the show was postponed Friday by the New York
State Athletic Commission after it discovered that Akinwande was
infected with hepatitis B, a highly contagious virus that can cause
liver damage.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Munick, the Madison Square Garden vice president of
athletics, said the arena would maintain its control of the bout if
it comes off. But the Garden will have to find a spot on the
calendar for it. Everything hinges on how quickly Akinwande becomes
free of the hepatitis virus.
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande's manager, Jean Christophe Courreges, had Dr. Donald
Kaminsky, who is independent of the commission, administer another
blood test to Akinwande on Friday. Courreges expects to have those
results Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he would await the results of that test before
trying to decide what Holyfield's next move would be.
</P>
<P>
   As Thomas sees it, Holyfield has three options that involve his
getting in his mandatory title defenses against Akinwande and
Vaughn Bean, the International Boxing Federation's No. 1 contender,
and fighting Lennox Lewis, who holds the World Boxing Council
championship.
</P>
<P>
   If Akinwande is available shortly, then Holyfield fights
Akinwande next month, meets Bean in September and possibly squeezes
in Lewis in December. The next scenario is to fight Bean, Lewis and
then Akinwande. The third situation would have Holyfield meet
Akinwande and then Lewis and fight Bean next year.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario that Thomas did not mention involves eliminating
Akinwande altogether. Thomas was asked whether Holyfield had
fulfilled his obligation to the WBA to meet its No. 1 contender by
being available and ready to fight, but then having the show
postponed or canceled because Akinwande was not fit to fight. ``I'm
still analyzing that,'' Thomas said. ``It's a very good question.
My immediate inclination is to say yes he has.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is predicated on Holyfield's being able to get a
pay-per-view date on Showtime Event Television.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime executive producer Jay Larkin said Holyfield and
Akinwande may have already missed their pay-per-view window.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pay-per-view calendar is not very promising for the
immediate future,'' Larkin said. ``There are no available dates in
the next two weeks. Then you have the World Cup, and there are no
international dates during the World Cup. So, now you're looking at
the end of July or the beginning of August.''
</P>
<P>
   That cuts into Holyfield's timetable. He hasn't fought since
last Nov. 8 when he knocked out Michael Moorer in the fifth round
in Las Vegas. An August fight means that he will probably get into
the ring again in November or December. If the IBF holds him to
fighting Bean, then Holyfield can't possibly get around to meeting
Lewis this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has a mandatory defense against Zejlko Mavrovic of Croatia
on Sept. 26, which means that he will not be available again until
at least the end of November or early December.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lennox were available right now, we'd be in negotiations
this minute trying to get a fight with him and Holyfield,'' Larkin
said. &QL;

SANCHEZ VICARIO TOPS SELES AT FRENCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario had that old Spanish magic
working for her on a muggy afternoon at Roland Garros on Saturday
afternoon; Monica Seles didn't stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent baseliner from Barcelona won her third French
Open championship, 7-6 (7-5), 0-6, 6-3, and put an end to Seles'
emotional run to the final in her first tournament since her father
and coach, Karolj, died last month.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario sounded almost apologetic for winning her first
Grand Slam title since the 1994 U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't express what I feel right now,'' Sanchez Vicario said
when receiving the trophy. ``It was a very difficult match, filled
with emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spaniard then turned to Seles, with tears in her eyes, and
said, ``I'm so sorry I beat you. I don't think you are the one who
deserved to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Spanish champions at the French Open are old hat, the
arrival of 12th-seeded Carlos Moya and 14th-seeded Alex Corretja,
neither of whom are regular suspects in the Grand Slam winners
circle, in Sunday's finale is not the surprise it would be had it
happened anyplace else.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the eight Grand Slam titles won by Spanish men have come
at this site, and two of them, Manolo Santana and Sergi Bruguera,
have won the event twice.
</P>
<P>
   Spaniards are, after all, born and bred to survive red clay
ordeals like the seven-round obstacle course that must be
negotiated by the winners of this event: sprinters need not apply.
The French Open rewards those champions who can go the distance,
weather a hundred hundred-ball rallies, ignore the grit that cuts
into their skin and racquet strings, and never betray a hint of
boredom or fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   The last time two Spaniards met in the final was 1994, when
Sergi Bruguera made his a back-to-back championship run at Roland
Garros by picking up his second career slam title at the expense of
the dark horse in the mix, Alberto Berasetegui. Then as now,
Spain's Sanchez Vicario won the final on the women's side: Spain
enjoyed two champions in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 24-year-old Corretja, this weekend again
presents a no-lose scenario for Spain: ``I've been working my whole
life to find a place in the final of a Grand Slam, and I know I'm
going to play a friend, so I think we already won, both of us, and
that's the most important thing,'' said Corretja, who trains with
Moya and the rest of the so-called Spanish Armada in Barcelona and
has been making ice cream runs with Moya and the usual gang here in
Paris. ``No matter who the champion is, I think we already won the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 21-year-old Moya, who took Boris Becker's advice
about cultivating his prowess on hardcourts and made a stunning run
to the 1996 Australian Open final, Corretja has never reached the
final round of this or any slam.
</P>
<P>
   Though Corretja and Moya have played each other just three
times, all of the confrontations happened, naturally, to be on clay
courts. All of them were decided, improbably, in straight sets, a
result that seems unlikely in this three-of-five-set format.
Corretja leads the rivalry 2-1, but Moya captured their most recent
meeting, 6-3, 6-2, at Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   Moya said his experience at the Australian Open, where he was so
astonished at reaching the final that he virtually surrendered the
title to Pete Sampras before they'd even walked out on the court,
had changed his approach to this final. He's not an ingenue anymore
and, despite his fondness for his opponent, he's not going to be
satisfied with anything short of a Grand Slam championship on
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe one time to play a Grand Slam final is a coincidence,
but I don't think two times is a coincidence,'' said Moya. ``I
think now is different because I'm not going to go to the court as
a loser as I did there in Australia. Here I want even more, and I'm
going to do my best to win the tournament. I don't want to lose in
a final again. I just want to be the winner.'' &QL;

NEW CENSUS METHOD GETS TEST RUN IN CALIFORNIA

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Cindy Jumper pulled her blue Toyota to the
curb in front of a gray frame house on a quiet street. She could
hardly contain her excitement. ``Great,'' she said out loud to
herself. ``The door's open.''
</P>
<P>
   A jumble of children's toys scattered about the front porch
indicated that someone did live here. The wide-open front door
indicated more: that this time, unlike the last time Ms. Jumper had
visited, the occupants were at home. A knock brought forth a
slender woman with short, dark hair, a small boy and a roly-poly
black-and-white puppy. The woman was soon seated in a wicker porch
chair, answering Ms. Jumper's questions on a census form.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans and Democrats 3,000 miles away argue the
legality and the merits of the Census Bureau's plan to change the
way it will conduct the United States' head count in the year 2000,
the bureau is quietly _ and, it says, successfully _ testing that
new method in California's ethnically and economically diverse
capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of April, temporary Census Bureau employees
like Ms. Jumper have fanned out across Sacramento, interviewing
residents in households that did not return the forms mailed to
them in early March. But the number of households that will be
visited is different in Sacramento from that in any previous
census.
</P>
<P>
   This river city of about 374,000 is one of three sites where the
bureau is conducting its dress rehearsals for the next census.
Unlike the other two _ an Indian reservation near Menominee, Wis.,
and 14 counties in and around Columbia, S.C. _ it is being used for
a large-scale test of a method called statistical sampling, which
will be used to estimate the size and characteristics of its
population.
</P>
<P>
   Following the procedure that has been used in every census since
1970 and will be used again in 2000, the bureau mailed forms to
households in the Sacramento test asking them to provide
information on the age, sex, race, marital status and income of
every resident.
</P>
<P>
   But in previous years, census takers _ known at the bureau as
enumerators _ were sent, repeatedly if necessary, to each residence
that failed to mail back the form. In contrast, the enumerators in
the Sacramento test were sent only to a randomly selected sample of
households in each neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau statisticians in Washington monitored the return
rate for the forms in each of the city's census tracts, and from
their findings determined how many households in each tract would
receive a visit from an enumerator.
</P>
<P>
   If half the houses sent back their forms, census takers would
have to get interviews from four out of every five of the remaining
households. If 70 percent responded, they would have to visit two
out of every three. From that sample, statisticians plan to
extrapolate the size and makeup of all the households that failed
to mail back their forms.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau hopes the new method will reduce the cost of
conducting the census and improve on the accuracy of the 1990
results. That year's head count, the bureau has admitted, missed
more than 10 million people, mainly blacks in the inner cities and
Hispanic residents in Texas, New Mexico and California. It also
double-counted another 6 million people, mainly college students
and affluent white owners of more than one home.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have attacked the bureau's plans, contending that
they violate instructions laid out in the Constitution on how the
census is to be conducted every 10 years. Since many of those who
were missed in 1990 tend to live in solidly Democratic districts,
Republican strategists privately fear _ and Democratic strategists
privately hope _ that a more accurate count would give the
Democrats an advantage when the data from the census is used to
draw boundaries for state legislatures and the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the political stakes so high, the Sacramento test is being
closely watched by the Clinton administration and House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As a test site, Sacramento mirrors the problems the Census
Bureau experienced in 1990. Officials estimate that at least 11,400
people were missed by the 1990 tally in Sacramento. And the
experiences of Ms. Jumper and other census takers illustrate how
difficult _ and expensive _ it is to get a complete count.
</P>
<P>
   On a gloriously sunny day, David Granados, 19, a census taker
who is also a student at a local community college, walked the
leafy streets of a working-class neighborhood near Sacramento High
School. Fewer than 44 percent of the households in that census
tract had returned their forms; he would have to get interviews
from four out of every five dwellings that had not responded.
</P>
<P>
   Granados was visiting many of the houses for the second or third
time. When he determined that no one was home, he left a notice
indicating that he had been there and listing a number where he
could be reached to set up an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to keep coming back five or six times and call
them six times,'' he said. ``If you don't get a response after six
times, then you have to use other means.''
</P>
<P>
   Those other means could include asking neighbors or the local
letter carrier. It could also mean finding the owner of the house
by looking through land records, and asking that person if he or
she knows anything about the people living there.
</P>
<P>
   It was this process, undertaken for every household that did not
mail back its form, that pushed up the costs of the 1990 census.
The process was also blamed for many of the mistakes, since the
longer it takes to gather information, the more time there is for
the data to become outdated and erroneous.
</P>
<P>
   There have been problems with the test here. Some Hispanic
enumerators have complained that they were assigned to non-Hispanic
areas, wasting their fluency in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   A special telephone number was set up so that people who speak
Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Vietnamese or Mien, a Laotian dialect,
could talk to someone and receive help in filling out their forms.
But the instructions telling callers which numbers to press were in
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a lot of things that were done wrong in 1990
they're doing again,'' said May Lee, director of the Asian Resource
Center, who serves on a local advisory group recruited by the
Census Bureau. ``Did all the surveys and focus groups that were
done after 1990 go down a black hole?'' &QL;

POLITICAL NOTES: SOUTH CAROLINA, OKLAHOMA, FLORIDA, OHIO

   A Likely Challenger Is Gaining on Hollings
</P>
<P>
   Final polls indicate that when South Carolinians vote Tuesday
for candidates to run in the fall contest for the U.S. Senate,
Democrats will renominate the incumbent, Ernest Hollings, and
Republicans will nominate Bob Inglis, the congressman from the 4th
District in the state's northeastern corner. But that is not the
news about this seat that is crucial to the control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The news is that over the past six months, according to the
polls, Inglis has closed to within five percentage points or so of
Hollings in theoretical fall matchups. More precisely, Inglis has
managed to cut Hollings' lead to five points or so _ from about 15
points in December _ at the very time when the senator has been
pouring more than $600,000 into re-election advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Being the incumbent, Hollings, a political moderate first
elected in 1966, is in a position to raise more money than a
challenger, and to spend even more on television, certainly more
than Inglis, who refuses to take political action committee money.
But can the congressman's momentum be slowed?
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Hollings narrowly avoided defeat, winning
re-election by 50 percent to 47 percent over his Republican
opponent, Thomas Hartnett. Since then, his ``negatives'' have risen
even more in the polls, as South Carolina has turned ever more
Republican and conservative, and his age _ now 76 _ has become a
bit of an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis, 38, is a solid Republican conservative. In South
Carolina these days, as in much of the South, being a solid
Republican can be like money in the bank when it comes to
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Incumbent May Run Yet Again
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years between 1976 and 1990, Wes Watkins represented
Oklahoma's 3rd Congressional District, in the southeastern part of
the state, as a Democrat. Then he left Capitol Hill and his party,
ran two unsuccessful races for Governor as an independent, and
eventually settled into a business career.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, sensing that the Republican wave sweeping through
the South was also beginning to sweep through the 3rd Congressional
District, known as Little Dixie, he switched to the Republicans and
won back his old seat. He was preparing to seek re-election this
fall when a back ailment forced him to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in Washington despaired about finding another
candidate capable of holding the seat, given the nimble political
footwork Watkins demonstrated in 1996 in pulling both Republican
and Democratic votes. They tried mightily, but in vain, to talk him
out of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders sensed a good opportunity to recapture the
Third and whittle down the Republican majority on Capitol Hill. But
they, too, had doubts about recruiting a strong candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Given all that confusion, the race to replace Watkins has seemed
for weeks to be on hold and wide-open.
</P>
<P>
   Re-enter Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, he announced that he had undergone back surgery
and felt ``very good'' _ so good that he was reconsidering his
decision not to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of reflecting,'' he said. ``I'm not being coy or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a No. 2 For a Race in Florida
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for governor in Florida must name running mates well
in advance of the nominating primaries, a requirement designed to
give voters a better feel for each candidate's particular brand of
politics and decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in presidential elections, the candidates for lieutenant
governor chosen here tend to be those who can add the maximum
amount of ideological, ethnic, gender and geographical balance.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Florida primaries are set for Sept. 1. But the
deadline for picking running mates is mid-July and groups
representing conservatives, liberals, women, blacks and Hispanics
are intensely lobbying the likely Democratic nominee, Lt. Gov.
Buddy MacKay, and his likely Republican opponent, Jeb Bush, son of
former President George Bush and brother of Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, 20 or so conservatives, including John Dowless,
the executive director of the Christian Coalition of Florida, a
major political force in the state, showed up on Bush's doorstep,
insisting that he pick an opponent of abortion. Such a choice would
stand Bush well with a great many party loyalists _ he says he
personally opposes abortion _ but might cost him the votes of
independents inclined to support him should he balance his ticket
with a proponent of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encouraged him in no uncertain terms,'' Dowless said later,
the implication being that Bush, who leads MacKay in theoretical
pairings in the polls, should not take his political base for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, in an early decision on a running mate, Bush named
Secretary of State Sandra Mortham, only to have her withdraw when
questions were raised about how she handled her state job. He
promised the conservative activists who came to call that the
second time around he would look for ``the most qualified person.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, if anything, is feeling even more pressure about his
choice for No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Political professionals say he badly needs a running mate who
could add geographical and ethnic or racial diversity to the
ticket, ideally someone from heavily urban South Florida, where the
Democratic Party, through various political miscues, has lost some
of its standing with blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   But his overtures to several possible candidates reportedly have
been rejected on grounds that he is headed for defeat, no matter
whom he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Is Nominated For Box of Wheaties
</P>
<P>
   The way Ohio's congressional delegation sees it, Sen. John Glenn
possesses ``every attribute of a champion.'' That's the phrasing 17
members, Democrats and Republicans, used recently when they asked
General Mills to honor Glenn by featuring his square-jawed,
all-American visage on a box of Wheaties.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, a Democrat and the first American to orbit Earth, is
retiring this year and has talked the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration into letting him suit up again, in October, at
the robust age of 77. This time he will fly aboard a shuttle
mission.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills has agreed to consider the request, saying there
is no question that the senator has shown the right stuff in a life
``filled with service, glory and heroism.'' But company officials
note that Wheaties boxes traditionally have featured only famous
athletes and, they add, such marketing history must be considered a
``strike'' against putting an astronaut and Senator, however
famous, on a box.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn says that considering his age _ he will carry out aging
experiments while in orbit _ perhaps his legislative colleagues
should have forwarded their request to Geritol.
</P>
<P>
   Political Calendar
</P>
<P>
   Besides South Carolina, Maine, Virginia and North Dakota will
also hold primaries on Tuesday. In Arkansas, Democrats will hold a
primary runoff to elect a Senate nominee. &QL;

ORDERLY OR CHAOTIC, THE CONVENTIONS' TIME HAS PASSED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   As the New York state Republican convention sailed toward
adjournment last week, the party's five candidates for office
gathered on stage, raising their arms in victory as red, white and
blue balloons tumbled from the ceiling and delegates swayed to
Bruce Springsteen's ``Born to Run.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the concluding hours of the Democratic convention
had offered the image of a Westchester County delegate in tears,
her loyalties torn among the Senate candidates fighting to get on
the primary ballot. It was a memorable image of a divided
convention that had turned over the selection of its candidates to
primary voters Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the lesson in these contrasting images is that
the Democrats are hurtling toward damaging primaries and certain
defeat. ``They had 15 candidates going in and 14 coming out,'' Gov.
George Pataki said in an interview, offering a succinct and
dismissive commentary on the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' view is that the Republicans have fallen under
the sway of a small group of bosses. ``What we have here is a
tightly scripted media show with a predetermined outcome,'' said
state Democratic chairwoman Judith Hope.
</P>
<P>
   But both interpretations may have missed the real import of
these last two weeks. If anything, the back-to-back gatherings
served to illustrate just how irrelevant state political
conventions have become. These sessions have become rituals _
expensive, elaborate and legally required, to be sure, but
nonetheless pieces of political stagecraft that, in this age of
television and independently financed candidates, have less and
less to do with the campaigns ahead or what voters will do in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans leaders asserted that their convention had achieved
its main purpose: choosing a slate of candidates, and shielding it
from the challenge of a primary. But the 406 Republican delegates
at the convention had little to do with that result.
</P>
<P>
   The unity of purpose was, rather, evidence of the dominance over
Republican politics wielded by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, party chairman
William Powers and Pataki, the men who actually decided which
Republicans would run for office this year.
</P>
<P>
   And notwithstanding the satisfaction among Republicans judging
the Democratic convention, there was probably little the Democrats
could have done to avoid primary battles. There are too many
credible candidates with too much money and independent sources of
support running for the party's nomination for Senate, governor and
attorney general this year. The party, out of power, does not have
the kind of political authority needed to keep followers in line.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the Democrats did have the wherewithal to prevent
intramural battling for nominations, would it matter? Many
Republicans and Democrats assume that primaries are necessarily bad
for the party; Democrats in particular remember the damage the
party inflicted on itself with the primary that preceded D'Amato's
last victory.
</P>
<P>
   But there is ample evidence that a primary can sometimes be
helpful to a party out of power.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic have three unusually strong candidates for
Senate: Geraldine Ferraro, Mark Green and Charles Schumer. As a
result, there is almost certainly enough inherent interest and
drama in this race to assure the candidates attention that money
cannot buy. That is particularly valuable when many voters,
generally satisfied with the way things are going, have shown
little interest in politics, said Lee Miringoff, director of the
Institute for Public Opinion at Marist College in Poughkeepsie,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of a primary _ the give-and-take with other
candidates and the media _ can help sharpen candidates' instincts,
force them to think through the nuances of their positions, and
develop responses to political attacks. Those are important skills
for whoever goes up against the politically resourceful D'Amato in
the brief general election campaign that will start on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro, Schumer and Green all assert they can avoid a
repeat of 1992, and will use the primary to attack D'Amato rather
than one another. D'Amato has told friends he does not believe they
will be able to do that; but if they can, the primary could
effectively set the table for the general election campaign against
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say the Republicans did not emerge with
significant advantages from their convention. Unlike Democrats, the
Republicans leaders will all be working for, contributing to and
voting for the same candidates. There is no strife in the party,
and there is general agreement on the message.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, jubilant at their convention's result,
compared it to the smooth and flashy Democratic convention that
nominated Mario Cuomo for a fourth term in 1994. ``The people in
this room are happy to be at a convention that was settled before
they came,'' Joseph Mercurio, a Republican consultant, said on the
convention floor Friday. ``They didn't come here to fight over
scraps. They came to get their marching orders for the fall
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a cost to that as well. There was a palpable sense
of energy in the hotel hallways and bars and on the floor of the
Democratic convention in Rye Brook. For Republicans gathered in
Manhattan, though, lethargy ruled the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get some people in here,'' John O'Mara, a
longtime political adviser to Pataki and D'Amato, implored party
workers after surveying a convention hall filled with empty seats
just as the vote for D'Amato's renomination was about to begin. And
after the first day, in which party officials took note of row
after row of empty seats reserved for onlookers who never came, the
Republicans pulled a divider across the middle of the ballroom at
the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers to make it seem less empty.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, most politicians believe that the Republicans
are in a dominant position going into the fall election. But
ultimately, the explanation for that has little to do with what
happened in New York last week or in Rye Brook the week before.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in short, less and less reason to believe that there
is much of a connection between the flash of a convention in June
and the results of an election in November.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Cuomo. &QL;

LUCIEN CONEIN, 79, LEGENDARY COLD WAR SPY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIM WEINER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lucien E. Conein, one of the last great Cold War
spies, whose swashbuckling tales of war and death and sex, almost
all of them true, form an enduring legend at the CIA, died June 3
of heart failure in Bethesda, Md. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   He ran agents behind the Iron Curtain in the early 1950s. He was
the CIA's contact with friendly generals in Vietnam as the long war
took shape there. He was the man through whom the United States
gave the generals tacit approval as they planned the assassination
of South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem in November 1963.
</P>
<P>
   He was the chief of covert operations for the Drug Enforcement
Administration in the 1970s _ a job he imperiled by publicly
declaring his honorary membership in the Corsican Brotherhood, a
syndicate said to be skilled in smuggling certain controlled
substances.
</P>
<P>
   He was decorated by four nations and recruited by the Watergate
burglars (he turned them down, and later boasted, ``If I'd been
involved, we would have done it right.'')
</P>
<P>
   Conein also told fellow spies and more than a few journalists
that he had served in the French Foreign Legion, which may or may
not have been true, and that he had lost two of his fingers on a
dangerous secret mission. In fact, he lost them fixing the engine
of a car carrying him and his best friend's wife to an assignation,
so the story had a basis in truth.
</P>
<P>
   These stories were often told in a smoky restaurant at a table
holding empty wine bottles and a dwindling flask of pear brandy,
said historian Stanley Karnow, author of ``Vietnam: A History''
(Viking, 1983), who spent 70 hours interviewing Conein (pronounced
co-NEEN) for a proposed biography. The project was abandoned when
Karnow decided that his subject was beginning to resemble Somerset
Maugham's fictional spy Ashenden, a man so consumed by espionage
that he cannot sort out his cover stories from the story of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was out of his time,'' Karnow said. ``He was the
swashbuckling soldier of fortune _ the guy who has ceased to exist
except in fiction. A marvelous storyteller. Whether the stories
were true or not was beside the point. They were almost always
almost entirely true.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Paris in 1919, Conein was sent to Kansas City to live
with an aunt, a French war bride, in 1924. Stories of the Great War
and France so moved him that he raced to enlist in the French army
when World War II erupted in 1939. When France fell in 1940, he
somehow made his way back to the United States and joined the Army,
which assigned him to the Office of Strategic Services, the wartime
spy service.
</P>
<P>
   The OSS trained him to parachute behind enemy lines. In 1944,
based in Algiers, he was dropped into occupied France to rendezvous
with the Resistance. In Algiers, during a different liaison, he
conceived his first child, with a Frenchwoman who later became the
first of his three wives, Karnow said.
</P>
<P>
   With France liberated, the OSS sent Conein to southern China to
join a French-Vietnamese commando team assigned to attack a
Japanese post in northern Vietnam. He formed an attachment to
Vietnam, an affair that ended badly for both.
</P>
<P>
   When the CIA was begun in 1947, Conein was on board. He
infiltrated saboteurs into Eastern Europe and trained paramilitary
forces in Iran. In 1954, he was sent to Saigon, where he laid down
caches of arms _ in coffins, buried in cemeteries _ for
anti-communist uprisings that never came. He also met and married
his third wife, Elyette.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Saigon in 1962, with the rank of lieutenant
colonel, as the CIA's liaison between U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge and South Vietnam's top generals. In that role, he delivered
a message that the generals read to mean that the United States
would not object if they assassinated Diem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few secret agents are ever given the opportunity to scale the
professional summit by arranging the overthrow of a government,''
Neil Sheehan wrote in his book, ``A Bright Shining Lie'' (Random
House, 1988). ``Conein was transmitting the power of the United
States to influence these generals to do its bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   The war did not go well for Conein. He was increasingly unhappy
as a small covert operation grew into a huge military disaster. He
retired from the CIA in 1968 and contemplated a war-surplus trading
venture in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, he declined an offer from Howard Hunt, another retired
CIA officer, to join President Richard Nixon's ``plumbers,'' the
secret team that bungled the Watergate burglary.
</P>
<P>
   From 1973 until 1984, Conein ran secret operations for the DEA.
Much about these missions remains secret, although Conein became a
public figure of sorts in 1975 by candidly testifying about his
role in the Diem killing to a Senate committee investigating the
U.S. role in the assassination of foreign leaders. His own role, he
testified, ``was to convey the orders from my ambassador to the
people who were planning the coup, to monitor the people who were
planning the coup, to get as much information so that our
government would not be caught with their pants down.''
</P>
<P>
   Conein, who is survived by his wife, Elyette, six sons, one
daughter, 11 grandchildren and one great-grandchild, will be buried
with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on July
14, Bastille Day.

RACIAL DISPARITIES CITED IN DEATH-PENALTY CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study on racial disparities in death-penalty cases has
found that black defendants in murder cases in Philadelphia are
nearly four times more likely than other defendants to be sentenced
to death, even when the circumstances of killings are the same.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the latest in a series of reports over the past
decade that have found racial disparities in death-penalty cases.
It was released in Washington as part of a report by the Death
Penalty Information Center, a research and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The center is lobbying Congress and the states to adopt laws to
allow prisoners on death row to challenge their death sentences on
the basis of racial disparities, just as people can now sue for
discrimination in housing and education.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the Supreme Court ruled that defendants could not use
evidence of racial disparities in death sentences as evidence of
bias in their own cases, even though the court accepted as true a
study of Georgia death sentences showing that killers of whites
were far more likely to be sentenced to death than killers of
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The findings reported on Thursday were immediately challenged as
statistically flawed and politically motivated by groups that favor
the death penalty. Diane Clements, director of Justice For All, a
victims' rights group in Houston, said that earlier work by the
main author of the Philadelphia study, David Baldus, a professor of
law at the University of Iowa, ``has been discredited by poor
methodology.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldus was in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia study was released in summary form in a report
titled, ``The Death Penalty in Black and White: Who Lives, Who
Dies, Who Decides.'' It will be published in full in the Cornell
Law Review this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The report, drawing on previous research in other states, also
found what it called a ``disturbing and consistent trend'' in
death-penalty states that makes defendants more likely to be
sentenced to death for murder if the victim is white.
</P>
<P>
   As researchers moved north to Pennsylvania from Southern states,
where executions are most common, they said they found little
disparity in death sentences based on the race of the victim, but a
large disparity in the race of the defendants, with blacks far more
likely to be charged.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, according to a study by Baldus that was the basis of
the 1987 Supreme Court case, defendants whose victims were white
faced odds of receiving a death sentence 4.3 times higher than
those whose victims were black, even when other circumstances of
the slayings were similar.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have found that in Florida the odds of a death
sentence were 4.8 times higher when victims were white; in
Illinois, 4 times higher; in North Carolina, 4.4 times higher, and
in Mississippi, 5.5 times higher.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dieter, the center's executive director, said the
disparities showed that ``white victims are considered more
valuable in the criminal justice system than black victims.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged in a telephone interview that if this racial
imbalance could be eliminated and the death penalty was invoked as
often for black victims, even more blacks might end up on death row
than at present. Most slayings occur within racial groups, with
whites killing mostly whites and blacks killing mostly blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the report noted, Kentucky enacted the first state law
allowing defendants to challenge racial disparities, after an
investigation found that all of the inmates on the state's death
row were there for slaying whites and none for killing blacks. &QL;

COUNTY IN VIRGINIA STRIVES TO SHAPE ITS OWN FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ By all accounts, Jermelle Penn and Carolyn
Hopkins have almost nothing in common. Jermelle is 9-year-old
third-grader at Irisburg Elementary School. Ms. Hopkins is a
40-year-old machine technician at the DuPont nylon plant.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have never met, they are linked through profound
changes now under way throughout southern Virginia's Henry County,
where economic reliance on furniture-making and textiles is
steadily giving way to uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Like countless other regions around the country, Henry County,
an area south of Roanoke near the North Carolina border, is moving
toward the future by fits and starts. Factory closings here as a
result of corporate mergers and cost-cutting measures have become
common for nearly a decade, putting hundreds of people out of work.
The DuPont plant, which opened in 1941 and once employed as many as
5,000 workers, is the latest, with a planned shutdown at the end of
the month. But in a way, that was the last straw.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than watch another manufacturing site turn hollow, this
one costing almost 450 jobs and as much as $1.4 million a year in
taxes, county officials have embarked on an ambitious program to
shape the future for Jermelle, Ms. Hopkins and thousands of others
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the effort depends on a candy bar.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye toward the rapidly growing technology centers of
northern Virginia, where companies cannot find enough skilled
employees to fill jobs, Henry County won permission of Nestle Co.
to use a likeness of its Oh Henry! chocolate bar in a promotional
campaign that sings the praises of the county.
</P>
<P>
   In recent advertisements in The Washington Post and The Wall
Street Journal and in promotional mailings, a picture of an Oh
Henry! bar in its colorful wrapper is followed by the tagline,
``We're hungry for work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known for about two years that DuPont was closing,''
said Benny Summerlin, deputy county administrator. ``We had to
figure out a way to soften the blow, how to market the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry County is more than hungry for work. It is famished.
Nearly every economic indicator shows that the county is lagging
behind the state and the country as the local manufacturing base
shrinks and the population slowly falls _ to 56,001 in July 1997
from 57,654 in 1980. Perhaps more telling is the rise in median age
_ to 35.3 in 1990 from 30.6 in 1980 _ a trend that suggests younger
people are leaving to find work elsewhere, cutting into the
regional tax base.
</P>
<P>
   The county is also grappling with an embarrassingly low
percentage of people with high school degrees: 53.9 percent, as
against 75.2 percent for Virginia and the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means almost half our people aren't graduating high
school,'' Summerlin said. ``Our goal is to reduce that to 20
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Since starting the Oh Henry! promotion, an $85,000 campaign
financed by the county, the city of Martinsville and DuPont, county
officials say they have received a small number of telephone
inquiries from companies curious about the county.
</P>
<P>
   But attracting new employers is only part of the strategy. The
rest involves efforts to prepare county residents by teaching them
skills that new companies might require.
</P>
<P>
   For schoolchildren like Jermelle, that meant a decision by the
county to spend $362,000 a year to give every child in the fourth
and eighth grade, starting in September, a laptop computer to keep
through high school.
</P>
<P>
   It also meant helping people like Ms. Hopkins, a DuPont employee
for the last 19 years, by working with Patrick Henry Community
College in Martinsville to create a curriculum that will help match
graduates to the local job market. In addition, the county is
allocating $280,000 a year to expand adult education classes in the
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody liked to talk about problems, but nobody was doing
anything,'' said Joanne Whitley, dean of academic and student
development at the community college. ``We finally decided, there's
been enough talk. Let's have some action.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While it remains too early to gauge the success, if any, of the
county's efforts, optimism abounds. In a visit to Irisburg
Elementary School, J. David Martin, the division superintendent of
public schools, showed Jermelle one of the new laptops that
fourth-graders will get in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neat,'' Jermelle said, wide-eyed. ``It could help me with
some math, reading and my language skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin dropped it on the floor to demonstrate its durability.
Jermelle looked aghast for an instant, then smiled to discover it
was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Made out of the same material they make motorcycle helmets,''
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool,'' Jermelle exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   At the DuPont plant, Ms. Hopkins and two co-workers, Kay Handy,
43, and Phoebe Gravely, 51, talked about life after manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a positive outlook,'' Ms. Hopkins said as the others
nodded. ``I'm looking at the closing as an opportunity for
schooling and preparing myself for something in the medical field.
I'm hopeful, but if something doesn't happen, Martinsville is going
to go down to nothing. Something needs to be done to bring some
good jobs into the area.''

GIULIANI PARRIES COUNCIL'S BUDGET PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after the City Council defied Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani by passing a budget without his consent, he struck back
Saturday, declaring that New York would collect less money next
year than the Council had assumed. The move escalated a game of
political brinkmanship, with higher property taxes as the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   In a curt letter to the Council, the mayor estimated that the
city's revenues would be $251 million less than he had projected in
April. The Republican mayor said that unless the
Democratic-dominated Council cuts the spending it had added to his
proposed budget, the Council will have to raise property-tax rates
to balance the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a very good exercise for them in leadership,
or the possibility of leadership,'' Giuliani said at a news
conference Saturday. ``If you want to lower taxes, you have to
lower expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Council members had expected the new figures. They said the
mayor was skillfully exploiting his power under the City Charter to
set revenue estimates. The property-tax rate is the only one the
City Council sets independently. The Council's staff estimates that
to cover the shortfall, the average homeowner's property tax would
increase $48.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said in the letter that over the next five days he
planned to veto most of the items that would be needed to bring
spending into line with the new revenue estimates. ``With regard to
any remaining gap, I am hopeful that we can work together so that
it will not be necessary for you to raise the tax rates,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Council's additions to the mayor's proposed budget are
weekly recycling collections for areas of the city that now get
service every other week; a program to keep some elementary schools
open from 3 to 7 p.m.; and reduced tuition for City University of
New York students who graduate from high school with a B average
and maintain it in college.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Friday, the Council passed a $34 billion budget amid
self-congratulatory speeches and standing ovations. Speaker Peter
Vallone crowed that the Council was finally coming into its own as
an equal branch of government, and Councilman Herbert Berman, the
chairman of the Finance Committee, declared that the vote would be
``grist for some future master's thesis.'' The euphoria lasted less
than eight hours _ from 4:08 p.m., when the budget passed, to 11:51
p.m., when the mayor's office paged the Council Finance Director,
Thomas McMahon, to deliver the new revenue estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone issued a statement Saturday calling the new figure
``fabricated'' and saying his staff would work through the weekend
to find an alternative to raising property-tax rates, which are to
be set Monday. ``It is incredible that the mayor would seek to
raise property taxes in the midst of the biggest budget surplus in
city history,'' he said. ``The City Council refused to raise
property taxes during the bad times. We're certainly not going to
allow a Giuliani tax hike now.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he had settled on about three-quarters of his
vetoes, which he called ``a road map as to how to straighten their
budget out so that they don't have to raise property taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget passed 43-7, with all the Republicans voting against
it and one Democrat not voting. So Michael Clendenin, a Council
spokesman, said the Council would easily override the mayor's
vetoes, which takes 34 votes. That foretells a long battle between
now and July 1, when the new fiscal year begins.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the mayor accused the Council of ``illusory
calculations'' and of spending ``make-believe money.'' He indicated
he could adjust a few figures himself to restrain the Council from
imposing what he saw as an irresponsible budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give them a revenue estimate,'' Giuliani said, ``and
obviously, that revenue estimate is going to be lower _ either
lower, considerably lower or substantially lower _ than it was
before, because the action that they've taken both in the budget,
which I've just outlined, and in future years does some damage to
the city this year, and significant and substantial damage in the
year 2000, 2001 and 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone responded by pointing to the city's financial vigor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to believe that in the face of what everyone
acknowledges to be the largest surplus in memory,'' Vallone said,
``that he would just arbitrarily lower the revenues and thereby
increase the real-estate taxes. That would be a real unusual thing
for a Republican mayor to reject the largest tax cut in the history
of the city and, in the face of the largest surplus, to ask for a
larger real-estate tax. That, to me, are three non sequiturs in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor returned to City Hall at 8:30 Friday night to discuss
the new revenue estimate with his staff. Council staff members, who
gathered at a nearby bar, contended that the number was a political
creation and started a pool on the new estimate, with entries
ranging from $100 million to $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani maintained, however, that much of the adjustment was
made because of changes in state and federal policy that the
Council should have known about, and that some of the reduction
would be caused by decisions in the
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Gifford Miller, D-Manhattan, called the new number
``bogus'' and said the mayor was taking a different position from
most other budget analysts and credit-rating agencies. ``It's
ironic that the mayor, now that he doesn't have the same control
over the budget that he used to, would suddenly switch course and
claim the city is not in sound fiscal condition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's budget director, Joseph Lhota, said he believed that
fiscal monitors would find the new estimates to be accurate and
necessary. ``The only thing we took out of the budget are state and
federal revenues that we're not going to receive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the budget dust-up as he left his news conference
Saturday, the mayor said with a laugh, ``I enjoy it.''

MALONE'S EYES ARE ON GOAL, BUT BALL WON'T COOPERATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Scottie Pippen whispered into his ear as he
stepped to the free-throw line for two crucial free throws in the
final seconds of Game 1. ``The Mailman doesn't deliver on
Sundays,'' Pippen coyly told Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Malone smirked and shrugged his shoulders _ and promptly missed
both shots.
</P>
<P>
   The misfires last June not only helped the Chicago Bulls
eventually slink away with another title but also left Malone's
teammates pondering the delicate nerves of their 6-foot-9-inch,
260-pound power forward, a large man who had trouble completing the
smallest of tasks.
</P>
<P>
   With Game 3 of the National Basketball Association finals
looming at the United Center in Chicago on Sunday, Malone is
chucking up shots, most of which are careening off the back iron.
His bad aim is not just relegated to the weekends, either.
Wednesdays. Fridays. Whenever. Like perennial runners-up Charles
Barkley and Patrick Ewing before him, Malone is standing on the
perimeter and hoisting away the Jazz's best chance for a world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with Karl shooting out there,'' Jazz
coach Jerry Sloan said after Utah lost its home-court edge Friday
night at the Delta Center. ``They're quick getting out of a double
team to cover other people on the perimeter, and that's why we've
always played that way with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Malone does not stop missing, the Bulls will soon be
celebrating. Beyond Michael Jordan's 37 points and Steve Kerr's
clutch rebound and assist with less than a minute remaining,
Chicago won Game 2, 93-88, partly because Malone could not find his
range.
</P>
<P>
   He missed 11-of-16 shots and attempted only four field goals in
the second half. His last basket came with 4 minutes 30 seconds
left in the second quarter, meaning the brawniest player on the
floor was a nonfactor the final 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Malone is 14-for-41 in the first two games of the series,
numbers that bear a disturbing resemblance to his production in
last year's NBA finals. He shot only 60 percent from the line for
the 1997 series, missing 23 out of 58 free throws. He averaged 23.8
points and 10.1 rebounds, but hit only 44 percent of his shots from
the field.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 6, with the Jazz's season on the brink, he scored 21
points but missed 8-of-15 free throws. The more his Hall of Fame
status blossoms over 13 seasons, the more his reputation as a
clutch player shrinks into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of things that maybe I could have done or whatever,
but I didn't,'' Malone said after Game 2. ``And I take
responsibility for that, and you can't shy away from that. What we
try to do as a team is on my shoulders, and when I don't do it, you
have to face the firing squad.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone is good at shouldering the blame. He did it last June,
too, owning up to his own shortcomings with his team's season at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``All year, I make those shots and it just came at a kind of
time to not make them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Jazz could dethrone the Bulls if he did not begin
to start making his shots, he added, ``No. Point blank, no. We will
not win this series if I don't play better. And that's just fact.
That's just the way it is. We have other guys that step up, but if
I don't play well _ if Karl Malone doesn't play well _ we don't win
this series.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks comfortable on the finals stage, even when his game is
suffering. Playing in a small market, his encounters with the
national media come but a few times a year. He loves to verbalize
his feelings whenever given the chance _ and his outspokenness has
often created rifts between players on his team and around the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Whether voicing concern about Magic Johnson playing with HIV _
before Johnson's original comeback in 1993 _ or taking teammate
Greg Ostertag to task for not hustling, Malone has spoken his mind.
</P>
<P>
   And now the finals provides the attention and forum _ his dream
come true _ an event with all the trimmings. His striking candor
and carefree attitude play well in a league suddenly short on
accessible superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Still, once he stepped onto the court, that pillar of strength
in the post has often been reduced to another big, strong player
with limited skill. With the world watching, he is wilting _ one
clanking miss at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's teammates are at a loss for answers. They remember the
hulking presence who used his marksmanship and his muscle to carve
up the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals two
weeks ago, not the frustrated spectator from the past five days.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman's efforts to swat the ball away from Malone as he
received entry passes into the post helped throttle him offensively
in Game 2. But Malone was often standing by himself after screening
for John Stockton and waiting for the pass. He kept firing and
missing. He was not executing the Jazz's offensive staple; he was
running the pick-and-roll over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be fine, everyone struggles once in a while,'' Bryon
Russell said. ``We all have faith in him. We aren't going to stop
going to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Antoine Carr, ``We need to get him rolling, one way or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to Game 3, Malone has decided to ask for his space.
``I just want to get away from basketball,'' he said. ``I guarantee
whoever is at my house right now won't mention basketball. And I
doubt if there will be anyone around the house when I walk in.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as the owner of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and a
natural-rain compact disk, Malone was possibly thinking about a
mountainous retreat before the team left for Chicago on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere far, far away from Michael Jordan and his team would
be a start, a peaceful and serene place, where the Mailman can
regain his confidence and prepare to finally deliver on a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play well, but in times like this it's really only
one person that can correct it _ and that's me,'' he said.  &QL;

HOCKEY COLUMN: MURPHY CREATES HIS OWN LUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ About a year ago, Larry Murphy seemed near the end of
a long and semi-distinguished career. After modest success in Los
Angeles, Washington and Minnesota in the 1980s and two Stanley Cup
rings with Pittsburgh in the early 1990s, the veteran defenseman
was toiling for the Toronto Maple Leafs, a team hardly in danger of
qualifying for the post-season playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Even the polite fans of Maple Leaf Gardens were booing and
heckling Murphy. It was as if someone had passed a law that said
whatever could go wrong would go wrong. But then everything started
to go right for Larry Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   His luck changed on March 18, 1997, right after St. Patrick's
Day, when Toronto sent him to Detroit for future considerations.
Murphy soon helped the Red Wings to their first Stanley Cup
championship since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   This season, which included his 37th birthday, Murphy was the
only player on the Detroit roster to play all 82 games of the
regular schedule. He also has appeared in all 18 playoff games. The
most important was Friday night in Joe Louis Arena, Game 6 of the
Western Conference finals against Dallas. In it, Murphy played 29
minutes 21 seconds, more than any skater on either team. Among
other chores, he scored the winning goal and set up the other one
to lead the Wings to a 2-0 victory over the Stars and a 4-2 triumph
in the series. Detroit next faces the Capitals in the championship
round beginning on Tuesday night at Joe Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   On a multidimensional roster that is deep in most hockey
necessities, Murphy is a critical component: the savvy veteran rear
guard whose poise and opportunism are most evident at the most
important times. One of those moments came in the first period,
when Murphy jumped off the bench during a penalty kill to turn a
one-on-one break into a two-on-one. Murphy and Bob Rouse, another
veteran defenseman, had read the play perfectly. Rouse ``hustled''
to the bench, Murphy said, so that Murphy could come on quickly
``with a little jump.'' It was a slick, shrewd move that proved
pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was so upsetting was that everybody was on the other side
of the ice,'' Murphy said of the Stars. ``I was the only guy on
this side of the rink.'' So he took Darren McCarty's pass and beat
goalie Ed Belfour with a backhanded shot.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room afterward, Murphy's face looked exhausted
beneath the perspiration, the scratches and the little red welts.
He said his team felt a combination of ``jubilation and relief''
about not having to go back to Dallas for Game 7 on Sunday. The
Stars, big and rugged, had the best regular-season record. They
played at least as well as Detroit in this series. The Wings never
got ``on track,'' Murphy said, until the final game. ``The rest of
it was just a scramble,'' Murphy said. ``These games are tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to last year, he said, this season's playoffs have been
``a grind.'' On most teams, Murphy would be the grand old man of
the defense. On this team, the honor goes to Slava Fetisov, who
turned 40 at the start of the tournament. His face now a mask of
scars and bruises, Fetisov has a style that involves more hitting
than Murphy's. Like many Wings defensemen, Fetisov must compensate
for the loss of Vladimir Konstantinov, the heavy checker whose
career ended last spring when he suffered brain damage in a
limousine crash a week after the cup was clinched.
</P>
<P>
   On the forward lines, the collision work is handled by Martin
Lapointe, Darren McCarty, Kirk Maltby and Kris Draper. Lapointe,
playing with great snarl, just finished the best two weeks of his
career. He has picked up for Brendan Shanahan, a veteran power
forward who used to combine scoring and rough stuff
</P>
<P>
   At center, Steve Yzerman and Igor Larionov can still skate and
pass well. But neither whips the puck past goalies the way he did
in his youth. For that, the Wings rely on Slava Kozlov and Sergei
Fedorov.
</P>
<P>
   By scoring his first goal of the series Friday, Fedorov
increased his post-season total to 9, most in the league. Clobbered
and knocked dizzy early in the game by Richard Matvichuk, Fedorov
came back with impressive vigor both attacking and defending. Late
in the game, he bowled over Derian Hatcher, the biggest and meanest
man on a big, mean team. It was one of a hundred such moments in a
most definitive game played by a gritty group of smart, tough, old
pros who are trying to be the first team to repeat as champions
since Murphy and the Penguins of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid a very heavy price to win,'' Dallas coach Ken
Hitchcock said of the Wings. ``They responded as champions do.''

EDITORIAL: AN UNDILUTED AGENDA FOR CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, June 7.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's visit to China later this month is
inextricably entangled in an array of political and security
problems that will shadow his trip. Clinton will need to be sure
that he does not gloss over the hard issues in his eagerness to
improve relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for instance, must not push security matters to the
margin when he engages the Chinese leadership on commercial
opportunities. The administration's handling of technology
transfers to China has been sloppy, producing at least one
potentially serious breach of rocket-guidance information.
Expanding trade is fine, but not at the cost of sensitive military
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   China's own transfer of nuclear technology to Pakistan needs to
be addressed. Without the Chinese assistance, Pakistan would not
have been able to develop the weapons it tested last month. China's
previous promises to prevent the sale of nuclear goods to Pakistan
have proved unreliable. Unless China now plays a more constructive
role in South Asia, it will be difficult to prevent a nuclear arms
race between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be a temptation to sidestep China's efforts to
influence the 1996 presidential election with illicit campaign
contributions. A Democratic Party contributor, Johnny Chung, has
told federal investigators he donated money provided by a Chinese
aerospace company that is controlled by the Chinese military. Armed
with that knowledge, Clinton cannot accept China's bland denials of
any attempt to interfere in the U.S. electoral system.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights are another important front. Here, too, Clinton
should not shy away from challenging Chinese conduct. Contrary to
demands from Congress that he omit his scheduled stop in Tiananmen
Square, Clinton should go there and affirm America's continuing
support for democratic ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can far better honor the memory of those massacred in
the square nine years ago by visiting, rather than boycotting, the
site. Hundreds were killed, but their cause remains alive, thanks
to the courage of a few famous dissidents and of thousands of
lesser-known Chinese, many still serving prison sentences for their
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more important powers of a traveling president is the
right to speak plainly in lands unaccustomed to open debate. Ronald
Reagan used this freedom to good advantage when he visited the
Soviet Union in 1988, meeting with prominent dissidents and talking
directly to Soviet audiences about the advantages of democracy.
Clinton can do the same in Beijing by using Tiananmen Square as the
backdrop for a blunt speech about the value of freedom and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest course for Clinton would be to cancel the China
trip. He properly rejected that option. But in going he must not
duck the issues that divide Washington and Beijing. Stable,
mutually beneficial relations will never be possible if American
leaders do not forcefully defend American interests.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE POLITICS OF EMBARRASSMENT IN ALABAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOWELL RAINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alone among the states of its region, Alabama has not fully
turned the New South corner. The main reason for that and for the
state's obsessive concern with its national image is its habit of
electing governors who expose the state to ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   George Wallace fashioned this inferiority complex into a
personal political asset with his defiant cry of ``Stand Up for
Alabama.'' But even the people who loved Wallace were humiliated by
his ketchup-splattered shirts and masticated cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Yet like members of a dysfunctional family, enlightened
Alabamians usually kept quiet around outsiders when it came to
their feelings of shame and their secret longing for a governor who
did not come across as a racist ranter or a corrupt rube.
</P>
<P>
   That tradition of silent shame may have changed Wednesday when
Winton Blount III, having won a spot in the Republican
gubernatorial runoff, celebrated his victory by saying the E-word.
The state's most pressing need, he declared, is a ``governor that
won't continually embarrass us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fob James, the incumbent governor, responded by suggesting that
Blount was a ``fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   James' argument that he is ``every bit a gentleman'' is weakened
by his record. He once did an ape imitation before the state Board
of Education. He announced that the Bill of Rights does not apply
in Alabama. His family owns a landfill that does business with the
state, and he wants to grant his son the right to build a private
toll bridge. When he welcomes visiting dignitaries, James often has
the rumpled look of a man who slept in his car.
</P>
<P>
   All this led The Birmingham News, which is generally kind to
Republican incumbents, to editorialize that ``Blount's right: James
is an embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   As a native Alabamian with a deep affection for my home state, I
salute Blount for getting the issue of embarrassing governors out
in the open and The News for supporting him. This is a terribly
important election because it gives Alabama a chance to embark on
the journey toward basic economic and educational reform that began
in Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi and Florida almost 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's contrasting lack of progress can be linked directly to
its penchant for electing buffoons. Because of the structure of
state politics, only a progressive governor can change things. The
Legislature is paralyzed by the gambling, timber and trial-lawyer
lobbies. The revenue system is a joke, having been tailored by
Northern corporations to avoid paying fair taxes on their Alabama
holdings. The education budget is sapped by scores of redundant
junior colleges, trade schools and faux universities that Wallace
set up as patronage mills. The state's chief asset, the University
of Alabama at Birmingham, was built with federal dollars. Its most
important industrial facility, a Mercedes plant near Tuscaloosa,
was lured into the state during the period between James' two
terms.
</P>
<P>
   James has established himself as a contender for worst governor
of the century, but it will be a hard title to nail down. Wallace,
by virtue of allowing unprosecuted racial violence and a culture of
endemic corruption in Montgomery, will probably win.
</P>
<P>
   But you've also got to consider Big Jim Folsom's public
drunkenness and the hayseed machinations of Guy Hunt, elected in
1986 as the first Republican governor since Reconstruction. Hunt
used the state plane to deliver him to preaching engagements and
set a new standard for rustic manners, conversion of campaign funds
to personal use and lack of meaningful knowledge about state
business.
</P>
<P>
   James seems equally devoid of public-policy expertise, but has
been more aggressive in showing it. His record has defied any
rational analysis. He first won election in 1978 by campaigning in
a school bus as the symbol of his promise to improve education. But
for the last four years he has kept the state in chaos by arguing
that Alabama, which ranks near the bottom of every educational
index, is spending too much on education. He is widely regarded as
less interested in improving the state than in his wife's
apocalyptic religious theories. She, by the way, called Blount a
``big, fat sissy.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount, who is 54 and the son of a former postmaster general, is
only nine years younger than James, but he represents a new
generation in Alabama politics. So does the Democratic nominee, Lt.
Gov. Don Siegelman. If Blount can defeat James in the June 30
runoff, he will face Siegelman in November.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for the first time in living memory, Alabama will have a
choice between two progressive candidates whose public appearances
will be occasions of pride rather than dread.

EDITORIAL: REMEMBERING ROBERT KENNEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, June 7:
</P>
<P>
   When Robert Kennedy's admirers try to explain what made him
special, they invariably describe him as a man who changed. Instead
of becoming cynical or burned out with time and trouble, they say,
Kennedy became less calculating, more passionate, more sensitive to
social injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Even Americans who are not old enough to remember him must feel
nostalgic at the idea of a man for whom politics was a catalyst for
moral growth.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kennedy, who died 30 years ago this month, is a
historical figure untrammeled by history. He was murdered while
campaigning for the presidency at the age of 42, after a career as
attorney general and senator that lasted less than eight years. He
did not leave behind any notable achievement that could have fixed
his image to a particular deed. His legacy was a presidency that
never was, a blank slate on which people could draw their visions
of a more perfect union.
</P>
<P>
   Like his brother John, Robert Kennedy impressed himself so
firmly on the national consciousness that Americans are able to
believe in two competing versions of him at the same time. The good
Robert Kennedy was a lifelong foe of organized crime. The bad RFK
apparently tried to cover up his brother's affair with a mob
leader's girlfriend, and probably knew that organized crime figures
were working with the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that this anniversary is bringing forth a
rash of biographies in which he is described as a hero to both the
left and the right.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Kennedy's personal story reaches so close to the
national core that it may live on as long as the country does. It
is a version of the old legend of a knight who purifies himself
through great suffering to prepare for a holy quest. Burdened by
grief over his brother's assassination, and perhaps a fear that his
own complicated relationships with the mob might have somehow led
to it, Kennedy searched for a purpose that could transcend regular
politics, and that cause became racial justice.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general who wiretapped Martin Luther King's phone
became a presidential candidate who lectured college students about
the unfairness of a draft that took poor blacks to war and left
middle-class whites to study in comfort. The great tales about the
later Robert Kennedy, the one who had changed and been purified,
were almost always about poverty and race. ``What the hell would
you do if you found out that God was black?'' he asked white
students at a South African university in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of Kennedy contrarians who scoff at the
legend, who point out that the Robert Kennedy who was supposed to
be about people, not politics, had no qualms about allowing Eugene
McCarthy to take the risks as an anti-war candidate, and then
big-footing it into the race after McCarthy demonstrated that
Lyndon Johnson might be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The record of John Kennedy's administration has taken a beating
on many fronts, and may be tarnished further. But the idea of what
happened to Robert Kennedy during the last five years of his life
supersedes all that.

SENATORS SEEKING REFORM FOR JUDGES TO AVOID CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE STEPHENS  
 c. 1997 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two U.S. senators say broad reform is needed to
combat what appears to be a ``disturbing pattern of judicial ethics
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   John Ashcroft and Charles Grassley, ranking members of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, leveled the charges in a blunt letter
sent Friday to the federal court system's top administrator, L.
Ralph Mecham.
</P>
<P>
   ``An alarming number of federal judges have apparently heard
cases involving corporations in which they held stock,'' the
Republican senators wrote. ``The number of unreported financial
conflicts of interest indicate that reform of the process is
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter says the problem may require wider financial
disclosure, perhaps even the posting of judges' assets on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, of Missouri, is chairman of the Senate's Subcommittee
on Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights. Grassley, of Iowa,
is chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the
Courts.
</P>
<P>
   The senators said their concerns stemmed from a series published
in April by The Kansas City Star. The articles revealed that
federal judges in Kansas City, Mo., and elsewhere presided over
dozens of lawsuits against companies in which they owned stock,
despite laws forbidding such conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The series also showed that judges caught in conflicts almost
never face discipline. And it revealed that few people see judges'
financial disclosure reports because the judiciary imposes tight
restrictions on their release.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, the senators described the process for
obtaining the reports as ``difficult and intimidating.'' They
questioned why judges filed them in Washington but not at local
courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   Although members of the public can request copies of the
reports, the letter pointed out that they must use a special form
unavailable outside the capital. All requests must be notarized.
And before court officials mail out a disclosure report, they alert
the judge to the name and occupation of the requester.
</P>
<P>
   ``This notification procedure cannot help but have a chilling
effect,'' the senators wrote. ``Litigants understandably are
reluctant to appear to be snooping around in the presiding judge's
finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``These procedures appear to be in need of substantial
revision.''
</P>
<P>
   Reforms approved last month by judges in the Western District of
Missouri could be a model for a nationwide solution, the letter
says. The judges plan to make lists of their assets available
locally, at the clerk of courts office. Anyone will be able to
review the reports without providing identification, and no one
will warn the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The letter asks Mecham, director of the Administrative Office of
the U.S. Courts, to estimate the frequency of ethics-law violations
by judges throughout the country. And it asks Mecham's opinion on
other ways to make judges' assets more available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the letter asks Mecham to examine the feasibility
of posting lists of judges' assets on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about the scope of this problem and the need
for enhanced access to financial disclosure forms,'' the letter
explains. ``At the same time, we understand there are legitimate
concerns regarding security and potential harassment suits.
However, we believe these concerns can be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators' letter adds to a growing momentum for judicial
change since The Star series ran.
</P>
<P>
   The Administrative Office is investigating creation of a
computer system that would automatically identify conflicts of
interest. Independently, three federal appeals circuits are
exploring other possible reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Judicial Conference, which sets policy for federal
courts nationwide, recently wrote each of the nation's 2,000
federal judges and urged them to obey ethics laws. A committee of
the judicial conference plans to consider the need for systemwide
change at an August meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The senators also are not the first on Capitol Hill to express
concern. In April, two members of the House Judiciary Committee
called for a congressional inquiry into the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might want to insert our legislative oars into the water,''
Rep. Howard Coble, a North Carolina Republican, said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft and Grassley have a history of pressing for more
accountability among judges. For example, Ashcroft called hearings
last year on judicial activism and Grassley called for a General
Accounting Office study that was critical this year of travel by
judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say,'' the senators wrote in Friday's letter,
``when federal judges fail to obey the laws that govern their
conduct, they send a terrible message to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The Star series, ``On Their Honor,'' can be read on the
newspaper's Web site at kcstar.com. Also posted on the site are
financial disclosure forms for federal judges in the Kansas City
area.

DUBIOUS CLAIMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL DANGER ARE THE REAL THREAT TO
HUMANITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   UNDATED: In case you missed it, asbestos apparently doesn't pose
nearly the lung cancer risk U.S. regulators claimed more than a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   A report published in last month's New England Journal of
Medicine by three Canadian scientists says the Environmental
Protection Agency model ``overestimated the risk of
asbestos-induced lung cancer by at least a factor of 10.'' The
claim is based on extensive research done in a Quebec area having
one of the world's heaviest concentrations of asbestos mines and
mills.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists have been quick to dispute the Canadians'
conclusions, but a synopsis of the findings seems to reflect sound
science. They did their research among women living in
asbestos-laden air during the 1940s and '50s before modern
pollution-control equipment was available. Even though the
community's exposure levels were five times higher than the maximum
limit for asbestos workers today, the women proved no more likely
to develop lung cancer than women in relatively asbestos-free areas
of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, it should be noted, disputed the danger from exposure to
massive asbestos ingestions of the sort shipbuilders encountered a
half-century or more ago. What critics of the early asbestos
regulation warned against was the sort of overreaction regulators
seem incapable of resisting.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings went unheeded and billions of dollars have since
been spent on required asbestos removals. Not only were these
efforts often economically wasteful, but the very act of removing
asbestos may have posed greater dangers than leaving it alone.
Nevertheless, there was a lot of money to be made from the scare,
and financial incentives soon overwhelmed calls for common sense.
</P>
<P>
   This has been par for the course when it comes to real and
imagined environmental dangers in America. Has there been any
environmental scare that proved valid?
</P>
<P>
   The list of threats that have been either entirely discredited
or shown to be much less dangerous than claimed seems to grow with
each passing year: Acid rain, cyclamates, pesticides, global
warming, ozone depletion, second-hand tobacco smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental movement and its government and media allies
have always made a number of dubious assumptions as they've pressed
their crusade. One is that most human beings need to be protected
from themselves by those who are smarter and more environmentally
responsible. This assumption is buttressed by the belief that
humans are like hot-house flowers lacking the wherewithal to
survive the everpresent toxins that are part and parcel of normal
life on the planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever government has gotten involved, another assumption is
that economics and environmental concerns bear no relationship.
Once a problem is created, identified and adequately publicized,
the regulatory response is that money should be no object when it
comes to eliminating the perceived threat. If the taxpayer can't be
forced to pay the freight, government imposes the financial
responsibility on the private sector, and cost-benefit
considerations are out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   The economist-journalist Warren Brookes warned in a cautionary
essay in the early 1990s that while wanting to save the Earth was a
worthy goal, it should be an informed undertaking. The problem with
the movement is that it has always reacted to dubious claims first
and informed itself later, if at all.

BUSINESSES EXPLOIT BEANIE BABY BALLYHOO TO REAP BONANZAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1997 Kansas City Star

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Businesses and ball clubs facing lagging
sales are turning to the latest marketing medicine: a shot of
Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's is selling more food than ever by stuffing a Teenie
Beanie Baby in the bag along with those burgers and fries.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fast-food chain started giving away a reported 250
million Teenie Beanie Babies on May 22, cars have clogged its
restaurants' drive-through lanes, and customers have crowded
counters, many hoping to build sets of the 12 tiny stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's isn't alone in mining the Beanie Baby mania, a fad
that doesn't seem to be flagging.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals recently gave away 13,000 Roary Beanie
Babies at its game against the Oakland A's, boosting attendance by
83 percent over its previous Sunday afternoon outing, May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Other ball clubs, including the Detroit Tigers and the New York
Yankees, have experienced similar results riding the Beanie Baby
wave, although in some instances the ``fans'' didn't stick around
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Most Beanie Baby collectors are behaving like civilized people,
but others have resorted to guerrilla tactics to hunt and capture
as many Beanies and Teenies as possible.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's had a similar giveaway last year, and 100 million
Beanie Babies were scooped up. This time McDonald's set clear
ground rules for customers, including one that they could purchase
the toys only every two hours.
</P>
<P>
   But recently a crowd at a McDonald's in Overland Park, Kan.,
decided they were on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Dixon, an employee of a Godfather's Pizza next to the
McDonald's, described what he saw May 23, the day after McDonald's
started its latest Teenie Beanie Baby giveaway:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parking lot started filing up with cars, and so was
McDonald's and the gas station across the street. It was just crazy
amounts of people. People were coming in here to use the bathroom
to change their clothes and then changing cars in our parking lot
so employees wouldn't recognize them. It really started getting
crazy. There were minivans and Blazers full of people. Our manager
asked them to leave, so they just started changing clothes in the
parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Dixon said, the police were called to monitor the
situation and eventually direct traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were obviously breaking the rules. These were
normal-looking people, but it was like they had some master plan to
get their hands on those Beanie Babies,'' Dixon said. ``But why? I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Robert Schachter of New York said he didn't think
Beanie Babies themselves generated mass insanity, but added:
``That's not usual behavior under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some die-hard collectors don't know why they're maniacally
driven to collect the critters.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Austin American-Statesman, a woman in that
Texas city dissected a Wrinkles the Dog to determine whether some
chemical inside was compelling her to add to her 500-plus Beanie
Baby collection.
</P>
<P>
   Schachter said it was really Ty Inc., the marketer of Beanie
Babies, that had induced the craze by randomly yanking certain
models off the market without warning.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately prices for the ``retired'' Beanie Babies, most of
which are made in China, go crazy on the secondary market. Even
rumors of such actions cause prices to spike.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Web sites on the Internet are devoted to Beanie
Babies, and many include price lists. At a recent Beanie Baby show
in California, a woman displayed an ``Employee Bear'' she'd just
bought for $4,600.
</P>
<P>
   A chat room at one of the Web sites contained a discussion of
the McDonald's Teenie Beanie Baby promotion. One woman described
how she'd bought some Happy Meals to get the toys and then offered
the food to a homeless woman, who said, ``Ugh, not another Happy
Meal.'' She then directed the benevolent collector to others
willing to take the meals.
</P>
<P>
   One local woman, who asked that her name not be used, admitted
having thousands of Beanie Babies. She has four full sets of every
Beanie Baby issued and extras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my friends to know how addicted I am to Beanie
Babies now,'' she said. ``It's starting to get embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   But she perked up when asked why she collected Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm collecting one set each for my three children and then
one for me for my retirement!''
</P>
<P>
   Psychotherapist Susan Maxwell of Los Angeles said she understood
why children loved and collected Beanie Babies but was less clear
why adults were caught up in the craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the artificial scarcity'' creates a more frenetic
atmosphere ``because they feel like they're missing out on
something,'' Maxwell said. ``Some people think by collecting
something desirable, it will bring something mystical, magical to
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some view the whole collecting mania as crazy, others
say it has positive aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Another local collector, who also asked that her name not be
used, said collecting and talking about Beanie Babies was something
her whole family got involved in. She said she wanted to remain
anonymous not because she was ashamed but because she didn't want
to be lumped with ``crazies.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her sons, age 10, is attracted to all the Beanie Baby
dogs and is serious about his collection. The other, age 7, likes
the quirkier ones and enjoys playing with them.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night at a local McDonald's, Trisha Brown won the
12-critter Teenie Beanie Baby set being distributed in a special
drawing. She gave the set to her niece, Lexie.
</P>
<P>
   Lexie's mother, Theresa Storrer, said the whole family was into
collecting Beanie Babies. Together, they have about 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long ago we thought the market was about to go flat, but
after seeing what's happened with McDonald's and its giveaway, I
don't know,'' Storrer said. ``It looks like this thing could go on
for a long, long time.''

AS A CHAPTER IN THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING ENDS, AMERICA REMAINS
CHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1997 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Two Americans, former soldiers at that, now stand
convicted of plotting a crime that toppled a federal building,
killed and injured hundreds of their countrymen and made a nation
feel less secure.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Terry Nichols was sentenced to a lifetime behind
bars for his role in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed
168 persons and injured more than 500. Timothy McVeigh waits on
death row.
</P>
<P>
   Three years of investigations and trials bring this federal case
to a close, but can this country ever be the same?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time when America lost its sense of security,'' said
Martin Cash, a Department of Veterans Affairs employee who lost an
eye in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Even the simple act of parking near federal buildings and some
county courthouses has changed: Parking frequently is prohibited
because a car or a truck could hide a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a vulnerable people,'' Larry Mackey, lead prosecutor in
the Nichols trial, said after the sentencing. ``We have learned
that from this case in a way I hope we'll never see again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that vulnerability doesn't change who we are. It reminds
us of our responsibility to each other. When there is crime, we all
have to step forward as a nation and individually.''
</P>
<P>
   If the country feels more vulnerable because of the bombing, it
should also feel more resilient, Judge Richard Matsch said Thursday
before sentencing Nichols. Nichols was found guilty of conspiracy
and involuntary manslaughter. A year earlier, a jury found McVeigh
guilty of murder and conspiracy and sentenced him to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only inference that can be drawn from all this evidence
was that there was an intention here to change the course of
government, change the policies of government through fear and
intimidation,'' Matsch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, it didn't work out that way. Quite the
contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsch said he was impressed that federal workers showed up at
temporary headquarters the day after the bombing to keep the
government in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``What occurred to me was that a community became even more
united and, I think, perhaps the country as well,'' Matsch said.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma City, the destroyed federal building is being
replaced by three buildings, none over three stories tall, said
Paul Heath, a psychologist who leads a group for bombing survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who are somewhat frightened by being in
government buildings, but by far the majority of people believe
that their government is capable of protecting them and carrying on
business,'' Heath said.
</P>
<P>
   Heath said the end of the McVeigh and Nichols trials should
hasten the healing process for Oklahomans, who were affected more
than most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly will go a long, long way,'' Heath said,
describing the trials as a painful distraction. ``The trial was
necessary for me, but I really wanted it to be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Guzman, whose brother Randy Guzman, a Marine captain, was
killed in the blast, attended most of the Nichols and McVeigh
trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to move on,'' Guzman said Thursday. ``I'm closing
this chapter and going back home to California. Randy is never
going to come back, but I'm satisfied (Nichols) is actually going
to pay the price now.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Kight, whose 23-year-old daughter died in the bombing,
said the Nichols sentencing did not ease her pain but had increased
her empathy for people who lose a friend or relative to crime.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence ``brings a lot of emotion, but it sure won't bring
closure,'' Kight said. ``I will continue to fight for (crime
victims) as I did for my daughter. It's too important. I can't turn
my back.''
</P>
<P>
   People like Kight may have to bear yet another bombing trial,
this time in Oklahoma state court.
</P>
<P>
   A state grand jury has heard from more than 100 witnesses in an
investigation that could lead to indictments of Nichols and McVeigh
on state murder charges. Both could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   They can be tried again, because the federal charges dealt with
the deaths of eight federal agents. The state charges would be for
the deaths of the 160 other victims.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury inquiry also has tried to identify any others who
assisted McVeigh and Nichols, such as the suspect known only as
John Doe No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The federal cases will give state prosecutors an advantage over
the defense, said Scott Robinson, a Denver trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know who all the witnesses are and how they'll do, and
the defense loses the element of surprise,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahomans have a right to seek justice, Mackey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm delighted that the people of Oklahoma City
have convened a grand jury, that they are going through that
evidence with great diligence,'' Mackey said.
</P>
<P>
   There also is the possibility of more federal proceedings.
Nichols and McVeigh are requesting new trials.
</P>
<P>
   The wait for justice in the McVeigh and Nichols cases has been
long, Mackey acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message here is `Trust your American judicial system,' &UR; ''
Mackey said. ``Be patient; it takes time. Give the system time, and
that system will prevail.''

ABORTION ISSUE CAUSES SOME TO RESIST VACCINATIONS FOR THEIR
CHILDREN

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   KNOB NOSTER, Mo. _ Todd Parish didn't mind when his 1-year-old
son, Timothy, was vaccinated against chickenpox two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the Air Force sergeant at Whiteman Air Force
Base learned that cells derived from aborted fetuses were used to
make the vaccine. And that similar cells were used to make the
hepatitis A and rubella shots Parish got several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Parish, who describes himself as a conservative Christian and a
staunch opponent of abortion, was appalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is battling the military over whether soldiers should be
informed about how vaccines are made and be allowed to reject them
on moral grounds.
</P>
<P>
   He is also refusing to let his 6-year-old daughter, Ashley, get
a chickenpox shot, even though it is required of children attending
military-run elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not know when I was injected what I was getting,'' said
Parish, 27. ``That tramples on my moral convictions. Unknowingly, I
became involved in something I find immoral and hideous.''
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces require their personnel to be vaccinated for a
variety of diseases.
</P>
<P>
   And when vaccinations are deemed necessary, no exceptions are
made for soldiers with moral qualms, said Department of Defense
spokesman Jim Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for the safety of the group,'' Turner said. ``He (a
soldier) has to be reliable. Maybe somebody could die because he's
not doing his job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department does allow vaccination exemptions for
children on religious grounds. And Parish plans to exercise that
option.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family were to leave his base near Knob Noster on
June 7 for Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The only school there is
operated by the Defense Department. Parish and his wife, Kara, 25,
said they would rather teach Ashley at home than let her be
vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so crazy about that,'' Parish said. ``But if I have
to, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Parish has filed a grievance with the Air Force about the way
vaccinations are handled. His case has been referred to the
Department of Defense inspector general's office, which would not
comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   Parish won't be fighting the military alone. His case has gained
the support of the Rutherford Institute, the legal defense
organization that handled Paula Jones' unsuccessful sexual
harassment lawsuit against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like this one a lot,'' said Ron Rissler, the institute's
legal coordinator. ``This deals with his religious beliefs,
parental rights. And we're disturbed about the use of fetal tissue.
That's a violation of the sanctity of human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Cell lines derived from fetal tissue provide a medium for
growing viruses used in vaccines. They long have been used in
medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers and manufacturers prefer fetal cells because they
can go through many more divisions than mature cells. That means
fetal cell lines do not have to be replaced very often and can be
used over time to produce uniform batches of vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The cells used to make Varivax, the chickenpox vaccine, came
from tissue taken from two fetuses from therapeutic abortions
performed in the mid-1960s in Sweden and Great Britain. The cells
are many, many generations removed from those of the fetuses
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Parish said he is not opposed to vaccines in general. He gets a
flu shot every year.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't opposed to the use of human tissue in medicine, as long
as the donor of that tissue is able to consent. Parish has signed
up to be an organ donor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I still think the use of fetal tissue for my gain
shouldn't happen,'' he said. ``By accepting this vaccine, we're
encouraging the development of more fetal tissue products. We're
helping people profit from the death of two fetuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Parish's moral concerns are very real ones, said M.C. Sullivan,
a bioethicist with the Midwest Bioethics Center in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly some people will say: `Don't waste this valuable
(fetal tissue) resource. Let's find some good in this.' But are we
meant to be seen as potential human salvage yards?'' she asked.
``He raises very serious issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of fetal cells has become a subterranean issue among
some anti-abortion groups, erupting occasionally on the Internet or
taking hold in church groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the overall concern we in the pro-life community
have about the rights of the unborn,'' said Douglas Peterson of the
group Stop Fetal Tissue Research, based in McHenry, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Parish brought the fetal tissue-vaccine connection to her
husband's attention after she learned about it at a women's Bible
study group.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Merck &AMP; Co. Inc., the manufacturer of Varivax,
said the connection between the vaccine and any tissue taken from
aborted fetuses is tenuous at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merck does not see this as fetal tissue per se,'' said Donna
Cary. ``Someone took a small sample of cells and put them on a
petri dish 30 years ago. It was a little scraping.''
</P>
<P>
   The chickenpox vaccine was developed using virus taken from a
3-year-old Japanese boy in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese researcher weakened the virus by growing it in both
human fetal cells and animal cells. From this virus strain, Merck
produced its vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine must be grown in fetal cells because that was the
primary medium used to develop and test it, Cary said.
Manufacturing it with animal cells could make the vaccine less safe
or effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``These types of cell lines are used in so much research, if
they were banned it would pretty much shut down medical advances,''
Cary said.

2 OF JETS' QUARTERBACKS ARE JUST LEARNING, FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Neither Neil O'Donnell nor Glenn Foley was
around this week for the Jets' rookie camp. Instead, the team was
directed by Ray Lucas, the Rutgers product, and Chuck Clements, the
quarterback out of East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Like O'Donnell and Foley, neither of them knows what's going to
happen this season. But Lucas and Clements have a lower profile.
They hang out together, scratch their heads during meetings and
avoid controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie camp was Lucas' first foray on the field after an
off-season of intensive meetings and drills.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are attempting to make a professional quarterback out
of him. Thus, coach Bill Parcells patted him on the back after he
drilled a completion into the hands of a wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the quarterback coach, Dan Henning, used the word
``amazing'' after another Lucas completion.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have a starting quarterback. But no one knows who he is
_ the up-and-coming but injury-plagued Foley, or the experienced
O'Donnell, whose refusal to take a pay cut has left his status
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets also have another quarterback in camp _ Scott Frost,
who directed the nation's top-rated offense while leading Nebraska
to a share of the national title. Frost is trying to make the team
as a safety.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas is no rookie. He is going into his third season after an
outstanding career at Rutgers. But after starring as a demon
special-teamer on the Jets last year as well as a third-down option
specialist, he wants to throw the ball. So far in his pro career,
he has thrown five passes.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas is still trying to master the system, though, and
acknowledges that in meetings with O'Donnell, Foley and Clements,
he often wonders what Henning is talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think I'm in another world,'' Lucas said. ``They
ask me, `Do you understand?' and I say, `No, but when I go
downstairs to the locker room I'll ask someone and find out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Henning, who tutored Joe Namath and Richard Todd more than two
decades ago on the Jets, changed Lucas' mechanics in the
off-season. He told him to take shorter strides and to make
decisions more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know how this whole thing will be played out,''
Lucas said, ``but I'm still hoping Coach Parcells will use me on
third down.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to remain on special teams, even though he has put
on 15 pounds to be able to take a quarterback's pounding and has
switched uniform numbers, from 18 to 6.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas did not throw a National Football League pass until the
Jets' regular-season finale at Detroit. He he came in for O'Donnell
against the Lions and connected on a third-and-1 play.
</P>
<P>
   He helped lead the Jets to a field goal, then came in later with
the Jets leading by 10-6, brought them to the goal line, but threw
an interception. The Jets went on to lose in a game that cost them
a playoff appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Lucas met Henning, they discussed that
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to think about it,'' Henning told him, ``don't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas understands that when the veterans are back for the start
of summer camp, his time will be limited. If both Foley and
O'Donnell are there, then there will be a quarterback shootout, and
that means precious few snaps for the No. 3 man.
</P>
<P>
   Or precious few snaps for Clements, for that matter. Clements,
who was a rookie with the Jets last season, tossed more than 50
touchdowns in his last two seasons at Huntsville High in Texas,
where his father coached him. He was also a big star at the
University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But his NFL experience consists of five plays in last season's
opening rout of Seattle. Clements handed off three times and knelt
down twice. ``To this point in my life, it's still the greatest
thrill of my career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two young quarterbacks. One remembering the first game of the
season, another trying to forget the last. Neither knows when he
will throw his next pass.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Fathers and sons have appeared across the racing
stage over the years with mixed results and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   B.A. and Jimmy Jones won the Kentucky Derby eight times for
Calumet Farm, and swept the Triple Crown twice. Max and Buddy
Hirsch were a team until Buddy left for Chicago with a short string
of horses and this advice from his father: ``If you run out of
money, sell one of the horses.'' And trainer Syl Veitch was the
father of John Veitch, the trainer of Alydar, who ran second to
Affirmed in all three races in the Triple Crown, 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 130th Belmont Stakes has produced Allen Jerkens and his
son Jimmy, once bonded in the family racing stable, now neighbors
in adjoining barns at Belmont Park and, for the first time, rivals
in the Belmont Stakes. Allen, 69, the master of the upset in racing
lore, is the trainer of Limit Out, and Jimmy, one of his four
children, trim and serious at 39, is the trainer of Thomas Jo.
</P>
<P>
   The family's racing interests have been housed in Barn 30
(father) and Barn 31 (son), although Jimmy keeps six of his horses
in Allen's barn across the driveway and is just as familiar there
now as he was during the 20 years he served as an assistant to his
famous father. He considered the age-old question of the father who
casts a long shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that Dad had the reputation of a giant-killer in
racing,'' Jimmy said. ``But the fact that he was our father was
enough. That already made him the greatest, not his reputation in
racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Jerkens, a man of few words, was the youngest trainer ever
elected to the Hall of Fame in 1975 when he was 45. He has now been
a horse trainer for 48 years, he has won 3,200 races, including 200
stakes, and four times he was the leading trainer in New York. He
trained such stars as Beau Purple, Devil His Due, Missy's Mirage
and the great filly Sky Beauty.
</P>
<P>
   But his legend grew with each upset he scored over some of the
giants of racing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Beau Purple outran Carry Back in the Suburban Handicap,
the year after Carry Back won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. In
1967, his Handsome Boy upset Buckpasser in the Brooklyn Handicap.
In 1973, reaching a peak of unlikely success, his colt Onion outran
the mighty Secretariat in the Whitney at Saratoga when Secretariat
was the 1-10 favorite. A month later or so later, Jerkens did it
again: His horse Prove Out rallied to defeat Secretariat by four
and a half lengths.
</P>
<P>
   He also saddled horses who outran Forego, Riva Ridge and Cicada
and three times outran Kelso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's probably overdone,'' Jerkens said. ``It doesn't
really matter, but it gets a little annoying.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Jerkens was born in Islip and remembers how the family got
involved in horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was in the riding-stable business,'' he said. ``He
also liked to patch up broken-down racehorses, and have someone
bring them back for racing for him. I wanted to be a jockey at
first, but realized I was too large for that. So, I became a
steeplechase rider for a short time when I was 17. And I took out
my trainer's license in 1950, and here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   He is regarded not only as a giant-killer in racing circles but
also as a strong, silent type who usually goes straight from
paddock to railing to watch his horses run. He avoids sitting with
the horse's owner, preferring to endure his race-time agony in
private, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Jerkens, who went out on his own as a trainer last fall,
has not lost any of his fealty to his father. They talk about
horses and races, just as they always did, but they also keep a
discreet distance when running their horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran against each other twice before the Belmont,'' Jimmy
said. ``Allen won both races. I ran second once and out of the
money the other time.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled, and said with the resigned but proud air of the son
of a celebrated father, ``But he had the favorites both times.''

only wrestled with tubes in her daughter's chest and with pumps for
food or antibiotics, she has also learned to spot infection before
doctors do. Ms. Cunningham feels that she has received inadequate
training, and is exhausted from her ``medical duties.'' ``It's very

tube implanted in his stomach, after suffering a stroke. Dealing
with the machine has been overwhelming for Mrs. Kaufman. ``In my
time, I've never learned anything about computers. And all these
buttons! I'm scared of it,'' she says. Still, because of the
advantages patients have at home -- familiar surroundings and away
from the risk of infection in hospitals -- many cases of caregiving
prove more joyous than painful, even if families are providing care
in a way that would have been unheard-of only a few years ago.

VALENTINE SEETHES AS PIAZZA MUST SIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mike Piazza spoke too optimistically about possibly
pinch-hitting Saturday. His swollen left hand prevented him from
even swinging a bat, while Mets manager Bobby Valentine spoke
rather angrily about Boston's Pedro Martinez for injuring Piazza
with an inside fastball on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who wore a gauze wrap around his hand, tossed a ball
Saturday and insisted that the swelling had diminished and that he
simply wanted to take the day off to be safe. But the catcher's
prognosis did not stop Valentine from wondering aloud if Martinez's
2-2 pitch with first base open in the first inning had a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like it,'' Valentine said. ``Whatever it was, I
didn't like it because of the way the pitch wound up. He's not
playing today.''
</P>
<P>
   When Valentine was asked if he did not like it simply because
Piazza was injured or because he thought Martinez intended to drill
Piazza, the manager said: ``I don't like it for all of the above
reasons. There's nothing about the situation I like. He has pretty
good control most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who is notorious for buzzing hitters with inside
pitches, said, ``The ball just ran up and in on me.'' Boston
catcher Jim Leyritz added that Martinez ``absolutely was not
throwing at Piazza,'' and that he threw a tailing fastball inside
because Piazza had looked so bad on a previous high-and-tight
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a whiner, I'm not a complainer,'' said Piazza, who
intimated strongly on Friday that Martinez had aimed at him. ``It's
part of the game. Unfortunately, it happens. Fortunately, it's not
broken and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine was still seething, enough to vehemently disagree
when a reporter repeated Martinez's assertion that Piazza was
diving into the pitch and enough to gloat about the Mets' 9-2
victory, which included four homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four home runs is a pretty good way of answering that
nonsense,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza planned to continue receiving ice treatment on his hand
Saturday and before Sunday night's game against the Red Sox, but it
seemed improbable that he would play before Monday against Tampa
Bay at Shea Stadium, if then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little tender,'' Piazza said. ``When you get in a game,
adrenaline starts to flow. I'll take an extra day to make sure.'' &QL;

 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ In an effort to head off a potential boycott of
the world championships in Athens this summer, USA Basketball has
sent letters to team members threatening legal action if the
players fail to honor their signed contracts with the organization,
according to two agents representing players on the team.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after commissioner David Stern of the National
Basketball Association questioned the patriotism of players who
might bow to pressure from the National Basketball Players
Association to not play in the games, which run from July 29
through Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The union president, Patrick Ewing, has quietly been encouraging
members of the team, including Knicks teammate Allan Houston, to
not represent the NBA until the league's labor problems are solved.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan chimed in with his support last Thursday, stating
that the player boycott would serve as a counter to a potential
lockout by the owners on July 1 _ the day after the current
collective bargaining agreement between both sides expires.
</P>
<P>
   Whether USA Basketball will file separate suits charging breach
of contract against the players is unclear. But the action is the
latest indication that players and owners have a long summer ahead,
and that a lockout is almost certain.
</P>
<P>
   The key issue is the owner's request for a hard salary cap, a
proposal that would ultimately put a ceiling on how much a team can
pay its players in a given season.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. Confidential
</P>
<P>
   The league's best running soap opera is still ``As the Bulls
Turn.'' But the Los Angeles Lakers are beginning to make a ratings
push.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West, whose front-office wizardry has been responsible for
the franchise's success over the last two decades, is still miffed
at owner Jerry Buss' failure to reward his loyalty and commitment
with dollars. The two are expected to meet Monday to discuss West's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no health issues involved _ it's basically about
money owed to Jerry,'' a Lakers team official said.
</P>
<P>
   West was promised a bonus of several million dollars by Buss
after signing Shaquille O'Neal in 1996. Rather than pay West a lump
sum, the Lakers owner has doled out the money over time. West, the
team official said, feels it is a matter of principle that he be
paid the balance in full before he can decide to stay in his job.
</P>
<P>
   West has also requested a long-term annuity after he retires and
was said to be upset about the owner pulling the plug on a
potential deal for Mitch Richmond at the beginning of the current
season. The Lakers were prepared to send Eddie Jones to Sacramento,
but reneged at the last minute because Buss was apparently worried
about compensating Richmond after his current deal expires.
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue in Monday's meeting is whether Del Harris will
indeed return as the team's coach. Another team official termed
Harris' chances at ``50-50'' after the Lakers were swept by Utah in
the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal able to exercise an out clause in his contract and
Kobe Bryant's current deal eligible for an extension, there is
plenty of uncertainty in the air. In fact, there is but one
clear-cut plan for the Lakers at the moment: trading the
disenchanted point guard Nick Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1? Probably Bibby
</P>
<P>
   Some teams are worried about his size and others are worried
about his durability. Still, Mike Bibby is beginning to emerge as
the player the Los Angeles Clippers will take with the No. 1 pick
in the draft on June 24 in Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The unpolished, 6-foot-2-inch, 180-pound Arizona point guard
will most likely go ahead of Michael Olowokandi, the 7-foot,
265-pound project from the University of the Pacific; Kansas
forward Paul Pierce, and North Carolina's Antawn Jamison.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, meanwhile, is flirting with trading its No. 2 pick
and has even had discussions with Toronto, an Eastern Conference
team official said. But the Grizzlies are leery. Even though they
play in different conferences, their Canadian rivalry would make
the move akin to the Knicks and Heat swapping players.
</P>
<P>
   How weak is this year's crop of talent? Denver Nuggets general
manager Dan Issel recently brought Olowokandi in for a workout.
Without any players around to gauge his talent, Issel suited up and
played defense against the nation's premier big man.
</P>
<P>
   He blocked Olowokandi's first two shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards Get Blunt
</P>
<P>
   Give Wes Unseld credit. Unlike many of his spin-doctor
colleagues, he is honest.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Wizards general manager recently sent a letter to
season ticket-holders, informing them that last season's dismal
performance would not be tolerated again.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed his dismay about the team's off-court problems and
said any future incidents would be punished by ``the most extreme
measures possible'' under the league's collective bargaining
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards, one of the league's most talent-laden teams,
narrowly missed the playoffs last season. They were not only
hamstrung by on-court problems, but also were undermined by mayhem
off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to clean up our approach,'' coach Bernie Bickerstaff
told The Washington Post. ``We've got to clean up our loyalty to
the fans, the organization and the game.'' &QL;

SELES WINS OPPONENT'S SYMPATHY, NOT THE TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Monica Seles, who somehow willed her way into the French
Open final a few short weeks after losing her father to cancer, had
sympathy and tragedy on her side of the net. If anyone deserved a
happy ending to two draining weeks on this soggy red clay, it was
Seles.
</P>
<P>
   A three-time champion here, she made an inspired bid for a 10th
career Grand Slam singles crown at the very event that launched her
back in 1990. When she won then, she was a giggling 16-year-old
juggernaut who seemed not to have a care in the world beyond
drilling tennis balls at and past her every foe.
</P>
<P>
   But because the adversary across the net Saturday was the
two-time champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the same indefatigable
Spaniard whom Seles defeated here in the 1991 finale and thrashed
again in the 1993 U.S. Open, Seles failed to gain the full measure
of spiritual and emotional redemption she sought.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario _ who hadn't won a Grand Slam title in four
years and had her own redemptive issues roiling in the back of her
mind as she headed into this poignant finale _ refused to
relinquish her personal designs on the 1998 French Open
championship in order to spare Seles further heartache. Instead,
Sanchez Vicario carried off a masterly 7-6 (7-5), 0-6, 6-2 victory
first and apologized for it later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so sorry that I beat you,'' Sanchez Vicario told Seles,
and the rain-splattered crowd, as she gave her acceptance speech.
``I have a lot of respect for you and what you did here to get to
the final,'' said Sanchez Vicario, who complimented Seles for
showing such ``professionality'' so soon after the death of her
father, Karolj.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario also declared that regardless of the invasion of
women's tennis by the parcel of teen-agers, the French Open
campaigns of Seles and herself stood as living proof that ``we have
a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Seles, she added, ``She also is a great champion, and I think
this is better for women's tennis, because it shows we're still in
there.'
</P>
<P>
   What the 26-year-old Sanchez Vicario did Saturday was play a
vintage brand of tennis. She scurried and scampered and, in her own
special way, went for the jugular just as she had when she won her
first Grand Slam title here in 1989 at 17. She did so again at
Roland Garros in 1994, when she regained her form and ended a
five-year Grand Slam drought.
</P>
<P>
   She chugged to and fro on the red grit like a little locomotive
content to take the most indirect of routes to her destination. She
sent defensive topspin lobs into the gloomy sky like clay pigeons
at a skeet shoot, then patiently waited for her impatient opponent
to try to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted but successful after the 51-minute first set was
decided with a tie breaker, Sanchez Vicario bided her time in the
second, let Seles expend ample energy in the act of leveling the
contest, then cleverly revved up into full retrieval-and-rebuttal
mode when the match was on the line in the final set.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Seles made 48 unforced errors and made Sanchez Vicario
pay for just five of the 14 break opportunities she allowed. ``I
made so many errors against Arantxa that you just can't make,''
Seles said, ``and she played really well whenever she was down,
just hit some great shots, and when I was up, I did just the
opposite.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``In the first set, I ran out of gas there, and Arantxa is such
a great player, she just ran down everything,'' said Seles, who
undermined herself by choosing all the wrong shots as she served
for the opening set at 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Seles chastised herself for stubbornly attempting ``stupid drop
shots'' with the humidity-laden balls. Then, by slamming an
elementary overhead into the net at 30-30, she took herself to
break point instead of set point. Although Sanchez Vicario failed
to convert that one, a couple of forehand errors from Seles set up
and then converted the Spaniard's second break point for her.
</P>
<P>
   In the tie breaker, a cascade of puffballs from Sanchez Vicario
goaded Seles into swinging backhand volley errors on the fourth and
fifth points, giving the Spaniard a 4-1 lead. Though Seles crept
back to knot the tie breaker, 5-5, a netted forehand return
followed by another netted forehand after a lengthy rally at set
point gave the set to Sanchez Vicario.
</P>
<P>
   Not much more than a bystander in the middle set, Sanchez
Vicario resurfaced with a vengeance, and a plan, in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew in my mind that the third set was going to be a
different story,'' she said. ``It was important to start really
well, concentrate a little more, play a little more deep, stay into
the match and be able to be ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the key, to start a little better in the third set,
to hang in there,'' said Sanchez Vicario, who has built an entire
career doing precisely that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of crumbling when she faced two break points in the
first game, the Spaniard staved them off and broke Seles for a 2-0
lead that she improved to 3-0 by saving another break point in the
third game. Down 15-40 in the fifth game, Sanchez Vicario again
bounced back, a recovery that demoralized Seles.
</P>
<P>
   In deep trouble at 2-5, Seles didn't save herself: More
defensive lobbing from Sanchez Vicario produced another netted
overhead, a mistake that was followed at break and match point by
yet another swinging backhand volley that missed its mark.
</P>
<P>
   Though it takes more than a tennis match to make Seles cry these
days, she made it clear she wasn't delighted about working her way
into the final round only to lose there. ``I'm happy that I got
this far and everything, but every time I lose, I'm disappointed,''
she said. ``In the finals or in the first round, it's equally hard
to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario was not unmindful of the fact that the
sympathies of the crowd were clearly in Seles' corner. ``It's
happened to me here before,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone deserved a sympathy vote, it was Seles. She had
lost her chance to win a fourth consecutive French Open title in
1993 because she was stabbed in Germany three weeks before the
Paris tournament began, played last year's Open with one eye on the
ball and the other on her terminally ill father, and competed this
year despite losing her parent and coach to cancer on May 14.
</P>
<P>
   Seles just didn't receive Sanchez Vicario's sympathy vote, at
least not for the duration of the 1-hour-53-minute match. ``But if
I lose, I lose with somebody who deserves to win,'' the Spaniard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, her victory guaranteed Spain a repeat of the triumph it
enjoyed here in 1994, a sweep of the singles titles. With Carlos
Moya and Alex Corretja squaring off in the men's final on Sunday, a
Spanish champion is assured. ``Obviously I would like them both to
win,'' said Sanchez Vicario, gracious to the end.

ANALYIS: GIULIANI'S FOSTER CARE PLAN FACES POLITICAL MINEFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City treats its foster care system like a
slot machine, a child welfare commissioner complained in the
mid-1970s: it pours in money and hopes for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, would-be reformers inside and outside city
government have tried to turn the hundreds of millions of dollars
the city spends yearly on foster care contracts into a force for
controlled improvement, rather than a gamble with the lives of
abused and neglected children.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to refocus the system along community district lines and
put the pieces up for bid, announced by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani last
week, is the most sweeping effort in almost 20 years to change the
way the city does business with the private, nonprofit agencies
that care for most children in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the plan seems to concern uncomplicated shifts
in social work philosophy _ delivering services to children in
their neighborhoods rather than dispersing them throughout the
region. But underneath, it presents a minefield of power politics
and patronage in a city where racial, religious and ethnic
interests have historically clashed over children as they battled
for a bigger share of public money and social clout.
</P>
<P>
   Foster care has long been a key source of both. Last year 23 of
the 50 biggest city contractors were foster care agencies, and 10
of them alone handled about half the city's $614 million foster
care budget, according to an analysis by Child Welfare Watch, an
independent publication. Most of the 10 are at least 100 years old
and have well-established influence at City Hall through their ties
to the city's major religious leadership and through trustees and
boards drawn from the city's business establishment. Newer,
smaller, agencies include minority-run programs started through
state grants in the 1980s and nurtured under the Dinkins
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The last overhaul comparable to the one detailed Wednesday by
Nicholas Scoppetta, commissioner of the Administration for
Children's Services, was acclaimed in 1979 as a revolution. But
after a promising start, it was derailed by the pressures of city
politics, economic downturns and roller-coaster shifts in the
city's foster care population. Regardless of the value of
neighborhood-based services, how much difference the new plan makes
will ultimately depend on whether Scoppetta can safely steer it
through such pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Politics will inevitably be part of the scramble for the $614
million pot the plan opens to redivision. The change presents the
possibility of new jobs and public money in neighborhoods riven by
ethnic rivalries, and the expansion or contraction of institutions
with major campaign contributors on their boards.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's unveiling of a system redesign came six weeks before
the scheduled start of trial in Marisol vs. Giuliani, a
class-action lawsuit brought late in 1995 by Children's Rights
Inc., a national nonprofit children's advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit aims at all aspects of the city child
welfare system, from child-abuse investigations through foster
care, and asks that a receiver be given full authority to
restructure the city's Administration for Children's Services on
behalf of more than 100,000 children. The city's position has been
that Scoppetta's changes make this lawsuit and other pending
litigation against the agency a dead letter if not a hindrance.
</P>
<P>
   Scoppetta's plan envisions a neighborhood-based child welfare
system reminiscent of the old settlement house model. It is based
on a longstanding social work consensus, honored far more in the
breach than the observance, that children should be placed close to
home. Under the plan, contractors are to be held responsible for
serving children and families in one community, supporting them
with a range of linked services, including health care, counseling
and drug treatment as well as foster care. Agencies that fail to
improve outcomes for children would risk losing their city
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But veterans of the city's foster care wars, while admiring the
ambition of Scoppetta's effort, have not forgotten lessons from the
past.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the Board of Estimate, then the powerful budgetary arm
of New York City government, outlawed the automatic contract
renewals and rate increases that had become common for foster care
agencies and adopted measurable performance standards. One of the
standards detailed in the resulting program assessment system was
children's placement in their home borough. That was a less
ambitious geographical requirement than the one in Scoppetta's
plan, yet the city abandoned it in 1985 as soon as foster beds fell
short of need. Today only 6 percent of the 42,000 children in
foster care reside in their own community district, though nearly
every district has enough foster families to accommodate the foster
children it originates.
</P>
<P>
   Many other requirements detailed in contracts fell by the
wayside in the late 1980s as the balance of power between the
agencies and the city shifted with the rising number of children
pouring into care. Fueled by deepening poverty, homelessness, AIDS
and crack, the foster care population rose from a low of 17,000 in
1985 to almost 50,000 in 1991. That year, the assessment system was
eliminated in budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment the numbers exploded, the message to the city was,
you can be assessing people until you're blue in the face _ who
cares when you're using every bed they have?'' Steven Cohen, who
oversaw the city's contract relations with the agencies until 1985,
once explained. ``You can't regulate anything when the suppliers
control the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic show of contractor clout came over church
precepts. When Cardinal John O'Connor publicly threatened to end
his archdiocese's role in the foster care system, the city chose
not to enforce a contract requirement that teen-agers have access
to family planning.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor then, Ed Koch, quickly repudiated the court-ordered
consent decree that mandated such services, though it had been
negotiated by his own corporation counsel. Potentially at stake
were not only a quarter of the city's foster care beds, but Roman
Catholic votes in a difficult election year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Scoppetta was impatient with
references to past failures. ``I don't know that there's ever been
a concerted effort to do it the way we're doing it,'' he said.
``Agencies were not really held accountable. Isn't it time to
change that?''
</P>
<P>
   But children's advocates are concerned about the city's own
accountability. For more than a decade the city has been under
judicial order to promptly evaluate children who come into city
custody and to place them in the best program available for their
needs. Last year no more than 6 percent of children placed had
timely initial evaluations, according to city data. Hit-or-miss
telephone brokerage has remained the city's dominant method of
placing children, in part because it still lacks the computer
capacity to find vacancies accurately.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1996, for example, Spanish-speaking children from
Sunset Park in Brooklyn were assigned by the city to foster
families in Harlem who spoke no Spanish, despite vacancies in their
own neighborhood linked to the Center for Family Life, a national
model of the kind of community services network that Scoppetta is
trying to create citywide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I credit them for their aspirations,'' said Marcia Robinson
Lowry, director of Children's Rights Inc. ``What is dangerous here
is if they want to declare victory and go home.''

COMMENTARY: A MONUMENT TO THE BAY ROILS WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHOLD, N.Y. _ No one has claimed the heron isn't big. Why,
big is too small a word for it. The heron is breathtakingly
colossal: 40 feet tall, two tons of twisted steel, with a beak that
seems to reach the sky. Standing on a groin extending from Jim and
Barbara Miller's waterfront back yard, it can be seen from Cedar
Beach, about a half-mile away, and, as the neighbors tell it, from
just about everywhere else, clear across Shelter Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a former commercial fisherman who runs a company that
cleans up oil spills and other sea calamities, calls the heron a
monument to Peconic Bay, whose waters have allowed him to ply a
decent trade, raise six children and buy a big, lovely house on
three acres.
</P>
<P>
   But neighbors say the bird is an eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   They want it gone. They've written to the Army Corps of
Engineers, the state Department of Environmental Conservation and
the town. ``I must now worry about the increased boat traffic that
will be attracted to view such a large object,'' complained Ann
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   And Robert Scott worried about what could come next. ``Art and
its appreciation is personal in nature,'' he said. ``Where would
such a precedent lead us?'' Others on this remote edge of Long
Island's North Fork fretted that the bird might blow away in a
storm, wrecking their houses and endangering life and limb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonsense!'' said Miller, as he showed off the heron on his
shell-strewn, pebbly beach the other day. ``This bird hasn't
attracted hordes of boats. It's not the only large piece of art in
town and it's bolted to withstand hundred-mile-an-hour winds.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But the town building inspector has jumped into the fray.
And now the Great Heron is the subject of a great debate: When is a
sculpture ``a structure''?
</P>
<P>
   The Millers, who were slapped with a summons for a building-code
violation, say never. At least not in this case. ``We got the
necessary approvals from the town trustees and the DEC,'' Miller
said. ``People wrote letters, so the town said we got to do
something. So they did something.''
</P>
<P>
   This has made arts organizations, like the National Campaign for
Freedom of Expression in Washington and the East End Arts Council
here, pretty edgy. Their concern is that if the Millers have to
remove the heron, it would set a national precedent. Any group of
people who didn't like a public display of art could try to have it
removed, starting an onerous fight for its owner.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller takes the issue in stride. ``I'm a pretty positive
kind of a guy,'' he said, ``so I don't think of things like
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Millers are due in court later this month. But their lawyer,
Harvey Arnoff, said he was considering an application to stay the
enforcement of the zoning code. ``The town has no code for art,''
he said. ``And if they want to apply the strict definition of the
building code to this, then the statues in front of the various
churches are illegal, as are birdbaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, the heron has attracted a lot more attention
than it would have if no one had complained. The Millers'
neighborhood is very private. Houses are announced with great stone
pillars and long, shaded driveways. Shrubs are meticulously coifed,
but the houses always look as if no one is home.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its size, the heron is too far from the beaten track,
from the trendy Hamptons _ on a beach where only the people who
live here play _ to have garnered much notice if people from far
and wide hadn't heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some people actually like the bird. Last weekend,
dozens were among the 80 who joined the Millers and the heron's
creator, Roberto Julio Bessin of Centerport, at a ceremony
dedicating it to Peconic Bay. (Bessin made it in 1988 and displayed
it in his yard for three years without a snag.)
</P>
<P>
   Just as the ceremony was starting, thunder and lightning cracked
the sky, which everyone thought was quite appropriate.

RETARDED ADULTS LIVING IN HOMELESS SHELTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ The homeless shelter at the Westchester County
Airport here is tidier than many of its New York City cousins, but
experts still would not consider it the most congenial place for a
mentally retarded person to live.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, 26 mentally retarded adults are living in this and other
county shelters because of a statewide shortage of beds in group
homes or in supervised apartments, county officials disclosed last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the retarded adults, officials said, wound up in the
county's shelters after living with aged or frail parents who could
no longer care for them. Others were unhappy with their group homes
and wandered off; still others wore out their welcome with
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure that retarded adults are living among a homeless
population that includes drug and alcohol addicts and ex-convicts
embarrassed county officials and local state legislators and caused
some to wonder whether the situation in Westchester suggested a
statewide problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are 25 here, then there are 250 in New York City,''
said Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, D-Greenburgh. ``What sort of
society takes mentally retarded people and forces them in homeless
shelters?''
</P>
<P>
   But Deborah Sturm Rausch, a spokeswoman for the state Office of
Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, said state
officials had surveyed other counties and concluded that the
situation in Westchester was an isolated one.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Wiviott, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of
Homeless Services, said she was sure there were some mentally
retarded people whose condition had been misdiagnosed and as a
result were placed in a shelter system that cares for 7,000 single
adults a night. But department workers, she said, did not encounter
enough such cases to consider the homeless retarded a major
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky and some county officials attributed the shortage of
beds to Gov. George Pataki's decision to halt spending for new
group homes for several years, ending last year. Roughly 6,500
people in the state, including 100 in Westchester, are on waiting
lists seeking placement. Although the governor has authorized some
1,500 new slots, such homes often face stiff neighborhood
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of mentally retarded people in shelters came to light
on Tuesday night at the annual dinner of the Westchester
Association for Retarded Citizens. Morton Steinberg, a founder of
GROW, an advocacy group for the retarded, said he learned in
February that a handful of retarded people were homeless, but in
discussions before and during the dinner it emerged that the actual
number was 26.
</P>
<P>
   The large number of homeless retarded crystallized a problem
that distresses many elderly parents of the retarded. These parents
are desperate to place their retarded children in community
residences, fearing that the children will otherwise end up
homeless when the parents die.
</P>
<P>
   Mildred Rigano of New Rochelle is 78 and her husband, Philip, is
80. Their son, Robert, is mildly retarded _ he can sign his name
but cannot read very much _ and has been living with them all his
life. For 12 years they have been unable to find a slot for him in
a community residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned if something happens to us, what will happen
to him,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Steven Friedman, the county's community mental health
commissioner, said that retarded people, especially the high
functioning ones that have ended up in the homeless shelters,
needed work experiences and literacy programs and that it was
difficult to provide such rehabilitation in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in 1995 the county was able to place 80 to 100
people a year in group residences; but given the state shortage of
beds since then, it had been able to place only 30 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky announced Friday that he was asking for $275,000 to
provide rent subsidies and counseling for the 26 adults in the
shelters. He called the emergence of homeless retarded ``a
breakdown in the bureaucracy'' and a lapse of ``a moral compass.''
</P>
<P>
   There was bipartisan dismay over the problem, with both
Democrats and Republicans accepting responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad commentary that people with disabilities are being
dumped in homeless shelters,'' said State Sen. Nicholas Spano,
R-Yonkers, who for many years led the Senate committee on mental
health. ``Everybody should recognize that we are all to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, announced legislation that would give state officials
no more than 30 days to place a retarded person without a home in a
community residence.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office did not return phone calls seeking a
response. But Spano said that Pataki last year provided for the
creation of 600 new residential slots and that the state
Legislature added another 57. In this fiscal year, Pataki has
included money for 867 new slots.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental
Disabilities sent a team to Westchester on Thursday to assess the
26 retarded people in shelters and recommend placements for them.
</P>
<P>
   At the homeless shelter here, set among hangars, airport runways
and fuel trucks, some of the regular residents did not think it was
the best place for retarded adults. ``It's more like a jail setting
here,'' said Abdullah Abraham, who has lived at the shelter for a
year. ``Mentally retarded people have more needs than homeless.''

FIREFIGHTER WHO LOST HIS LIFE PUT SAFETY FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His profile fits that of most other good guys who die
heroically, on the job, saving other people's lives. Fire Lt. James
Blackmore, 48, was a quiet, unassuming man who spent a lot of time
with his family and liked to golf.
</P>
<P>
   He had a wife, four children, a house and, years ago, a boat. He
lived a good, simple life and had a job he loved. He was a Vietnam
veteran who never talked about his combat experiences, a careful
man who spent many hours reading safety manuals and was precise in
conducting fire drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no short cuts with him,'' said Lt. Kevin McGoldric
of Engine Co. 332 in Brooklyn, where Blackmore was assigned.
``Safety, above all, was his primary consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmore died Friday night battling a five-alarm fire that
consumed a city-owned three-story apartment building in Brooklyn.
He and five other firefighters fell through the second floor, which
snapped after it was weakened by flames.
</P>
<P>
   As his fellow firefighters at Engine Co. 332 and Ladder Co. 175
awaited a delivery of the black bunting that would drape the
Brooklyn fire house where he was assigned, they remembered
Blackmore as a man who was too young and too good to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone loved him,'' said Capt. Gerard Donbrowsky, commander
of Ladder Co. 175. ``He was an all-around great guy. We are all in
mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackmore's wife, Susan, said from their home in Farmingdale,
N.Y., that he was born in Ozone Park, Queens, the son of Elizabeth
and Robert Blackmore, who now live in Florida. He was the second
born of seven brothers and sisters and the only career firefighter
in the family, although his father was once a volunteer
firefighter. He went to several colleges but never finished his
degree in education, and he served in Vietnam from 1967 to 1971,
Mrs. Blackmore said. He became a firefighter 21 years ago and had
been cited for bravery five times, his fellow firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was not battling fires, Blackmore was playing with his
children in his back yard, his family and neighbors said. He had
three girls _ Sara, 13, Jackie, 11, and Claire, 9 _ and a boy,
Brian, 7. Because he had a firefighter's schedule, he was home
three days a week and had plenty of time to work around the house
and chat with neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always outside, taking care of the house or playing
ball with the children or, in the winter, fooling around in the
snow,'' said Michael Neglia, a neighbor who lives across the
street. ``He was a good, friendly guy. You couldn't say anything
bad about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before he died, Blackmore had been talking to other
firefighters about the computer he had just bought for his
children. Mrs. Blackmore, a nurse, said he had also been talking
about returning to school to finish his degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved everything, and I loved him very much,'' Mrs.
Blackmore, 41, said. ``But there was nothing he liked more than
going to a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   McGoldric said he would always remember Blackmore as he last saw
him: sitting on a white plastic chair, smiling and surrounded by
firefighters who were posing for the annual picture of the ladder
company. That was Wednesday, two days before Blackmore battled his
last fire.

TV SPORTS: DISNEY COMMITTING TO COMPLETE SOCCER COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Program times are for New York area.)  
(lb) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This World Cup thing matters at Walt Disney's ABC, ESPN and
ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest deal on earth,'' said Bob Ley, the event's
lead play-by-play announcer, soccer dad and rabid fan since the
1970s. ``We all remember how we felt as Americans in 1980 when the
U.S. hockey team defeated the Soviet Union. Every nation can
attempt to feel that way during the World Cup. Translate it in
those terms _ love of country and love for a beautiful game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only will each of the 64 games be carried live from France.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will each game be preceded by a half hour pregame show.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will ESPN2 carry a nightly recap show at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   And not only will ESPN2 replay the day's top match most nights
at 8.
</P>
<P>
   But also, ABC will pre-empt ``General Hospital'' on June 15 for
the U.S.-Germany game and on June 25 for the U.S.-Yugoslavia
contest. (``GH'' fans will be able to see their soap in prime time
on those nights.) In New York, Channel 7 will pre-empt ``Oprah''
and the early news for the 2:30-6 p.m. broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's a Disney-wide commitment.
</P>
<P>
   For the $22 million being paid for the World Cup rights, ABC
will televise 14 matches, ESPN 27 and ESPN2 23. All three of the
U.S. team's first-round games will receive maximum exposure on ABC.
In 1994, the three American games averaged a 7.0 Nielsen rating,
above ABC's overall 5.3 average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American games are important,'' said Ley, who became a
soccer enthusiast when he attended Bloomfield High School in New
Jersey during the North American Soccer League's heyday. ``Even in
the rosiest scenario _ the U.S. gets to the third round _ there are
still 59 games without the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Americans will be interested in games that don't
involve the U.S. team, Ley said: ``We have great stories to tell.
We'll reel people in with them. These players aren't going to be 11
shirts, but good guys and bad guys. I'd like to think Americans can
think outside their borders.''
</P>
<P>
   He fondly recalled the biggest surprise of the 1994 World Cup.
``Who would have thought we'd fall in love with a bunch of swarthy
Bulgarians?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, I'd forgotten that.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC-ESPN-ESPN2 format improves upon the 1994 setup, when the
event was played in the United States. Back then, there were more
than a dozen tape-delayed games. Also, there were no pregame shows,
just five minute lead-ins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest failure was to cover as many matches as possible
in two hours with only five minutes before each game, and no other
ancillary programs,'' said David Downs, the senior vice president
of ABC for network operations.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1994, all commercials will be crammed into pregame and
halftime, allowing each 45-minute half to be shown uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The production comes mainly from French cameras and tape
machines, and the Disney networks will augment some matches with
equipment of their own. But Geoff Mason, the executive producer for
ABC and ESPN, cautioned that the coverage will be respectful, not
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no glowing ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing we can do is allow the flow of play to dictate
what our coverage style is,'' Mason said. ``If we are disciplined
enough to stay out of the way of this event, it'll work. We won't
be boring. Football is about pace and flow. The coverage the French
have put together, and our announcers, will allow us to reflect
that flow and pace. That's the best approach we can take.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mason said the telecasts' main innovation will be used during
the pregame and halftime shows: a computer-generated ``virtual
replay'' system that uses video from stadium cameras to show
various plays from numerous angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, no exploding graphics, no bells and whistles,'' he
said. ``I know it's not politically correct to say that, but this
game is damned interesting. We want to show it in the most
interesting way.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the productions are too laid back, ABC, ESPN and ESPN2
risk boring casual and new viewers of soccer. There should be some
daring _ not enough so that cutting to close-ups means missing
action that is better viewed from a standard high angle, but enough
to excite rookie and veteran fans.
</P>
<P>
   The announcers _ in addition to the Ley-Seamus Malin team, the
voices include J.P. Dellacamera and Bill McErmott, and Roger
Twibell and Mike Hill _ need to bring enthusiasm. It need not be as
over the top as Univision's Andres Cantor, but they should realize
that Cantor's style is so seductive that he is worth listening to
even if you don't know Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, they must resist using too much inside soccer talk while
explaining simply the rules, plays, offenses and defenses. The
model, as usual, for deftly explaining a fast-moving sport amid
heavy action is hockey's Mike Emrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to getting people to understand the game is not to
force principles on them, but to allow the flow of play to dictate
the points that will help educate,'' Malin said. ``I don't think
you can inject artificially facts or opinions or explanations where
the game isn't throwing them open for discussion. If you do that
and you have 64 telecasts, you can cover the basics of the game
without being a boring drill instructor.''

CONE HEARS BARKING, BUT IT'S ONLY A JOKE
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The instant David Cone was bitten on the right index finger last
week by Veronica, his mother's Jack Russell terrier puppy, Cone
knew he would be the object of jokes from teammates. David Wells,
one of Cone's fellow starting pitchers, barks and growls and howls
every time reporters gather to ask Cone about his finger.
</P>
<P>
   The teasing is coming from all over now, however. On Friday,
Cone went to speak at a school in Harlem, P.S. 117.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 9-year-olds asking me about dog bites,'' Cone said with
a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Cone says the cut is drying up, and he will most likely start
Sunday's game against Florida, two days earlier than expected.
Because David Wells is bothered by a sore shoulder, Cone will take
his place, and then Orlando Hernandez will probably start on
Tuesday in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Ramiro Mendoza will remain in the rotation.
Mendoza has pitched well over all, but his outings in the next few
weeks may be extremely important to his future in the rotation. If
he pitches poorly, he will provide the avenue for change.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Irabu Welcomes Nomo
</P>
<P>
   In the years they both pitched to Japan, Hideki Irabu never
developed a close friendship with Hideo Nomo, who was acquired by
the Mets in a trade Thursday night. But because Nomo was the first
Japanese-born pitcher to make an impact in the major leagues,
paving the way for Irabu and others to come here, the Yankees'
pitcher refers to Nomo, in his native language, as ``senpai'' _ an
elder.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu said Friday that he is pleased Nomo has joined the Mets
and Masato Yoshii, with whom Nomo is close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy the trade worked out the way it did,'' Irabu
said through his interpreter, George Rose. ``Mutually, we're all
going to go out and do our best. It's nice to have guys like that
nearby.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees' rotation remains in place, Irabu will not pitch
in any of the three interleague games against the Mets at the end
of this month. Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, is not inclined to
set up any kind of a matchup between Irabu and Nomo, or Irabu and
Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in playing baseball,'' Torre said, adding
that while marketing people would want that duel, he's worried
about winning games.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu, too, said he doesn't really care about pitching against
either of his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just looking forward to talking to them at the ball park
when we play the Mets,'' Irabu said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sympathy for Leyland
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre visited briefly with Jim Leyland, the manager of the
Florida Marlins, a team that has the worst record in the big
leagues after winning the World Series last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins have stripped their payroll and traded away
virtually all of their star players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for Jim,'' Torre said. ``The thing about being the
world champion is that you win the last game, and then you go home.
When you really enjoy it is when you walk out on the field the next
year. I sensed he couldn't wear the crown like he wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Planning for Interleague Play
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees play the three-game series in Montreal next
week, they will be without the designated hitter for the first time
this year and may have need for pinch-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for that, the Yankees intend to call up a
right-handed-hitting position player from Class AAA _ probably
outfielder Shane Spencer, possibly Mike Lowell _ to give them 14
position players.
</P>
<P>
   If Ramiro Mendoza stays in the rotation, Orlando Hernandez will
go back to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   But if Hernandez stays, then newly acquired Scott Brow will be
headed to Class AAA Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Close to Perfection
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Lloyd, the Yankees' left-hander, completed a strange feat
Thursday night, in pitching 1 1/3 innings of relief. Of the last 29
batters he's faced, Lloyd has retired 27, allowed one hit and one
walk. In a sense, he pitched a one-hitter over his last 12
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be perfect in my own way,'' Lloyd said, with a
laugh. ``I'm hitting my spots. I haven't been worried about the
hitters at all. It's par for this team _ you want to do well, so
you're not left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Other numbers, some bizarre, some incredible:
</P>
<P>
   _ In his first 82 2/3 innings, David Wells has allowed 17 home
runs and 17 walks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bernie Williams, the Yankees center fielder, has 10 hits in
his last 15 at-bats with runners in scoring position, since May 23.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Yankees' bullpen has not allowed an unearned run since
April 30. That encompasses a span of 32 games. The entire Yankees
staff has allowed a total of three unearned runs in the last 32
games.

SPORTS COLUMN: DESORMEAUX HOPS ABOARD DESTINY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By race time late Saturday afternoon, Kent Desormeaux had long
since come to believe that fate surely meant for him to be in post
position No. 8, aboard a sliver of a horse named Real Quiet,
shooting for the first Triple Crown in 20 years in the Belmont
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Why would he not believe this after what he had been through,
where he had come from to be there?
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a devout Catholic boy from Louisiana, I'd have to say
this is all God's will,'' he said. ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletes who expect us to believe they were chosen to win at the
expense of others are one thing. Desormeaux wasn't referring to any
divine race fixers.
</P>
<P>
   He was saying that in his mind, his heart, he was only destined
to find the trainer, Bob Baffert, who was supposed to help him
revive a comatose career, just as he was meant to nearly come back
from the dead six years ago after a horrific fall at Hollywood
Park.
</P>
<P>
   This was before he would come down with what was diagnosed
industrywide as a lousy attitude, and suffer the symptoms of being
virtually out of work.
</P>
<P>
   This was six years ago, three years after Desormeaux, at 19, set
a single-year record with 598 victories, working the prestigious
Southern California triangle of Santa Anita, Del Mar and Hollywood
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Three years before he would become the youngest jockey ever to
record his 3,000th victory.
</P>
<P>
   This was smack dab in the middle of what he previously thought
was the height of his prosperity, when his mount rebelled like a
defiant teen-ager and Desormeaux took the most painful fall from
grace, and the world went dark at the very time his wife needed him
to be her shining light.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Desormeaux, not yet eight months pregnant, was bedridden,
hospitalized, on that day in December, 1992, when her husband was
riding a horse named Judge Hammer at Hollywood Park. He had just
taken the lead, but the horse wanted to veer left and Desormeaux
administered a couple of quick spanks to the left side. The horse
veered right. Desormeaux did not go with him. Every horse but the
last one passed him by.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trailing horse got me,'' he said. ``Kicked me in the
head.'' He rubbed his temple, as if to pinpoint the spot and said,
``Judge Hammer got me hammered.''
</P>
<P>
   He could afford to joke about it now, but the ambulance driver
who rushed Desormeaux to Centinella Hospital would say that on his
previous trip, he had picked up a man who had also taken a severe
blow to the head, and had a similar lifeless look, the same black
eyes, as him. The internal bleeding inside the skull. Blood oozing
from his ears. The first guy didn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   When the doctors looked at Desormeaux, they weren't placing bets
at the window that he would either.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 hours later, he awakened and asked for his wife. It
wasn't much later that she went into labor and began screaming for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I begged and pleaded the doctors to let me go watch the birth
of my child,'' he said. ``They strapped me flat and wheeled me back
into the ambulance, over to Methodist Hospital, near Santa Anita.
I'm laying watching it, and every time she would have a
contraction, they would lose my son's heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they rushed Sonia Desormeaux off for an emergency
C-section. Desormeaux, heavily sedated, passed out. When he awoke
this time, he was told he had a son.
</P>
<P>
   The family Desormeaux was still a long way from leaving the
hospital, or the proverbial woods. Sonia Desormeaux developed
toxemia during the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Joshua weighed barely 4 pounds and was under 24-hour
emergency care. Desormeaux remained confined to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   So there they were, on Dec. 16, medicated under one hospital
roof and clinging to the hope that they would somehow survive this
together.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days later, Christmas Day, Kent and Sonia Desormeaux
dressed their son and took him home.
</P>
<P>
   So it is more than understandable that Desormeaux believes he
was guided along the road to Churchill Downs and Pimlico last
month, if not to the actual winner's circles. It is believable.
``When it is your turn, it is your turn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By the early spring of last year, it was his turn to go helmet
in hand to Santa Anita and ask Baffert for mounts. He started
slowly, working out horses. Another rider got hurt. Desormeaux
wound up aboard Real Quiet, Baffert's No. 2 Derby entry. In the
stretch at Churchill Downs, Real Quiet blew by Baffert's No. 1,
Indian Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go get 'em, Meaux money,'' Gary Stevens shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Is this fate? Baffert, with a Triple Crown at stake, was not
about to run Indian Charlie in the Belmont Stakes. Stevens, one of
the world's leading jockeys, switched stables to Prestonwood Farm's
Victory Gallop, second to Real Quiet in the Derby and the
Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   When he envisioned how the Belmont would be run in the countdown
to the race, Desormeaux would see his horse pulling away from
Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have run the race 150 million times in my head before it
goes off, putting myself in situations that will arise in the
race,'' he said. ``They'll all be in my dream, and all the dreams
end up with me in front.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that is his dream, his plan. He was willing to admit
there could be another.

CARDIAC SURGEON WINS AVON MINI MARATHON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The absence of world-class runners left more glory
for others to bask in Saturday at the Avon Mini Marathon in Central
Park.
</P>
<P>
   For the winner, Kim Griffin, it was a day to confirm that a
nagging Achilles' injury had finally healed. Griffin, a cardiac
surgeon from Manhattan, seized the lead in the shadow of her
employer, Mount Sinai Hospital, at the 7-kilometer mark and
captured the 10-kilometer race in 35 minutes 26 seconds. Jennifer
Latham of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., finished second in 35:33, and Sue
Kelly of Atlanta was third in 36:06.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking I had a chance to win,'' Griffin said. ``I'm
a little bit out of shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, who is 36, was the NCAA 10,000-meter champion in 1982,
but she would have been just another club runner in Saturday's race
had elite competitors been invited. Avon recently took over
sponsorship of the annual race from Advil, and organizers geared
this year's event toward encouraging local talent, said Kathrine
Switzer, Avon's program director. Next year, the likes of Kenya's
Tegla Laroupe will return when the race becomes a world
championship for the Avon road-racing circuit.
</P>
<P>
   For Johanna Rhyins, a 12-year-old from Manhattan, Saturday was
another chance to astound her doctors. She was born with a hole in
her heart and had open-heart surgery at age 6. She began running
competitively at 7 and is now a very good age-class runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fifth mile I had trouble,'' said Rhyins, who was timed in
43:28. ``My legs tightened up.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the 6,000 competitors benefited from ideal race
conditions: morning temperatures in the low 60s with low humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Karin Stenstrom and three friends, all visiting from Sweden,
chatted about the race afterward on the lawn by Tavern on the
Green, glancing up at the breeze-swept sky as if it were a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Stenstrom celebrated her sub-1-hour time with an iced tea and a
cigarette. ``I'm the bad one,'' she said sheepishly.

ANNE KRAUS, 73, ADMINISTRATOR OF HOMES FOR MENTALLY RETARDED
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anne Kraus, who was inspired by the plight of her
firstborn to devote herself to those with mental retardation and
other developmental disabilities, died on Monday at Long Island
Jewish Medical Center, in Queens County. She was 73 and lived in
Rego Park, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   At her death, Mrs. Kraus was the director of general services at
the New York City Association for the Help of Retarded Children.
She had served on the board of directors for a number of years and
as association president from 1967 to 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The association operates about 100 group homes in New York City.
Mrs. Kraus was instrumental in the creation of one of those group
homes, the Melvin M. Kraus Residence in Manhattan, named after her
stricken son. Melvin was born in 1949 and died in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   As director of general services, Mrs. Kraus was involved in
keeping the homes comfortable and attractive. She organized trips
to the agency's summer camps in the Catskills and ran a car pool
that took residents and nurses to doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   She looked after the needs of board members and organized annual
dinners and meetings for them and family members, as well as
special parties for donor groups.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Kraus was born Hanneliese Bender in Frankfurt, Germany, and
reached England in the late 1930s on a Kindertransport. While in
England she trained at the Sheffield School of Nursing.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching New York in 1946, she worked as an operating-room nurse
in a Manhattan hospital until her marriage to Walter Kraus in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband died just over a year ago. Mrs. Kraus is survived by
their other son, Lawrence, of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and two
grandsons.

   RAMSEY _ While Colorado police are eager to have a grand jury
address the JonBenet Ramsey case, hoping it will force testimony
from those resistant to talk, at least one legal expert believes
the move will probably solve nothing and could end the
investigation. ``I don't see it (a grand jury) getting much from
any suspect,'' said William Pizzi, a former federal prosecutor and
a criminal law professor at the University of Colorado Law School.
In fact, should the process add nothing to the case, Pizzi believes
the grand jury may decide no charges are warranted. ``This may be
the last chapter'' of the story, said Pizzi. (Schneider, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

SPORTS COLUMN: GRIEVING SELES FOUND SERENITY ON THE COURT
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ She uses the word ``weird'' to describe her state of
mind, the heightened consciousness, the serenity.
</P>
<P>
   The Magyar Valley Girl is long gone, the giggle long lost or
suppressed. She is now a woman, a woman in mourning, a
European-American woman in black, putting her grief into her
backhand.
</P>
<P>
   Her purposefulness, the last gift from her father, helped Monica
Seles reach the final of the French Open. The crowd knew the
particulars, which meant that Arantxa Sanchez Vicario had to hear
chants of ``Moh-Nee-Kah! Moh-Nee-Kah!'' in steamy Roland Garros
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sanchez Vicario was sympathetic, ``but this is a game,'' as
she graciously informed the crowd later, and Sanchez Vicario had
more legs and mind and strokes on this afternoon, winning by 7-6
(7-5), 0-6, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   There is a song by the vastly underdiscovered American
folk-country singer, Iris Dement, about how she had to go back on
the road after the death of her father because she had a series of
concerts. The song is called, ``No Time to Cry.'' This is where
Monica Seles is now. Her tennis got her through these weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Many athletes who lose a parent will openly dedicate their next
season, their next game, to the absent parent, but Seles declined
to make the French Open a memorial to her father, who died on May
13.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Seles said the other day after demolishing Martina
Hingis in the semifinals. ``I mean, my dad just really wanted me to
do what I wanted to do. Tennis is one of the things that I love to
do. He was the one who started me with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss him tremendously, but win or lose, it doesn't make a
difference in my thinking about my dad, or not thinking about
him.''
</P>
<P>
   She wore black on the court Saturday, with a touch of yellow at
the throat, but she insists that was merely what her sporting-goods
sponsor happened to put in her kit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad it's not a bright color, because it just feels
more appropriate,'' she said the other day. ``I try to give respect
to Dad. Sometimes I've been wearing black, I know the past two
weeks, but I really don't think consciously _ maybe a little bit
subconsciously, but not fully consciously.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles acted and played like a grown-up in this tournament, a
mature woman in black, leaning into her strokes, distracted by
nothing, until Saturday, when she tried far too many drop shots
against a familiar opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have noticed that a lot sooner and stopped doing
those plays, because they were free points to Arantxa,'' Seles said
later.
</P>
<P>
   Her focus came from her father, Karolj, who had postponed the
next stage in his life to counsel her after the ghastly stabbing on
court in Germany. When he fell ill, she staggered through her
tournaments, she and her mother calling at odd hours from European
locker rooms or courtside mobile phones, back to Florida, just to
check up on him.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, when he knew his illness was terminal, Karolj Seles
put his life in order. He made a return trip to Europe, to his
familial and professional bases, where long before he had a
daughter with a two-handed killer stroke he had been a notable
artist and cartoonist.
</P>
<P>
   He made a pilgrimage to Italy, to Bordighera, for the annual
reunion of cartoonists, political humorists, the people of thought
and ideology who had been his life. He and his wife went back to
their old apartment in Novi Sad, in what is left of Yugoslavia,
where the Hungarian-speaking Seles family had lived along with
thousands of others of Hungarian ancestry. They went to Kanjizza,
in the north, where Monica's Serbian maternal grandmother still
lives. Karolji had always claimed that when Monica was settled in
tennis, he would retire to this northern post of Serbia, not far
from the Hungarian border, where he would help his in-laws distill
the fiery plum brandy, Slivovice.
</P>
<P>
   He died in Florida just before the clay-court tournament here,
where she had won her first Grand Slam championship in 1990. She
had the freedom to throw herself back into her work, and she
produced glorious throwback victories over Jana Novotna and Martina
Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, she was asked if she had felt comfortable, back in
her old routine, but she said: ``I really don't know because I
don't remember how I used to feel. So I'm just in the present, what
it is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   All she knew was that life had conspired to give her a Grand
Slam tournament at a time when she needed to work. As the
songwriter put it, she had no time to cry. &QL;

JORDAN'S CONGREGATION KEEPS ON LISTENING
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Over the years, Michael Jordan's congregation has
listened to him without nodding off or making grocery lists. Time
has passed, and a message has seeped into their souls: never give
in.
</P>
<P>
   So when the preacher needed to be saved in Game 2, when Jordan
was weary and worn, it was Steve Kerr and Dennis Rodman, Ron Harper
and Toni Kukoc, who found a way. Their efforts helped even the NBA
finals with the Jazz in the four-of-seven series that heads back to
Chicago for Games 3, 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have the edge now. Jordan never doubted the
possibility. He has kept the faith in his team. It did not matter
that the Bulls entered Game 2 on Friday night down, 1-0, to the
Jazz, or that they had lost four out of their last six playoff
games, dating to their seven-game series with Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Through his tired eyes, Jordan continued to search for hope amid
the negatives.
</P>
<P>
   Before Game 2, he was more upbeat than downtrodden. But was that
just a cover for his anxiety?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been confident all along,'' Jordan said after struggling
in the fourth quarter, but finishing Game 2 with 37 points. ``I may
have been laughing and joking and changing my mood, but that didn't
diminish my confidence. I think a lot of people have said things
about our physical tiredness, or whatever, but our mental toughness
is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't become five-time champions without having some type
of mental advantage. I think right now, we are mentally strong to
defend what we have. Physically we may not be a much more
physically gifted team, but our mentality counts for something. I
don't think that should ever be overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen. You could almost hear the Bulls say it. Game 2 was over
and they had accomplished something few thought they could. They
took a home game from Utah at the raucous Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very important game for us,'' said Scottie Pippen,
who contributed 21 points and started off the game right by
attacking the rim with repeated layups. ``We didn't think we were
going to come in here and lose two games. Everyone in the locker
room was upbeat, and we just had to do what we had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   They started doing it the moment the Bulls saw the flare Jordan
sent up. He was floundering out there in the final three minutes as
he missed an easy layup and followed that up with a flat 12-footer
that bounced off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   On that last shot, Jordan was panting and became a straggler as
Jeff Hornacek streaked ahead to hit a 3-pointer. The lead was the
Jazz's with 1 minute 46 seconds left in a Game 2 that looked bound
to be turned into another dissection of Jordan's fourth-quarter
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff hit the big 3 and I think we went back to the huddle and
everyone was quiet and focused,'' Kerr said. ``We came back out and
took control.''
</P>
<P>
   They did it just like Jordan has taught them to do. Whatever it
took. As it has in the past _ note John Paxon _ the auxiliary unit
suddenly kicked in for Chicago. Fresh power. There was Kerr, saving
his own rebound off a missed 3-pointer and then whirling it to an
open Jordan for the finish and the foul. The 3-point play with 47
seconds left gave the Bulls the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at that play Steve Kerr made,'' Hornacek said. ``It
looked like two or three guys jumped at him when he shot that
3-pointer, and he gets the rebound. I have to go get him and he
dumps it to Michael. They get a 3-point play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it the other night. We anticipate every game
being this close and it's going to be a play here or there that
wins a game. I thought Steve Kerr killed it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr made the overt impact. But others contributed, as well.
Rodman, with his head painted like a tortoise, popped out of his
shell. After playing 11 minutes in the first half without a
rebound, he jump-started himself.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman threw a few elbows and got a little wicked. In the end,
after several key rebounds, he smiled a sly grin as he hugged the
ball off yet another Karl Malone miss. Now add to this a key steal
by Toni Kukoc, plus another steal by Ron Harper, and it allowed
Jordan to sit back and breathe for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's no question that Michael is wearing down a
little bit,'' Kerr said. ``We've seen it in both games of this
series. We have to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jazz have a great bench and a lot of scorers. We know
we're going to get outscored, but to make a few plays in the game
and help our cause, that's all we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   They did all they could in Game 2. And this is just like the
Bulls. This is how they have always defended their titles. They
watch Jordan and take their cue from him. If he doesn't give in,
they don't give in. If he's optimistic, they are optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being frustrated, I just smile and let it flow,''
Jordan said. ``I just channel my thoughts and my frustration into a
whole different form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about our chances. I feel confident. I kind of
force myself to say, `Hey, I'm going to enjoy this moment because
it may not happen again.' This may be the last time, the last
dance, whatever. That's my mood from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has spoken. The congregation surely took note.

JUST ANOTHER DAY ON DECK FOR TITANS OF INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens all the time on big sailboats. A crew member jams a
finger in some piece of deck hardware. It's off to the hospital for
stitches, then back on board for the next race. But this time it
was Rupert Murdoch, and no one assumed anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rupe, Rupe, Rupe,'' the boat crew chanted that night as the
Australian magnate of the news media walked into the team dinner in
Sydney. A local hospital had repaired the sliced index finger, and
Murdoch was back. ``Are you going to go?'' the chorus chimed. ``Are
you going to go?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Murdoch said, he was. And so for the next three days,
he resumed his crew position on board Sayonara, the 80-foot
maxiyacht owned by his friend Larry Ellison. It was the 1995
Sydney-Hobart Race, a 635-mile Australian competition that Sayonara
ultimately won.
</P>
<P>
   On board for nearly three days of offshore competition were the
two titans of global technology: Murdoch, chairman of News Corp., a
worldwide communications firm; and Ellison, a software giant from
San Francisco who is chief executive officer of Oracle Corp.
Compared with their daily dealings ashore, life at sea offered a
relatively tranquil hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   That was three years ago. But fleet gatherings are an ongoing
affair each year for such owners and friends. On Saturday, a small
but powerful fleet of maxiyachts is expected to gather in Newport,
R.I., for the start of the annual maxi world championship. At least
four of the big $2.5 million yachts will compete in a series of day
races and one short offshore race, culminating the following Friday
in the Newport-Bermuda Race.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in this for the maintenance of a Corinthian spirit in
yachting,'' Bob Hale, navigator for the yacht Boomerang, said
recently. ``Owners continue to sail their own boats. And although
anyone with a maxi is in a financial position to hire a crew, the
idea is to have the owner steer his own boat in races with
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the big maxiyachts of the world rope in titans of
industry with their seductive style: fast, expensive boats that
offer leisure time with just enough competitive spirit to keep
corporate moguls in personal overdrive. It's not surprising that
when they meet now and then in a corporate boardroom, the talk
swings first to a savored victory on the water.
</P>
<P>
   George Coumantaros of New York, the owner of Boomerang, is the
epitome of the amateur owner who steers his own boat rather than
hiring a professional racer. Coumantaros, who owns Southern Star
Shipping in New York, would like others who join his elite pastime
to play willingly by the same rules. But the rules have been by
necessity spelled out: An owner must steer his own boat at the
start, and up the first leg of each race, as well as one-third of
the race from then on.
</P>
<P>
   Given who the owners are, it's not hard to fathom how deep their
will to win is. Ellison, who is relatively new to sailing, has
hired Chris Dickson of New Zealand, one of the best yacht racers in
the world, as an alternate helmsman.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch is a lifelong sailor who competed in his first
Sydney-Hobart race 34 years ago. But he has not yet joined in the
maxi race circuit; he owns a 140-foot cruising sailboat. Murdoch is
not expected to sail with the Ellison team in Newport.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Coutts, another New Zealand sailor with top professional
credentials, often sails as alternate helmsman on Morning Glory, a
maxiyacht owned by Hasso Plattner, a German software entrepreneur.
Another prominent player in the maxi fleet is Alberto Roemmers, a
wealthy Argentinian who owns the maxi Alexia.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dolan, the chief executive officer of Cablevision Systems
Corp., a New York firm that also owns Madison Square Garden, has
campaigned the maxiyacht Sagamore over the last three years. He
recently donated the maxi to a nonprofit group while awaiting the
completion next year of a new maxiyacht.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mix of owners and high-profile crew has caused problems in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when he started campaigning Sayonara, Ellison caused a
stir at the Kenwood Cup in Hawaii by turning the helm over to
Dickson during a particularly dicey start. The International Class
A Yacht Association of maxi owners refused to acknowledge
Sayonara's standing in that race. And unless Ellison agreed to
change his ways, the group was ready to totally ignore him.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison agreed to change his ways in the next regatta, the Big
Boat Series that autumn in San Francisco. ``Larry drove the whole
time,'' said Bill Erkelens, Sayonara's boat captain. ``He could
have gotten intimidated by being at the starting line in 25 knots
of wind and fairly new to this particular boat, but instead he
agreed to play by the rules.''

BELMONT FIELD REDUCED TO 11 BY 2 LATE SCRATCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO and JAY PRIVMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two horses, Hanuman Highway and Hot Wells, both long shots, were
scratched from the Belmont Stakes for widely differing reasons
Saturday, reducing the field to 11 in the hours before the race.
</P>
<P>
   Hanuman Highway, who drew the No. 1 post position on the rail
and was 30-1 in the early track line, ran second in the Arkansas
Derby and seventh in the Kentucky Derby. He was forced to withdraw
after he came down with a case of colic during the night. His
trainer, Kathy Walsh, said the colt was being treated at Belmont
Park and she hoped it would prove to be only a temporary setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call about 3:30 this morning,'' she reported, ``and I
came right down here. Everyone's upset, but it seems like he'll be
all right. He tends to get keyed up, that's probably how he got
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said that some symptoms appeared two days earlier, but
they disappeared. However, during Friday night, the colt got sick
again, apparently with colic, which involves a blockage of the
intestines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to walk him as long as we could this morning,'' Walsh
said. ``Sometimes they can walk this off. But it just didn't get
better. He is resting comfortably in his stall, and we'll keep a
close eye on him. Colic can be very temporary, or it can be very
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The other horse, Hot Wells, was scratched because his owner was
not licensed in New York state. The owner, Michael Lasky, was
turned down for an owner's license in 1982 when the state Racing
and Wagering Board ruled that he was the publisher of tip sheets.
Lasky now is the founder and operator of the Psychic Friends
Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Lasky's activities have apparently not been judged to
be illegal,'' the board ruled at the time, ``such activities foster
and present to the public a view of racing that is contrary to its
best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot Wells, winner of the Southwest Stakes, ran fourth in the
Preakness and was quoted as 30-1 in the Belmont. He is trained by
Tom Amoss and drew the No. 9 post position in the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of Affirmed
</P>
<P>
   The Triple Crown quest of Real Quiet brought back sweet memories
for Louis and Patrice Wolfson, who owned Affirmed, the winner of
the 1978 Triple Crown and the last of the 11 3-year-olds who have
captured the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfsons spent much of the week participating in anniversary
celebrations at Belmont Park that honored Triple Crown winners
Affirmed, Secretariat (1973) and Citation (1948). They maintain a
home in Old Westbury, N.Y., and visited several of their current
runners who are based at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been so wonderful about this anniversary has been going
down to the basement and bringing up the old pictures,'' said
Patrice Wolfson. She was walking around the stables with an
oversized bag that had pictures and news clippings from Affirmed's
racing days. ``Affirmed looked so young then. As a 4-year-old,
that's when he got big.''
</P>
<P>
   Affirmed went through a celebrated series of races with
arch-rival Alydar, who is the only horse to have finished second in
all three Triple Crown races. In the Belmont Stakes, Affirmed won
by a head after a prolonged stretch drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a series you can't duplicate,'' Wolfson said. ``Alydar
was probably the most brilliant horse who never was a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   The week of the 1978 Belmont, Wolfson said she and her husband
came to the barn every morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were nervous. That was the one time he had to win.
Everything was on the line,'' she said. ``And we were never
overconfident running against Alydar.''
</P>
<P>
   In the stretch, Alydar briefly put his head in front, ``but I
knew Affirmed would fight back,'' Louis Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmed was bred, raised and raced by the Wolfsons. He was like
a pet to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would nuzzle his head in my arms,'' Patrice Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Louis Wolfson: ``You could go in his stall and hug him.''
</P>
<P>
   Affirmed is now 23 and is a stallion at Jonabell Farm near
Lexington, Ky. The Wolfsons can hardly believe 20 years have
elapsed since the Triple Crown, but they are reminded of it when
they visit the stables at Belmont Park. They have a 2-year-old
daughter of Affirmed with the trainer Mark Hennig. And Affirmed's
best runner, the mare Flawlessly, has her first foal, a 2-year-old
filly, in the barn of the trainer Allen Jerkens.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so wonderful about this business is that you think of
20 years ago, and then you look at this,'' Patrice Wolfson said,
pointing at Flawlessly's daughter _ Affirmed's granddaughter _
``and it's all connected.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Large Belmont Crowd
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular weather and the chance for a Triple Crown sweep
brought a large crowd to Belmont Park Saturday. The fans arrived
early with beach chairs and blankets and enveloped the grandstand
apron from the finish line to the top of the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was expected to rival the 70,682 who came last year to
see Silver Charm attempt to capture the Triple Crown, but fall
short of the record Belmont crowd of 82,694, set in 1971 when
Canonero II was shooting for the Triple Crown. Both Silver Charm
and Canonero II lost.

REAL ESTATE: TECHNOLOGY'S EFFECTS ON DESIGN AND MARKETING  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At both the glitzy marketing end of the real estate business and
the utterly practical working level, new technology is changing the
way office buildings are designed and the way they are offered to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology is obvious in an interactive CD-ROM that
markets retail space and signs at 4 Times Square, the new building
under construction by the Durst Organization at 42nd Street and
Broadway. Slip the CD-ROM into a computer and the presentation
opens with a pictorial history of the last 100 years of Times
Square, complete with background music from each era. On another,
promoting 2 Broadway, viewers can move the mouse pointer to a
floor, click, and see what the views out the windows of that floor
will be.
</P>
<P>
   New technology is less obvious, but no less present, in the work
of the people who design the systems that make buildings work _ the
lighting, air-conditioning, elevators and so forth. One way they
are trying to avoid ``sick building syndrome'' is by supplying more
air to the places people work, without consuming more energy.
</P>
<P>
   It was appropriate that the Durst building should go the
high-tech marketing route, since it will be something of a
technological marvel when the first retail tenants start moving in
late this year. Because almost all the office space was leased by
the Conde Nast publishing company and the Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher &AMP; Flom law firm before a spade was put into the ground,
marketing efforts have focused on the multistory retail space at
the base of the building and on the large, illuminated signs that
will sit above the stores as well as at the very top of the
48-story structure.
</P>
<P>
   The Dursts have presented 4 Times Square as a green building,
one that will both conserve energy and improve the environment of
the 8,000 people who are expected to work there. Special glass in
the building's skin admits light but keeps out the heat that can
overtax the cooling system. And the panels between the windows are
photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight to electricity to meet a
small part of the building's power demand.
</P>
<P>
   After the opening sequence on the CD-ROM marketing the building,
the viewer is presented with a series of screens with buttons on
them. When the computer mouse is used to click on the buttons, the
locations of planned new hotels and retail stores are displayed on
maps that show their relation to 4 Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Although the building is not yet finished, the use of animation
shows how it will be seen in relation to its neighbors and displays
the sightlines for the signs. The 60- by 60-foot sign that is to
face west on the roof will be easily visible in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse can also be used to travel around the neighborhood at
street level, zooming in and out.
</P>
<P>
   On another CD-ROM, prospective tenants at 2 Broadway, which is
undergoing a major renovation, can check out the views from the
various floors, including those overlooking New York Harbor and the
Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROMs were created for Williams Real Estate Co., which was
a consultant to the Dursts, as a means of helping to distinguish it
from the brokerage pack, said Michael Cohen, director of brokerage
services for Williams. (He is not to be confused with Michael
Cohen, president of the company.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only so much that you can put on paper, and every
broker in this city is inundated with paper,'' he said. ``Mostly
they look at it briefly and then throw it out or pass it on to the
research department.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, most people are conditioned to regard CDs as
valuable items, with the music versions costing $15 or more,
although the actual cost of making copies is modest once the
presentation has been completed, just as it is with printed
material. As a result recipients are more likely to save the
presentation than if it had arrived in printed form, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he sends CD-ROMs to prospective tenants and brokers and
follows up with visits to demonstrate what is on the disk, for
those not computer-literate enough to load and run it on their own.
``It's a way of distinguishing ourselves,'' he said. ``The `wow'
effect gets people's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he developed the CD-ROMs with a partner, David
Williams, an architect and animator. The CD-ROMs, he said, are
produced like an advertisement, with video, photography, audio and
animation combined to follow a story board prepared in advance to
guide the production.
</P>
<P>
   He said the disks had practical value, in addition to the
``wow'' effect, particularly in dealing with clients in other
cities. Showing them the outdoor views from the different floors at
2 Broadway, or the placement of the signs on 4 Times Square, gives
decision-makers something to consider before actually visiting a
property. ``They will still visit,'' he said, ``but maybe it's just
one trip rather than multiple trips.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the technology spectrum, engineers are
trying a new approach to keep office workers comfortable while
saving energy. Since many offices have raised floors to accommodate
the wiring for personal computers, copiers and fax machines, the
idea is to use the space for ventilation as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a review of developments at 4 Times Square, Bruce Fowle, a
principal at Fox &AMP; Fowle Architects, which designed the building,
wrote that under-floor air distribution was an innovation his firm
would consider for its next project. The firm is also designing the
Reuters Building at 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue, which has been
designated 3 Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is, without question, the way of the future,'' he
wrote. ``Under-floor air allows you to eliminate duct work, give
individualized air supply, reduce floor-to-floor heights and
increase layout flexibility, thereby reducing energy, material and
waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Most modern buildings have a system of overhead ducts to deliver
cooling air. But because most people work sitting down the air has
to be blown down toward the floor, competing with the heat rising
from computers, desk lamps, copiers and other office machines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With an under-floor system, the air is blown through an
adjustable grille in the floor near where people sit. The idea is
to cool people, rather than the entire interior volume of a
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you supply air overhead, you have to cool it to 55 to 60
degrees to maintain 72 degrees at a workstation,'' said Marvin
Mass, a partner in the Cosentini Associates engineering consulting
firm. He said that an under-floor system could use air as warm as
65 degrees to maintain 72 degrees at the critical breathing level.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to use warmer air means that less energy needs to be
used to run air-conditioning equipment, and less energy means lower
costs. It also means fresher air. In warm months building operators
tend to recirculate interior air to hold down the cost of cooling
the cleaner _ but warmer _ outside air.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mass blames 1970's federal energy-conservation
regulations for what has become known as ``sick building
syndrome.'' To hold down energy usage, more modern buildings use
less fresh air than those built earlier. As a result, gases emitted
by carpeting, paint and machines tended to recirculate rather then
be eliminated and replaced by fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buildings put up in the '50s, '60s and early '70s have plenty
of fresh air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mass said that air-conditioning and other interior systems were
considered standard for many years, but that lately new approaches
were being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a time of change, and that is a good thing,'' said Alan
Traugott, a principal of Flack &AMP; Kurtz, an engineering company.
``It means we are getting away from catalog engineering,'' he said,
referring to the practice of designing systems using standard
references rather than a creative approach.
</P>
<P>
   Because they work best in an open layout, rather than in a space
with many closed offices, under-floor systems are more suitable for
corporate headquarters than for multitenant projects, said Douglas
Mass, Marvin Mass' son, who is also a partner at Cosentini.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are relatively new in this country, under-floor air
systems can cost slightly more than standard overhead
air-conditioning, Douglas Mass said. But because new ducts do not
need to be designed and fabricated every time offices are moved,
operating costs are typically lower.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Owens-Corning headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, had been
built with an under-floor air system. ``The facilities manager told
me he saved $500,000 in a year on his budget for moving people,''
the younger Mass said.

NEWARK DIOCESE DOES NOT CHOOSE GAY CLERIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATIANA WITH RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Episcopal Diocese of Newark could have made the
Reverend Canon Gene Robinson of New Hampshire the country's first
openly gay bishop on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 50, canon to the bishop of New Hampshire and executive
secretary of the Province of New England, was bypassed by the
almost 500 diocese members who cast their ballots at St. Peter's
Church in Morristown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   They selected the Rev. John P. Croneberger, 59, rector of the
Church of the Atonement in nearby Tenafly, N.J., to lead the
diocese of 43,000 communicants and 123 churches. Croneberger, one
of six candidates who had vied for the post, will succeed the Right
Reverend John S. Spong, who has announced he will retire on Jan.
31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's candidacy had caused an uproar in the Episcopal
Church in America, which has been divided over the issue of
homosexuality. Many conservatives in the 2.5 million-member
denomination, who believe the Scriptures condemn homosexuality,
were watching the vote carefully.
</P>
<P>
   But Dale Gruner, spokeswoman for the Diocese of Newark, said she
believedRobinson's sexual orientation made no difference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that weighed into the vote in any significant
manner,'' Gruner said. ``He ran third throughout, and the mood of
the diocese was that they wanted someone they knew well, which is
why Croneberger and McKelvey ran as the leaders in this all day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Right Reverend Jack M. McKelvey, Bishop Suffragan of the
Diocese of Newark, was neck-and-neck with Croneberger until the
third ballot, after which he withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from his home in Weare, N.H., Saturday afternoon,
Robinson said he was disappointed he was not elected, but said he
was thankful and honored to have been in the running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was treated with respect and hospitality and warmth
throughout the process. ... There was no unpleasantness, no
prejudice and only courteous and warm behavior,'' said Robinson,
who was married with two daughters before he acknowledged his
homosexuality. ``My sexual orientation played a small and
appropriate role in all of our discussions. They were far more
interested in knowing who might best lead them into the next
century than my orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the fifth time in the past few years that Robinson was
considered for a bishop's post, he said. In the four other cases,
the dioceses stopped short of nominating him for fear of the
controversy it would generate, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newark, perhaps because it is no stranger to controversy, was
bold and courageous enough to make the nomination,'' said Robinson.
``Now that they have paved the way, maybe it will not seem like
such an intimidating prospect to other dioceses _ at least, that is
my hope. I hope that my participating in this way made that small
contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Newark's bishop, Spong, who has served that diocese since 1976
and is the most senior prelate in the Episcopal Church, has
long-supported the ordination of openly gay clergy and the blessing
of same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Reverend Edward Rodman, canon to the bishop of Massachusetts,
said he was disappointed that Robinson was not elected, but he
thought the vote showed that ``there are fair-minded people in this
world'' and that ``an openly gay priest is a viable candidate.'' He
said it is just a matter of time until someone who is openly gay
gets elected as bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope it is not as long as it was to get a woman,''
Rodman quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The first woman bishop, Right Reverend Barbara C. Harris of the
Diocese of Massachusetts, was consecrated only nine years ago.
There are currently eight women among the church's 200 bishops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the people in Newark judged me on my merits,'' said
Robinson. ``I felt honored all the way through that process and I
just feel deep gratitude for the opportunity to talk to people
about my life and my ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you can tell the truth about yourself and
sing the Lord's song at the same time, it is a great moment.''

CARDINAL LAW DEFROCKS ACCUSED MOLESTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Cardinal Bernard F. Law revealed Saturday that he has
defrocked John J. Geoghan, a retired priest accused of sexually
molesting more than 50 children over three decades, in an
extraordinary punitive move sanctioned by Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man can never again present himself as a priest,'' Law
said in an interview at his Brighton residence.
</P>
<P>
   While the pontiff authorized the defrocking early this year, Law
said he decided to announce it Saturday after it was revealed this
week that the church had paid millions to settle claims against
Geoghan brought by dozens of his alleged victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been so much notoriety that I felt it necessary to
point this out for the record,'' said Law, who has sent a letter
explaining his actions to all priests in the Archdiocese of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials believe that Geoghan's punishment is the first
time a priest has been defrocked, or laicized as it is formally
called, in the 125-year history of the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Defrocking is the most serious punishment that can be meted out
against a priest. Geoghan can no longer perform any priestly
duties, including saying Mass, performing weddings or annointing
the sick.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the equivalent, some priests noted, of being
disbarred as an attorney or being expelled from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Geoghan, who has never talked about the allegations against him,
could not be reached Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He has kept a low profile ever since the allegations against him
were first made public more than a year ago. Archdiocesan sources
say Geoghan, who is living the Boston area, has not cooperated with
church officials, refusing, for example, to undergo counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Law said he informed Geoghan of his defrocking in person. ``He
understood the decision and the ramifications of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ongoing criminal investigations of Geoghan, Law refused
to go into any details about allegations against the ex-priest or
what evidence he provided the Vatican to make a case for
defrocking.
</P>
<P>
   But he did say that he used a rarely used provision in canon law
covering forced laicization that makes it impossible for Geoghan to
appeal his defrocking in ecclesiastical court. Another section of
church law does permit appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it would be more helpful, all things considered, that
an appeal with the delay it would mean not be part of the
picture,'' Law said. ``This is a definitive decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Geoghan's alleged victims praised Law for taking the
action. ``I'm happy that the church has decided not to harbor a
pedophile,'' said John D. Sacco, who alleges that Geoghan molested
him in the 1960s while the Geoghan served Blessed Sacrament parish
in Saugus, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good step on Law's part because so much of the
problem in the past is that the church has just recycled these guys
from parish to parish,'' said Jason Berry, a Catholc writer in New
Orleans and author of ``Lead Us Not into Temptation,'' a 1992 book
on clergy sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Laicization is typically a lengthy, complex and sensitive
process that has been a stumbling block to removing priests accused
of sexual abuse. Law said he began the process of defrocking
Geoghan about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Geoghan still faces criminal investigations by the district
attorneys in Suffolk and Middlesex counties. And there are at least
a dozen lawsuits still pending against Geoghan and the Archdiocese
of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese has settled 12 lawsuits against Geoghan and the
church by paying at least 50 of his alleged victims a total of
between $2.5 million and $10 million, according to several victims.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Geoghan's alleged victims and church observers wondered
why it had taken Law so long to punish Geoghan. Several victims and
their relatives charge that church officials knowingly returned the
retired priest to parish work even after receiving information that
he had sexually abused children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had done this 30, even 20 years ago, a lot of kids
would have been spared the pain and the trauma they have had to
endure,'' Sacco said.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of one of Geoghan's alleged victims told the Botson
Globe that as early as 1972 she told officials at St. Mary of the
Annunciation in Melrose that Geoghan was sexually abusing her son.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 Geoghan was placed on sick leave after a mother told
archdiocesan officals that he was molesting her sons while he was
at St. Andrew's Church in Forest Hills. At the end of his sick
leave in 1981, Geoghan was returned to parish duty and allegedly
molested children at two more churches until he was again placed on
sick leave in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Over 31 years following his ordination in 1962, Geoghan served
six parishes in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   Without referring specifically to the Geoghan case, Law
acknowledged that in the past the church did not do a good job of
handling sexual abuse allegations. But, he insisted, that the
archdiocese has improved its treatment of victims and of priests
accused of sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Law acknowledges, ``As long as I am archbishop I
will be haunted by those persons who have been victimized.''
</P>
<P>
   The Geoghan case has been a public relations nightmare for the
Archdiocese of Boston and is one of hundreds of sexual abuse
scandals that have convulsed the church in the United States in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the Reverend Joseph Keith Symons sent shock
waves across the church when he resigned as bishop of Palm Beach,
Fla., after admitting having molested five boys early in his
priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 15 years, about 1,000 pedophile priests have been
identified nationally and during that period the church has paid
nearly $800 million to settle with victims of sexual abuse,
according to those who track the issue.
</P>
<P>
   While church officials have shown increasing concern for
victims, critics say the church is still primarily interested in
protecting its reputation and trying to make scandals disappear as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for victims of clergy sexual abuse say there is still
a reluctance on the part of some dioceses in the United States to
agressively investigate allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Most dioceses keep investigations private, leaving parishioners
to wonder why priests have been suddenly yanked out of their
churches.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, some advocates and attorneys who handle sexual abuse
cases acknowledge that the archdiocese has done a significantly
better job of dealing with the explosive issue.
</P>
<P>
   New guidelines instituted by Law five years ago give the
archdiocese greater latitude in dealing with priests accused of
sexual abuse, including immediately removing clerics from their
posts until an investigation can be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials also report allegations of sexual abuse
involving children to legal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, church observers note, that the American bishops
approach to clergy sexual abuse has changed dramatically in the
past 15 years as a result of a more sophisticated understanding of
pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most American church officials realize that priests
accused of sexually abusing children should never again be allowed
to work with children. And most dioceses have aggressive policies
for dealing with sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But American bishops still face a tug-of-war with the Vatican
over how to punish priests accused of sexual abuse. The bishops,
faced with a serious financial and moral crisis, want to streamline
the process of defrocking priests. But the Vatican, concerned about
ensuring that the due process of priests is not violated, urges
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bishops have the power to cut these guys loose earlier
it would save them a lot of money and it would save parishioners a
lot of grief,'' said Phil Saviano, regional coordinator for the
Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.
</P>
<P>
   Law said in some cases he does favor a more expedited process.
``I am confident that I have done the right thing before God,'' he
said. ``I would ask people today to pray for victims and their
families and, if they have time, to pray for me because this has
not been an easy time.''

VICTORY GALLOP DENIES REAL QUIET THE TRIPLE CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ The Triple Crown slipped away from Real Quiet in
the final strides of the Belmont Stakes Saturday when he was run
down and beaten by a nose by Victory Gallop, the horse who chased
him home in both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. The winning
margin was the smallest ever that denied a Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The race was the 130th Belmont Stakes and the most dramatic in
20 years, since Affirmed defeated Alydar by a nose and became the
11th horse in racing history to sweep the Triple Crown. And for the
second year in a row, fate foiled Bob Baffert on the threshold of
completing his sweep of the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Baffert's colt Silver Charm lost the Belmont to Touch
Gold by three-quarters of a length. This year, Baffert's Real Quiet
was nipped by Victory Gallop and became the 14th horse to surrender
the crown in the Belmont. And in one of those twists of fortune,
Silver Charm's losing jockey, Gary Stevens, was the winning jockey
this year on Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts to come this far and not win the Triple Crown,'' said
Kent Desormeaxu, who rode Real Quiet in the Kentucky Derby, the
Preakness and the Belmont. ``I felt as though I touched victory.
And it was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert took his second straight loss of the crown with
resignation.``He ran a great race, but got tired at the end,''
Baffert said. ``I'm getting closer. Silver Charm by three-quarters
of a nose. Real Quiet by a nose. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet was undone by the rigors of winning three classics in
five weeks and by the distance of the third, which stretches for a
mile and a half. At the head of the homestretch, Real Quiet made
his famous move, just as he did while winning in Kentucky and
Maryland. He even opened daylight on his 10 pursuers, and with a
quarter-mile to go he had four lengths on Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   But the race was far from finished. Victory Gallop, a son of
Cryptoclearance, who won the Arkansas Derby last month, cast his
shadow on Real Quiet, who was starting to wobble from fatigue. Then
they were nearing the finish line racing shoulder to shoulder as
Real Quiet struggled to hold his edge. But he lost the final bob of
the head by Victory Gallop as they crossed, six lengths in front of
Thomas Jo.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the stewards delayed the result until they examined
films of the race. They reportedly were checking to see if Real
Quiet had veered into his rival's path, and they reportedly would
have stripped him of the victory if he had won it.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop ran his mile and a half in 2:29 flat, paid $11.60
for a $2 bet and went home with $600,000 and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   The race was run on an afternoon of resplendent sunshine and
cool breezes at Belmont Park, the traditional scene for the finale
of the Triple Crown, and it was run with the crowd pushing toward
last year's remarkable turnout of 70,682, the largest to watch a
horse race in New York in 20 years and the third largest to watch
one at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   The racing day, though, began with two scratches from the
Belmont, reducing the field to 11 horses. Both colts scratched were
30-1 long shots: Hanuman Highway, who came down with a case of
colic, and Hot Wells, who was withdrawn because it was determined
that his owner did not have a license to race in New York state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And, of course, the cast for the Triple Crown was severely
depleted since Favorite Trick won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last
November and then was elected champion 2-year-old, early favorite
for the Kentucky Derby (with a perfect 8-for-8 record) and Horse of
the Year. But Favorite Trick didn't make it past the Kentucky
Derby, where he ran eighth. And other star contenders fell by the
wayside with injuries or were otherwise not ready: Lil's Lad, Event
of the Year, Indian Charlie, Halory Hunter and Coronado's Quest.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate drama remained: Could Real Quiet succeed where
13 other horses had failed? They included his stablemate, Silver
Charm, who lost the Belmont last year just when the racing world
was brimming with anticipation over the arrival of a new hero for a
sport that has been fighting against public apathy and financial
ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert Saturday clung to his belief that he had a great horse
who would show the doubters that he deserved to stand among the
greatest in racing annals. In terms of history, Baffert
acknowledged that more horses had failed to win the Triple Crown
than had succeeded. But he insisted to the end that ``you still
have to go out there and run around that oval.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was precisely why so many people were drawn to Belmont
Park for the climax of the racing drama. The sport of kings had
long since grown into a difficult business, surrounded by
alternative forms of gambling, casinos, slot machines, even
off-track betting shops within yards of the race tracks.
</P>
<P>
   But a horse hero remained the rarest form of the art. In recent
years, several such stars crossed the skies. Holy Bull raced into
prominence until he was injured during the Donn Handicap three
years ago. Cigar achieved fame as an older horse who hadn't even
run in the Triple Crown, switched from grass racing to dirt and won
16 races in a row. He is now retired and living in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the generation of Baffert and his happy talk: Silver
Charm, who revived the melodrama in racing, and one year later Real
Quiet, who gave the public a chance to be mesmerized one more time.

BAFFERT WAS WEARY AS THE MARATHON CAME TO AN END 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also RAC-BELMONT) 
(mk) 
 By JAY PRIVMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Bob Baffert hid behind his dark sunglasses. He
tried to rally one more time for a morning of jokes, but his body
language betrayed his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly 11 hours before Saturday's Belmont Stakes, in
which Real Quiet, whom Baffert trains, would attempt to become the
12th Triple Crown winner, only to lose by a nose. Baffert had no
real way of knowing the frustration that lay ahead, but as he
leaned against a wall near Barn 9 at Belmont Park, it looked as if
the rigors of the Triple Crown had already taken a bigger toll on
the trainer than the horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit the wall; I'm exhausted,'' Baffert finally admitted.
``I just want to get the saddle on him, get him around the track
and get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two months, Baffert and those closest to Real Quiet _
the owner Mike Pegram, the exercise rider Larry Damore, the groom
Jose Saul Mancilla and Baffert's top assistant trainer, Eoin Harty
_ had been on a whirlwind tour. Real Quiet left his base in
Southern California in mid-April for the Kentucky Derby, which he
captured as an 8-1 long shot. Then it was on to Maryland for the
Preakness Stakes, where Real Quiet crushed his rivals by 2 1/4
lengths. And now they were just hours away from the 130th Belmont
Stakes, trying to put the bear hug on a prize that had eluded
Baffert one year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Baffert's Silver Charm won both the Derby and
Preakness, then finished second in the Belmont. Now, for the first
time, a trainer was back in consecutive years attempting a Triple
Crown sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joked about it last year,'' said Damore, who is the
exercise rider for Real Quiet and Silver Charm. ``When we lost the
1996 Derby by a nose with Cavonnier, we talked about coming back
the next year and winning it. Then we won with Silver Charm. And
then when Silver Charm got beat going for the Triple Crown, we
joked about coming back the next year and winning the Triple Crown.
It's weird that it could happen now.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet's date with destiny began early Saturday morning. He
was out of his stall and on the track by 6:30 for a light jog. He
came back to the barn, was bathed by Damore and Mancilla, then was
walked by Mancilla around the barn's shed row. Then Real Quiet was
put back in his stall to await the Belmont Stakes, whose post time
was 5:27 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him a little bit of grain, just a light breakfast,''
Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet had half a bucket of water to quench his thirst. He
also was allowed to nibble on his hay rack until 10 a.m., when that
was removed. ``He'll know something's up then,'' Baffert said. ``We
just want to keep him relaxed until the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert was trying to remain calm, too, and said he would take
cues from watching George Steinbrenner at Friday night's Yankee
game. While a guest with his family in Steinbrenner's suite,
Baffert noticed that the Boss ``was focused.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking and entertaining us,'' Baffert said, ``but he
was watching every move of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert had a similar task, trying to prepare for the race while
marshaling his troops. He left the barn around 10 a.m. and headed
back to his Garden City hotel, where he would meet his wife and
their four children. Baffert also had various family members _
parents, brothers, sisters and in-laws _ to accommodate. He and
Pegram spent part of the morning figuring out where all their
friends and family would sit, and how many passes they would need
to get their entourage into the paddock before the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Baffert planned to return to the track around 1 p.m. and remain
at the barn until Real Quiet was led to the paddock, about 45
minutes before post time. He had dozens of buttons that read ``Keep
It Real Quiet'' that he planned to toss to fans in the paddock and
grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not nervous, but I'm thinking about the race; I've got my
game face on,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``My main concern is being able to leave New York one
for eight.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who is based in Southern California, was without
victory in seven previous starts in New York races.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert has relied on a trusted team throughout the Triple
Crown, particularly Damore and Mancilla, who have been with Real
Quiet every day since he left Southern California. The trip had
been rewarding, but difficult, Damore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been home for nearly two months, and I'll still be
on the road another week,'' Damore said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Baffert are returning to Churchill Downs to prepare
Silver Charm for a race there next weekend. ``I just bought a new
house back home, and I haven't seen my wife, Michelle,'' he said.
``She's a wonderful person to put up with my stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Damore, 39, gets on Real Quiet every morning. He is a former
jockey who retired after a nondescript career in which he won only
70 races while riding from 1978 to 1985. He has worked for Baffert
for nearly eight years, and gallops the trainer's best runners.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet has ``a beautiful stride,'' Damore said. ``And the
faster he goes, the nicer and smoother he is. It's been fun
watching him develop. I get to work with him every single day. It's
like raising a little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Damore said Real Quiet has a different personality than Silver
Charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silver Charm couldn't care less about anything,'' Damore said.
``Real Quiet looks around a lot. And he can be tough to gallop. A
few days before the Derby, he was pulling so hard he pulled some
muscles in my arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Mancilla also has battle wounds from Real Quiet. The colt has
bitten Mancilla on his right arm, and on his torso, just above his
right kidney.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kicks and bites,'' Mancilla said. ``I watch him more now.
Now, when I scold him, he doesn't play as hard. We're buddies.''
</P>
<P>
   Mancilla, 38, a native of Guatemala, has been in this country
since 1983 and has worked with horses since 1984. He has worked for
Baffert for five of the last six years; he took a year off to
return to Guatemala when his father, a cattle rancher, died four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mancilla has dark, curly hair that is hidden under a San
Francisco Giants baseball cap. He speaks little English, and though
he relied on Damore to interpret, Mancilla needed no translation
when playfully poking fun at Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He give me the cheap horses,'' Mancilla said. Real Quiet was
purchased as a yearling for $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He no like this horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet lost his first six races. After his fifth loss, Real
Quiet's groom at the time asked for another horse, so Baffert
turned Real Quiet over to Mancilla. Since then, Real Quiet has won
four of nine starts. His last two victories, though, put Real Quiet
and his corner men on the threshold of greatness. &QL;

   Gingrich not following own advice, some say
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Sherman
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Newt Gingrich's public appearance last week
with President Clinton could have come straight from Gingrich's new
book, ``Lessons Learned the Hard Way.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ``personal report'' about mistakes he had made in his
first three years as speaker, Gingrich acknowledged he sometimes
underestimated Clinton's ability to bounce back from trouble. He
titled the chapter, ``Pick Your Fights Wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   So rather than pick a public fight on Social Security, in which
Democrats traditionally have had the upper hand, speaker and
president shared a stage to proclaim jointly their desire to make
the retirement system financially strong for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   But this example of Gingrich taking a chapter from his own book
is unusual and sharply contrasts with much of his behavior since
``Lessons Learned the Hard Way'' was published.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich lately has been much more confrontational than the
smiling, warmer and fuzzier speaker who graced the cover of his
book in jeans and leather jacket. In the space of two months,
Gingrich has attacked Clinton over allegations of illegal foreign
money in Democratic campaigns, slapped ``liberal'' and ``big
government'' tags on a tobacco bill that U.S. tobacco companies
hate, criticized Clinton administration foreign policy while in the
Middle East, initiated discussions about raising the pay of members
of Congress and backed off his support for a farm bill to provide
crop insurance to farmers because it also restored nutrition
benefits to legal immigrants who lost them in the 1996 welfare
reform legislation. The bill eventually passed after complaints
from farm state Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dallek, a historian who has written a review of the book,
said the speaker appears to have abandoned ``a posture of
moderation'' that included learning the value of ``no comment'' and
counseling compromise instead of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Dallek said, the onset of the 1998 campaign season
demands a more partisan and aggressive approach, particularly the
criticism of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a yachtsman, he'll tack in one direction and then
another,'' said Dallek, who recently completed work on ``Flawed
Giant,'' his second book on President Johnson. ``He may have
written the book, but he needs to reclaim his hard edge and the
conservative ground.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican critic, Arianna Huffington, was more pointed,
saying that Gingrich sharpened his tone in response to polls that
showed a depressed Republican base. ``There's a lack of
credibility,'' Huffington said. ``The book was one kind of attempt
to change his image and the change in tone was another kind of
attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ruskin, director of the watchdog group Congressional
Accountability Project, said Gingrich's closed-door discussion with
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt about a congressional pay raise
feeds Americans' cynicism about politics. Gingrich aides stress no
decision has been made to increase members' pay, now $136,700 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter titled ``Know the Difference Between Right and
Wrong,'' Gingrich wrote, ``The trustworthiness of our political
leaders goes through the heart of our political culture to the very
question of how much allegiance to their country can be demanded of
ordinary citizens. Cynicism is corrosive of everything that
Congress was meant to stand for and hence of our very democratic
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's supporters dismiss the criticism as misplaced.
Christina Martin, the speaker's press secretary, said Gingrich
refrained from personal attacks on Clinton, even though he likened
the administration to ``The Jerry Springer Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not get involved in innuendo,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the speaker simply restated U.S. law that the capital
of the country is Jerusalem and that the U.S. embassy should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   Editorials that suggested Gingrich follow his own advice,
contained in the chapter ``Learn to Keep You-- Mouth Shut,'' were
off the mark, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker is on his game, in charge and winning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blankley, Martin's predecessor and a contributor to George
magazine, said Gingrich's desire to curb his rhetorical excesses
does not mean he plans to remain silent on policy issues. His
maturation as speaker should not suggest he will cave in at every
turn, Blankley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an easy contrast here, with the cover jacket, but it
misreads both the book and Newt's political needs,'' Blankley said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of last year's reprimand by the House for violating
ethics rules and a failed effort to depose him as speaker, Gingrich
purposely lowered his profile and sought about rehabilitating his
image, Blankley said.
</P>
<P>
   The effort largely worked and culminated in the book tour, if
his revived poll numbers mean anything. At the same time, ``Newt
saw what was needed, and he did it,'' Blankley said.

 &HT;    Georgia Dome may be next site for fight
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After one of the world's most famous arenas was
forced to fold a boxing card because two boxers tested positive for
hepatitis B, one was pregnant, one had a broken hand and one was
being served court papers, Evander Holyfield's camp was looking to
stage a fight in more tranquil and, hopefully, sterile
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thomas, Holyfield's attorney, huddled with promoter Don King
and Showtime executive Jay Larkin for nearly three hours Friday to
try to clean up the mess after the cancellation of Holyfield's WBA
and IBF heavyweight title defense against Henry Akinwande at
Madison Square Garden. Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis B
and, though the results of a retest won't be learned until Monday,
Larkin said, ``it's 99.9 percent likely to come back dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to project the incubation period for hepatitis
B, and Holyfield, who hasn't fought since beating Michael Moorer in
November, doesn't want to wait long for another bout. All parties
would prefer a unification bout against WBC champion Lennox Lewis.
But Lewis is likely to fight in September against Zeljko Mavrovic,
meaning Holyfield-Lewis could not take place before December and,
more likely, the spring.
</P>
<P>
   With Holyfield in need of an interim fight, and Akinwande's
status unknown, the current most probable scenario has the Atlanta
champion fighting in his hometown against IBF No. 1 contender
Vaughn Bean in August at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield desires to fight one last time in Atlanta before
retirement, have affordable tickets and possibly give some away to
youth groups. Thomas will open discussions soon with city and
sports officials and said the amount of financial support the fight
receives from businesses _ ticket guarantees, sponsorships, hotel
rooms, etc. _ will determine whether it comes off.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who was to earn $10 million for the Akinwande fight
and has made $62 million in his past three bouts, likely would have
to lower his financial demands in Atlanta, where the site fee would
not be as big as a casino town.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas said, ``I don't sense he would (accept a reduced
purse) in Las Vegas or Atlantic City or here (New York) but I sense
he would be willing to do it to support his community, if the
people want it. If the people don't want it, why do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Other than fighting the IBF mandatory against Bean, these are
Holyfield's options, assuming Akinwande's second test comes back
positive:
</P>
<P>
   _ Attempt to revive talks for a fall Lewis fight with cable
operators. But Lewis is under contract with HBO for one more bout
and therefore has exclusive rights to it. HBO, not enthused about
the Mavrovic bout, may raise its purse offers to Holyfield and
Lewis. But it's more likely Holyfield and Lewis will wait until the
HBO deal expires to set up a bidding war with Showtime. Holyfield
wants $20 million, Lewis $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ The WBA could try to force a mandatory against its highest
ranked available contender, unknown fourth-ranked Jade Scott.
(Akinwande is No. 1; Ray Mercer, who also tested positive for
hepatitis B, is No. 2; Mavrovic is No. 3.). But Thomas said, ``If
Akinwande can't fight, our position is we made every effort to
satisfy our obligations to the WBA. We're moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Holyfield could ignore mandates by the WBA and IBF at the risk
of being stripped to fight Lewis. But he has never ducked a
mandatory and wants to retire with all three belts.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a Bean fight at the Georgia Dome has the support of
King and Larkin, whose Garden card was being lampooned for weeks.
Officials claim 8,000 tickets were distributed. But it was learned
only 4,000 actually were sold for a total gate of $500,000, as of
early Friday _ well short of the $3 million MSG guaranteed to King.
</P>
<P>
   By cancelling the card, the Garden lost only $100,000. But King
had spent about $2 million in promotional costs and wasn't insured.
All parties vehemently deny suspicions that Akinwande's blood test
was doctored because of the sluggish sales.
</P>
<P>
   But this card seemed doomed. Not only did Mercer test positive,
his scheduled opponent, Atlanta's Marcellus Brown, suffered a
broken hand and was scratched. Maria Nieves-Garcia, the scheduled
opponent for Christy Martin, tested as being 21 weeks pregnant,
much to her amazement. Roberto Duran, also on the card, was sued
during the week for child support but planned to fight despite
possibly having his purse garnished by a Florida court. Holyfield,
who last fought in Atlanta in 1991 against Bert Cooper at the Omni,
hopes there is support for a fight. As he recently said, ``You may
not get to see the last fight in my career. But you'd be able to
see this fight.''

<P>
   Gingrich not following own advice, some say
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Sherman
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Newt Gingrich's public appearance last week
with President Clinton could have come straight from Gingrich's new
book, ``Lessons Learned the Hard Way.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ``personal report'' about mistakes he had made in his
first three years as speaker, Gingrich acknowledged he sometimes
underestimated Clinton's ability to bounce back from trouble. He
titled the chapter, ``Pick Your Fights Wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   So rather than pick a public fight on Social Security, in which
Democrats traditionally have had the upper hand, speaker and
president shared a stage to proclaim jointly their desire to make
the retirement system financially strong for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   But this example of Gingrich taking a chapter from his own book
is unusual and sharply contrasts with much of his behavior since
``Lessons Learned the Hard Way'' was published.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich lately has been much more confrontational than the
smiling, warmer and fuzzier speaker who graced the cover of his
book in jeans and leather jacket. In the space of two months,
Gingrich has attacked Clinton over allegations of illegal foreign
money in Democratic campaigns, slapped ``liberal'' and ``big
government'' tags on a tobacco bill that U.S. tobacco companies
hate, criticized Clinton administration foreign policy while in the
Middle East, initiated discussions about raising the pay of members
of Congress and backed off his support for a farm bill to provide
crop insurance to farmers because it also restored nutrition
benefits to legal immigrants who lost them in the 1996 welfare
reform legislation. The bill eventually passed after complaints
from farm state Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dallek, a historian who has written a review of the book,
said the speaker appears to have abandoned ``a posture of
moderation'' that included learning the value of ``no comment'' and
counseling compromise instead of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Dallek said, the onset of the 1998 campaign season
demands a more partisan and aggressive approach, particularly the
criticism of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a yachtsman, he'll tack in one direction and then
another,'' said Dallek, who recently completed work on ``Flawed
Giant,'' his second book on President Johnson. ``He may have
written the book, but he needs to reclaim his hard edge and the
conservative ground.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican critic, Arianna Huffington, was more pointed,
saying that Gingrich sharpened his tone in response to polls that
showed a depressed Republican base. ``There's a lack of
credibility,'' Huffington said. ``The book was one kind of attempt
to change his image and the change in tone was another kind of
attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ruskin, director of the watchdog group Congressional
Accountability Project, said Gingrich's closed-door discussion with
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt about a congressional pay raise
feeds Americans' cynicism about politics. Gingrich aides stress no
decision has been made to increase members' pay, now $136,700 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter titled ``Know the Difference Between Right and
Wrong,'' Gingrich wrote, ``The trustworthiness of our political
leaders goes through the heart of our political culture to the very
question of how much allegiance to their country can be demanded of
ordinary citizens. Cynicism is corrosive of everything that
Congress was meant to stand for and hence of our very democratic
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's supporters dismiss the criticism as misplaced.
Christina Martin, the speaker's press secretary, said Gingrich
refrained from personal attacks on Clinton, even though he likened
the administration to ``The Jerry Springer Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not get involved in innuendo,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the speaker simply restated U.S. law that the capital
of the country is Jerusalem and that the U.S. embassy should be
there.
</P>
<P>
   Editorials that suggested Gingrich follow his own advice,
contained in the chapter ``Learn to Keep You-- Mouth Shut,'' were
off the mark, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker is on his game, in charge and winning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blankley, Martin's predecessor and a contributor to George
magazine, said Gingrich's desire to curb his rhetorical excesses
does not mean he plans to remain silent on policy issues. His
maturation as speaker should not suggest he will cave in at every
turn, Blankley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an easy contrast here, with the cover jacket, but it
misreads both the book and Newt's political needs,'' Blankley said.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of last year's reprimand by the House for violating
ethics rules and a failed effort to depose him as speaker, Gingrich
purposely lowered his profile and sought about rehabilitating his
image, Blankley said.
</P>
<P>
   The effort largely worked and culminated in the book tour, if
his revived poll numbers mean anything. At the same time, ``Newt
saw what was needed, and he did it,'' Blankley said.

 &HT;    Ramsey case nears critical juncture
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While Colorado police are eager to have a grand jury
address the JonBenet Ramsey case, hoping it will force testimony
from those resistant to talk, at least one legal expert believes
the move probably will solve nothing and could end the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see (a grand jury) getting much from any suspect,''
said William Pizzi, a former federal prosecutor and a criminal law
professor at the University of Colorado Law School.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, should the process add nothing to the case, Pizzi
believes the grand jury may decide no charges are warranted. ``This
may be the last chapter,'' Pizzi said.
</P>
<P>
   Pizzi acknowledged that a grand jury proceeding can intensify
the probe. ``People have to testify under oath. It locks people
into their original stories,'' he said. ``There's a little more
pressure, a little more formality.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as people can refuse to talk to police, they can
decline to answer a prosecutor's questions before a grand jury if
they would be incriminating themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As police and prosecutors huddled last week to discuss a
possible grand jury action, Boulder, Colo., Detective Division
Comdr. Mark Beckner said he has ``an idea'' who killed the girl but
lacked the evidence to charge someone.
</P>
<P>
   Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter said he's leaning toward a
grand jury but may take a month to make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Ramsey family _ John and Patsy and son Burke, who
have settled down in Vinings, northwest of Atlanta _ must adjust to
life once again in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coping as best they can,'' said Peggy Ramsey, John
Ramsey's sister-in-law, who lives in metro Atlanta. ``For them it
has been a compounded tragedy. They've lost their daughter, but
they've also had to deal with all this garbage in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``What's on their mind is that whoever did this is
still out there walking the streets _ and it was no one in this
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Barnett Lough, who grew up with Patsy Ramsey in
Parkersburg, W.Va., said ``Life had been getting more normal for
them. They really wanted things to die down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lough, like Patsy Ramsey, a former Miss West Virginia, said
Patsy has been a stay-at-home mom pursuing the same kinds of
charities and volunteer work that engaged her before JonBenet's
death. She has also been spending much time with her son Burke,
volunteering at his school, the Lovett School in Atlanta. Lough
expects the heightened public interest in the case will upset the
family, though, ``They're pretty realistic. I don't think it's a
big surprise to them.'' JonBenet, 6, was found strangled and beaten
in her Boulder home, hours after her mother found a ransom note the
day after Christmas 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say they'd like to question, among others,
JonBenet's parents, who stopped talking to police 13 months ago, as
well as her 11-year-old brother, Burke, whose lawyer cut ties with
police in February. As the number of suspects has narrowed, the
Ramsey parents remain under an ``umbrella of suspicion,'' police
said. But the parents insist they are innocent.

ROSEY REMEMBERS RFK'S FINAL DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Rosey Grier heard gun shots ring out and horrified shrieks,
and he knew instinctively that the joyful evening had turned tragic
and that someone had shot Sen. Robert Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   He had been in another part of the Ambassador Hotel, but he
immediately charged through the milling crowd toward the kitchen
where he saw Kennedy lying in pool of blood on the floor and saw an
enraged mob angrily attacking the assassin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to kill him,'' says Grier, recalling the
reaction several spectators had in the immediate aftermath of the
eight shots that came out of a .22 caliber pistol held by a
24-year-old Jordanian immigrant named Sirhan Bishara Sirhan that
would take the life of Kennedy and would wound four bystanders.
``All I remember thinking was, `I've got to save this man. If I
allow him to die, then we're no better than he is.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rosey Grier still was a professional football player at the
time, a 6-foot-5, 300-pound defensive tackle for the Los Angeles
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   But he says he never faced greater resistance in his 14 seasons
on the gridiron than he did the next few tense minutes on that
early June 6, 1968, morning in Los Angeles when he and Rafer
Johnson and a couple of Kennedy aides fought to keep Sirhan from
being fatally mauled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an unbelievable scene,'' says Grier. ``People were
grappling with Sirhan, and just pounding him. I grabbed him by his
legs with one arm, and threw punches at people to keep them away
with the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got really ugly. People kept shouting, `Let's kill him!
Let's kill him!' I finally was able to wrap my arms around Sirhan
himself, and then just kept fighting people off until the police
came.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember losing my voice that night because I kept screaming
for help. I also remember crying a lot that night. The crying still
hasn't stopped in me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 30 years ago that the lives of Rosey Grier and Robert
Kennedy would intersect at such a tragically historic juncture.
</P>
<P>
   Grier had no idea when he agreed to give his support to Kennedy
for the Democratic presidential nomination that it would result in
his being present at one of this country's most notorious political
assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the final things Bobby Kennedy ever said was, `Rosey
Grier said he'd take care of anybody who didn't vote for me,'''
says Grier, referring to the speech Kennedy gave to campaign
workers at the Embassy Room in the Ambassador after scoring a
stirring California primary victory over Sen. Eugene McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then a few minutes later he would be gone. That was a
horrible night for all of America and for the world. What we lost
that night was an idea. What we lost was a man who could have taken
us all to another level. What we lost was a man who could have been
a unifying symbol at a time when our nation was being torn apart by
the Vietnam War and racial tension. It was a huge loss for our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosey Grier would go on after his NFL career had ended to do his
TV variety shows and acting and needle-pointing and singing and
preaching, but it would be a long time before he was over the deep
sorrow he felt about the death of Robert Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me about 12 years to work through it,'' says Grier.
``I felt for a long time that I had let the Kennedy family down,
that I had been there to protect Bobby Kennedy and simply hadn't
done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it was my job that night to watch out for Bobby,
along with his personal security guard, Bill Barry. The original
plan for Bobby that night was to go out the front way, and we all
were going to go to a nightclub in Beverly Hills called The Factory
to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing off to the side when they rushed Bobby off the
stage, and into the kitchen. I heard later a maitre'd had
recommended they exit that way because it was faster. Before I knew
what happened, I heard the gun shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosey Grier had met Robert Kennedy a year earlier when he had
been invited to a Washington D.C. fund-raiser by Ethel Kennedy, the
senator's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that Bobby Kennedy had stood up for Martin Luther King
when it wasn't popular to do so and I knew the Kennedys had done a
lot to help in the inner cities,'' says Grier. ``I hated flying,
but I flew back to D.C. and hit it off with Bobby immediately. We'd
laugh together and he was always punching me in a lighthearted
manner. We just connected immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier has remained close to the Kennedy family over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime they've wanted anything, I'm there for them,'' he
says. ``I'll always make myself available to them. I always think
how things could have been so different in this country had Bobby
Kennedy lived. I think he would have been successful in leading us
through the change we desperately needed at the time, change we
still need. We all have to get together to make positive changes in
this country. This is no time to sit on the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier, 65, these days works for Michael Milken's prostate
foundation when he isn't performing his non-denominational
ministerial duties at weddings, funerals and other occasions.
</P>
<P>
   His last public exposure came during O.J. Simpson's murder trial
when he was seen visiting Simpson at the L.A. County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just basically wanted to help O.J. find an answer to his
life,'' says Grier, who saw Simpson throughout his one-year
incarceration. ``Robert Shapiro kept reminding me, `Remember why
you came, Rosie.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt O.J.'s life was on the line, and he needed help. He was
dealing with a problem he couldn't solve, but I felt maybe God
could solve it for him. I read him passages from the Bible, and
shared with him the thoughts I had. We never talked about what
happened to his wife or to the other person he was accused of
murdering.''
</P>
<P>
   Still an imposing 300 pounds, Rosey Grier and his wife, Margie,
reside in Brentwood. They have two children, Rosey Jr., 26, and
Sheryl, 43.
</P>
<P>
   Rosey Grier is such a God-fearing man that he doesn't even seem
to hold any bitter feelings toward Sirhan, who has been attempting
to get out of prison in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think Sirhan should be paroled?'' Grier is asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sirhan should be treated like any other person in the
prison system,'' he says. ``I don't think his rights should be
politicized. It's up to the court system to decide what happens to
Sirhan. It's up to them to deal with those kinds of things. That's
why we have a court system.''
</P>
<P>

killed by Sirhan.

be different today had he lived. Things would have been better.''

   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Attorney General Scott Harshbarger
consolidated his status as the Democrats' front running
gubernatorial candidate when he very narrowly won the party's
convention endorsement Saturday with a first ballot victory over
two opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, who had come to the convention the heavy favorite
to win the contest, squeaked to victory by two votes out of 3,898
cast. He received 50.05 percent of the vote _ just barely the
majority necessary to win the endosement on the first ballot, but
ahead of former Senator Patricia McGovern who received 31.35
percent of the vote. Former US Representative Brian J. Donn

 &HT;    Defending champion and star Ronaldo land in France with high
hopes
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest World Cup of all starts Wednesday. Expanded to 32
teams, the 1998 Cup in France will be cashing in on nearly $500
million in rights fees and watched by more than a billion people
worldwide through the July 12 final.
</P>
<P>
   But biggest might not necessarily mean best.
</P>
<P>
   Since Air France pilots went on strike this week, teams, fans
and journalists descending on France have been greeted by a
logistics disaster. Threatened strikes by other transportation
workers loom, as the planet's largest sporting event returns to
France for the first time in 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   A severe ticket crunch has simmered for months in Europe, where
the French organizing committee's policy of earmarking 65 percent
of tickets for its own citizens has been criticized. In its first
major World Cup plunge, Nike will plaster its swoosh on the jerseys
of Brazil, Nigeria, Italy, the Netherlands and the United States.
And Disney's trio of ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 will devote 230 hours of
television coverage _ more than double the output four years ago _
to a nation supposedly uninterested in soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling the heaviest burden are the players and coaches of the
32 teams, eight more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer-obsessed Brazil, is rightly worried about a rash of bad
outings, including an unforgiveable loss to the U.S. in February.
</P>
<P>
   The four-time champions are favorites to repeat for the first
time since Pele made his mark for Brazil in 1958 and 1962. But head
coach Mario Zagallo acknowledged that his team has been playing
defensively as a result of extremely high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather win playing ugly soccer than lose playing
attractive soccer,'' said Zagallo, a party to all four previous
crowns, as a player and coach. ``Everyone wants to win and I'm no
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has the man tapped to be the game's next great star.
Ronaldo, a 21-year-old striker who rode the bench in 1994, has
scored more than 60 goals in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria features a number of stars from its 1996 Olympic
gold-medal squad, but the ``Super Eagles'' must survive a rugged
Group D with Spain, Paraguay and Bulgaria. For the first time in 20
years, Argentina will not have Diego Maradona, whose last World Cup
moment was leaving Dallas in 1994 after failing a drug test. Europe
offers the usual suspects _ Germany, England, Italy, France, Spain
and the Netherlands _ among the favorites. The U.S. has improved
since 1994 but might not get out of group play, now that advancing
teams must finish first or second. The Americans kick off with
formidable Germany on June 15 and later play powerful Yugoslavia
and unheralded, but extremely motivated Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. has gone scoreless in two of its last four friendlies
and has been battling injuries to key players. ``In 1994, we played
not to lose. Now, we intend to win,'' U.S. coach Steve Sampson
said. ``Our goal is to get to the second round.''

 &HT;    Like clockwork, time has come for Dutchmen
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brazil has the best players. Germany is the most disciplined. No
team will play harder than England. Italy is a nice blend of
seasoning and skill.
</P>
<P>
   As host nation, France has a disproportionate edge. Argentina
seems positioned to slipstream behind the big Brazilian hype. The
time may be right for an African team to win, and Nigeria is the
class of the continent. A slew of insiders are on record as liking
Yugoslavia's chances.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons why any of the above could win the World Cup.
Here are reasons they won't:
</P>
<P>
   Brazil will be missing Romario, who was cut from the '98 team
because of a calf injury and whose absence will leave the great
Ronaldo alone up front. Germany is so strapped for a sweeper, the
key defender in its precise system, that it has pressed the
37-year-old Lothar Matthaeus into service. England goes to France
with two off-form strikers and could be consumed by the furor over
Paul Gascoigne's omission from the squad. Italy goes without Angelo
Peruzzi, its first-choice goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   France is sublime in midfield but lacks a target man. Argentina
will chafe under the handling of Daniel Passarella, its rigid
coach. Nigeria seems a better bet to lose in the semis than to take
the FIFA Trophy. Yugoslavia will go only as far as striker Predrag
Mijatovic can carry it.
</P>
<P>
   So who's that leave?
</P>
<P>
   Holland.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands once seemed the next dominant footballing
country. Dubbed The Clockwork Orange, the Dutch had splendid
players and a progressive system. They were unlucky to lose the
World Cup finals to host nations in both 1974 and '78. But after
that, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Holland's team came to mirror its free-thinking society. The
famed Ruud Gullit grew so weary with the internal bickering that he
finally refused to play for his country. Edgar Davids, a combative
midfielder, was sent home from the '96 European championships after
a disgreement with the coach. Dutchmen would play vital roles on
the best club teams _ Amsterdam's Ajax, Italy's AC Milan, England's
Arsenal _ but somehow the national side became much less than the
sum of its high-priced parts.
</P>
<P>
   This is the summer Holland puts things right. The Dutch are made
up of accomplished footballers in the full flower of their career.
Striker Dennis Bergkamp and winger Marc Overmars led Arsenal to a
rousing English double _ the Premier League title and the FA Cup.
Clarence Seedorf was the midfield engine in Real Madrid's upset of
Juventus in the Champions League final.
</P>
<P>
   Davids, back in the Dutch fold, has been terrific for Juventus.
Manchester United just paid $17 million to buy Jaap Stam, a
world-record fee for a defender, from PSV Eindhoven. Edwin Van der
Sar is ready to claim the mantle of world's best keeper from
Denmark's Peter Schmeichel.
</P>
<P>
   There's a chance Bergkamp will miss the opener against Belgium
with a nagging hamstring pull, but that shouldn't derail the Dutch.
They're in the softest of the eight groups and could advance to
Round 2 working at half-capacity. By then, Bergkamp should be fine.
As Mexico '86 was Maradona's World Cup and USA '94 was Romario's,
France '98 will belong to Bergkamp.

 &HT;    WORLD CUP CAPSULES
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROUP A:
</P>
<P>
   Brazil
</P>
<P>
   Morocco
</P>
<P>
   Norway
</P>
<P>
   Scotland
</P>
<P>
   _ Top players: Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Roberto Carlos of Brazil;
Noureddine Naybet of Morocco; Tore Andre Flo and Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer of Norway; Kevin Gallacher and Colin Hendry of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Despite losing Romario to injury, defending champion
Brazil has more than enough talent to dominate this group. Ronaldo,
21, the world player of the year the last two years, will make his
World Cup debut. Carlos is a free-kick expert with his left foot,
but Brazil has holes in its midfield and defense. Scotland promises
a tough battle in the opener, but only Gallacher is a proven
scorer. The Scots have a chance to get out of group play, something
they've never done. Norway isn't fancy but beat Brazil last year
and has been making strides with players based in England. Morocco
is a nonfactor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prediction: Brazil and Norway to advance.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP B
</P>
<P>
   Austria
</P>
<P>
   Cameroon
</P>
<P>
   Chile
</P>
<P>
   Italy
</P>
<P>
   _ Top players: Alessandro Del Piero, Demetrio Albertini and
Paolo Maldini of Italy; Marcelo Salas of Chile; Anton Polster of
Austria; Ribobert Song of Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Italians stumbled through qualifying and lost to
Sweden last week. Del Piero, a dazzling scorer for Juventus, has
been nursing a sore hamstring but is expected back, along with 1994
star Roberto Baggio, whose missed penalty kick in the Rose Bowl
helped cost Italy the title. Veteran keeper Gianluca Pagliuca is
back in the nets with an injury to Angelo Peruzzi. Chile could
challenge if strikers Salas and Ivan Zamorano get hot. Austria is
aging and injured but won't be easy. For Cameroon, forward
Marc-Vivien Foe is injured, and a coaching change has rattled
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prediction: Italy and Chile to advance.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP C
</P>
<P>
   Denmark
</P>
<P>
   France
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia
</P>
<P>
   South Africa
</P>
<P>
   _ Top players: Zinedine Zidane, Didier Deschamps and Youri
Djorkaeff of France; Peter Schmeichel and Michael and Brian Laudrup
of Denmark; Saeed al-Owairan of Saudi Arabia; Benni McCarthy of
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The hosts have never won the World Cup and have never
had a better chance. Zidane and Djorkaeff are perhaps the most
talented pair of creators in the tournament, but they're working
with untested forwards. Denmark has a veteran roster. Shmeichel,
36, is still going strong with England's Manchester United. Saudi
Arabia can score and is coached by Carlos Alberto Parreira, who led
Brazil to the top in 1994. South Africa's first World Cup probably
will be short-lived, although McCarthy is exciting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prediction: France and Denmark to advance.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP D
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay
</P>
<P>
   Spain
</P>
<P>
   _ Top players: Raul, Fernando Hierro and Luis Enrique of Spain;
Hristo Stoichkov and Emil Kostadinov of Bulgaria; Jose Luis
Chilavert of Paraguay; Victor Ikpeba, Sunday Oliseh and Nwankwo
Kanu of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: D is for death, as in Group of Death. This draw will
be brutal. Spain's enormous talent has never materialized at the
World Cup, but hard-driving coach Javier Clemente can change that.
Raul is just 20 but already a star for European champ Real Madrid,
as is defender Hierro. Nigeria may have the most talent of anyone
except Brazil, but harnessing it has been a chore. Former U.S.
coach Bora Milutinovic has been on board since February with no
noticeable improvement. Bulgaria was a surprise semifinalist in
1994 and could be tough, but its core players are well into their
30s and don't have much speed. Keeper Chilavert is a dynamic
presence, but Paraguay might not be able to bridge the talent gap
in this group.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prediction: Spain and Nigeria to advance.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP E
</P>
<P>
   Belgium
</P>
<P>
   Mexico
</P>
<P>
   Netherlands
</P>
<P>
   South Korea
</P>
<P>
   _ Top players: Dennis Bergkamp, Clarence Seedorf and Edwin van
der Sar of The Netherlands; Marc Wilmots and Luc Nilis of Belgium;
Luis Hernandez and Claudio Suarez of Mexico; Choi Yong-soo of South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Mexico has fallen dangerously in the last year and
might not survive the round robin. Coach Manuel Lapuente, who came
on after qualifying, mysteriously dropped prolific scorer Carlos
Hermosillo.suffered some disastrous results. The Dutch may have
their best outfit since Johan Cruyff led them to the finals in 1974
and 1978, but infighting has been legion ever since. Bergkamp is
coming off a terrific season for English double champions Arsenal.
Belgium is respectable, and given Mexico's present state, may edge
through. South Korea has been the best Asian team for several years
but never has advanced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prediction: The Netherlands and Belgium to advance.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP F
</P>
<P>
   Germany
</P>
<P>
   Iran
</P>
<P>
   United States
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia
</P>
<P>
   _ Top players: Oliver Bierhoff and Andreas Moller of Germany;
Predrag Mijatovic and Dejan Savicevic of Yugoslavia; Kasey Keller
and Claudio Reyna of the U.S.; Khodadad Azizi of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Germans are aging, injured and usually start
slowly. But they come up big in the World Cup and will be seeking
redemption for a disappointing quarterfinal finish in 1994.
Bierhoff had a superb season in Italy and Moller is a crafty
playmaker. The U.S. is sending its best team ever, but a lack of
goals is a concern. Striker Eric Wynalda's recovery from a knee
injury is slowly progressing. The U.S. has an outside chance to
advance but must get points in all three matches. Yugoslavia
returns following UN sanctions in 1994 with Mijatovic, who scored
the winning goal for Real Madrid in the European Cup final. Iran
has three veterans of the German leagues.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prediction: Germany and Yugoslavia to advance.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP G
</P>
<P>
   Colombia
</P>
<P>
   England
</P>
<P>
   Romania
</P>
<P>
   Tunisia
</P>
<P>
   _ Top players: Carlos Valderrama and Faustino Asprilla of
Colombia; Alan Shearer, Paul Ince and David Seaman of England;
Gheorge Hagi and Gheorge Popescu of Romania; Adel Sellimi of
Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: England's confident stride after qualifying has
turned into full-fledged anxiety, especially with the dismissal of
1990 veteran Paul Gascoigne. Shearer has been injured most of the
year, and it could fall upon 18-year-old Michael Owen to give him a
boost up front. Colombia has changed little from the disastrous
1994 squad that suffered a first-round exit and the tragic murder
of defender Andres Escobar, who scored an own goal in a loss to the
U.S. Carlos Valderrama is still dangerous as a creator. Romania
lacks speed, stamina and consistency. Tunisia will be fortunate to
get even a tie.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prediction: England and Romania to advance.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP H
</P>
<P>
   Argentina
</P>
<P>
   Croatia
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica
</P>
<P>
   Japan
</P>
<P>
   _ Top players: Gabriel Batistuta, Ariel Ortega and Hernan Crespo
of Argentina; Davor Suker and Robert Prosinecki of Croatia; Deon
Burton and Frank Sinclair of Jamaica; Hidetoshi Nakata of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Argentina's first World Cup appearance in 20 years
without Diego Maradona may be a golden one. Despite the despotic
tactics of coach Daniel Passarella, Argentina is coming on strong
and recently beat Brazil in Rio. Leading goal-scorer Batistuta has
taken a back seat to the tandem of Crespo and Claudio Lopez.
Croatia's first World Cup also could be special, especially if
Suker is productive. A knee injury to Alen Boksic, his partner at
forward, is a major loss. Jamaica and Japan will soak up the flavor
of the World Cup for the first time but aren't expected to
accomplish much.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prediction: Argentina and Croatia to advance.

 &HT;    A new world for citizen Regis
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ David Regis describes the accelerated process to
become an American citizen as something ``that fell out of the
sky.'' His in-laws, Johnny and Danetta Fogle of Decatur, Ga.,
regard it as a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when it means being able to see more of their
precious granddaughter, Ella Camille, born 15 months ago to David
and his wife, Nikki.
</P>
<P>
   And for the United States World Cup team, Regis already has
proved to be well worth the painstaking effort to put him in the
red, white and blue uniform of Uncle Sam _ and Nike. The native of
Martinique, who moved to France at age 12, has played every minute
of the last two
</P>
<P>
   warmup matches for the Americans, who open against Germany next
Monday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Regis (pronounced ray-jee), sworn in as a citizen on May 20, is
certain to start as a defender, using his deft left foot, solid
marking skills and strong ability to head balls on set pieces. That
he will be playing in, but not for, the country he once called home
is why his six-month odyssey began in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   And why the Fogles will watch the World Cup for the first time
in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the first thing about soccer until David came
along,'' said Danetta Fogle, proudly holding the official game ball
given to Regis and signed by his teammates after he made his U.S.
national team debut on May 24. ``Once he explained the rules to me,
it's been so much easier to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   David and Nikki Regis were neighbors who met over a baguette and
coffee in 1994 in Strasbourg, France, where she had chosen to study
abroad to complete requirements for a degree in French. He was
playing for Racing Club de Strasbourg, trying to make it up the
French first-division ladder and hoping to get noticed by the
national team coaching hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a dream to be able to play for your country, but
that never happened with France,'' said Regis, who speaks only a
few words of English while Nikki translates for him. ``Unless you
play for a big team, it's hard to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, he had options, thanks to his marriage to Nikki in 1995
in Atlanta, where Danetta Fogle is the director of Christian
education.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Regis through the maze of immigration bureaucracy is old
hat for the U.S. Soccer Federation. Despite a newly launched
program to develop more elite-level, native-born players, American
soccer authorities also want to maintain respectability gained from
a second-round finish in the 1994 World Cup. Seven players on the
current 22-man roster were brought up in another country, including
forwards Roy Wegerle and Preki Radosalvjevic, both of whom received
hastened citizenship because of their marriages to American women.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for another partial American, David Wagner, whose
father is a U.S. military officer in Germany, heard of Regis'
potential eligiblity and promptly notified U.S. head coach Steve
Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about a defense that showed major cracks during World
Cup qualifying, Sampson flew over in December and saw Regis play
for the first time for his current club team in Karlsruhe, Germany,
across the Rhine River from Strasbourg. When Sampson told Regis in
April that he wanted to bring him on board, David and Nikki began
their whirlwind experience, which often became a maddening one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' Nikki said with a sigh and a smile. ``It
was a very tedious process. It's not as simple as snapping your
fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. certainly isn't alone in looking for loopholes. Seven
of Jamaica's ``Reggae Boyz'' have spent most or all of their lives
in England. Tunisia and Japan each will be starting players born
and raised in Brazil. FIFA, the international soccer governing
body, simply abides by the respective immigration laws of its
member nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American is an American is an American,'' Sampson said in
regard to Regis, who was invited to training camp last month before
it was certain he would be able to play. ``This is a country of
immigrants, and David is doing nothing different than other
newcomers have done for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but his case was on a faster track than most. U.S.
immigration law allows the foreign spouses of Americans to become
citizens if they have been married for three years, or if their
husband or wife works abroad. Nikki hadn't been working since
becoming a mother. Their third anniversary, coincidentally enough,
falls on Wednesday, the opening day of the World Cup. The
federation lined up a job for her with its travel agency with the
intention of her being a France-based employee beyond this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We applied like everybody else to get a green card for
David,'' she said. ``The federation simply helped us through the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some close calls. The Federal Bureau of Investigation
lost Regis' fingerprints, and he had to interrupt training in San
Diego to have another set made in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Studying for the citizenship exam wasn't easy, given the
language barrier. His teammates studied with him, although none
speaks French fluently. But when Regis had to write a sentence in
English _ ``Today is a nice day'' _ he aced it, and answered all 10
questions correctly. ``I think I know more U.S. history than a lot
of Americans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates welcomed him with open arms, singing ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' to him before he dressed out for his first
game against Kuwait. The song brought a tear to his eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised that the players were so open to me,''
Regis said. ``In Europe, every man is out for himself, it's more
dog-eat-dog. It was a new experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   So will the larger task of becoming an American in the cultural
sense. That may be complicated because he is looking for a new pro
team in Europe, where he intends to complete his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibility for all of that lies with me, and I want to
do that very much,'' Regis said. ``It will take time, but once I
Iearn more about the language and spend as much time over here as I
can, the easier it will become.''

 &HT;    Johnson still Seattle's as trade waxes, wanes
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First, the Seattle Mariners say they're going to trade
Randy Johnson. Then they're not. Then they are again. And then
they're not. The latest comes from team president Chuck Armstrong,
who issued a statement saying that Johnson will remain with the
club for the rest of the season. Armstrong added, ``We have no
plans to trade Randy Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real reason that Johnson hasn't been traded is because
other clubs haven't offered enough. It was reported last week that
the Dodgers offered right-handed pitcher Ismael Valdes and
infielder Wilton Guerrero. But when the smoke cleared, the Dodgers
actually had gotten cold feet on losing Valdes and offered Hideo
Nomo instead.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle thinks it's too early in the season not to get a lot for
Johnson, who last year was the most dominating pitcher in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   They have to trade him, however. Johnson becomes a free agent
after the season, and he has no plans to return. The Mariners are
still in the division race, so far, at 9 1/2 games out of first and
eight games out of a wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   It would be folly not to get something good for one of the best
pitchers in the game. The Marlins, for example, got three good
prospects when they traded Mike Piazza to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Johnson has not had a good season, compiling
a 5-4 record with a 5.58 ERA. But many baseball people think he is
upset with the club and has had trouble focusing.
</P>
<P>
   When the rumors began that Johnson was close to being traded, he
won two starts in a row, allowing three runs and 10 hits in 17
innings and striking out 25. Then, after Armstrong said Johnson
would remain in Seattle for the rest of the year, the ``Big Unit''
went out Wednesday and got beat 8-1 by the Angels, allowing six
runs in 6 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts representing more than 20 clubs were in Seattle to watch
him pitch Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing trade could be with the Yankees. The
Mariners would like to get New York right-hander Ramiro Mendoza and
prospects Ricky Ledee and Mike Lowell. But New York thinks the
price is too high. The Padres continue to call, because they don't
want to see the Dodgers get Johnson and would be glad to send
pitcher Joey Hamilton to Seattle. The Orioles also are interested,
which could lead to a Johnson-for-Armando Benitez swap. Both
players could use a change of scenery.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson isn't saying much these days. He continues to mope and
appears unapproachable to teammates and reporters. He said after
Wednesday's game that he is not going to talk to the press anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize the media has a job to do,'' he said. ``I hope
everyone understands. I'm tired of being a story every day. I'm
tired of talking about what has happened around me.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has become a huge distraction in the clubhouse, but his
teammates say otherwise publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he want to stay?'' asked shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who
didn't answer his own question. ``He's such a great competitor, the
best pitcher in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. At least not right now.

 &HT;    Inside Pro Football: Youth movement on hold as Falcons opt for
veterans
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the day he was hired as the Atlanta Falcons
football czar, Dan Reeves talked about the need to rebuild the
moribund franchise with younger players. And there likely will be a
day when the kids he has brought aboard _ cornerback Michael
Booker, linebackers Keith Brooking and Henri Crockett, tailback
Byron Hanspard, tight end O.J. Santiago and others _ will be the
foundation, and not the foundlings, in Suwanee.
</P>
<P>
   Nurturing young players takes time, though, and after 17 months
a certain pragmatism has settled in on Reeves and staff. There is
no better example of what should be dubbed ''Dan's Dilemma'' than
last week's deal for San Diego wide receiver Tony Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Simply defined, it is this: With a dwindling fan base, and
facing a red-ink bath for the second straight season, the Falcons
need to win games now or become a speck on the local sports
landscape. And at any level of the game, enthusiasm can't often
overcome inexperience, a fact that will stunt any well-intentioned
youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all his rationalizations, Reeves is savvy enough to know
third-rounder Jammi German, who hasn't been on a field since 1995,
isn't apt to quickly assimilate nuances like blitz adjustments. So
to replace Bert Emanuel the club paid a lofty price, at least two
rounds higher than some Chargers coaches felt Martin would fetch.
It is simply the latest example that a move toward youth usually is
a painstaking process. In the era of the salary cap, where NFL
teams pay dearly for veteran mistakes, turning over a roster in
wholesale doses is an impossible task.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Martin, who turns 33 the day before the regular
season begins, actually continues an offseason trend most observers
failed to discern. The nine veterans added by Atlanta this spring
average 30.5 years of age and 8.0 seasons of experience. Of the key
additions, only free agent Corey Louchiey, 26, has fewer than six
years in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   And since he couldn't fend off a challenge from a player no more
talented than Jerry Ostroski to retain his starter's job in Buffalo
last year, there's no guarantee Louchiey will be an upgrade over
Matt Willig.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other additions, free safety Eugene Robinson, who
bumped a player 10 years his junior (Devin Bush) to the bench, is
35 and will team with 32-year-old William White in the interior
secondary. Backup QB Mark Rypien is 35. Dave Widell and Matt
Elliott, acquired to add depth to the offensive line, are 33 and
29, respectively, and Elliott reportedly failed at least one
physical at a club he visited. Defensive tackle Esera Tuaolo is 30.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the infusion of draft choices and presence of standout
young veterans like offensive tackle Bob Whitfield, tailback Jamal
Anderson, cornerback Ray Buchanan and defensive tackle Travis Hall,
the projected starters for '98 average 28.6 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a redeeming feature to the graying of the Falcons,
it's that general manager Harold Richardson has done a good job of
keeping the financial investment in the new players low, and only
Martin is signed for more than two years. As temporary as some of
the players may be in Suwanee, however, they are still quick-fix
types. All the good intentions aside, a youth movement is called a
``movement'' because it is a process which takes time and patience.
After 32 seasons of mostly-miserable football, fans here aren't
likely to afford the Falcons much more of either commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling the dice
</P>
<P>
   His age notwithstanding, Martin was a productive player for the
Chargers and his exit leaves the team with a dubious wideout group.
Three of the top five players at the position _ veterans Webster
Slaughter and former Falcons backup Tyrone Brown, along with '98
second-rounder Mikhael Ricks _ weren't in the NFL in 1997.
Incumbents Bryan Still and Charlie Jones combined for one touchdown
last season. So why a trade? Age was one factor. Although he's a
solid citizen, Martin's sour relationship with coach Kevin Gilbride
was another. But general manager Bobby Beathard felt the club
couldn't afford to have a frustrated Martin around again this year.
At the end of 1997, Martin privately apologized to Beathard for
``losing (his) focus'' at times during a quarterback carousel that
included Stan Humphries, Jim Everett, Craig Whelihan and Casey
Weldon. Of the 83 pass attempts to Martin he didn't catch last
year, he had just four drops, but 44 were labeled ``poor throws.''
And while the Chargers drafted Ryan Leaf, it's Whelian, 0-7 as a
starter last year, who figures to open this season No. 1 on the
depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Limping Lloyd
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh brass won't admit it, but it seems just a matter of
time until the Steelers give up on linebacker Greg Lloyd. The
former league defensive MVP limped through the mini-camp last week
and his right calf was noticeably atrophied from the severe staph
infection he suffered last November. Coach Bill Cowher conceded
Lloyd's recovery was ``taking a lot longer'' than anticipated.
Despite releasing corner Donnell Woolford, the team still needs
salary cap room to sign draft choices. Lloyd, who could be replaced
at the weakside spot by converted defensive end Mike Vrabel, is to
earn $2.8 million. ... As expected, Carnell Lake worked primarily
at cornerback in mini-camp and onetime Georgia Tech standout Lethon
Flowers lined up at strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   Change in the wind?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Modrak, the new director of football operations in
Philadelphia, wasn't pleased last week when starting tailback
Charlie Garner and No. 2 quarterback Rodney Peete missed the first
day of mini-camp. Modrak is finding out fast that not every
franchise runs as smoothly as the Steelers. He's still interested
in running back Raymont Harris, but Green Bay GM Ron Wolf might
beat him to the former Bears 1,000-yard rusher. He is still
rehabbing a broken leg, but Harris looked good in a Thursday
workout in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego might use a second-round pick to take Oklahoma State
defensive tackle Jamal Williams in the July 9 supplemental draft.
Some scouts feel Williams is as good as the late Leon Bender, taken
in the second round this year by the Raiders. ... Former Auburn
safety Martavius Houston hasn't applied for the supplemental draft
yet but is expected to, along with a top-notch offensive tackle
prospect. ... Colts president Bill Polian doesn't expect a deal
before July, but his first session with Tom Condon, the agent for
Peyton Manning, went far better than expected.

SETTING YOUR SIGHTS ON WORLD CUP SITES

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Got a few days?
</P>
<P>
   That's how long it's going to take to sort through sites
dedicated to the World Cup soccer championships, which start
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The logical starting point is the official site, France 98:
Coupe De Monde (www.france98.com). If it's been a while since those
confusing days in French language class in high school or college,
choose English and go to town.
</P>
<P>
   The framed site has the basics, including history of the World
Cup, news updates, venue information and rosters. It's definitely
official.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA, the official organizing committee for the World Cup, has
detailed World Cup information at its official site (www.fifa.com).
</P>
<P>
   After these official sites, the list of soccer sites is strictly
a fan's preference. Most have rosters, schedules, image galleries,
polls and chat rooms. Many are multilingual.
</P>
<P>
   All of the big-media sites plan extensive coverage. CBS
SportsLine might have the advantage with its affiliation with
Soccernet, regarded as the world's best soccer site.
</P>
<P>
   Kgoal! (www.kgoal.net) promises a free service that allows
soccer fans with Internet access to be informed in real-time _
either in French, Spanish, English or Italian _ about all goals
made during the Cup's 64 games. Every time a goal is scored, an
E-mail is sent to each Kgoal! subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   And for something completely different, access the British
Broadcasting Corp. coverage (www.bbc.co.uk). Included in its vast
features is a debate about and message link to Paul ``Gazza''
Gascoigne, who was kicked off the English team after being found
drunk in a Spanish hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   The tip here is to access your favorite search engine and type
in ``World Cup.'' Don't expect to move from your seat for a while. &QL; 
REVIEW &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose Cooperstown Countdown (www.scrollsaw.com/peterose)
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Reds fan Ben Jones of Vandalia, Ohio, thought his
campaign to have Pete Rose considered for the Baseball Hall of Fame
was over.
</P>
<P>
   In September, when he heard that Rose was on the verge of
reinstatement, Jones had his site taken down. Then he read that
acting commissioner Bud Selig might not review Rose's request for
reinstatement after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If baseball refuses to reinstate Pete, then I decided to
reinstate the Pete Rose Cooperstown Countdown,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones rushed his site back online in late April. It features an
online poll on whether to put Rose in the Hall of Fame or keep him
in the ``Hall of Shame.''
</P>
<P>
   From nearly 27,000 respondents, sentiment is running 12-to-1 to
allow Rose, who was suspended for his ties to gambling, in the Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Jones doesn't know Rose personally, so he can't vouch for his
character. But Jones said he knows baseball talent and there
``never has been any better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones site doesn't have much depth _ the statistics and
background on Rose were on his previous site. But he is passionate
about this cause.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: (out of five stars). &QL; 
BYTES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NBA.cam on NBA.com: It's kind of like ``The Truman Show'', but
we're not peering in on Jim Carrey; it's the NBA Finals.

   For the finals, NBA.com is showing off its NBA.cam, a robotic
camera developed by Chicago-based Perceptual Robotics that fans can
activate through their Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   In another melding of television and the Internet, it's a way to

ANTIQUE FISHING TACKLE IS DRAWING MORE COLLECTORS, DRIVING PRICES
UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By BOB HOOD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of fishing tackle may be on the rise, but if you want
artificial lures worth big bucks, find some that have rusted hooks
and painted bodies that have faded, especially ones in yellowed
boxes with jagged corners.
</P>
<P>
   Some antique lures are worth 20 times more than their original
prices and 10 times more than modern lures. And, if you are lucky,
one old lure could be worth $1,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Antique fishing tackle collectors say prices for old lures, rods
and reels are climbing as more collectors become involved, but most
collectors are quick to tell anyone who thinks they may have a
valuable old piece of tackle to not get their hopes too high.
</P>
<P>
   Most antique lures, even many made as far back as the 1920s and
1930s, aren't worth more than $10 to $20, but rare ones can go for
$50 to $100, especially in an original box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always caution anyone interested in buying an antique lure
to be very careful for what he pays for it,'' said Jeff Winters, a
collector who specializes in Heddon and Creek Chub lures. ``I've
seen a lot of lures priced at $45 to $75 which actually aren't
worth more than $10 or $20, and some aren't even worth more than $5
to $10. But, you should always be on the lookout for those rare
exceptions like the Heddon Punkinseed that sold at Lang's in Maine
a few months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heddon Rainbow Punkinseed was auctioned at Lang's for
$1,320, and a Yellow Musky Rush Tango sold for $1,265.
</P>
<P>
   When searching for rare lures, finding ones that weren't made in
large numbers or have color patterns that weren't highly
distributed is as important as finding ones that date to the turn
of the century or before, collectors say.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting antique lures and other fishing tackle also can be a
rewarding learning experience, both about fishing and about the
people who invented lures. In many cases, a company or person's
name is synonymous with a collectible antique lure, and learning
those names is important for people who are serious about becoming
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, not many people have heard of Bucktail Worden. F.G.
``Bucktail'' Worden founded the South Bend Bait Company in about
1912 and got his nickname after inventing the first bucktail
treble-hook teaser on an artificial lure. Hair and fiber-covered
treble hooks still are popular today.
</P>
<P>
   Some lures were designed after careful planning. Others,
including many of the rarest, came about by accident or
happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   Julio T. Buel, a Vermont furrier, for example, is reported to
have accidentally dropped a spoon overboard while fishing from a
boat in 1830. As he watched the spoon flutter and wobble downwards,
Buel was surprised to see it suddenly snatched by a fish. Buel went
home and made another spoon from his kitchen tableware, attaching
hooks to it. Buel not only caught fish with his spoon, but formed a
tackle company in 1848 and produced high-quality (and collectible)
spoons and spinners until his death in 1870.
</P>
<P>
   If that story sounds familiar, it should. About 53 years later,
in 1883, James Heddon was waiting for a friend on a creek bank in
Dowagiac, Mich., when he tossed a piece of carved wood into the
creek and saw a bass promptly attack it. Heddon went home, carved a
wooden replica of a frog, attached two hooks and thus began the
Heddon Bait Company, credited with being the first manufacturer of
wooden fishing ``plugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooking anglers was as important as hooking fish to early lure
manufacturers, just as it is today.
</P>
<P>
   In about 1915, for example, The Detroit Glass Minnow Tube
Company produced a lure that would hold a live minnow in a glass
test tube-like capsule that allowed water circulation. The lure had
four treble hooks, the glass was magnified, and the manufacturer
said the minnow would stay alive all day.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the Booster Bait made in 1915. Its manufacturer
said the lure was ``filled with edible matter and containing a
capsule which, when placed in the water, dissolves, throwing off a
strong taste and smell.''
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous other stories that, like the lures
themselves, are lying there somewhere under the dust, just waiting
to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   And, about those lures: How does anyone know when they've found
the next $1,000 piece of junk?
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Harbin Sr., perhaps the most well-known Heddon Lure
collector in the United States, offered this advice: ``There ain't
nothing worth anything unless someone is willing to buy it. A lure
is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it.''

Column: Mailman misses his appointed rounds in the Finals
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ At the rate things are going, the Bulls soon will turn
Utah's Mailman into a commemorative stamp.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they seem to have him licked.
</P>
<P>
   Two games into the NBA Finals and Karl Malone might as well have
his photo back up on the post-office wall with the rest of the
missing persons. Somebody needs to tell him the idea in June is to
get yourself on the front of a Wheaties box, not the side of a milk
carton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Karl Malone don't play well, we will not win this series,''
Malone said, proving only that his grammar is as bad as his
offense, which says a lot.
</P>
<P>
   After averaging 27 points per game during the regular season,
the Mailman has delivered only 37 total in this series against the
Bulls. He has taken 41 shots and made 14. Friday night, he did not
score a field goal after the midway point of the second quarter. In
short, he's been the Great Salt Fake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comes at a bleepy time,'' he said, recognizing the aroma of
the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes at the same time on the calendar when Malone
served up several clunkers last year against the Bulls, which is
one of the reasons the Jazz is trying to prove itself title-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Game 1 collapse of a year ago, when Malone stood
at the free-throw line in the final seconds with a chance to ice a
Utah win and clunked two foul shots. He misfired on other crucial
occasions during the series. He did not pick up his team and carry
it on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Malone entered the Finals as a controversial 1997
Most Valuable Player in the eyes of many. And, if anything, he
added fuel to that debate by looking like a different kind of MVP _
Most Vanishing Person.
</P>
<P>
   All of those monster games in the regular season make nice
highlights for SportsCenter. But this is the time of the year when
reputations _ for better or for worse _ are forged. Michael Jordan
rises to the occasion at this time of the year. Hakeem Olajuwon and
Clyde Drexler did. Magic Johnson and Larry Bird did.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems in June, Malone turns more nervous than a blushing
bride.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Jordan was on a mission to prove the MVP award
rightfully belonged to him and he imposed his will on the series,
lifting the Bulls even on a night when he was ill and dragged them
to another title.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, for all of his muscles and all of his work ethic, looks
like just another 98-pound weakling who is melting under Jordan's
laser-beam glare for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Malone returned to the big stage, supposedly determined to
redeem himself, and has stood there stage-struck again, forgetting
his lines. The open jumpers on the wing he buried with regularity
in the early rounds of the playoffs against the Rockets, Spurs and
Lakers are not falling. What's worse is when the game is in the
balance late in the fourth quarter, he does not appear comfortable
taking the big shot, or looking for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Mailman's Game 2 line of 5-for-16 and only 16 points looked
like just another night at the dead letter office. And the
crunch-time numbers were worse: Jordan 13 points in the fourth
quarter; Malone one. What's more, he took only two shots in the
final period when the Jazz needed him to step up.
</P>
<P>
   How much of the credit for Malone's troubles should go to Dennis
Rodman, who brought fear and loathing from his Las Vegas trip into
the heart of the Delta Center, bumping Malone and trying to push
him out of his comfort zone?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the referees don't call the small-time stuff, I can play
Karl Malone any day of the week,'' said Rodman, who spent four days
in Salt Lake City and managed to not offend the Mormon community
once. ``I just don't feel comfortable in Utah. It's not my scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning, probably, there aren't enough pierced body parts and
topless dancers for his taste. But it isn't like Rodman has
tattooed himself to Malone, who has had plenty of wide-open looks
at the basket and missed shots.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been the kind of belly-flopping performance that
hasn't been put forth by a superstar in the Finals since 1977, when
George McGinnis built an embarrassing house of bricks for
Philadelphia against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just keep trying,'' Malone said. ``I keep taking
opportunities, if they're there, and I keep trying to do other
things.''
</P>
<P>
   If nobody else, at least the folks who make Rogaine have to be
happy with their celebrity endorser. Sales are going up in Utah,
because the Mailman has a lot of Jazz fans pulling out their hair.

JOHNSON A HAPPY CAMPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Golf at The Country Club one day, deep sea fishing
the next. Sometimes life can be tough. And then there is life at a
National Football League minicamp in June.
</P>
<P>
   Meetings, practice, preparation for a season that will be upon
us in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Give Ted Johnson a choice and he will probably hesitate. Just a
bit. After all, how many times does one get to stroll The Country
Club grounds in Brookline, having your caddie retrieve balls you
slice and hook into the woods. And then there is the deep sea
fishing excursion planned for later in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson, as much as anyone, knows that such activities are
only offshoots and byproducts of what he is, which is the Patriots'
middle linebacker, arguably their best defensive player and
unquestionably a key to a team that hopes to go deep into the
playoffs next season.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there's one more thing. Johnson is entering the fourth year
of a four-year contract worth $403,000 this season. But another
good season by the former University of Colorado star will earn him
10 times that much in his next contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, nothing's going on,'' said Johnson Saturday as the
Patriots veterans went through their second day of workouts in this
minicamp, which ends Sunday. ``No real talks. There hasn't been any
for a while. But there has been some mutual interest on both sides
to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson took some good-natured ribbing from the media Saturday,
the joke being that if it weren't for his upcoming extension, the
Patriots might have had enough money to keep running back Curtis
Martin around.
</P>
<P>
   ``A business decision,'' was Johnson's explanation as to why
Martin is with the Jets and why he will probably sign a long-term
extension with a big raise in the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says he has learned as much about financial aspects of
the NFL these days as he has football the past several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a learning experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So has his time with the Patriots. A year ago, Johnson and the
rest of the defensive unit were in a state of flux as Bill Parcells
and his staff were replaced by Pete Carroll and his staff. It
wasn't until the end of the season that the defense showed the form
that helped the Patriots get to the Super Bowl two seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, says Johnson, the expectations are much higher. Johnson
calls it the ``comfortability factor.'' The players know the
coaches and the system, and the coaches know the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is more in sync,'' said Johnson, who has worked
hard on his golf game in the offseason but has worked just as hard
in making himself into what he calls a full-time linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Johnson has been a two-down linebacker, removed on
third and long for defensive backs in nickel and dime coverages.
</P>
<P>
   One knock on him _ and there aren't many _ is that he could
improve his pass coverage. So he has, working hard at getting
quicker, if not faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play more,'' he said. ``I want to be full-time. I
don't want to be a two-down-and-out guy.''
</P>
<P>
   As to where he does his playing? Well, there is little doubt
about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be stupid to want to leave here,'' he said, pointing out
that he has already been to a Super Bowl, he is on a good young
team, the fan base is solid, and he feels very much appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of that coin, of course, is that Johnson has
learned that football can come down to business decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, he is in the right place at the right time, and he
will be the first to tell you how good it is.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Will the Patriots be a running team that passes or a passing
team that runs under the guidance of new offensive coordinator
Ernie Zampese? ``The players will dictate that,'' said Zampese
Saturday. Although his inclination is to run the ball more, he will
not be stubborn about it if the offense, minus Martin, cannot
produce.

NOTHING HOLDS COUPLES BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This is Fred Couples. During the 1989 US Open, he invited the
entire crew of the outdoor pro shops at Oak Hill to an Italian
restaurant for dinner at his expense.
</P>
<P>
   This is Fred Couples. He was the best dancer at the calypso
parties during the now defunct Johnnie Walker tournament in Montego
Bay, Jamaica, where he earned a lot of money _ and one victory _
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   This is Fred Couples. He is the PGA Tour's leading money winner
this year, with nearly $1.5 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people remember how he took an 8 on the 13th at Augusta
National to let the Masters slip out of his grasp and how he landed
in the water on 17 at the Byron Nelson to lose that tournament to
John Cook. Many may have expected to see him let the Memorial get
away last Sunday in Dublin, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. The real Fred Couples stepped to the front of
the pack and stayed there. He won by four shots, a triumph for the
older guys on Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel tired and old, but I'm playing as well as I
can play right now,'' says Couples, 38. ``I just don't live and die
golf like I used to. I don't think I'll ever become a bad player.
I'm capable of playing as well at 38 or 39 or 40 as I did at 32.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples has been through a lot _ a divorce, the death of his
father from leukemia last November, and a longtime battle with back
problems. But even though his bad back has limited his competitive
appearances over the years, when Couples walks the fairways, he
walks with a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   How good could Couples have become had his schedule not been
limited by physical problems? Back in 1991 and 1992, he was voted
the Tour's best player by his peers. He won the Masters in 1992, a
year in which he won three times and finished second twice during a
remarkable six-tournament stretch. There were blips in the years
that followed, but when he won his second Players Championship at
Sawgrass in 1996 with a strong finish, he showed he was back.
</P>
<P>
   There was a downturn last season, when he finished outside the
top 30 in earnings for just the second time in 11 years. But now
he's back, in the era of Tiger Woods, Justin Leonard, David Duval,
Davis Love III, and Phil Mickelson. He showed that when he won the
Bob Hope Jan. 18 and then the Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   He has that casual swing, that casual look, that casual way of
expressing himself in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept the lead and I stayed in the lead,'' he said after last
Sunday's win. ``It was a little easier than I felt it was going to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Don Lyons &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has been head professional at George Wright GC
in Hyde Park for 16 years, is in his first year as president of the
New England PGA. The 39-year-old Lyons came up in golf the
old-fashioned way, learning the basics as a caddie and bag room
attendant at Salem CC. He later worked in the pro shop under  &UR; Bill
Barclay &LR; , &UR;  &LR; then moved to the Thomson Club, where  &UR; Bill Flynn  &LR; was
head pro. It was Flynn who presided over the restoration of George
Wright and the city's other course, Franklin Park.
</P>
<P>
   The winding road from caddie to bag room to pro shop to head
professional to NEPGA president is one of dedication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into the apprentice program,'' says Lyons. ``I never
played much in high school; I played in one amateur tournament. I
didn't start to play until I was 15. I played with friends.''
</P>
<P>
   His golf education came through working with Barclay and Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only worked for two guys,'' says the Peabody native, who
resides in Danvers with his wife, Peggy, and their four children.
``I learned the basics of the business from both of them _ how to
deal with people. As I got more into it, I grew to love the game of
golf and just being around people who had similar interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day was exciting; different things happen. Everybody
you're dealing with all had the same love. Being able to teach and
help people with their games gave me satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Few are the days when he isn't on the lesson tee at George
Wright, and for things like that he is a four-time recipient of the
NEPGA's Horton Smith Award for dedicated leadership and outstanding
contributions to the education program.
</P>
<P>
   And now he is the leader of the NEPGA. Lyons worked his way up
through the ranks, holding every elective position in the NEPGA
Assistants Association. His term at the helm of the organization
comes with the 1999 Ryder Cup at The Country Club on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ryder Cup will be one of the biggest events to come to
Boston,'' says Lyons, who will step down when his term ends in
September and be succeeded by  &UR; Steve Napoli  &LR; of Wannamoisett CC.
``We're also seeing the growth of junior golf and we've moved into
a new home site at Cyprian Keys. There's been a rapid growth in our
membership. We have over 600 Class A PGA members and about 300
registered apprentices. Ten years ago, that number was 600, tops.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The national golf media will focus on  &UR; Casey Martin  &LR; again
Monday as he attempts to qualify for the US Open in the sectionals
at Clovernook CC in the Cincinnati suburbs. When Martin won a Nike
event earlier in the year, he gained an exemption that permitted
him to skip a local qualifier. The US Golf Association's executive
committee has agreed to let Martin use a cart. Earlier, Martin won
an injunction in federal court that permits him to ride a cart on
the Nike Tour, and should he make his PGA Tour debut, as expected,
at the Greater Hartford Open this summer, he'll ride in that event
as well. ``The transportation will be a single-rider cart,'' the
USGA's statement read. ``Similar vehicles have been used at recent
USGA national championships for transportation of spectators with
disabilities.'' The statement noted that the USGA was not a party
to the suit Martin brought against the PGA Tour ``and disagrees
with the verdict.'' ... The majority of area pros and amateurs
involved in sectional qualifying this week will play Tuesday at
Canoe Brook CC in Summit, N.J. _ if they can find it. Getting to
the two courses requires intricate moves off Exit 142 of the Garden
State Parkway. Those in the 36-hole test include  &UR; Geoff Sisk  &LR; of
Marshfield and  &UR; Kevin Johnson  &LR; of Halifax and the Nike Tour. Should
Sisk make it to The Olympic Club in San Francisco for the June
18-21 Open and make the cut, he'd have quite a cross-country trip
to make to defend his Massachusetts Open title; the tournament at
Oak Hill CC begins the day after the US Open ends. The 106-player
field at Canoe Brook also includes a few players off the PGA Tour,
including  &UR; Fuzzy Zoeller &LR; , who Monday conducts his annual clinic
for the Boys Clubs of Greater Newark ... Four members of the New
England PGA qualified for the PGA Club Professional Championship
June 25-28 at Pinehurst No. 8 in Pinehurst, N.C., where  &UR; Bruce
Zabriski  &LR; of Rye, N.Y., will defend his title. The area players who
qualified through the regionals last fall are  &UR; Paul Parajeckas  &LR; of
Woburn,  &UR; David Lane  &LR; of Indian Ridge,  &UR; Jeff Stewart  &LR; of North Hill,
and  &UR; Mike Baker  &LR; of Bangor Municipal. There will be 144 competitors
playing for a $300,000 purse. The winner earns $40,000 and earns
exemptions to next year's PGA Championship at Sahalee in Redmond,
Wash., the PGA Cup Matches at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs,
and three PGA Tour events ... West Roxbury native  &UR; John Hines  &LR; and
 &UR; Jack's  &LR; son  &UR; Steve Nicklaus &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who purchased Executive Sports
International last year, will manage the US Senior Open at Salem CC
in 2001. ESI, a subdivision of the Nicklaus enterprise Golden Bear,
has managed more than 600 tournaments globally since 1971 ...
 &UR; Donald Trump's  &LR; $40 million golf resort in West Palm Beach is
being constructed next door to a boutique named Condoms Galore. ``I
don't think Donald knows about it yet,'' store owner  &UR; Karol Schmick
 &LR; told the Palm Beach Post. ``Maybe the golfers will stop by after
they play to get a little something to bring home to their wives.''
... The soaring popularity of the Ryder Cup has attracted six
prominent clubs to bid for the 2003 matches. The people at Colonial
in Fort Worth brought a video and letters from  &UR; Byron
Nelson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; former President  &UR; George Bush &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Texas Gov.  &UR; George W.
Bush &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and the late  &UR; Ben Hogan  &LR; when they met with the PGA of
America in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. They also proposed setting up a
corporate village at the Fort Worth Zoo. Colonial and Pinehurst are
considered the leaders, and bids reportedly are in from Medinah,
Congressional, Oakland Hills, and Pebble Beach. Eastern clubs are
thought to have an advantage because of the time difference in
Europe. The matches were at Oak Hill three years ago ...  &UR; Les
Kennedy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was a legendary pro at Pawtucket CC from 1944 until
his retirement in 1984 and is still alive and kicking in spite of
recent published reports of his death, will be inducted into the
Pawtucket CC Hall of Fame Friday night. He'll be there.

but Spain can't lose whatever the score.
</P>
<P>
   Diminutive, perpetually moving Sanchez Vicario made sure of that
Saturday, beating the game and gritty but hard-luck Seles, 7-6
(7-5), 0-6, 6-2, for her third French Open title as Spanish and
Catalan flags of scarlet and gold brightened a dim, rain-heavy sky.
</P>
<P>
   Grieving and underprepared, Seles, the champion of seemingly
long ago, had untold hearts beating for her as she raced improbably
to the final (knocking off Nos. 1 and 3 Martina Hingis and Jana
Novotna on the way), and into a decisive third set against Sanchez
Vicario, whom she'd beaten in 14 of 16 previous encounters. The
death of Seles's father three weeks ago was an immeasurable loss,
and she ``didn't make up my mind to play until the Friday before
the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Spanish contingent among the sellout gathering of
16,000, it was a Seles crowd. Chorusing, ``Moni-ca! Moni-ca!'' as
she struck the bigger double-fisted blows in the exciting though
unevenly played match, fans sensed success after Seles brilliantly
shut out her opponent in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't to come because Sanchez Vicario refuses to let a
point die whether she has to climb walls, skin her desperately
reaching arms, careen and skid around corners, risk high-speed
crashes into the net, and almost total herself. Somehow she keeps
the rally breathing, scooping, lofting, overtaking balls that
appear surely to be her foes' points.
</P>
<P>
   Seles was no exception to the mass charitable gestures that made
Sanchez Vicario the United Fund of this tournament. Everybody gave
at the office, particularly in the stretch: Serena Williams 71
unforced errors in three sets, Patty Schnyder 63 in three, No. 2
Lindsay Davenport 56 in two, Seles 47 in three. Her seven victims
contributed a total of 328, but an error-pinching Sanchez Vicario
donated but 187, merely 21 to Seles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arantxa makes you start going for too much to get it past
her,'' sighed Seles. ``She runs down everything and you start
making mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles had limited Sanchez Vicario to 6 points in the brief
second set but found an even more determined Sanchez Vicario facing
her as the third set began. Seles failed because she couldn't cash
in five break points: two in the opening game, one in the third,
and two in the fifth where the Spaniard's 3-1 lead jiggled
precariously at 15-40.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first and second games of the third were so important,''
said Sanchez Vicario. ``I kept hanging in there'' to elude two
break points from 15-40 and lead, 1-0. She broke, then boosted it
to 3-0 by escaping a break point with a rocketing backhand, and got
to 4-1 as Seles bungled her openings.
</P>
<P>
   Two points in the first set _ the fifth of the ninth game and
the last of the tie-breaker _ were especially costly to Seles,
playing only her 18th match of this troubled year. Leading, 5-3,
30-30 _ 2 points from the set _ she zinged a serve wide to Sanchez
Vicario's forehand and stood at the net to cream the pop-up return
that her opponent somehow managed. But Seles blew the smash and
also netted the next point, preserving Sanchez Vicario for a
tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario sprang off to a 5-points-to-1 lead, but for a
moment it was reminiscent of Seles's first of three straight
pre-stabbing titles, as a 16-year-old in 1990. Then, she lagged
behind Steffi Graf, 6-2, in the first-set tie-breaker but reeled
off 6 straight points.
</P>
<P>
   This time she got 4 of them back to 5-5, missed a forehand
return, and became embroiled in a corner-to-corner duel of 15
strokes, her forehand assaulting Sanchez Vicario's backhand. The
Spaniard kept stretching and slicing with one hand, lulling Seles _
until Sanchez Vicario saw a ball she liked and threw herself at it
with both hands, a banger that won the point and set.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the fourth round last Sunday, nobody was talking up the
aging Sanchez Vicario, 26, whose championship days seemed well
behind her (she won the title in 1989 and 1994). Certainly not when
she trailed 16-year-old Williams, 4-6, 2-5 and four times was
within 2 points of losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one got me started,'' she said. ``It stung me, hurt me
that Serena show me no respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had yelled at her during a dispute over an umpire's
call.
</P>
<P>
   Neither she nor Seles figured to get this far. All the attention
was going to the cocksure teen-agers led by Hingis. But Seles and
Sanchez Vicario have plenty of respect now. And Sanchez Vicario has
the championship.

   CHICAGO _ The Last Stand.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine arrived in the mail two days ago, and there was
Michael Jordan on the cover of Sports Illustrated for the millionth
time, looking sweaty and tired, with Scottie Pippen in profile
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   I knew I'd seen this before. Being something of a pack rat, I
didn't have to look far. There's a sports collage on the wall of my
home office _ color magazine photos from the 1960s. I put it
together when I was in high school and it has moved with me.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Bill Russell driving the lane on the Boston Garden
parquet floor next to the headline ``Boston's Old Guard/The Last
Stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty neat. Like Jordan today, Russell was 35 years old (both
born in February) when SI put him on its cover in 1969 to
encapsulate the final quest of a great champion.
</P>
<P>
   There are some obvious differences. For one thing, Sports
Illustrated cost only 50 cents in 1969. Also, Russell made the
cover on April 28, which reminds us that the NBA season lasts two
months longer than it did in the old days. There's no
``www.cnnsi.com'' on the 1969 cover, either, and the old magazine
is slightly larger than today's SI.
</P>
<P>
   But my address is in the same lower left-hand corner of both
magazines and the cover themes haven't changed much in 29 years.
Russell's Celtics in 1969 were going for their second straight
title, their 11th in 13 seasons. They didn't have the home-court
advantage and they had to play the first two games in Los Angeles.
Boston lost the first two games, but recovered to win the series in
seven.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Bulls are trying to win their third straight title,
their sixth in eight years. Like the '69 Celtics, they are trying
to beat the same team they defeated in the finals the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Russell have much in common. They are perennial MVPs
(five each) and the undisputed leaders of basketball dynasties.
Russell served as player-coach in his final three seasons. Jordan
is merely the coach on the court, allegedly taking orders from Phil
Jackson. When Jordan won his latest MVP, Russell _ rarely seen away
from the golf course _ was there to present it to Michael.
</P>
<P>
   The 1969 Celtics were tired and got help from spare parts named
Don Nelson and Emmette Bryant. They won Game 7 on the road in the
LA Forum. Red Auerbach has 16 championship rings in his possession,
including nine he won as a head coach, but he wears the ring from
'69. And he still gets a chuckle out of Jack Kent Cooke lining the
Forum ceiling with balloons for the postgame celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are they gonna do with all those damn balloons?'' said a
chuckling, stogie-smoking Auerbach after Boston's 108-106 Game 7
win.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls and Jazz are 1-1 after two games and play three in
Chicago this week. Should the series return to Salt Lake City, and
it undoubtedly will, the Jazz would be smart to put a pin in
anybody who suggests balloons at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   These Bulls have their Don Nelsons and Emmette Bryants. Try
Steve Kerr and Luc Longley. Russell had no running mate equal to
Scottie Pippen, but Sam Jones comes pretty close. Sam was there for
10 of the 11 championships, and he retired with Russell after
winning The Last Stand.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't know Russell was done when he won Title No. 11. He
made the announcement in Sports Illustrated. Similarly, we don't
know whether this is really the end for Michael. He has said he
won't come back if Jackson doesn't return, and Jackson says he's
not coming back. Still, it seems Michael wants to play more ball.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's 1969 Celtics had the hearts of champions. They beat a
Laker team that had Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, and Elgin Baylor.
They won on the road, after losing the first two. They won after
fans and rivals counted them out.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of stuff about the Bulls being tired and old
after they wheezed to a Game 7 conference final win at home against
Indiana. There's not so much of that talk now. But unless they win
three straight at home, starting tonight, they will have to win
their title out West _ just like the Celtics did in The Last Stand
of 1969.

COMMAND PERFORMANCE BY JONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One week ago in Philadelphia, Mets pitcher Bobby Jones had his
worst outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The righthander allowed 10 hits and six earned runs in four
innings, and while the New Yorkers came back for an 8-6 victory to
take Jones off the hook, pitching coach Bob Apodaca wasn't about
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the same pitches like he had today,'' said Apodaca,
after Jones went eight innings and gave up just three hits in a 1-0
victory Saturday at Fenway Park that improved his record to 5-3,
``but he wasn't locating them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? Well, today you saw a calm Bobby Jones with a rhythm to
his delivery. In Philadelphia, I saw a quick, herky-jerky pitcher,
similar to (Pedro) Martinez Friday night, and that affects your
comand.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment he started his warmup tosses Saturday, Jones was
eased into his task by Apodaca.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set the tone for his rhythm right from his first pitches in
the bullpen,'' said Apodaca.
</P>
<P>
   Jones not only showed some resiliency in coming back from his
shellacking by the Phillies, but also from his only previous
appearance against the Red Sox. A year ago in Shea Stadium, Jones
was touched for five runs and six hits in just four innings as
Boston romped, 10-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a lot of tapes from that game last year,'' said
Jones, whose 15 victories in 1997 were the most by a Mets pitcher
since Frank Viola won 20 in 1990. ``Basically, my stuff was a lot
better today against Boston than last year. I had good command of
all my pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   After Troy O'Leary's leadoff single in the second inning, Jones
faced 22 batters without giving up a hit. He was lifted by manager
Bobby Valentine in favor of stopper John Franco to start the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Bobby's best-pitched game this year,'' said Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't quite start out that way. Darren Lewis and Reggie
Jefferson opened the Boston first with singles but Jones got Nomar
Garciaparra to hit a ground ball that third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo
turned into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Jones then got Mo Vaughn on a shallow fly to center and he was
never again in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big pitch to Nomar, but the big thing all day was
my location,'' said Jones, who said he couldn't afford to worry
about how well his counterpart, Tim Wakefield, was pitching. But he
did have some concern after eyeing the Green Monster from the
pitcher's mound for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I wanted to get a lot of ground balls,'' said Jones, who
recorded 13 outs on grounders, including two double plays.
</P>
<P>
   And Apodaca knew why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby had an outstanding game plan and he worked it from the
beginning,'' said Apodaca. ``He established his fastball in the
first couple of innings on both sides of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday night, we played macho ball with Mo Vaughn and tried to
bust him inside and all he did was get the head of the bat out and
hit nothing but shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Bobby forced the hitters to adjust to hitting his hard and
softer pitches on both sides of the plate and then he started
mixing it up with his changeup and curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw a lot of funky swings on his curveball because he was
coming in with fastballs and sliders all day to those lefthanders
and then he'd break off that curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could throw any pitch on any count and get most of them over
for strikes,'' he said. ``It was my best stuff all season.''
</P>
<P>
   And it all started in the bullpen with a pat on the back instead
of a pep talk from his pitching coach.

NEW YORK JURY SENTENCES FORMER GUARD TO DEATH FOR TRIPLE KILLING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first death penalty trial since New York state
reinstated capital punishment in 1995, a Brooklyn jury sentenced a
former jail guard to death on Saturday for murdering three people
in a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The former guard, Darrel Harris _ who was given a medal by Mayor
Edward Koch in the 1980s for saving another correction officer's
life during an inmate riot at a Brooklyn jail _ was sentenced to
execution by a jury that rejected his past heroism and other
mitigating factors proposed by the defense as reason enough to
spare his life.
</P>
<P>
   When the sentence was announced in a somber session in state
Supreme Court in Brooklyn, more emotion came from the jury box than
from Harris or his relatives, who appeared to have been informed of
the jury's decision privately before it was announced in court.
</P>
<P>
   One juror began sobbing and nearly collapsed as she left the box
after the panel of seven women and five men was dismissed by Acting
Justice Anne Feldman, who thanked them for performing ``this very
difficult civic obligation.'' Another juror dabbed her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which could have instead sentenced the 40-year-old
Harris to life in prison without the possibility of parole, also
rejected as mitigating factors a defense argument that serious
psychological problems and cocaine and alcohol abuse had not only
caused Harris to plunge from hero in 1986 to triple killer a decade
later, but had also fueled his murderous rampage itself.
</P>
<P>
   If Harris is executed by lethal injection, as prescribed under
the 1995 capital punishment law, he will be the first person put to
death in the state since 1963, when the death penalty was carried
out in the electric chair. But years of legal appeals are likely in
the effort to save Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of his victims, some of whom wept quietly as they left
the courtroom, expressed quiet gratification at what they deemed a
just penalty for the bloodletting at the illegal storefront social
club in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, in the early morning of Dec.
7, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One of Harris' lawyers, Russell Neufeld, called the death
sentence ``a tragedy for the people of the state of New York and
for all the families involved.'' The victims' families, he said,
``feel this will ease the pain of the loss,'' but the sentence was
``not a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said that ``we must
remember that this trial was a search for the truth and an effort
to do justice in the memory'' of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   With no previous criminal record _ and, in fact, as a publicly
honored hero who saved a fellow correction officer from inmates who
were severely beating him in the 1986 jail riot _ Harris had shown
``there's some value in him,'' warranting life in prison, said one
of his lawyers, Colleen Brady, part of a team, with Neufeld and
Timothy Rountree from the Legal Aid Society's capital defense unit.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony in the trial, Harris' murderous rampage
began when he pulled out a gun in the storefront social club, which
he had previously patronized, and ordered five people to get on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   He shot three men in the head, two fatally: Michael Harris, 37,
who was not related to him, and Jerome Sims, 58, the manager of the
social club, called Club Happiness. Another shooting victim, Eddie
Brown, 50, survived. And when Harris ran out of bullets, he fatally
stabbed Evelyn Davis, 32, despite her cries to be spared because
``I have five babies,'' according to Brown and a second witness,
Newbry Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   The defense conceded that Harris was the killer, but disagreed
with the prosecution on what had driven him to commit the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The defense insisted that there had been no robbery and that
rather than killing to eliminate witnesses, as the prosecution
contended, Harris had been a severely disturbed man who had
``snapped.'' A psychiatrist testified about severe childhood
beatings by Harris' mother and, in adulthood, about his job losses,
drug and alcohol abuse, and what he called the traumatic effects of
the 1986 jail disturbance in which Harris saved his colleague.
</P>
<P>
   The defense argued that although this action earned Harris a
medal from New York's mayor, the violence had also left him with
the kind of severe psychological and emotional problems diagnosed
in many war veterans as post-traumatic stress disorder. The city's
Correction Department forced Harris to resign in 1991 because of
his drug use. All this, the defense unsuccessfully argued,
justified a conviction for first-degree manslaughter, punishable by
up to 25 years in prison for each killing.

 McRAE'S TOUR DE FORCE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some guys win 1-0 games with home runs. Some win 1-0 games with
singles to center field. Brian McRae can now tell the grandchildren
that he once won a 1-0 game by inducing a balk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to win two or three games a year on weird
things,'' he shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   McRae beat Tim Wakefield on a day when the knuckleballer was
otherwise unbeatable, or, at least, unhittable. The Mets managed
one hit off him in eight innings. Thanks almost exclusively to
McRae, the Mets got a sixth-inning run _ in what New York manager
Bobby Valentine labeled a ``wonderful game'' _ without the
necessity of a hit. All they needed were the legs and moxie of
Hal's Kid, who walked, took second on a seldom-seen delayed steal,
advanced to third on a John Olerud grounder, and then scored when
he made a menacing move down the line and a concerned Wakefield was
charged with a balk by home plate umpire Terry Craft.
</P>
<P>
   It was aggressive baseball. It was smart baseball. It was
connoisseur's baseball.
</P>
<P>
   To Brian McRae, son of a major league baseball player, it was
simple, common-sense baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone of the game, the way it was going,'' said McRae, ``I
thought the only way we were going to score a run was by trying to
make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   McRae led off the sixth inning of a scoreless game. In his first
two at-bats, he had grounded to second and popped to short. ``He
was throwing more balls that inning,'' McRae recalled. The count
went to 2-and-0 and 3-and-1 before McRae took ball four. It would
be Wakefield's only walk of the afternoon, and the 29-year-old
center fielder was determined to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   He remained on first as Wakefield fanned Bernard Gilkey for out
number one. Now he started thinking about stealing second, but
against Wakefield this is not an easy thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to get it done on a straight steal,'' he said.
``Wakefield is quick to the plate, and (catcher Scott) Hatteberg
looks like he has a strong arm.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem. McRae had a Plan B. Some 20 times in his career he
has successfully executed a delayed steal. The time had come to try
it again.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to go on a 2-and-1 pitch to Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got lucky,'' he explained. ``The pitch was down in the dirt
and Hatteberg probably couldn't come right up with it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in a Red Sox uniform was expecting anything funky. McRae
stole second without drawing a throw.
</P>
<P>
   The Olerud grounder moved him to third. When he got there with
two away, he immediately liked what he saw: Wakefield would be
pitching from a full windup.
</P>
<P>
   It was now back to Spring Training 101. Valentine is a firm
believer in trying to disrupt any pitcher trying to pitch from a
full windup with a man on third. Mets players are taught to make
hard moves down the line, and one thing about McRae is that he's
good at following instructions.
</P>
<P>
   McRae made a pretty good move toward home on the first pitch, a
called strike to cleanup batter Butch Huskey. As Wakefield went
into his motion on the next pitch, McRae made a serious move, one
that would have done Jackie Robinson proud. Wakefield reacted. He
broke his motion, and Craft immediately ruled a balk. McRae came
trotting home with the run that would make Bobby Jones a winner
over Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   McRae is a solid major league player, but he is no star. He is a
.265 lifetime hitter. This is his third big-league team. If he ever
thought he was heading for Cooperstown, he was forced to abandon
those thoughts a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   In order to make himself useful, he has had to offer managers
more than raw skills. He has had to learn the game. And the very
fact that he has a game put a W in the Mets' pocket Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the delayed steal, which is not something you see
every day, week, or month in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that in Rookie ball from Joe Jones, who is now the
Pirates' first base coach,'' McRae explained. ``He was my first
manager in baseball. He taught me that there were many little
things that can help you win baseball games.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the hard move on third base against a pitcher in a
windup, McRae gave the credit to his manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby likes us to be aggressive,'' McRae said. ``He says if
you think you can steal home, don't be afraid. Otherwise, you might
get something out if it. The pitch could be in the dirt, the batter
might get a better pitch to hit or, in this case, you might get a
balk.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine can't go out and make it happen. Only the player
can do that, and McRae was textbook Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've really got to sell it,'' he acknowledged. ``You can't
take a casual stroll.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It all came under the heading of Doing What You Had To Do
against a pitcher who wasn't otherwise forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a whole lot of good at-bats against him,'' said
McRae. ``He threw an awful lot of strikes. I bet if you asked him
he'd say he had some of his best stuff this year.''
</P>
<P>
   (Ed. note: I asked him. He said yes.)
</P>
<P>
   This was all a great display of baseball playing, but to Brian
McRae it was just a matter of being a professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of my game,'' he said. ``I work on it. You've
got to know what your game is. You work on something, and it might
win you one game a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope someone had enough gratitude to buy this man some
dinner.

WAKEFIELD NOT AT LOSS FOR WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over and over, questions about Boston's 1-0 loss to the New York
Mets Saturday were posed in different ways. But Tim Wakefield kept
repeating himself. It did little to soothe Wakefield's raw nerves
after the knuckleballer's masterful one-hit, one-walk,
three-strikeout performance over eight innings produced only his
third loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   What made matters worse was that Wakefield (6-3) was charged
with a controversial balk in the sixth inning by home plate umpire
Terry Craft that allowed Brian McRae to score the only run.
</P>
<P>
   Boston hitters, meanwhile, struggled for eight innings against
Bobby Jones (5-3), eking out just three singles against the
righthander, including two in the first inning by leadoff man
Darren Lewis and designated hitter Reggie Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   So, Tim, what about the balk?
</P>
<P>
   ``The balk shouldn't have mattered,'' he said. ``It shouldn't
have because one run shouldn't have beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's all it took to ruin Wakefield's day.
</P>
<P>
   One hit. One balk. One run.
</P>
<P>
   It added up to one headache for Wakefield, who afterward seethed
over a number of aspects of the loss. First, there was the decision
by manager Jimy Williams to lift Wakefield for Tom Gordon in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I surprised?'' Wakefield said. ``Yeah, very. But he just
said that Flash needed the work. It's just the way it is. I don't
make the decisions for the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the balk. With McRae on third base looking like a
jackrabbit about to sprint for home, Craft said Wakefield balked on
his move toward the plate. But third base umpire Al Clark saw it
differently, saying Wakefield's foot had come off the rubber before
his motion. Craft prevailed, however, and McRae, who had reached on
a walk, stolen second, and advanced to third on a fielder's choice,
came trotting home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want him to steal home. I wanted to keep him honest
and keep him close,'' Wakefield said. ``But I got called for a
balk. I can't even remember having a balk called against me in my
career. If I did have one called against me, it was a long time
ago. But I didn't think one run was going to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Which raised another sore subject for Wakefield: Boston's
offensive offense. The Red Sox have been shut out in two of their
last four games. Wakefield couldn't hide his displeasure with the
lack of support, as he kept repeating, ``One run should not beat
this ball club.
</P>
<P>
   ``You throw a one-hitter through eight innings and you come off
the field with an L next to your name. It shouldn't happen. Not
when we're trying to win a championship here. One run shouldn't
beat this ball club, but it did, and it's really hard to swallow.
It really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield again was asked to expand on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think one run should beat our ball club,'' he
repeated, ``but it did today, and I don't need to comment on it
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we've got the offensive power and capability to
come back from one run. It's happened before, and that's what I'm
trying to say.''

SIGNS THERE BEFORE SAD DETOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ It is the latest verse of a sad song sung too often
in boxing, and today the melody plays for Riddick Bowe, a
heavyweight champion who always knew how to laugh until boxing made
him cry.
</P>
<P>
   The man who brought laughter back to the sport of tears learned
how far and how fast a champion can fall when he stood up in a
federal courtroom in Charlotte, N.C., Thursday _ barely a year
after leaving boxing behind _ and pleaded guilty to abducting his
estranged wife and five children at knifepoint, unable to do with
those charges what he had been trained to do all his life.
</P>
<P>
   Riddick Bowe, standing in confusion and shame, refused to fight
them.
</P>
<P>
   There was no use anymore and Bowe finally seemed to understand
that. It was knowledge that probably came too late to keep him out
of the same place that his old neighbor from Brownsville, N.Y.,
Mike Tyson, visited a few years back. Bowe is going to prison, it
seems, and while that was a predictable landing place for Tyson, it
was never where Bowe seemed headed.
</P>
<P>
   How did the young boy who used to rise late in the night and
walk to a small factory in Brownsville to meet his mother so she
would not have to walk home alone end up standing before a judge,
accused by his high school sweetheart, Judy Bowe, of carrying a
knife, handcuffs, pepper spray, and duct tape to her new home in
Cornelius, N.C., in February to try to drag his family back
together?
</P>
<P>
   In some demented way, it was typical Bowe, one of the very few
family men in a solitary sport. This was the same Bowe who wore
pictures of his wife and children on his boxing robes, the same
Bowe who talked incessantly to his wife on the phone each night
while held prisoner in the self-imposed exile of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   But something had gone wrong with this Bowe, a fact evident when
he arrived at the annual Boxing Writers Dinner in New York in
April. He came to praise his retiring trainer, old and wise Eddie
Futch.
</P>
<P>
   Bowe, Futch's last heavyweight champion, was to introduce the
trainer that night, but after listening to his slurred speech and
unfathom-able conversational meanderings at an earlier reception,
organizers changed the program. Some will say it was boxing that
silenced him that night, and they probably are correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of sad,'' said the man with whom Bowe fought a
stirring trilogy, present champion Evander Holyfield. Sad it was
that last night they sat together in New York, one talking, the
other mumbling back.
</P>
<P>
   ``His demeanor was quite different,'' Holyfield said. ``A guy as
young as him, you kind of wonder what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   If you have fought as long and as hard as Holyfield with no
apparent ill effects, perhaps you wonder. But for so many of us who
watched Bowe get hit in the head again and again by men like
Holyfield and Andrew Golota (who hit him not only high but also low
so often that he pushed Bowe into early retirement), you didn't
have to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   You know what happened to Riddick Bowe.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing happened to Riddick Bowe.
</P>
<P>
   The other way to put it is that Bowe's brain surrendered to his
obsession. It gave up boxing before he did, no longer able to take
the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Your brain was never meant to slam back and forth inside your
skull, although many fighters can take it for years without harm.
Bowe was clearly not among them, especially when he so often taxed
himself with tremendous weight gain followed by withering weight
loss that dried out his body and his soul. Finally one punch too
many dented his face and his brain surrendered, but who can know
which punch it was?
</P>
<P>
   Was it one of Holyfield's hateful shots, perhaps the one that
drove Bowe onto his back in their third fight? How could it be that
one, you say, if he got up the way he did, tottering but brave, to
finish Holyfield the very next round?
</P>
<P>
   Was it one of the ones Golota hit him with that didn't land
below boxing's demilitarized zone? Was it the low blows that twice
left Bowe writhing on the canvas in pain, a victor on his back
because his opponent had less self-control than he did, that did
the real damage?
</P>
<P>
   Or was it one no one will remember and few witnessed? Was it one
of the thousands that hit him during sparring sessions when only
Futch and a handful of hangers-on were there to see it, a lethal
punch left unrecorded by history?
</P>
<P>
   Who can know such things?
</P>
<P>
   All we knew is that Bowe was losing it day by day by day. You
knew it when he would rock back, just a bit off balance, when he
got up too quickly from a chair, his brain unable to readjust
itself quickly enough to keep him on balance. You knew but you kept
silent.
</P>
<P>
   You knew it the first time you talked to him by phone and felt
like you needed a translator to be sure what this funny, funny man
was really saying. You knew but you kept silent.
</P>
<P>
   You knew it when you finally found yourself needing the
translator even when you were face to face with him. You knew for
sure then, but you kept silent.
</P>
<P>
   That's what you do in boxing most of the time. You keep silent.
You let the tragedy play itself out and then you shake your head
and say, ``You kind of wonder what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   You say you wonder, but you know.
</P>
<P>
   You knew it when Golota hit Bowe with a jab and nearly knocked
him out in the first round of their second, terrible confrontation,
the one that ruined both of them for good.
</P>
<P>
   You knew it the day you read that a retired multimillionaire
with five kids named Riddick Bowe had decided to enter the Marine
Corps at an age when he needed special dispensation to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days later you knew it again when you heard he was
quitting the Corps, drummed out by mutual agreement because he
didn't particularly want to get up early and he missed his family.
</P>
<P>
   You laughed at some of these things and winced at others, but
you kept silent because some people don't survive prizefighting,
and even though Bowe was clearly going to be one of them, he was a
fighter who had earned respect and privacy in his downfall and so
no one spoke about it until Bowe could barely speak himself.
</P>
<P>
   Then you read another headline that his wife of so many years
had accused him of trying to hit her and then you later read she'd
left the man she'd loved since they were kids and then you read
that he'd been arrested for attempted kidnapping in February, the
spiral speeding up with each headline, and you knew why.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the night in New York when you saw Bowe stumbling over
his words the way a drunk trips over a curb. That night two
journalists, professional acquaintances of Bowe and his family,
talked of what they'd seen and what they knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you talk to Bowe?'' one says to the other.
</P>
<P>
   A nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you gonna write?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothin'. There's nothing to say now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to say now about a kid from Brownsville who always
wanted to be Muhammad Ali and now, in his dotage, had become him.
</P>
<P>
   So there it is, and now there's nothing to do but feel a little
guilty because you knew what was coming, but in boxing, as in any
other sport, a guy is free to destroy his body if he wants. He
doesn't have to play. He doesn't have to fight. He doesn't have to
end up like Riddick Bowe, you tell yourself.
</P>
<P>
   That's the justification, and it's true, but when it happens, as
it has now to sad, solitary Riddick Bowe, there's only one thing
left to say about it and a lot of people on all sides of boxing
need to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   We all knew and nobody said a word.
</P>
<P>
   Riddick Bowe will likely live 18 months to two years in a
federal prison, wondering what happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us will live a lot longer knowing we don't have to
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   We knew all along.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Don't want to say next weekend's fight between welterweight
champion  &UR; Oscar De La Hoya  &LR; and  &UR; Patrick Charpentier  &LR; is a
mismatch, but word is this is the first time in his career that
Charpentier has sparred in preparation for a match. His old trainer
supposedly was against it. Wonder how he feels about defense? ...
Because of the cancellation of the Holyfield- &UR; Henry Akinwande
 &LR; fight, HBO reportedly granted World Boxing Council champion
 &UR; Lennox Lewis  &LR; an extension on its June 6 deadline to sign a
six-fight, $30 million contract extension because the two sides
will once again try to make a deal for a unification fight in
September.  &UR; Jim Thomas &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Holyfield's lawyer, feels Lewis should
remain a free agent to make a Lewis-Holyfield fight more possible,
as does Showtime executive  &UR; Jay Larkin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but  &UR; Seth Abraham  &LR; and
 &UR; Lou DiBella &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who run HBO Sports, counter that the deal does not
preclude Lewis from fighting Holyfield on Showtime if it outbids
HBO ... After a complaint from  &UR; Obed Sullivan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; undefeated
heavyweight prospect  &UR; Michael Grant  &LR; nearly had to fight last
weekend while wearing a new protective cup. Sullivan's aides
claimed Grant's gear was so large that it covered half his stomach,
and the New Jersey Athletic Commission agreed, but executive
director  &UR; Larry Hazzard  &LR; finally allowed Grant to wear it. By the
third round it was halfway to his chest, but it made no difference
in the end. Grant KO'd Sullivan in the ninth ... Rumor is Grant
could face former heavy-weight champion  &UR; Michael Moorer  &LR; in
September if anyone can get Moorer's weight down to the heavyweight
limit, which means down to something remotely healthy ...
Featherweight champion  &UR; Naseem Hamed  &LR; claims a sore hand will make
him unavailable for his July 18 fight vs.  &UR; Kennedy
McKinney &LR; , &UR;  &LR; although many in boxing doubt it. Regardless of the
reason, he's out and  &UR; Roy Jones Jr. &LR;  has volunteered to move his
August fight to fill the July date. HBO was hoping to match him
with  &UR; Reggie Johnson  &LR; but Johnson is out with a shoulder problem.
It now appears likely that Jones will end up with World Boxing
Association light heavyweight champion  &UR; Lou Del Valle &LR; , &UR;  &LR; whose
scheduled defense last night disappeared when Holyfield-Akinwande
was canceled ... Don't ask me why, but  &UR; Julio Cesar Chavez  &LR; plans
to train in New York for his June 25 tuneup fight at Foxwoods in
Connecticut ... Promoter  &UR; Bob Arum &LR;  claims ``everything is open
after Sept. 18,'' the night of Chavez's rematch with De La Hoya. He
claims that means they're ready to face  &UR; Felix Trinidad  &LR; or  &UR; Ike
Quartey &LR; . If so, it's because De La Hoya ordered it, not because
Arum is looking for a toughy fight for his meal ticket ... You've
got to hand it to  &UR; Carlos Palomino &LR; . The 48-year-old former
welterweight champion's odd comeback came to an end after five
fights last weekend when he lost a 10-round decision to 30-year-old
 &UR; Wilfredo Rivera &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is 28-3-1 with his only losses to  &UR; Pernell
Whitaker  &LR; and De La Hoya. ``I gave it all I had,'' said Palomino,
who held the welterweight title from 1976-79. ``I will now
concentrate on my acting career.'' Good idea ... It was mistakenly
reported recently that Main Events' promotional contract with Lewis
had only one fight left to run on it. Fact is, only HBO's deal with
Lewis has one fight left. Main Events has a long-term deal to
promote him ... Lowell's  &UR; Mickey Ward  &LR; looks to play the spoiler
again tonight when he faces young, undefeated  &UR; Zab Judah  &LR; on ESPN2
from Miami. Judah has never lost a round on a judge's card since
turning pro in September 1996 and recently had a no-contest on his
record wiped out by a ruling from the Maryland State Athletic
Commission. Judah is 15-0 with 11 KOs.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When Holyfield's trainer,  &UR; Don Turner &LR; , was asked Friday if he
would accept a replacement for Akinwande on short notice, he
replied, ``Can't nobody beat him, so what's the big deal? Styles
don't make no difference to Evander. We would take even Tyson again
if he's available.'' ... You may have not gotten to see Holyfield
defend his WBA title against Akinwande, but it seems you'll see him
in the next  &UR; Spike Lee &LR;  film. Holyfield attended a benefit for the
Hale House in New York and made the high bid of $8,000 for a
walk-on part ... Philadelphia fighters stick together.
International Boxing Federation middleweight champion  &UR; Bernard
Hopkins &LR;  has loaned his belt to former US Boxing Association
lightweight champion  &UR; Ivan Robinson &LR;  to gaze at as he prepares for
his June 27 bout with IBF lightweight champion  &UR; Shane Mosley &LR;  at
the Apollo at Temple University ... Arum is going ahead with a
specious libel suit against New York Daily News boxing writer
 &UR; Michael Katz &LR;  for an article critical of Arum's decision to try to
stage a fight between  &UR; Buster Douglas &LR;  and Chelsea's  &UR; John Ruiz  &LR; on
Yom Kippur. Katz's column was published in the International Boxing
Digest yet Arum has demanded a retraction in the Daily News, which
is ludicrous, and claims in his suit that the thrust of Katz's
article ``is that Mr. Arum lacks the integrity to be a fight
promoter.'' If Arum had any integrity, he wouldn't have filed such
a clearly frivolous suit apparently designed to harass and
intimidate one of his harshest critics into silence. If he had any
integrity, by the way, he also wouldn't be a boxing promoter.

REVOLUTION HAVE THEIR HANDS FULL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY _ It's a matter of controlling the ball.
</P>
<P>
   That's something the Los Angeles Galaxy, as well as the
Revolution, like to do. Each wants to dictate the play, so putting
pressure on the ball was something the Revolution stressed in
practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a much better job in being aggressive,'' said
Revolution coach Thomas Rongen before leaving with his team for Los
Angeles, where they play the Galaxy Sunday night. ``It's a team
that can hurt you in different ways, with the through ball, with
good speed up front, and we're going to try to take it away with a
sweeper, like we did against New York-New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done. The 11-2 Galaxy happen to be Major League
Soccer's best team, one equally strong on offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Revolution are 4-7, with four consecutive losses.
</P>
<P>
   Each team is missing players who have World Cup duty. Forward
Joe-Max Moore and defender Mike Burns are away from the Revolution,
and midfielder Cobi Jones from the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy prefer to move the ball forward with short passes and
once in a while with the long ball. They rarely play the solo game,
preferring to attack with numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do one of two things,'' Revolution midfielder Edwin
Gorter said. ``You can change your whole system, or you can play
your game, and we're going to do that. We can't chase, we have to
play with possession of the game. When we have the ball, we have to
play with it and not give it back every 15-20 seconds. That would
be very hard on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy average nearly three goals a game and have the
league's best scorer in Welton, who was traded by the Revolution
for a first-round draft choice last season. A speedy player, he has
11 goals and 8 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Motajo, a Galaxy player in 1996, may play his first game
for the Revolution Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they turn the ball over, they can't attack you, so if we
keep the ball and don't lose it going forward, we should do quite
well for ourselves,'' he said. ``If we can put pressure on them and
make them make mistakes, we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to match up with Welton man to man,'' said
Rongen, who will have David Nakhid in the middle of the defense.
``We're going to have to make more adjustments than Los Angeles on
the road and try to get a result, that's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another new ingredient for the Galaxy in forward Carlos
Hermosillo, Mexico's all-time leading scorer, who, strangely, did
not make that country's World Cup team. He averaged two goals a
game last season for Cruz Azul, a team he's been with since 1991.
Hermosillo, 33, is expected to step in for Clint Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hermosillo is a target player who is actually slow,'' Rongen
said. ``He's a power goal-scorer and he makes them a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   Revolution goalkeeper Ian Feuer, with a 1.90 goals-against
average, should be busy, considering that the Galaxy make good on
44 percent of their shots on net. They are coming off an 8-1 win at
Dallas Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a little bit of work,'' Feuer said. ``If we can
contain them a bit and get our game going well, we'll be OK. It's a
question of who's going to be able to keep the ball most of the
night. Hopefully, we can pressure them into mistakes and go from
there.''

ONE FALSE MOVE FOILS SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One balk call was worth a thousand words Saturday at Fenway
Park. It prompted strong opinions from the Mets and Red Sox. Lusty
echoes by a mixed bag of fans. And a final say by an umpiring crew
who stood by the call even though they seemed to disagree on what
had happened.
</P>
<P>
   When all was said and done, the Red Sox were stuck with a 1-0
loss to the visiting New Yorkers in a hard-fought contest that left
a sellout crowd of 32,545 buzzing long afterward. The victory went
to Bobby Jones (5-3), who outdueled Tim Wakefield (6-3) as they
each worked eight innings. The game was decided in the sixth inning
on a balk call against Wakefield that scored Brian McRae from third
base.
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 ways to balk and Wakefield, who gave up only one
hit, apparently found one of them. According to plate umpire Terry
Craft, who made the call, Wakefield started his motion and then
stepped off the rubber. As it turned out, it didn't matter that
third base umpire Al Clark thought Wakefield had stepped off first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sucks,'' said an angry Wakefield. ``We're trying to win a
championship here. You hold a ball club to one hit in eight innings
and you walk off the field with a loss. It shouldn't happen like
that. One run shouldn't beat this ball club, and it did. It's hard
to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Craft said later that Wakefield had committed the balk long
before stepping off. In his view, the knuckleballer had halted his
windup, broken his hands, then backed off in an attempt to counter
the movement of McRae, who was dancing off third and indeed has the
speed to steal home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pitcher has to step off the mound before he can move his
hands,'' said Craft. ``He moved his hands and then stepped off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares which one of us sees it?'' said Clark. ``We're not
out there vying for the call. We're out there to get as many things
correct as we can. Terry saw it. He's looking right at it and can
see his hands move a lot better than I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny how things work out. Coming off a 9-2 loss Friday to the
Mets (whose fans filled about half the seats at Fenway Saturday),
the Red Sox were praying for a strong pitching performance.
Wakefield gave them that, allowing only a single by third baseman
Edgardo Alfonzo in the second inning that had nothing to do with
the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield walked only one _ but that was McRae leading off the
sixth. With Bernard Gilkey at bat, McRae took second on a delayed
steal. He reached third on a ground out by John Olerud, and the
two-out balk got him home and started the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clark didn't call anything,'' said Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams. ``He thought Wakefield had stepped off. But the home
plate umpire said he broke his hands. Can they see both? I don't
know. Maybe you can with those friendly eyes always looking at each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield left after eight innings, tired and frustrated. The
Mets got another hit in the ninth off Tom Gordon but did not score.
</P>
<P>
   There will be days like this, said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never waste a great pitching performance,'' said Williams,
``and that's what Wakefield gave us today. We might have gotten
beat, but credit the other guy, who just pitched better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it's just a shame to decide a game on a call like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield did not share the win-some-lose-some philosophy of his
manager. He was angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen the replays, and truthfully I don't want to
watch it,'' he said. ``I don't know if that's the right call.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had one umpire that said it was, and another who said it
wasn't. It stinks. But stuff happens. I didn't want him to steal
home. I just wanted to keep him honest and keep him close. And I
got called for a balk.''

SPLITTING HEADACHES PERSIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scene was Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home of the Greatest
Spectacle in Racing. Al Unser Jr. was sitting on the wall along pit
row, watching his cousin, Robby Unser, qualify during time trials
for the 82d Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   A two-time winner of the Indy 500, Al Jr. was rendered nothing
more than a spectator because of the nasty feud between
Championship Auto Racing Teams _ with which Unser is aligned as a
driver for Roger Penske _ and the Indy Racing League, founded by
Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, Unser was at the Brickyard to lend his cousin
support, but it was clear how much he missed being in the race.
When George approached Unser, fans sitting in the stands spotted
them and weighed in with their opinion on the CART-IRL split,
chanting, ``Bring him back, Tony!''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would love to see it happen. Everyone would love to see
CART and the IRL get together. Everyone, that is, except for CART
and the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   Three years into their rift, CART and the IRL appear to be
growing further apart. Each series has landed title sponsorship for
this season, FedEx signing on with CART and PepBoys with the IRL.
Each has attempted to establish its niche as an open-wheel racing
series, CART on a worldwide circuit of street and road courses, the
IRL on American ovals.
</P>
<P>
   But is there a chance that middle ground can be found at Indy?
It is unlikely, though parties on both sides have expressed concern
about Indy remaining a viable marketing vehicle for the sport.
Television ratings for both series have suffered, enabling NASCAR
to rise as the premier motor sports series.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's Indy 500 drew a 5.5 TV rating nationally; CART's
Motorola 300 at Madison, Ill., which ran the day before, opposite
Game 3 of the Bulls-Pacers NBA Eastern finals, drew a 1.5 rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been expressions on both sides they would like to
be here, and we would love to have them feel welcome here, and they
always have been,'' said George, who this year scrapped the
``25-8'' qualifying rule that provided guaranteed starting spots to
the Top 25 IRL drivers and scaled back preparations from a month to
a fortnight to make it more affordable for IRL teams to practice
and qualify at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tries to characterize this as the IRL keeping the
drivers away. The drivers really don't have a whole lot to say or
do about the situation. I'm sure they miss being here and some
probably don't know what it is like being here so they don't miss
it.''
</P>
<P>
   There remains a constituency of fans who would love nothing more
than to see the return of such CART drivers as Unser and Michael
Andretti. The problem now is that the IRL has implemented its new
chassis and engine formula, which means CART would have to play by
IRL rules at Indy, making it cost-prohibitive for any CART team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's practical,'' said Fred Treadway, an IRL
owner who fields cars for Arie Luyendyk. ``I think (Indy) already
is the Super Bowl for anybody who wants to come here.
Unfortunately, I can't beat anybody who doesn't show up here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there'll be a (CART-IRL) Super Bowl,'' he
continued, ``because if we're running this equipment, we're going
to have an advantage over them, because we'll have been able to
test it and run it and we'll have established relationships with
the engine and chassis manufacturers. So the people in CART or
anyone else coming into this race is going to have the same amount
of expenses, and it's real difficult to find sponsors to give you
enough money to run this one race.''
</P>
<P>
   And this leaves accomplished CART drivers such as Al Unser Jr.,
who will toe the line Sunday at the ITT Detroit Grand Prix, sitting
on the fence at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are a couple who very much want to come back,''
George said. ``And I hope they have the opportunity to come back,
because they would certainly be welcome.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   After finishing dead last at Indy,  &UR; Tony Stewart  &LR; gained a
measure of redemption by starting on the pole for last night's IRL
True Value 500K at Texas Motor Speedway. Stewart set a track record
during pole qualifications Friday with a lap of 224.448 miles per
hour around the 1.5-mile oval. ``Winning the pole makes us feel
like we're back on track,'' said Stewart, who was bumped from the
front row at Indy by Plano, Texas, native  &UR; Greg Ray  &LR; and then
surrendered the lead to Ray when his engine seized after 22 laps.
``Indy was Indy. That's behind us now and we're ready to look
forward.'' ...  &UR; A.J. Foyt  &LR; said the reason his driver,  &UR; Billy
Boat &LR; , &UR;  &LR; was knocked out of contention early in the Indy 500 was
that Boat's pole-winning car was sabotaged the night before the
race; it was discovered that LocTite, a gluelike substance, had
been poured over the engine. Just a thought, but did anyone check
Luyendyk for fingerprints? Luyendyk, you'll recall, got into a
Victory Lane brouhaha with Foyt last year at Texas Motor Speedway
after blustering into Boat's apparent victory celebration and
claiming he was the rightful winner. Luyendyk was later vindicated
when he was proven correct, but not before he was cuffed around by
Foyt ...  &UR; Davey Hamilton  &LR; once again was carrying the Reebok logo
on his IRL car in last night's race, and he will do so for the
remainder of the season. The Stoughton-based shoe company
originally signed on as sponsor for  &UR; Eliseo Salazar &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but when he
failed to qualify for the Indy 500, Reebok jumped aboard Hamilton's
ride with Neinhouse Motorsports for the race and extended the
sponsorship for the season ... Two-time defending NASCAR Winston
Cup champion  &UR; Jeff Gordon  &LR; won the pole for last night's NASCAR
Winston Cup race at Richmond, the Pontiac Excitement 400, by
setting a track record during qualifications Friday. Gordon broke
his own three-year-old track record at Richmond International
Raceway with a lap of 125.558 ... The Formula One series will make
its lone stop on the North American continent Sunday in Montreal,
where defending series champion and local favorite  &UR; Jacques
Villeneuve  &LR; hopes to acquit himself after last year's debacle.
Villeneuve spoiled a triumphant homecoming to Circuit Gilles
Villeneuve, the track named after his late father, when he crashed
on the second lap ... After winning the Icebreaker in April,  &UR; Mike
Stefanik  &LR; of Coventry, R.I., will go for his second victory of the
season at Thompson (Conn.) Speedway in Sunday's Shaw's 300
Featherlite Modified Series event.

NOT RIGHT TIME FOR PEGRAM, BAFFERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ELMONT, N.Y. _ By 3:15 p.m., when Mike Pegram was into his
fifth Bud Light and Bob Baffert had tapped his foot for the 1,000th
time, the owner and trainer of Real Quiet decided time was moving
too slowly, way too slowly, so they headed away from Real Quiet's
barn, walked across Hempstead Turnpike, and headed for a greasy
spoon diner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burger and fries,'' wisecracked Baffert. ``Can you imagine the
guy in the diner thinking, `Hey, isn't that Real Quiet's trainer in
here ordering a burger and fries two hours before the race?' But it
was good ... and I finished all the fries, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Time passed, still so slowly. A few minutes before 5, just 45
minutes before the race, Baffert kept asking one and all, ``What
time is it?'' And, ``Anybody got the right time?''
</P>
<P>
   Now Baffert paused outside Real Quiet's barn and said, as he
said last year with Silver Charm, ``the whole experience has been
tremendous. It's great trying to be part of history.''
</P>
<P>
   And then it was 5, and Baffert walked from the barn, took a
right, then headed down into the tunnel that connects the
backstretch to the paddock behind the Belmont Park clubhouse. Real
Quiet was a good furlong behind Baffert and Pegram, and the two
seemed relieved that the time finally had come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch out for the horse (expletive),'' Baffert shouted to
Pegram as they avoided the manure there in the darkness of the
tunnel. And when the two emerged back into the light, Baffert began
scaling Real Quiet buttons into the throngs and Pregram stopped for
a fan begging for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   In the paddock, Chris McCarron, the rider of Thomas Jo, shouted
good luck wishes to Baffert, who was scaling even more Real Quiet
buttons into the thousands in the paddock. Then Baffert gave his
final instructions to jockey Kent Desormeaux and headed up the
steps to the owner's box.
</P>
<P>
   But not before shouting some wisecracks at Gary Stevens, the
jockey aboard Victory Gallop, the one horse Baffert knew he had to
fear in this field of 13 in the Belmont. ``I heard him,'' said
Stevens, ``but I had my game face on and I didn't want him to know
that he could get to me, so I didn't say anything back.''
</P>
<P>
   This was New York, so sentimentality be damned and even if
Baffert was only moments from a Triple Crown, he noticed a band of
hecklers pounding a window that separated the stairs to the owner's
box from the masses. ``They were saying, `Bob, not today,' and I
thought I saw a sign that said that. Then my little 7-year-old son
said to me, `Dad, there's a guy there with a sign that says, `Not
today.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not today.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Baffert had been at the barn in the early morning and went back
to the Garden City Motel to change ... change? He emerged after
noon in his superstitious outfit, the ungodly combination of blue
blazer and green pants and colorful yellow tie that had been given
to him by Australians who had met Baffert in Dubai in March when
Baffert's Silver Charm won the Dubai World Cup. Baffert wore the
outfit in Louisville for the Kentucky Derby, then in Baltimore for
the Preakness, and now here again in New York for the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   The same underwear, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well ... ''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, Baffert had gone through his tales of the day
before, of how he had gone to Yankee Stadium Friday night for the
Yankees' game against Florida, of how he had bowed and prostrated
himself at the feet of New York manager Joe Torre, met Yankee
pitcher David Wells (``I asked him who he liked in the race,'' said
Baffert, ``and he told me `Hot Wells.' Figures.'') Then Baffert sat
outside Barn 9 with his brothers and waited and waited, his feet
tapping nervously.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram, meanwhile, was into his fourth beer of the day and
telling his tales, of how he hadn't worn a tie ``in the '90s,'' but
how he was faced with a quandary of all quandaries as he got ready
to gavel open the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street Friday
morning. Gosh, said Pegram, ``I was really excited about doing that
... it meant a lot to me to open the Exchange, but the limo driver
was telling me I needed to wear a tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, said Pegram, ``I just followed the advice my daddy gave me
a long time ago ... `Never make a decision until you have to make
it' ... and my daddy, once again, was right. Nobody asked me to
wear a tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram raised a leg up on the wood fence outside Real Quiet's
barn and talked of how unreal this whole experience had seemed to
him. A reporter mentioned that he had read somewhere that Pegram
had described it as ``an out-of-body experience'' and then Pegram
was asked if he ever had had such an out-of-body event.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times you been married?'' came back the wisecrack
from the owner. Really, though, he went on, ``an out-of-body
experience is when you know it's happening but it's too good to be
happening to you. It's almost too good to be true. It's like I'm
standing over there watching me do this.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for philosophy. That's because Pegram had some 200 of
his nearest and dearest at the race ``and you know what I did? I
forgot the tickets to the owner's box. I was begging for the
tickets all week and I have 'em for 12 hours and then I lose 'em.
Thirty tickets and I lose 'em. Heck, it's only Belmont Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried? Pegram was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, they can't keep me out of the winner's circle so how are
they going to keep us out of our box?'' replied the owner. ``I know
the number of the box ... this is New York, isn't it? You just just
march in, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram had just moved to Seattle back in 1977 to begin amassing
his fortune with McDonald's franchises when Seattle Slew wowed the
racing world with his Triple Crown. ``It really hit me,'' he said.
``I had just moved to Seattle then and Seattle Slew's owners had
paid only $17,000 for him, just like we did, and now here I am. I
mean, the similarities between the two stories are just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about then, some two hours before the race, that Baffert
stopped tapping his feet enough to get up, move over to Pegram, jab
a phantom microphone under Pegram's chin and say, ``For a guy who
never would talk to the press this guy's come a long way. But thank
God he came around and talked because I ran out of things to say
two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert then left, walked back over to Real Quiet's barn and
pretended to vomit. Then the trainer sat down, the foot tapping
non-stop once again. Time was moving slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont clubhouse can be seen from Barn 9, even if it is a
good 10-minute walk. There, the echoes of past greatness in Triple
Crowns watched with mixed feelings. Mrs. Patrice Wolfson, widow of
Louis Wolfson, whose Harbor View Farm owned Affirmed, noted that it
been such a glorious time in 1970s when first Secretariat, then
Seattle Slew, and finally her Affirmed won Triple Crowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1970s we were all spoiled,'' said Mrs. Wolfson. ``what
with Secretariat and then Seattle Slew and Affirmed. Maybe it might
be time for a different horse to win the Triple Crown.''
</P>
<P>
   And those who could read between lines and pauses might have
concluded that Mrs. Wolfson meant a lesser horse as much as a
different one.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Penny Chenery, the former Penny Tweedy, is associated with
Triple Crowns as much the memory of Secretariat itself, and she
watched Baffert and Pegram have such a good time leading up to the
race. If she could have done anything different in watching her
Secretariat stride to greatness, Chenery said, it would have been
to enjoy the experience more than she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing people shouldn't be so stiff,'' said Chenery, who
herself was stiff 25 years ago. ``I wish I felt that freedom to
celebrate Secretariat's win. Instead, I felt so much pressure,
particularly at the Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could please me more,'' said Chenery of the prospect
of the Triple Crown club having a new member. ``I knew there would
be other Triple Crown winners (after Secretariat's win in 1973),
but when it comes to records, I can get possessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretariat, of course, set track records at Churchill Downs,
Pimlico and Belmont in his sweep of the Triple Crown races, a stark
indicator of his greatness. And Saturday ...
</P>
<P>
   No worries for Chenery as the horses ran the Belmont in 2:29,
some five seconds slower than Secretariat's time.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When Desormeaux moved on the turn, that undulating, gradual but
killing turn that penalizes anyone who wants to go three-wide in a
1 1/2-mile race, ``I thought I had it. For a minute there, I could
taste it.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet opened up 5 lengths on the field and seemed home, a
sure Triple Crown winner. Later, Desormeaux said he had moved too
soon, but who knew it then? Baffert watched Victory Gallop gallop
down Real Quiet's flank and mouthed, ``Go, go, go, GO! We got it?
We got it?''
</P>
<P>
   There was a question mark in Baffert's appeal, and long minutes
would pass before the picture worth $5 million would answer that
question. Real Quiet had lost the Belmont by a nose, Victory Gallop
catching him in the absolute final jump of a mile-and-a-half race.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most classic of races, one of indescribable
excitement, and once again it proved that all things in horse
racing must be earned. Baffert, though, kept being himself,
wisecracking to the end, just as he had last year when his Silver
Charm failed to win the Triple Crown by a neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real Quiet just ran out of gas,'' said Baffert. ``I'm getting
closer (to winning the Triple Crown). Last year we lost by a neck,
this year by a nose ... maybe next year we'll win by open
daylight.''
</P>
<P>
   And Elliot Walden, the trainer of Victory Gallop, said this when
asked if he had any empathy for Baffert, losing the Triple Crown in
consecutive years by the smallest of margins. ``No,'' said Walden,
``I have no empathy for Bob Baffert. It's not about beating Bob
Baffert.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic game, it's a cruel game, horse racing.

REAL QUIET NOSED OUT BY VICTORY GALLOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The critics who said that Real Quiet was unworthy of
a Triple Crown championship were right, but only by the length of
an equine's nostril. That was the margin by which Victory Gallop
denied Real Quiet's bid to become the 12th Triple Crown winner in
Saturday's 130th running of the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   If Real Quiet's owner Mike Pegram, trainer Bob Baffert, and
jockey Kent Desormeaux, who collectively lost the $5 million Visa
Triple Crown bonus by a nose, were the three unluckiest men at
Belmont Park Saturday, the three luckiest were in the stewards'
stand. Real Quiet came out and bumped Victory Gallop twice, the
second time very soundly, and the stewards announced that they
would have disqualified Real Quiet had the bob of the head gone the
other way. That would have been quite a scene, taking down a 4-5
shot and depriving him of the Triple Crown before a crowd of
80,162, the second largest in the Belmont history. Disqualifying
Real Quiet would have been the correct call, but Belmont might not
be standing today if it had had to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux made a move aboard Real Quiet, going to the front
from the outside with 5 furlongs to go in the 1 1/2-mile race. The
Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner moved clear entering the
stretch, opened a 4-length lead passing the eighth-pole, then began
to run out of gas. Meanwhile, Victory Gallop kicked in and came
storming down the middle of the track. The winner, who had run
second in both the Derby and Preakness, survived the bumping and
Real Quiet was beaten at the wire. Thomas Jo, a 28-1 shot ridden by
Chris McCarron, finished third. The race was run in 2:29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult to sit at the three-eighths pole and not
move, believe me,'' said Gary Stevens, who sat chilly on Victory
Gallop as Real Quiet moved away. ``But I gained so much confidence
riding him in the Preakness that I knew to wait. Real Quiet made an
explosive move but he was tiring coming to the eighth-pole. That's
when we made our move. I thought we'd get to him but he made strong
contact with me. I thought we would have won by a neck but he hit
us hard. It's fortunate that he got up and the stewards didn't have
to go through that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary and I talked about tracking Real Quiet,'' said Elliot
Walden, who trains Victory Gallop for Prestonwood Farm. ``The idea
was to stalk him. He let our horse settle and that's because he
felt confident in him. The main thing was to let Real Quiet make
his move, weather the storm, and not go when he goes. We thought we
should stay cool, calm, and collected, and go after him late.''
</P>
<P>
   This was deja vu for Baffert, who lost the Triple Crown and the
$5 million bonus at the wire last year when Touch Gold, ridden by
McCarron, caught Silver Charm, who was ridden by Stevens, nearing
the wire to prevail by a half-length. ``You ran out of horse and
that's my fault,'' Baffert told Desormeaux at the postrace press
conference. ``I don't think so,'' Desormeaux responded. ``I don't
think he saw him coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum change was too drastic for Real Quiet,''
continued Desormeaux. ``I saw Victory Gallop coming and I tried to
show him to Real Quiet, but it didn't work out. I pulled his head
out a little too hard and he did come out and that's why the
inquiry was posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come so far, to get so close, and now it's all gone, it's a
tough pill to swallow. I thought we were in trouble at the
eighth-pole. I knew he was starting to slow down. He was lost on
the lead and I knew if someone aimed at him as a target they might
catch him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit premature when I moved. I wish I had it to do
over again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard race,'' said Baffert. ``He just got tired at the
end. It was a great run but it's a letdown. It looked like we had
it won.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pressure on Kent. He thought he was home
free, and nobody's home free.''

NEW LEAGUE PLAN NOT NEWS TO THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bob Caporale and Randy Vataha, who run Game Plan Inc. in
Boston, feel good about the new football league proposed by Ted
Turner. They think it validates many of the concepts on which they
based their own venture, the All-American Football League, which
was scheduled to open in the spring of 1999 but is on hold until
Turner and General Electric decide whether to go forward with their
alternative league, which has caused great intrigue around America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It validates all of our research,'' said Caporale, who knows
about alternative leagues from his experience with the New England
Tea Men and the Boston Breakers. ``There's a market there. No
question. The second thing it validates is the concept of single
entity (i.e. the league owning the teams). They've added a new
dimension if they go forward, in that they're making major changes
in the industry in the future in that this would be corporate
ownership of an entire league rather than corporate ownership of
individual teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The concepts that NBC and TNT are talking about are the very
ones that Caporale and Vataha have researched for a couple of
years. But a key difference is that Vataha and Caporale don't
believe they could succeed going head to head with the NFL in the
fall, which the new league intends to do.
</P>
<P>
   Why might it work for the Turner league?
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd have complete control over TV,'' said Vataha. ``They've
got NBC and TNT at night. They don't have to make a TV deal. They
can promote it. They have the marketing thump of Time-Warner. With
NBC and GE, you have a bottomless pit of resources. The biggest
part of a new league is controlling your expenses and having enough
resources to see it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Vataha and Caporale know the problems associated with getting a
TV deal, because it has been a major problem in the launching of
their own league.
</P>
<P>
   With TV taken care of, an obstacle could be securing stadiums.
Vataha and Caporale spent a significant amount of time trying to
secure venues; they were able to get stadiums for most of their
teams, but it wasn't easy. In fact, in Boston, where Turner would
like to market a team, the All-American League has been unable to
find a place to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have to make decisions on their markets,'' said
Caporale. ``Some of the bigger markets have more than one facility,
but many don't. It's a little less of a problem in New York, and
probably not a problem in LA. In Chicago, there's Soldier Field,
and is there another field they go to there?''
</P>
<P>
   Both men agree that the most compelling issue is competing for
advertising dollars, viewership, and sponsorships. If it's in the
fall, the new league would go head to head not only with the NFL
but also with major college football.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not as simple as playing games at a different time or
on a different day of the week. Vataha says they couldn't pick
Friday because of high school football. They can't play Saturday
because of college football. Sunday and Monday nights are out
because of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you did it on Wednesday or Thursday night, you couldn't get
the games on NBC because those time slots are too valuable,'' he
said. ``It would have to be on TNT. And if you're doing it on a
weeknight, you're defeating the purpose because a family going to
an NFL game on a weekend is probably paying $200 for tickets. With
kids going back to school, it would be hard to attract families to
attend games.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are compelling reasons for starting up a new league,
Vataha and Caporale figure Turner and NBC head Dick Ebersol will
soon find reasons for not going ahead, or will back off their
original plan to compete head to head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been there with new leagues,'' said Vataha. ``You just
don't know. There's no guarantees on this thing. What it proves is
that there are some smart people at high levels who feel there is a
market for another professional football league. That's exactly
what our research showed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vataha said no one from Turner or NBC has contacted them
regarding their research. While they would like to see their own
league start up, they wouldn't mind being part of the Turner/NBC
venture if asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that people close to the scene there say it's 75-25
they'll go through with it, but I still think it's 50-50,'' said
Vataha. ``They know the compelling reasons for it, but now the
obstacles are beginning to come into place.''
</P>

   In assessing players in his strength and conditioning program,
 &UR; Johnny Parker  &LR; was thrilled with linebackers  &UR; Ted Johnson  &LR; and
 &UR; Chris Slade &LR; , center  &UR; Dave Wohlabaugh &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and backup center/guard
 &UR; Heath Irwin &LR; . In addition, he cited great work by the sophomore
class of linemen:  &UR; Ed Ellis &LR; , &UR; Scott Rehberg &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Juan Porter &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Slade should be no surprise. Johnson may be the best
middle linebacker in the game and should be in line for the next
 &UR; Willie McGinest &LR; -like contract (or the Patriots' front office
should have its collective head examined).
</P>
<P>
   All of these players participated in more than 80 percent of the
program, which to Parker is just about a guarantee that they will
stay strong and have an injury-free season.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the program doesn't end until June 26, but players
usually scatter after minicamp. Parker wasn't pleased with the
commitment last year. How about this year?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been OK,'' he said. ``Nothing to get excited about. We
really won't know how successful it was until the players start
performing on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some players, the program was grueling this year,
especially with the introduction of sandbag work, which is designed
to help players with shifting weight they'll encounter during
games.
</P>
<P>
   How did some other big names fare _ say,  &UR; Drew Bledsoe &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not enough evidence for this jury to decide,'' said Parker,
who learned about quarterback conditioning from  &UR; Phil Simms &LR;  when
Parker worked for  &UR; Bill Parcells  &LR; with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simms taught me that the key for a quarterback is to keep his
entire body strong,'' said Parker. ``A quarterback uses more than
his arm. He's also subject to blind hits, which is a lot different
than the head-to-head contact linemen take.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker said  &UR; Terry Glenn &LR;  ``was severely restricted by his
(clavicle) injury. There's still enough time left for him to have a
productive offseason. The key is consistency, staying with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn left for three weeks on personal business, which set him
back, and also did not participate in the weekend minicamp.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Patriots running back coach  &UR; Kirby Wilson &LR;  inherited  &UR; Curtis
Martin  &LR; in his first year in the job last season, and now he may
have the toughest coaching job on the team: preparing someone to
replace Martin. He wouldn't be surprised if it turns out to be
 &UR; Robert Edwards &LR; . ``I think people are going to be surprised by
him,'' said Wilson. ``He's bigger than Curtis and he appears to be
a step faster. Of course, Curtis was an All-Pro and Robert has a
long way to go before he can be that.'' Wilson on  &UR; Sedrick
Shaw &LR; : &UR;  &LR; ``We saw how he improved during the course of last year
just in practice. That's what you ask for. So far he's been here
every day working out and he's been working hard with Coach Parker.
I can't wait to start working with him.'' Wilson also has two new
fullbacks to break in,  &UR; Tony Carter  &LR; and  &UR; Chris Floyd &LR; , replacing
 &UR; Sam Gash  &LR; and  &UR; Keith Byars &LR; . ``We've upgraded ourselves
tremendously from an athletic point of view,'' said Wilson.
``Obviously we've lost an attitude that Sam and Keith had, the
experience they had, the leadership they had. From what I've seen
of Chris, he's a good blocker and he can catch the ball. But we
won't know much until we see them in pads.'' ... Much of the
running game's success will depend on the offensive line. According
to line coach  &UR; Paul Boudreau &LR; , &UR;  &LR; even though millions have been
earmarked to a unit consisting of tackles  &UR; Bruce Armstrong  &LR; and
 &UR; Zefross Moss &LR; , &UR;  &LR; guards  &UR; Todd Rucci  &LR; and  &UR; Max Lane &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and center
 &UR; Dave Wohlabaugh &LR; , &UR;  &LR; ``I'm going to recommend the best people to
start. If we don't play the best people, regardless of how much
money they make, that's hurting our team.'' Boudreau thinks that
Rehberg, who has been moved to right guard, is ahead of  &UR; Damon
Denson  &LR; (left guard) and Ellis (right tackle). ``I'm pleased with
all three, really,'' said Boudreau. ``Scott picked things up faster
last year, Ed was from a smaller school (Buffalo) and his progress
is like night and day from last year. Damon comes from a big school
(Michigan) and he's played in a million big games. He's got a
guard's body, but this is only the third year he's played the
position because he used to be a defensive tackle.'' Rehberg has
been a workout monster and now has 340 pounds on his 6-foot-8-inch
frame. Ellis, at 6-6, 338, has turned much of his baby fat to
muscle. Denson, who has legs like tree trunks, needed to improve
his foot speed and has done so. He's the little guy in the group at
6-3, 315 ... The only Patriot rookie who is a consensus GTE
Academic All-American and an Associated Press and Walter Camp
All-American is none other than  &UR; Brian Lee &LR; , &UR;  &LR; an undrafted free
safety out of Wyoming. Though Lee was timed at only 4.6 in the 40,
he did win several high school sprint titles. By the way, the only
other academic and football All-American this year was  &UR; Peyton
Manning &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the No. 1 pick in the entire draft.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he doesn't have any interest in  &UR; Dave Meggett
 &LR; ``at this time.'' The last three are the key words. Meggett may
not be ready until October anyway because of foot surgery. But he
may be the veteran sparkplug Parcells could use at midseason. ``I
have interest in him as a person,'' said Parcells ... Once again,
Parcells's strength and conditioning program was well-attended.
Most Jets players made their minimum 40 workout dates. One player
still lagging is  &UR; Keyshawn Johnson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is more than 10 short ...
Troubled running back  &UR; Lawrence Phillips  &LR; apparently is taking
football seriously again. His minicamp weight was 216 pounds, which
is down from 240 last season with the Dolphins ... One of the
clinchers in the reworking of  &UR; Chris Doleman's  &LR; contract with the
49ers was the team allowing him to skip minicamp ... Having already
tied up many of their key players for the long term, the Jaguars
did the same with receiver  &UR; Keenan McCardell  &LR; last week, inking him
to a four-year, $15.5 million deal ... Veteran receiver  &UR; Alvin
Harper  &LR; has been a no-show at the New Orleans minicamps, giving
rise to speculation that he may retire ... The Bears saved $2.3
million this year and $2.5 million next year by releasing middle
linebacker  &UR; Bryan Cox &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a smart choice for a team going nowhere.
Cox is drawing interest from the Raiders ... The Bengals are said
to be interested in  &UR; Vinny Testaverde &LR; , who was released by the
Ravens. With  &UR; Boomer Esiason  &LR; gone, the Bengals are counting on
 &UR; Jeff Blake  &LR; to get serious about quarterbacking again ...  &UR; Shawn
Lee &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a 10-year defensive tackle with the Chargers, is shopping
for a new home. He plans to visit the Bears ... The Raiders cut
loose Super Bowl XXX hero  &UR; Larry Brown &LR;  and veteran cornerback
 &UR; Terry McDaniel &LR; , who may be a candidate for the Patriots ...
Speedy recovery wishes to  &UR; Michael George &LR; , one of the good guy
agents, who is recovering from a heart attack. George represents
 &UR; Vincent Brisby &LR; , &UR; Troy Brown &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Ben Coates  &LR; on the Patriots
... Sure, the Hartford meeting may be another case of posturing by
Patriots owner  &UR; Bob Kraft &LR; , but at some point he may become serious
about moving the team there. And that point may not be far away.

COOKIE FINDS PURPOSE AS MAGIC'S WIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They're calling it a debut. They're saying it's a
career move from out of the blue.
</P>
<P>
   Silly critics.
</P>
<P>
   Earletha ``Cookie'' Johnson knows her husband Earvin has been
setting the stage for ``The Magic Hour,'' the late-night talk show
he'll unveil Monday on Channel 11, for as long as she has known
him.
</P>
<P>
   Before pilot guest Mel Gibson, there was Cookie, who wasn't sure
what to expect when she first sat across from Johnson, not on some
elaborate set but at a no-frills restaurant in Lansing, Michigan,
in early 1978, midway through their freshman year at Michigan
State.
</P>
<P>
   They had met briefly at a party right before the Christmas break
but had exchanged so few words, Cookie was amused when Magic asked
her for her phone number at the end of the night and bemused when
he called her weeks later, on the very first day of the new school
term.
</P>
<P>
   Magic already was living up to his nickname on the basketball
court so Cookie half-expected to spend the evening listening to the
bluster of a big-headed jock. Either that or she worried it would
be one of those excruciating first dates, replete with stilted
conversation and awkward pauses.
</P>
<P>
   The night turned out to be a delight as the Magic mien made
Cookie forget her own shyness. By the time their meals arrived,
Earletha and Earvin were talking and laughing like long lost
friends.
</P>
<P>
   That's Magic's spell, his wife says. Give him five minutes and
he can put anybody at ease.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't see what difference a few cameras and a studio
audience will make. If ever there was a man who can tune the world
in with his smile, she says, it's her husband, the legendary Lakers
point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earvin is so real, he's so comfortable,'' Cookie says. ``From
the very beginning, that's what I found so attractive about him.
I've never seen him try to impress anyone. He just goes about being
himself and (his sway over people) just kind of happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of Cookie, who never crumbled when
Johnson fathered a son by someone else a couple of years into their
courtship. Or when he ended their first engagement by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Or when, a few months after they finally were married and only
two days after she discovered she was pregnant with their first
child, he broke the news to her that he had tested positive for the
virus that causes AIDS, an explicit admission of his sexual
wanderings.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all she stayed true to herself, her faith, and,
ultimately, her man, who, miracle of miracles, is staring hard at
another beginning instead of the beginning of the end that appeared
so near in the first week of the penultimate month of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Cookie declares her husband ``cured'' inasmuch as Magic's blood
no longer shows any trace of the deadly virus that hastened his
initial retirement from the Lakers. She credits God, but the daily
medicine cocktails that Magic takes deserve at least an assist.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to make sense of it all now, Magic says, ``God needs a
messenger for HIV and AIDS and sex among young people and he knew I
would enjoy taking on that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But imagine being Cookie then, and waking up one glorious
November day to find out your life and that of your unborn child
could be in peril because of your husband's pursuit of carnal
pleasures. You'd need an oxygen tank and fins to plumb the depths
of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no dummy,'' says Cookie, 39, who has tested negative for
the AIDS virus. ``I knew he was not a saint (though) I didn't know
to what extent (he was not).''
</P>
<P>
   In the days after Magic's announcement, Cookie was the saintly
one. She could have been forgiven any public displays of anger
toward Johnson yet it was her affection for him that she chose to
show the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it would have been different if we had been married a
long time,'' says Cookie, who had been wed to Johnson less than a
year when a routine physical for an insurance policy spun their
world off its axis. ``To me, our love was more important than the
past. There was no way I was going to leave him to deal with it by
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that he had left her five years earlier, if not
at the altar then on the way to the church.
</P>
<P>
   They had stayed together but lived apart in the early `80s, with
Johnson leaving school for the NBA after his sophomore year and
Cookie staying behind to pursue her degree and then a career as a
department store buyer.
</P>
<P>
   When their long-distance romance led to an engagement in 1986,
it was accorded the kind of headlines you'd expect when one of the
world's most eligible bachelors meets his match. Cookie, who was
working in Toledo, Ohio, at the time, had hand-picked her wedding
party, settled on a ceremony site and narrowed her search for a
dress when the call came from Magic in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't ready to commit. The wedding was off.
</P>
<P>
   Cookie was crushed. ``Total devastation,'' she remembers
feeling. ``Total embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hadn't she pursued her own career so her life couldn't be
capsized by a man?
</P>

   ``That's it,'' Cookie told Magic once she had freed herself from
the sadness pulling her down and fought her way to the surface for
air. ``I can't do this anymore. I'm going to go on with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   And then she did. For more than a year, they exchanged no phone
calls, no letters, nothing. Magic was the one who finally re-opened
the lines of communication and even then it took another year
before Cookie felt she could trust him with her heart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, she moved out to L.A., but to her own place. It would
take another two years and a temblor that rocked her world for her
to find her niche, away from the Hollywood galas and Showtime's
glare.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to make the best of a bad situation, Magic and Cookie
in 1991 established the Magic Johnson Foundation, which raises
money for, and awareness of, AIDS-related matters, especially where
they concern disenfranchised children.
</P>
<P>
   Cookie, who nearly fainted from nerves the first time she had to
give a speech on behalf of the Foundation, now feels almost as
comfortable talking to people as her husband. She especially enjoys
interacting with children, starting with her own.
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old E.J., who is HIV-free, and 3-year-old Elisa, whom
the Johnsons adopted when she was three days old, give Cookie joy.
Her life as Magic's wife gives her purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very secure,'' she says, ``I'm a lot more tuned in to
me.''

MALONE MUST ARRIVE AND DELIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Karl Malone knows what people are thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Two games have been played in the NBA Finals and we're still
waiting for the Mailman's A game. Or his B Game. Or his C game.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded Saturday that his two-game performance _ 14 for 41,
more turnovers (6) than jump shots made (3), and only 13 free throw
attempts _ rated a pretty low grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``D minus,'' he said. ``That's an F in some schools.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is in the school of public opinion and in Malone's
grading system. He insisted after Utah's 93-88 loss in Game 2 that
the Jazz will not win the series if he doesn't improve. He said he
couldn't remember the last time he played three subpar games ``by
my standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off an uneven performance in last year's championship
series, the Mailman understands he'll be viewed as someone who
doesn't deliver in the Big One unless things change. He insisted
after Saturday's brief workout at Westminster College that he is
unfazed by any criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have gotten into this profession or stayed in this
profession if I couldn't take criticism,'' he said. ``That's part
of growing up. That's part of the business. You understand that
there are not always going to be good things said about you.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the only player on the Jazz who stayed around to field
queries Saturday. He said he had no plans to change the way he
plays. He did vow not to rush it, which is what he said he did last
year in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   He was 9 of 25 in the first game, an 88-85 Utah win in overtime.
He made only two jump shots. Game 2 was worse. He went without a
basket in the second half (0 for 4) and made only 5 of 16 shots
overall, including a single spot-up perimeter shot.
</P>
<P>
   In neither game did he lead the Jazz in scoring, a rarity. The
last time Malone did not lead the Jazz in scoring for two straight
playoff games was 1987, in Games 2 (Darrell Griffith) and 3 (Kelly
Tripucka) of the first-round series against Golden State. Utah had
played 124 playoff games before Malone ceded the scoring lead to
John Stockton (Game 1) and Jeff Hornacek (Game 2) in this year's
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   He's clearly struggling with his shot, because all of his 41
attempts have been consistent with the Jazz offensive system. He
said he will continue to keep shooting if the shots are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get passive,'' he said. ``But I also don't
think I'm playing relaxed. I have to guard against not trying to do
it all myself. I have to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it is,'' he continued, referring to the pressure.
``We played all those other (playoff) games just to get back here.
I know what's at stake. I want to win so bad. But I'm not going to
put any more pressure on myself. I have a hell of a lot already.
All I know is I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz watched film for about 40 minutes and then did some
light shooting. Utah coach Jerry Sloan snapped at the reporters
standing outside the coach's office, where the team was meeting.
``It's good you guys got some of it too,'' Malone said, referring
to Sloan's anger. ``He was short with us, too. Then again, we gave
him no reason to be long.'' ... One thing to bear in mind: Since
the 2-3-2 format was introduced in 1985, the home team has never
won all three middle games. The visiting team, however, has twice
swept Games 3-5, in 1990 (Detroit at Portland) and in 1991 (Chicago
at Los Angeles) ... Sloan said he was much more concerned with
``the little things'' than Malone's errant shooting. He cited
Utah's turnovers (20, leading to 33 Chicago points) and the Bulls'
success on the offensive boards (18 rebounds leading to 19
second-chance points) as the two key reasons his team lost Game 2.
He also was unhappy with the team's passivity. ``I just don't think
we came to play basketball in our own building, and that was
shocking to me,'' Sloan said. ``I was upset. But you can't make
them do something they don't want to do. Or at least I can't. Maybe
someone else can.'' ... On the critical play _ Steve Kerr
rebounding his own miss and feeding Michael Jordan for a 3-point
play, Sloan said, ``You look at the film and our guys were just
floating back on defense, like it was a pickup game. It was like,
who cares? How can you walk back up the floor on a play like that?
I told the guys it was like we were all wearing tuxedos out there.
We didn't want to be touched.'' ... Malone was asked for a reaction
to Dennis Rodman's comment that he, Rodman, could guard Malone
``any day of the week'' if the referees let them play. ``Please,''
Malone said with disgust. ``Next question.'' ... The Jazz led the
league in free throw attempts during the season, almost 25 a game.
In the first two Finals games, they've averaged 13.5.

ISLANDERS FEAR BEING STRANDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It would have cost the Islanders a minimum of about $1.5
million to learn whether J.P. Dumont had NHL skill and toughness.
For that kind of money, Gordie Clark didn't think the risk was
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all changed so much, because of the money,'' said Clark,
the former Bruins assistant coach who is now the Islanders'
assistant general manager with an emphasis on player scouting and
development. ``In the old days, you signed your top pick for
$100,000 or $200,000 and said, `What the heck? If it works out, it
works out.' And if it didn't, so what? But, when you're putting out
$1.2 million for just a signing bonus, you want to know it will
work out _ you want to know he'll eventually play in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Islanders dished Dumont to the Blackhawks
last weekend, giving up on the forward who this season broke Mario
Lemieux's Quebec League postseason goal-scoring record by potting
31 in the playoffs. In return, the Islanders picked up center
Dmitri Nabokov, a first-round pick (No. 19 overall) in the '95
draft, whom Clark projects as a second-line center. Had the
Islanders not made a deal, and left Dumont unsigned, he would have
been placed back in the amateur draft this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing,'' said Clark. ``I probably shouldn't go to
Quebec in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark decided that Dumont didn't have the speed or grit that it
takes to play in the NHL. In the two years that he watched him,
Clark didn't see Dumont beat anyone to the outside with speed. He
didn't see him battle for the puck. He saw a kid with some raw
offensive talent, with some genuine upside in scoring, but without
enough fire to battle his way to the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything, say, 10 or 15 feet out, he'd put it in the net,''
said Clark. ``And that's great, if a player can plant himself there
and make those shots. But that's not how the game's played. First
of all, you have to skate to get to the front of the net, and then
you have to have the courage to get there and stay there. I didn't
see it.''
</P>
<P>
   In one brief stretch with the goal-deficient Blackhawks last
season, Nabokov potted five goals in five games. He finished with
seven in about one-third of a season's work. The Islanders don't
figure he'll be a sniper, but he could add 50 or 60 points to their
roster, and that's a far safer and better gamble than laying out
$1.5 million for someone who never wears your uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm wrong, it will be worse than kicking myself in the rear
end,'' said Clark, who was directing the Bruins' draft when they
made Kyle McLaren the No. 9 pick in '95. ``I'll be fired.''
</P>

   Before naming  &UR; Bob Hartley  &LR; as  &UR; Marc Crawford's  &LR; successor
behind the bench, the Avalanche were considering the likes of  &UR; Ted
Nolan &LR; , &UR; Bryan Trottier &LR; , &UR; Jacques Lemaire &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and the  &UR; Dave
Lewis &LR; - &UR; Barry Smith  &LR; 1-2 punch from the Wings. In the end, they
went with Hartley, their coach in Hershey (AHL). Just wondering:
Has anyone been considered for more jobs, only to be left unhired,
than Nolan? He was named Coach of the Year last June just prior to
being fired by the Sabres. A year later, he can't buy a job?
Something just doesn't add up. Nolan recently talked to the Toronto
Star about the perception that he is a ``GM killer'': ``I had
nothing to do with ( &UR; John &LR; ) &UR; Muckler  &LR; getting fired (in Buffalo). I
was a second-year coach _ where would I get that kind of power? But
I keep reading and hearing that. `GM killer.' That's been the
hardest thing to swallow. It hurts, a lot.'' ... Trivia
answer-to-be:  &UR; Marian Cisar &LR; . The 20-year-old Slovak was traded
from Los Angeles to Nashville last week, thus becoming the first
player in Predator history ... Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment,
owner of the Canucks, the Grizzlies, and GM Place in Vancouver,
reports that its hockey team lost a whopping $30 million (Canadian
funds) in 1997-98 (upwards of one-third of that is  &UR; Mark Messier's
 &LR; salary). Beyond that, the Grizzlies lost a little and The Garage
made a little. And beyond that, life goes on for Orca gazillionaire
 &UR; John McCaw &LR; , &UR;  &LR; whose pockets run deeper than the deep blue Pacific
... Former Bruin defenseman  &UR; Glen Wesley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who would have become a
Group 2 (high compensation) free agent July 1, now will make $12.5
million over the next five years after re-signing with the
Hurricanes. Wesley is still only 29 years old and wouldn't have
become an unrestricted free agent until the summer of 2000. He
might have cashed in much bigger two years from now, but the
guaranteed revenue stream through the spring of '03 _ when he'll be
34 _ made the deal worth taking ... Following his soft performance
in Game 4 of the Eastern finals, Buffalo netminder  &UR; Dominik Hasek
 &LR; slapped a ``Kramer'' sign on his helmet prior to practice the next
day. The joke: Buffalo teammates slapped the ``Kramer'' nickname on
Hasek two years ago, noting how he resembled the character in
``Seinfeld.'' But Hasek didn't think it was so funny originally.
When then-rookie  &UR; Brian Holzinger  &LR; asked him about it during a team
photo shoot, Hasek said little, and was next seen flushing
Holzinger's suit pants down the toilet (we are not making this up).
``That's Dominik,'' said former Bruin defenseman  &UR; Garry
Galley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who then was one of Hasek's teammates. ``He could snap
just like that. You just never knew.'' The silver lining in the
soggy suit story? ``It was just one of my cheap college suits,''
said the speedy Holzinger, who then was only months removed from
the Bowling Green campus ... According to Canucks play-by-play man
 &UR; Jim Hughson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; coach  &UR; Mike Keenan  &LR; has veto power in regard to the
next general manager. But  &UR; Stephen Bellringer &LR; , &UR;  &LR; president and CEO
of Orca Bay Sports, says such a clause does not exist in Keenan's
three-year contract ... Word around Exit 16W in New Jersey is that
 &UR; Cap Raeder &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the former Boston assistant, is too entrenched in
his new career _ scouting for the Sharks and commentating on
college hockey _ to get back behind a bench with  &UR; Robbie
Ftorek &LR; , &UR;  &LR; his old pal from Needham who recently was named the
Devils' head coach. Ftorek will have to look elsewhere for a top
aide.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Provided  &UR; Art Williams  &LR; is ratified as the Lightning's new owner
(an empty-netter) later this month, he plans to go ahead next
season with one significant management change: GM  &UR; Phil Esposito
 &LR; and head coach  &UR; Jacques Demers &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who recently picked up the title
of director of player personnel, will have equal say in roster
makeup and all related player decisions. A two-headed management
team. Always dicey. Word around the Bolts is that Williams has
become an instant Demers booster, and in a year Demers could be
left running the whole show, with Esposito left without a job ...
Tampa Bay forward  &UR; John Cullen &LR; , &UR;  &LR; recovering from non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, will join the club for training camp in Austria this
fall, but without a contract. If he remains healthy and can play at
an NHL pace, he'll be signed to a new deal. If his playing days are
over, the former Boston University star will remain with the club
in a front-office capacity ... The oft-injured  &UR; Petr Svoboda
 &LR; recently underwent surgery on his neck, giving him some relief
around a nerve that was irritated as a result of his violent
collision with Buffalo's  &UR; Dixon Ward  &LR; in the opening round of the
playoffs. The night he was hit, Svoboda initially thought he was
paralyzed, but most of the effects of the ``stinger'' soon
diminished ... Ex-Bruins coach  &UR; Rick Bowness &LR; , &UR;  &LR; dismissed from
behind the Islanders bench late last season, is rumored to be
heading to Montreal to join  &UR; Alain Vigneault's  &LR; staff. At the
moment, there is no opening on the Habs' staff, but assistant coach
 &UR; Dave King  &LR; is on the short list of candidates to take over as
Florida's head coach. When Bowness was the Senators' head coach, he
hired Vigneault as an assistant ... Former Bruin  &UR; Sheldon Kennedy
 &LR; began a cross-Canada trek on in-line skates last Saturday, shoving
off from St John's, Newfoundland. His itinerary has him covering
the 5,000 miles to Vancouver in 136 days, about 37 miles a day, in
the hopes of increasing awareness about child abuse. While with the
Bruins in the '96-97 season, Kennedy told a Canadian court that he
was sexually abused hundreds of times as a teenager, all at the
hand of his former junior coach,  &UR; Graham James &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is serving 3
1/2 years in a Manitoba prison ... By early last week, the Oilers
had sold 13,121 season tickets for next season, triggering a $4
million (Canadian funds) subsidy from the NHL that is earmarked for
small-market Canadian teams ... If  &UR; Doug Gilmour  &LR; gets a serious
look in free agency, it likely will come from the South, either
Tampa Bay or Carolina. Both clubs are desperate for pivots. The
question is: Will either want to meet his $5 million-per-year
asking price? ... Trottier's hiring as Hartley's assistant in
Denver leaves the Portland Pirates without a head coach for the
second time in as many years. It was about this time last year that
Nashville hired away both  &UR; Barry Trotts  &LR; and  &UR; Paul
Gardner &LR; , &UR;  &LR; opening the way for Trottier. Now it's up to Washington
GM  &UR; George McPhee  &LR; to fill the job in Portland, the Capitals' top
minor league affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Oiler boss  &UR; Glen Sather  &LR; met twice last week with Edmonton's new
ownership group, and by Friday night the former Bruins spare
forward had yet to announce whether he'll stay on as the club's
boss. Complicating the picture: The Canucks were given permission
by the Oilers' new owners to approach Sather about their GM
opening. No one expects Sather to go anywhere, and he likely will
be enticed to stay by being offered an equity position in the
Oilers. If that's the case, the Vancouver job likely would be
offered to NHL VP  &UR; Brian Burke  &LR; (the former assistant GM in
Vancouver) or ex-Boston forward  &UR; Mike Gillis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now an agent who
represents, among others, Canucks star  &UR; Pavel Bure &LR; . Keep in mind:
Sather is essentially an unrestricted free agent, with untold
leverage handed him by the Vancouver courting. One insider suggests
that his compensation now approaches $2 million a year. He could at
least double that with his new deal, putting him in a position not
unlike that of Oiler goalie  &UR; Curtis Joseph &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is free to walk
July 1 and likely will command upwards of $7 million a year (a
boost from $2.3 million). Joseph will be using Hasek's new deal as
a bargaining benchmark. Hasek will earn $8 million next season, and
an average of $7.25 million the following two seasons. If the
Sabres so desire, they can retain him for the 2001-02 season at $9
million ...  &UR; Don Sweeney  &LR; will return to Massachusetts General
Hospital this week for another shoulder operation, according to his
agent,  &UR; Mark Witkin &LR; . A small metal plate will be placed over the
crack in Sweeney's shoulder blade, a decision that was made, said
Witkin, after doctors took another look at a recent MRI and weren't
comfortable with how the fracture was healing. Sweeney should be
ready for September training camp ... According to Bruins assistant
GM  &UR; Mike O'Connell &LR; , &UR;  &LR; any player on the Boston roster when the
season ended who is now due to become a free agent July 1 will be
offered a new contract. ``Everyone will be qualified,'' said
O'Connell, making reference to some players who must be offered at
least a 10 percent raise over last season in order for the Bruins
to retain their rights (example:  &UR; Landon Wilson &LR; ) ... Camp Black
'n' Gold, the commune-like voluntary summer camp the Bruins held
last year for their young prospects, will not be in operation this
summer. ``We did it last year because we had so many new faces
coming in,'' said O'Connell. ``It's something we might do again,
but we didn't think there was enough demand to merit it this
summer.'' ... If the Sharks want to pay him,  &UR; Al Iafrate  &LR; has a
deal in place worth $1.85 million for next year. But a bad knee and
painful back again kept The Planet out most of 1997-98, and it's
more likely the Sharks will cut him free, possibly with an eye on
signing him at a much cheaper price, with pay boosts triggered by
the number of games he plays. And of course there is always
Nashville, where Iafrate would be reunited with GM  &UR; David
Poile &LR; , &UR;  &LR; his former boss in Washington ... The Sharks say they'd be
happy to deal their No. 2 pick in the draft, provided someone wants
to send them a core player in his mid or late 20s. Keep in mind:
The Sharks were in the  &UR; Trevor Linden  &LR; hunt before the Canucks
dealt him to the Islanders. He's the kind of player the Sharks
would like to get for the the No. 2 pick. Any chances the Islanders
would dish Linden? ``There's nothing to talk about there,'' said
Clark. ``Trevor brings so much to our team, with his presence on
the ice, and his presence the room.''

<P>
   Because the Olympic world has changed dramatically since the
Amateur Sports Act was passed 20 years ago (the word ``amateur'' no
longer appears in the International Olympic Committee charter),
Congress soon will be looking at an update. Among other things, the
new Olympic and Amateur Sports Act will strengthen athletes' rights
and give the US Olympic Committee more power to quickly resolve
disputes over team selection (e.g. the Tonya Harding affair). The
amended act would also allow the USOC to send less than a full
Olympic squad if certain athletes don't meet the standard.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Major changes for figure skating will be on the table at next
week's congress in Stockholm. Besides video replay to help judges,
the International Skating Union is also expected to approve a new
placement system (to eliminate the ``wrong'' skater winning by
mathematical fluke) and a new format for ice dancing ...
Splitsville for  &UR; Kyoko Ina  &LR; and  &UR; Jason Dungjen &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the top US
skating pair at Olympus. Ina has hooked up with  &UR; John
Zimmerman &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a former world teamer with  &UR; Stephanie Stiegler &LR; .
They'll be logging lots of frequent-flyer miles, though. Ina trains
in New York, Zimmerman in California ... Predictable, if
disappointing, showing by the rebuilding US women's field hockey
team, which finished eighth last week at the quadrennial World Cup
after winning the bronze medal last time. The Americans, who won
two of seven matches, will now have to qualify for the next Cup.
They can still make it to the 2000 Olympics, though, by winning
next summer's Pan American Games in Winnipeg. As expected, Olympic
champion Australia won the Cup, followed by the Netherlands and
Germany ... No, field hockey isn't in danger of being dropped from
the Olympic program; in fact, the women's field will expand to 12
by 2004. But IOC president  &UR; Juan Antonio Samaranch  &LR; wants the sport
to become more attractive to watch. ``Consider changing some more
rules,'' he urges ... It appears US single sculler  &UR; Jamie Koven's
 &LR; stunning world title last year was no fluke. Koven easily made the
squad again for this year's regatta, beating Olympian  &UR; Cy
Beasley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; then won the opening World Cup event last weekend in
Munich.  &UR; Sally Scovel  &LR; and  &UR; Lianne Bennion Nelson  &LR; took the silver
in the women's pair,  &UR; Sarah Jones  &LR; was fourth in the women's
single, and the US men's eight (with only one member of last year's
gold medal boat aboard) was fifth. Next regatta is two weekends
hence in Belgium.

   Besides her lofty goals for the 2000 Olympics (winning an
unprecedented five gold medals in the 100, 200, long jump, and both
relays),  &UR; Marion Jones  &LR; is targeting  &UR; Florence Griffith Joyner's
 &LR; decade-old world record in the 200 (21.34 at Seoul in 1988) at
Sunday's meet in Padua. Jones has already run a 10.71 in the 100
this year, second only to Flo-Jo's 10.49 mark. She'll have a
showdown in the shorter race with Olympic champion  &UR; Gail Devers  &LR; at
next month's Goodwill Games in New York ... Though international
track and field kingpin  &UR; Primo Nebiolo  &LR; is still fuming at the
Atlanta Olympic organizers (``a disaster in the organization and a
strange use of the money''), he says he won't hold it against
Stanford, which is bidding for the 2001 outdoor world
championships. ``It is a good bid from Stanford,'' Nebiolo says.
``We are trying to help them.'' What bothers Nebiolo most about
Atlanta was the post-Games switch of the main stadium into the home
of the Braves. ``They have destroyed the stadium and built a new
stadium in the name of  &UR; Ted Turner &LR; ,'' he says. ``It is shameful.''
... Frenetic tuneup week for the US baseball team (nine games in
nine days against Mexico and Canada) before the regional qualifier
in Nicaragua for this summer's world championships in Italy. The
Americans, who'll be sending their usual squad of college
sophomores and freshmen, need to finish among the top five (with
Cuba already having qualified) to make the 16-team global field ...
Why is USA Swimming holding the trials for next summer's Pan
American Games a year early? Because it has four events in 1999
(the Pan Ams, Pan Pacifics, World University Games, and world
short-course meet), and training schedules won't allow four
multiple trials. So the squads will be chosen at August's summer
nationals in California ... Beach volleyball, the hot new sport on
the Olympic program in Atlanta, is rapidly dropping off the screen.
The AVP men's tour has cut its purses in half, the women's pro tour

IN MIDDLE OF US ATTACK, HE'S THE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LYON, France _ Claudio Reyna isn't sure how he feels about all
this ``man in the middle'' hype. After all, there's Kasey Keller
keeping the goal, captain Thomas Dooley prowling the back line,
Eric Wynalda finishing up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my team,'' says Reyna, who'll be the playmaker when
the US men's soccer team takes on the Germans in their crucial
World Cup opener in Paris a week from Monday. ``In soccer, everyone
is important. There's not one guy who can win it. Everyone has to
win it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yanks won't win anything here unless Reyna can create
scoring chances out of the midfield in their counterattacking 3-6-1
formation.
</P>
<P>
   When Reyna is in the lineup with freedom to roam, the US is good
for two or three goals a game. When he's sitting out, as he was
with a sore groin in two of the last three Cup tuneups last month,
the Yanks go barren.
</P>
<P>
   With Reyna, they beat Austria, 3-0, and Kuwait, 2-0. Without
him, they played scoreless draws with Macedonia and Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been the World Cup, Reyna says he would have taken a
pain-killer and pushed himself for 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he didn't want to take any risks, nor do I want him to
take any risks,'' says coach Steve Sampson. ``I'm sure we'll see a
phenomenal Claudio Reyna in the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   With three-time Cup veteran Tab Ramos still scrambling back into
form after tearing up his right knee twice in less than a year,
Reyna is a priceless commodity. And after viewing the 1994 Cup from
the sidelines with a hamstring injury, the 24-year-old Reyna can't
bear to be among the watching wounded again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was enjoyable just to be with the team and share in their
success,'' says Reyna. ``But obviously, it was disappointing. I
think I would have played. But I knew I'd get my chance _ and here
I am again.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyna has been the man in the middle for a while now, and the
system, which puts him amid five other midfielders, suits him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many players around him to play off of,'' says
Sampson. ``Claudio is allowed the freedom to come wide or stay
inside or come forward.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why Sampson made the shocking move of dumping
captain John Harkes in April _ because he didn't want Harkes
cramping Reyna's style.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the question is whether Ramos will cramp it. Ramos, a
terrific dribbler with a knack for finding the back of the net, is
used to having the ball. Is there enough of it to go around? Could
both men start?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tab and I are good friends and I love playing with him,'' says
Reyna. ``We can play together. Other countries manage to put their
best players on the field. Why can't we?''
</P>
<P>
   Reyna, seven years junior, was too young to play with Ramos when
they were growing up in New Jersey (they both went to St.
Benedict's Prep in Newark), but most folks thereabouts figured
they'd eventually end up playing for Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna, whose father played first-division soccer in Argentina,
had both the pedigree and the passion. St. Benedict's, which won 47
straight times, never lost a match when he was on the field. Reyna
led Virginia to three straight NCAA titles, played every minute of
the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, was the youngest member of the 1994
Cup team, and went directly to Bayer Leverkusen in Germany's
Bundesliga.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was a bench player there for three seasons, Reyna
never considered playing in the MLS. He figured his time would
come, and when Leverkusen loaned him to VfL Wolfsburg last year,
Reyna blossomed as a playmaker and was named one of the league's
top 25 players by Kicker magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson never sat Reyna down and told him he was making him the
mainspring. ``I read most of it through the papers,'' Reyna says.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson just kept putting him in the middle, surrounding him
with people (like Wolfsburg teammate Chad Deering) who could
shoulder the defensive chores, and letting Reyna improvise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5a &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve believes the team should be formed around certain
players,'' Reyna says, ``and he thinks I'm one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5a &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Last time he was the kid, hoping for a chance but happy to have
the jersey. This time, he's the man in the middle, and he might be
there for a while.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5a &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll be the Thomas Dooley of 2010,'' Claudio Reyna
muses. ``I'll be 37 then, too.''

</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ Athletes mess up all the time, and they do it so
publicly. They get busted for dope or alcohol, or for beating their
significant others, or for tearing up a bar, or for myriad other
nasty crimes and misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   But then they apologize, usually shedding a tear or two, and
swear on their mother's grave to improve their behavior. Our
response is to stand and applaud and to keep buying tickets.
</P>
<P>
   To err is human, to forgive is expected, as long as the
offending brute in question can score, tackle or smack the ol'
horsehide over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Seles, however, adds a unique twist to the familiar
fallen-jock-on-the-rebound saga. She, too, crashed and burned,
going from No. 1 in the world to practically withdrawing from the
world. Except, in her case, she was an innocent bystander, a victim
of somebody else's sick cravings, not her own.
</P>
<P>
   Seles was a goofy, ditzy kid who behaved oddly at times but who
also defied a number of significant shortcomings, namely slow feet
and an ungainly body, to become the best player on the planet while
still a teen-ager. Then one day out of the blue, as it began to
appear she would break all the records, everything was taken from
her. Now, five mostly lost years later, she seems whole again.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   The tenacity is back. The consistency isn't. Her near perfection
against Martina Hingis in the French Open semifinals gave way to an
alternately brilliant and laughably flawed effort against Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario in Saturday's final, won by the Spaniard 7-6, 0-6,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Seles pulverized the ball the same as the old Monica, meaning
the young Monica. She grunted, groaned and grimaced the same as the
old/ young Monica. She took most every ball on her rise, usually
from a good foot inside the baseline. But the old/young Monica
wouldn't have produced the untimely errors, both physical and
mental, that led to her downfall in e.e &QC; e wiC+

MAKING AN ELDER STATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SALT LAKE CITY _ While two of the oldest, most poised, most
fundamentally sound teams fight it out in the NBA Finals, the other
27 are trying to figure out the best way to get there.
</P>
<P>
   The first observation is that they might as well wait until
Michael, Karl, Scottie, and John retire. But the other observation
is that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and that what
is going on in Utah and Chicago is having its effect.
</P>
<P>
   It's called patience.
</P>
<P>
   These teams have coaches who are 1-2 in seniority in terms of
service with the same club. Utah is a more remarkable story in
that, unlike Chicago, it has been stable and solid despite not
winning a title.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jerry Sloan took over the Jazz 17 games into the 1988-89
season (Utah was 11-6 at the time), the Clippers have had seven
coaches. They'll soon have an eighth.
</P>
<P>
   There were a number of times early in the 1990s when Sloan could
easily have been measured for the hangman's noose. As late as 1995,
Sloan's 60-22 Jazz team lost in the first round, dropping Game 5 at
home to the eventual champion Rockets. The 1993 team also lost in
the first round after taking a 2-0 lead. Management stuck with
Sloan. Management didn't deal Malone or anyone else of importance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Jazz took the vaunted Lakers to seven games in the
conference semifinals. Utah actually led, 2-1, in that series and
almost won Game 5 in the Forum. It seemed inconceivable at that
point that the Jazz would have to wait nine years to get a sniff at
the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   They've got a nice thing going and have for a while. That should
be a valuable lesson for all the wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a testament to patience,'' says Celtics general
manager Chris Wallace. ``If they had done all those deals over the
years that were rumored or made all the changes they were supposed
to make, they wouldn't have been any better off than they are right
now. Probably not as good.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they also have the perfect situation. They play in a city
where patience is a little easier to come by, too. And ownership is
reflective of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone at times spars with owner Larry Miller or gets on
teammates, but that's what being a veteran leader is all about.
Larry Bird did the same thing, whether it was getting on Kevin
McHale or saying he was insulted with his latest contract. Look at
what the Bulls are going through now, with Scottie Pippen counting
the days until he goes and Michael Jordan drawing a line in the
sand.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Utah had a half-dozen free agents, a few of which
were attractive commodities. Jeff Hornacek and Antoine Carr are in
their dotage, settled here, and were not hard sells. But what about
Howard Eisley, Shandon Anderson, and Bryon Russell? They are all
critical to the Jazz' success, and Utah not only re-signed them but
probably got bargains in all three cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never played anywhere else,'' Anderson said, ``so I don't
know. But I can't imagine it being any better than it is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace got the sense this past week at the Chicago predraft
camp that NBA teams are looking to get older. They see the
thirtysomethings still playing and the twenty-somethings wondering
why. They see no dom-inator in the draft and figure someone with an
NBA resume might be preferable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports is sort of `follow the leader' and the playoffs have
been dominated by the over-30 set,'' Wallace said. ``Everyone now
seems to like the ideas of age and maturity. But you know what'll
happen. The Lakers will win it next year, crush everyone along the
way, and then everyone will be scrambling to get young and
athletic.''
</P>
<P>
   Except in Utah. They don't scramble anything here, except eggs.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The latest big name to appear in trade rumors is Houston fixture
 &UR; Hakeem Olajuwon &LR; . The Dream has three years remaining on his
enormous deal, averaging around $14 million per, and one report had
the Rockets and Orlando talking, with  &UR; Penny Hardaway  &LR; and Olajuwon
as the principals. Wallace said he had not heard specific Olajuwon
rumors, but added that he wouldn't be surprised if something
happened. ``When you're in the position Houston is in, you can go
one of two ways,'' said Wallace. ``You can ride out his career and
then build a statue of the guy in front of the arena. Or you can
see what's out there, make a deal, and try to make another run.
They're basically in a position where they are going to have to
start over soon and they were the eighth seed. So it's tough. In
the era we're in now, if you're a good team, but not good enough to
get there, it's almost like being a bad team.'' Another thing to
bear in mind: Olajuwon has a strong fondness for Vancouver. The
city, not the team ... Interesting sight at a certain Delta gate
two weeks ago at Los Angeles International Airport. On the Sunday
night red-eye to Orlando,  &UR; Shaquille O'Neal  &LR; and his entourage
basically took over the entire first class section. Earlier in the
day, Shaq and the Lakers had been eliminated by the Jazz, which
makes you wonder: Did Shaq have reservations? ... Valparaiso gunner
 &UR; Bryce Drew  &LR; appears to be the consensus winner of the Player Who
Helped Himself The Most Award at the predraft camp. He will help a
team _ say, San Antonio _ that needs a perimeter threat to offset a
solid inside game. ``It helps that there already are players in the
league who do what he does,'' Wallace said. ``Guys like  &UR; Brent
Price  &LR; and  &UR; Matt Maloney &LR; .'' Others who did well, according to
Wallace, include  &UR; Ruben Patterson  &LR; of Cincinnati, a 6-foot-6-inch
tweener who can create havoc on defense, Clemson's  &UR; Greg
Bruckner &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Iowa's  &UR; Ricky Davis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and Nebraska's  &UR; Tyronn Lue &LR; .
``My feeling is that one of those four will be the first player
taken from the camp,'' Wallace said. ``But they are late teens,
early 20s.'' The one exception is  &UR; Lee Nailon  &LR; of Texas Christian.
He hasn't hired an agent yet and his school is saying he will be
back for another year if he's not a top 15 pick. ``That's a logical
thing to do,'' Wallace said. ``But the more the kid stays away from
the school and the more that the friends and family get involved,
it becomes harder for him. The problem for him is that he's 6-8 but
he's not a rebounder and I don't see him playing small forward.''
... Meanwhile, noted UCLA alumnus  &UR; Bill Walton  &LR; had these
observations on the three Bruins at Chicago,  &UR; Toby Bailey &LR; , &UR; J.R.
Henderson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Jeelani McCoy &LR; : ``Toby is an incredible athlete,
but he doesn't have a real game. J.R. is going to have trouble in
the NBA playing power forward because that is where the meanest,
nastiest, dirtiest guys play. Jeelani is an incredible talent, but
he hasn't yet shown he can respond to coaching.'' Wallace concurred
on McCoy: ``It's hard to rule him out because of his size and
shot-blocking ability. But with him, you really have no idea what
you're going to get.''

   The NBA presented its Sportsmanship Award to  &UR; Avery Johnson
 &LR; last week. It was a tough year for the league's image, which took
a beating from  &UR; Latrell Sprewell  &LR; and a few other miscreants. Asked
for his take on sportsmanship in general in the NBA, Johnson said,
``I think overall it's healthy. Naturally, we have some incidents
where guys want to pump their fists in people's faces and when they
make a slam dunk or some of the theatrics that go on with some
players. It's an emotional game. But I think at the same time you
have a lot of young people watching. We are an example for millions
and millions of young people. We have to be an example with our
attitude, with our hard work. We should be an example by the way we
play.'' Someone ought to tell that to  &UR; Antoine Walker  &LR; ... We all
know that  &UR; Rick Pitino  &LR; models himself after  &UR; Pat Riley &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; they are
the only two people in the NBA with the dual titles of president
and head coach. Pitino took another step when he decided not to
attend the predraft camp. Riley hasn't gone for years, although
most coaches do. (A case could be made for Pitino's decision; the
camp is an example of classic management overkill.) ... Seattle GM
 &UR; Wally Walker  &LR; says his assistants, all of whose contracts expire
July 1, are free to talk to other teams. Fired coach  &UR; George Karl
 &LR; contended otherwise. Karl's name continues to surface for the
Clippers' opening, although one LA source said the offer might be
about half of what Karl wants. Meanwhile,  &UR; Lenny Wilkens's  &LR; name is
there for the Seattle opening, with  &UR; Paul &LR;   &UR; Westphal  &LR; in the
on-deck circle ... Can it be true that the IRS is going to drop the
hammer on as many as 15 referees after the playoffs? ... Utah
assistant  &UR; Gordie Chiesa  &LR; says one of the many reasons the Jazz are
successful is that they have two point guards who can shoot the
ball.  &UR; John Stockton  &LR; shot 52.8 percent from the field this season,
the highest percentage of any guard. Eisley was at 44 percent,
which isn't great but still is better than most. ``When your point
guard can make a perimeter shot, your whole team is uplifted,''
Chiesa said. ``It's huge.'' Most starting point guards struggle to
shoot 45 percent. Of the alleged elite in the NBA,  &UR; Allen Iverson
 &LR; (46.1 percent) and  &UR; Gary Payton  &LR; (45.3) were the best. (OK, good
guy Avery Johnson was at 47.8 percent.) But  &UR; Tim Hardaway  &LR; was at
43.1,  &UR; Damon Stoudamire  &LR; at 41.1,  &UR; Rod Strickland  &LR; at 43.4,  &UR; Mark
Jackson  &LR; and  &UR; Jason Kidd  &LR; each at 41.6,  &UR; Nick Van Exel  &LR; at 41.9,
 &UR; Kenny Anderson  &LR; at 39.8,  &UR; Stephon Marbury  &LR; at 41.5, and  &UR; Mookie
Blaylock  &LR; at 39.2 ...  &UR; Ed Pinckney &LR;  was among the members of the
Miami scouting staff at the Chicago camp. Easy Ed was with the
Heat's broadcasting team last season and is hoping to be more
involved in basketball operations ... Don't be surprised if the US
scrambles this month to assemble a backup team for the World
Championships. A roster must be submitted by the end of the month.
With union president  &UR; Patrick Ewing &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Jordan, and  &UR; Charles Barkley
 &LR; all supporting a boycott (if there's a lockout), how easy will it
be for the lads to go and diss the big guys? This group is not a
particularly strong assemblage; it's mostly second-level stars who
are not-rock-the-boat types ( &UR; Vin Baker &LR; , &UR; Allan Houston &LR; , &UR; Terrell
Brandon &LR; , &UR; Tom Gugliotta &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; ... The Indiana Pacers may enter the
Sprewell sweepstakes. President  &UR; Donnie Walsh  &LR; desperately needs
athleticism, which was more than apparent when  &UR; Chris Mullin
 &LR; turned into a cipher in the Bulls series ...  &UR; Chris Webber  &LR; is
already outta there. Is  &UR; Juwan Howard  &LR; next? Wizards GM  &UR; Wes Unseld
 &LR; all but begged to be publicly flogged in a recent letter to season
ticket-holders. The message was that he and everyone else is tired
of the extracurricular garbage, to paraphrase Riley. In one
revealing segment, Unseld apologized to the fans for not fining the
players more, but said he could not do so under league rules.
Howard was a large part of the problem, and the Wizards might not
hesitate to move him. But his ridiculous contract may make him
impossible to trade, and he hasn't done a thing since signing it.
Of course, the Wizards' obsession with doing the right thing will
end as soon as they turn around and sign Strickland for $10 million
a year.

METS BEAT BOSTON, 1-0  
 (HLW)

   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Brian McRae was dancing off third base with two outs in
the sixth inning Saturday, hoping that the Mets would find some way
to nudge him the remaining 90 feet to score the game's first run
and hoping that he would distract the Boston pitcher Tim Wakefield
enough to help make that happen. The McRae Boogie worked.
</P>
<P>
   After Wakefield stepped on the pitching rubber and started his
motion, he moved his hands apart and stepped off as McRae dashed
toward home. The third base coach, Cookie Rojas, pointed at
Wakefield, and Umpire Terry Craft called a balk that allowed McRae
to trot in as the Mets stunned the Red Sox, 1-0, at Fenway Park. It
delighted thousands of New Yorkers continually chanting ``Let's Go
Mets'' among the 32,545 fans.

   It was a frustrating way for the Red Sox to lose because
Wakefield and Tom Gordon combined for a two-hitter and an off-beat,
yet somewhat routine, way for the pesky Mets to win this
interleague matchup. Bobby Jones provided the impressive pitching
with a three-hitter over eight innings, the Mets played their
usually stingy defense game and the run scored without the benefit
of a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're trying to do is distract him and catch him off
guard,'' McRae said. ``Maybe his mind is on other things and you
can get him to balk or do something out of the ordinary. He's not
really concentrating on you and you make that move.''
</P>
<P>
   The move destroyed Wakefield's potential masterpiece because he
allowed only a second-inning single to Edgardo Alfonzo in eight
innings. But Wakefield inexplicably separated his hands and stepped
off the rubber, even if he did not admit to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember the last time I balked,'' Wakefield said. ``I
don't know if I did. I don't even want to look at the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   It would show Wakefield opening the sixth by walking McRae on
five pitches. One out later, McRae artfully pulled off a delayed
steal of second base on a 2-1 pitch to John Olerud. Catcher Scott
Hatteberg did not attempt a throw as McRae became the first Met to
reach second. Olerud's grounder to first pushed McRae to third and
brought Butch Huskey up.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a walking lead while timing Wakefield's motion on
his first pitch to Huskey, McRae sprinted 20 feet down the line
just as the right-hander initiated his motion. Wakefield flinched
at the fake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fooled me,'' Valentine said. ``I thought he was going.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, so did Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty simple,'' Craft said. ``He started upward in his
motion and then he separated his hands and then he stepped off.
Either one would have been a balk.''
</P>
<P>
   Because McRae diverted Wakefield's attention, Jones' effort was
not wasted. Jones (5-3), who won his fourth straight decision, did
not surrender a hit after the second, retiring 17 of the last 21
batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Jones pitched as good a game as I've ever seen him
pitch,'' Valentine said. Jones added: ``I think this was one of my
best. I've had games where I've pitched seven or eight innings and
allowed one or two hits. As far as my stuff, tonight was one of
those days.''
</P>
<P>
   John Franco worked the ninth for his 13th save.
</P>
<P>
   Even after adding Mike Piazza, who did not play again Saturday
because of a bruised hand, the Mets win with pitching, defense and
fundamentals, and this game epitomized that style. McRae stole
second, convinced Wakefield he might steal home and helped the Mets
steal a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to just sit there,'' McRae said. ``Nothing was
going on in the game. I just thought it might be our only chance to
score.'' It worked.

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Assemblywoman Barbara Alby was portrayed
as a wind-up hula dancer. Richard Katz was smeared as anti-Latino.
Orange County conservative Jim Lacy saw himself described as an
ally of Willie Brown Jr., San Francisco's liberal mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Voters may think they sent politicians a message against
negative campaigning Tuesday by rejecting Al Checchi, who spent
millions on attack ads in the gubernatorial primary. But the
political road kill left in the trail of legislative races across
the state tells a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Republican or Democrat, from Sacramento to San Fernando to San
Juan Capistrano, going negative paid off at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Alby, a Sacramento-area Republican, lost her primary bid for a
seat in Congress to Doug Ose, whose negative advertising centered
on votes and floor sessions Alby missed while in office.
</P>
<P>
   One television spot featured a grass-skirted toy to highlight a
trip Alby made to Maui last fall. The ad didn't bother to mention
that she was there to attend a meeting of the National Foundation
for Women Legislators, or that she serves on the group's board. Nor
did it acknowledge that some of Alby's other absences came on
``check-in'' days when no floor sessions were held.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money made a new truth. It rewrote the truth,'' she said.
``Money makes a new truth, which isn't true at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ose defended his campaign tactics and said voters have a right
to expect that elected officials will be on the job. The hula
dancer may not have been flattering, but it conveyed an important
message, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was our attempt to portray, with some degree of
humor, the obligation that elected officials have,'' Ose said. ``We
can back up everything we said in that piece.''
</P>
<P>
   In Orange County, Lacy headed into the Republican primary for an
Assembly seat with what he thought was an impeccable conservative
pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   A consultant to the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, Lacy
serves on the American Conservative Union's board of directors. He
was once national chairman of the Young Americans for Freedom and
in 1976 was a Republican delegate for Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine his surprise when an opponent's mailer carried a picture
of Brown, the famously liberal former Assembly speaker, and
suggested Lacy was supported by trial lawyers, a group long
affiliated almost exclusively with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``To link me to Willie Brown was just about as far-fetched as
anything I've seen in politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy said his campaign did receive donations from attorneys but
that they came from a new, conservative political action committee.
He said his opponent didn't bother to draw the distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lesson in all this,'' he said. ``The lesson is that
our political system has become, our method of campaigning has
become, a dirty, win-at-all-costs business which does absolutely
nothing to inspire integrity and confidence in our political
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Patricia Bates, who defeated Lacy in Tuesday's primary,
nor her campaign consultant returned calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   This year's primary brought plenty of negative campaigning to
the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles as well, where Katz, a
former member of the state Assembly, and Councilman Richard Alarcon
battled for the state Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Herschel
Rosenthal, D-Van Nuys, because of term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Each says the other went overboard. Alarcon claimed Katz's
mailers reprinted his Social Security number and unfairly portrayed
a dispute he had with the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRS made a mistake on my income taxes,'' Alarcon said.
``They owed me money; it wasn't the other way around. He just
assumed that I failed to pay my taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz had complaints of his own, including a mailer that noted
the state Legislature last year cut funding for prenatal care. The
vote came after Katz left office.
</P>
<P>
   But if the campaign had a ``daisy spot'' -- the name political
strategists have given to devastatingly negative ads since a 1964
commercial against Sen. Barry Goldwater juxtaposed a girl picking
flowers with a nuclear-bomb blast -- it didn't come from either of
the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-minute mailer, state Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los
Angeles, sought to link Katz to Gov. Pete Wilson and, by extension,
to a 1988 incident in Orange County in which some Republicans hired
guards to question Latinos as they went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Polanco mail had the distinction of both being full of
lies and an appeal to race,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Polanco did not return calls for comment. But Alarcon, who holds
a narrow lead in the race with some ballots still being counted,
disavowed the racial overtones made against Katz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have used it in my campaign,'' he said. ``I'm not
going to defend that. I had nothing to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said there was nothing wrong with Polanco urging
Latinos to assert their right to vote and including a ``voting
rights identification card'' in the mailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos are often hassled when they go to the polls,'' Alarcon
said. ``It's perfectly appropriate for Richard Polanco to do this,
when we've seen egregious civil rights violations with regard to
Latinos voting.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz said it's no secret why negative campaigning is used so
often -- it works, even if voters say they don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still remember and believe parts of it while they're
complaining about it,'' he said.

 Los Angeles:   about it,'' he said. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are other benefits as well. A candidate who spends his
time attacking an opponent doesn't have to talk about his own
qualifications or describe what he will do in office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are limits to the power of negative campaigning,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Slinging mud tends to lower the standing of the candidate who
throws it, as well as the target. And attacks seem to have less
effect on candidates who voters think they know and like.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works far better against candidates that have not yet
defined themselves,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political
analyst at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, a Los
Angeles suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffe noted that the ads showing Assemblyman Kevin Murray, D-Los
Angeles, behind the wheel of his Corvette didn't seem to hurt him
at the polls. He bested Marguerite Archie-Hudson in the primary for
a state Senate district in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But the effects of a negative campaign don't always end on
Election Day. They drive some people right out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Toy maker Richard Sybert of Ventura County, which borders Los
Angeles County to the west, ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1994
and 1996, then saw his election hopes dashed this year after he was
videotaped tearing down an opponent's campaign signs. The deed was
broadcast on television and publicized in campaign mailers.
</P>
<P>
   Sybert wants nothing more to do with running for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back at the last six years, politics have given me and
my family nothing but heartache,'' he said. ``I'm done.''
</P>
<P>
   For others like Alby, it means rethinking her high-road
political strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had it to do over again, I would have gone negative,''
she said. ``I would have unloaded on him.''

SCOUTS SEE PROBLEMS WITH NOMO 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Although Hideo Nomo got his wish by being traded to
the New York Mets, scouts watching him this season say he has to
make some major adjustments if he ever is going recapture any of
his past glory.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo's 2-7 record and 5.05 earned-run average with the Dodgers
illustrate only part of his problems this season. He had a dramatic
loss in velocity on his fastball that made his nasty forkball
vulnerable. He has only tinkered with a breaking pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a two-pitch pitcher and you don't have one of
them, you are in trouble,'' said an AL scout. ``He is out of sync
in a lot of areas, but the fastball sets up everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pop on the fastball might be gone forever, even
though he is only 29. In his first four seasons in Japan, all
before the age of 24, Nomo averaged almost 240 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when Nomo went 18-8 for the Kintetsu Buffaloes, he also
threw 21 complete games. At the age of 21. The next year he threw
22. Most pitchers aren't even in the big leagues at that age, much
less carrying a team.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs is 20 and never has thrown more
than 150 innings in a minor-league season.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Valenzuela , once the Dodgers' workhorse, was never the
same after throwing 20 complete games in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than just stats. Nomo's reputation as a warrior on
the mound might have come back to haunt him. He welcomed the role
of ace in Japan and never wanted to come out of games. But when
Nomo signed with the Dodgers in 1995, there were reports that pitch
counts of 170 and even 180 were not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Many think Nomo might also have to tone down or even discard the
famous ``Tornado'' windup that made him so endearing to fans.
Keeping the mechanics consistent throughout a game was a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Saturday, Nomo slightly lost his balance several times
during the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   With more walks and hits allowed, Nomo found himself pitching
more out of the stretch. There were some who thought Nomo should
pitch out of the stretch all the time, the way he did that night in
1996 when he threw a no-hitter on a rainy mound at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   But even that delivery has become a problem. This season he has
spread his legs wide apart, meaning the lead leg has to come a much
greater distance before it heads toward the plate. That has cost
him several mph on his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Dave Wallace, the former Dodgers pitching coach now with
the Mets, can sort it all out. But it seems the future is all up to
Nomo.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with Pettitte? Nomo isn't the only front-line
pitcher with problems. Yankees left-hander Andy Pettitte is not
enjoying the team's best start in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees privately are worried about Pettitte's season-long
slump, especially after he allowed eight of the 11 runs Boston
scored in the third inning last Sunday. It was the most the Yankees
had allowed in one inning since July 2, 1943, when they surrendered
12 in the fourth inning to the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Against Boston, Pettitte lasted only 2.2 innings _ the shortest,
non-injury workday of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte says he can't explain the problem, but there are
several theories.
</P>
<P>
   _ He has been distracted by complications in the birth of his
second child, which was delivered last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the past two years, Pettitte has suffered injuries to his
back and elbow. He says nothing is wrong, but his walks are up
almost 50 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use of the cut-fastball, similar to the one that robbed Jim
Abbott of his fastball before he turned 30. Pettitte has won 42 in
his first three seasons. But because he uses a pitch that's
generally considered taxing to his arm, he might already be paying
the price at age 25. Against Boston, Pettitte threw 70 pitches, and
the Sox swung and missed a total of three times.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the reason, the numbers are glaring: In Pettitte's
first three seasons, opponents batted .266 and averaged 1.3 hits
and walks an inning. This year, they are hitting .310 and averaging
1.7 hits and walks an inning. He has a 4.88 ERA. His career ERA was
3.58 coming into this season.
</P>
<P>
   Interleague reunion: Fans like interleague play, which began
this weekend, more than the players. Except in Cincinnati and
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' roster includes six players who used to play for the
Indians or in their minor league system: pitchers Jeff Shaw, Danny
Graves and Scott Winchester, catcher Eddie Taubensee, outfielder
Jon Nunnally and pitcher David Weathers. It would be seven but
first baseman Sean Casey is in the minors right now working on his
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has three players with ties to the Reds: pitcher Dave
Burba (traded there the day before Opening Day for Casey), pitcher
John Smiley (injured) and reserve infielder Jeff Branson. Burba is
scheduled to pitch today against Winchester.
</P>
<P>
   It's also big because the three-game series could challenge the
Reds' all-time three-game attendance record (152,565 vs. Dodgers in
1974). Not bad for a team averaging around 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for this, big-time,'' said Graves, who spent
some time with the Indians last year.``I was talking to my wife
before the season started, and I told her, `I just hope I'm in the
big leagues for the Cleveland series. That's all I want to do.' I
don't look at it like they shouldn't have traded me. But I want to
show them, `Here's what you had, and here's what Cincinnati has
now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that the Reds took two of three from the Tribe last
year, Taubensee joked, ``We're still defending state champions.
They were almost defending world champions, but we won the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockies rubble: Just when it appeared as if the Colorado Rockies
were beginning to play well at home by beating Houston two of three
last weekend, they flopped against the expansion Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, they lost 6-4 to Andy Benes, who was hit by Darryl Kile
after Kelly Stinnett hit a home run. Benes' 1997 season ended last
September when he was struck on the hand by the Rockies' Pedro
Astacio.
</P>
<P>
   Benes has had a grudge against the Rockies since 1996, when
Colorado manager Don Baylor implied during a postgame TV interview
Benes would find a way to lose if the game is close in the late
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This didn't hurt as bad as them taking a loss,'' Benes said
``I'll leave it at that.'' The following night, the Rockies lost
9-3, falling to 8-18 in Coors.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mike Lansing has turned into a serious
disappointment after getting a four-year, $23.75-million contract,
which almost was the exact same money they wouldn't give to Andres
Galarraga. Lansing says he's not hurting anymore (leg and back
problems early), but that might be cause for more concern.
</P>
<P>
   When he played for Montreal, Lansing used to beat up the Rockies
at Coors Field. Now, he is in a prolonged slump, batting .244 with
only two homers and three steals. He also has seven errors.
</P>
<P>
   Drew trickle down: As expected, the Phillies took the University
of Miami's Pat Burrell with the first overall pick in Tuesday's
draft. For their next trick, they'll attempt to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Phillies don't want to talk about J.D. Drew _
upper management wouldn't even refer to him by name Tuesday _ the
hard truth is Drew could still have a major impact in the team's
attempts to sign Burrell.
</P>
<P>
   Drafted fifth by the Cardinals, Drew's $11-million demand
remains intact. The difference this time could be that the
Cardinals are willing to meet it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew was the No.1 guy on our draft board,'' Cardinals GM Walt
Jocketty said. ``We knew he'd be tough to sign, but we feel we have
a lot to sell him on in St. Louis. We're just going to give it our
best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons to believe the Cardinals' best shot
will be good enough. In last year's draft, Rick Ankiel, a highly
regarded high school pitcher, slipped to the second round of the
draft and was selected by the Cardinals. Ankiel signed for $2.5
million, just $50,000 less than the Tigers paid Matt Anderson as
the first overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to drafting Drew Tuesday, the Cardinals took
Stanford pitcher Chad Hutchinson in the second round. Like Drew and
Ankiel, Hutchinson is a Scott Boras client.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals meet Drew's demands before Burrell signs with
the Phillies, then the entire financial landscape will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we're in a business where comparables are
important,'' Phillies president Dave Montgomery said. ``If they do
something quickly (with Drew), it obviously could impact us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Burrell doesn't officially have an agent, he is being
advised by Jeff Moorad, who represents Eric Karros and Raul
Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had a good working relationship with Jeff
Moorad,'' GM Ed Wade said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jim Symons takes a long draw off a
Winston, stubs it out in an already full ashtray and thinks for a
moment. He's sitting at the kitchen table in Largo, just north of
St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   His wife Elaine, gets up off the couch, checks their simmering
beef and noodle dinner on the stove and disappears around a corner
in their small living room.
</P>
<P>
   The evening news is on the TV, but the sound is down because a
visitor has stopped by to ask questions about Symons' brother.
</P>
<P>
   `If . . . if . . .'' he says, grappling for words a few seconds
later. Smoke gushes from his mouth and lingers around his head. He
tries again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my life to live over . . . I'd want the same
brother,'' he says in a soft tone, his voice draped with sadness,
confusion and pride.
</P>
<P>
   He says this almost to himself, as if speaking the words will
answer all his questions and heal the unexpected rupture in his
family's life.
</P>
<P>
   It's been quite a week for him. On Wednesday, he picked up the
newspaper to read that his brother, Joseph Keith Symons, had
resigned after eight years as the Catholic bishop of the Diocese of
Palm Beach, Fla. and admitted to ``inappropriate sexual behavior
with minors'' early in his priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   The public admission came five weeks after a middle-aged man
told church officials that Symons molested him as a boy. Last
weekend, Symons revealed to the Most Rev. Robert Lynch, bishop of
the Diocese of St. Petersburg, the names of four more victims.
</P>
<P>
   Symons was sent to an undisclosed location for treatment. Lynch
is now the temporary administrator of the five-county diocese while
the Vatican decides on a replacement. The names of the victims and
the precise time period during which the abuse occurred has not
been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the soft-spoken 65-year-old Symons _ friends,
family and clergy _ spent the rest of the week reconciling the man
they loved and trusted and knew as a gentle comforter with this new
image of a humbled, distraught, troubled soul who was forced to
confess to horrific flaws.
</P>
<P>
   For them, he is a man with an almost pathological devotion to
work.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man who remembers birthdays and anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man who cares for the sick and needy with a passion and
devotion second only to what he felt for his beloved mother.
</P>
<P>
   He's a man who prays almost as much as he breathes.
</P>
<P>
   He's a man who not only gives inspirational books to friends but
also takes the time to mark pages he thinks will boost their
spiritual deficits.
</P>
<P>
   He is a living history of Florida catholicism, someone who
helped shepherd the explosive growth from 80,000 faithful in 1945
to more than 2.5 million today.
</P>
<P>
   But, now, he's also the highest ranking Catholic in U.S. history
to leave his job for molesting a child.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Keith Symons knew he wanted to devote his life to
Christ.While his older brother Clayton and younger brother Jim
played baseball and games with the neighbors' kids outside his
family's home in Champion, Mich., Keith often stayed indoors to
read or study.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, Harold, a Methodist with English heritage, worked
long hours in the ore mines outside of Champion. ``I don't ever
remember him complaining about the long hours, though,'' Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   So it was up their devout Roman Catholic mother, Ella, a woman
of French and English descent, to raise the three boys. When she
went to novena prayer vigils or Mass at the Catholic church at the
top of the hill in Champion, Keith tagged along.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the family moved to Detroit, where his
father worked building tanks. In 1945, they visited a cousin in
Miami and decided to make a new home there.
</P>
<P>
   Keith graduated from Sts. Peter and Paul High School in Miami in
1949. At age 17, he studied for the priesthood, first at St. Thomas
Seminary in Bloomfield, Conn., and then at St. Mary Seminary in
Baltimore, where he became one of the youngest to study there. He
earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from St. Mary's in 1954, followed
by a Bachelor of Sacred Theology in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his age, the seminary required him to study for an
extra year to make sure he was committed to his religious calling.
He was ordained to the priesthood in Miami in 1958 and became the
assistant chancellor to the bishop of St. Augustine, which was the
only diocese in the state at that time. Today, there are seven
dioceses.
</P>
<P>
   But back then, it often meant driving hundreds of miles each
weekend, traversing rickety bridges, dodging wayward cows and
enduring dusty, bumpy back roads to celebrate Mass at parishes
throughout the state that had no priests. Of the few things he
brags about himself, one of them is that he can go anywhere in
Florida without a road map.
</P>
<P>
   ``For as long as I can remember, he always wanted to become a
priest,'' Jim recalled. ``Even to this day, he constantly reads the
Bible. I joke that his knees must be two inches thick, because he's
down praying constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Symons was first assigned for a short stint as assistant pastor
at St. Monika's in Palatka, Fla. The demand for priests at that
time is evident in his duties; by the end of 1959, he served at
least six additional parishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was crazy about Florida,'' his brother Jim said. ``Loved
the weather, loved the people, everything. Just fell in love with
it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a four-year span he spent serving parishes in
Leesburg, Fla. and Bushnell, Fla. in the early 1960s, Symons spent
most of his time from 1960 to 1971 in the Tampa Bay, Fla. area.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1971, he was tapped to work as vicar general and
chancellor for Bishop Charles B. McLaughlin in the burgeoning
Diocese of St. Petersburg. The job included running the
administrative offices, or chancery, as well as serving as
McLaughlin's right hand man at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Meticulous by nature _ a person who rarely had a stray thread on
his clothing, much less a paper out of line on his desk _ Symons
seemed born to do the job. He and McLaughlin, though, made an
unlikely team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called Bishop McLaughlin `Hurricane Charlie,' '' joked
Bishop Emeritus W. Thomas Larkin, who was picked by the Vatican as
McLaughlin's successor after he died in office in late 1978. ``He
was a man who who never hid his feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin, a pilot from the Bronx who often flew to events
around the diocese, was a commanding presence, forceful in voice
and demeanor, someone always on the go. Symons was undemonstrative
and low volume, choosing to speak with loyalty and compassionate
deeds as much as with words.
</P>
<P>
   Those deeds included efforts to improve the diocese's outreach
to the sick and the elderly. It was Symons who suggested in 1967
that Mass be broadcast weekly so shut-ins could continue to feel a
connection with the liturgy and their faith. In 1974, he followed
that with a televised Mass for the deaf, both broadcast on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great people person,'' Larkin said. Symons continued to
serve as chancellor for Larkin until being named auxiliary bishop
in March 1981. The enhanced role carried the bishop's title, but he
still was subordinate to Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a micromanager and worked all the time,'' Larkin said.
``He was just going, going, going all the time. He didn't have
hobbies or play golf. I couldn't even get him to take a vacation or
days off. I knew that I could leave the chancery and go out about
the diocese and he would take care of everything. He never left
anything half done.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Symons' duties was to coordinate the details of Masses
and ceremonies conducted by McLaughlin and Larkin. William Tapp, a
longtime musical director at the Cathedral of St. Jude in St.
Petersburg, dealt with Symons frequently since the bishops use the
cathedral to celebrate the holiest of ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny you called,'' Tapp said, his voice laced with
sadness. ``About five minutes ago I picked up a prayer book he had
given me. In it he made notes about certain feast days and what
each day represents _ not just which saint went with which day.''
</P>
<P>
   Symons' knowledge about the nuances of each Mass was
comprehensive, Tapp said. He knew what piece of music was supposed
to play at a certain moment. He knew where each altar boy was to be
placed during the service and what the role of each would be.
</P>
<P>
   During Holy Week, when the grueling pace of services and the
pressure to honor the solemnity of each Mass and vigil leading to
Easter can frazzle nerves, Symons was a portrait of calm, Tapp
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt well prepared with him there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Corsetti, hired by Symons in 1976 to be an assistant in the
diocese's finance department, remembers a similar level of
organization he witnessed during his job interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, he was impeccable,'' said Corsetti, who today is
assistant director of finance. ``His desk was impeccable. Not a
thing out of order.''
</P>
<P>
   Symons always had time to speak to co-workers, he said, and
regularly celebrated Mass in the chancery for staff members.
</P>
<P>
   At one point when Corsetti and his wife, Denise, were struggling
to cope with their inability to conceive a child, Symons paid extra
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would send cards and prayers, and he'd drop by the house
when he had the time to visit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of Symons' attention to detail and his depth of
loyalty to the bishop, Corsetti recalled the time after
McLaughlin's death when the diocese was waiting for a letter
telling them who the next bishop would be.
</P>
<P>
   Symons realized that the mail had been delivered on Saturday, so
he went to the office to scan it for the papal seal. Only there was
no mail bag. The cleaning service had pitched it into the trash.
Symons went out behind the chancery with Corsetti to rummage
through the dumpster, but a crew had already hauled the garbage
away.
</P>
<P>
   So the two tracked down the garbage hauler and learned the truck
was on its way to the landfill. Both fetched pitchforks and beat
the truck to the dump. Once there, they combed through the heaps of
stinking garbage and found the mail bag. They opened it up. No
letter. A few days later, the letter naming Larkin arrived in the
normal mail.
</P>
<P>
   Symons' work in the chancery, both as an assistant and as
bishop, only enhanced the love and pride felt by his mother. Ella
Symons lived close to him in a duplex she owned near his church,
St. Catherine of Siena, in Largo, Fla., where he was in residence
while serving Bishops McLaughlin and Larkin. (Symons' father died
in 1968.)
</P>
<P>
   She would visit him occasionally at the chancery in St.
Petersburg, and he would proudly show her off to staff members.
</P>
<P>
   One time, she called him from her Catholic nursing home in
northeast St. Petersburg. Figuring something must be wrong, Symons
rushed to take her call.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ducks,'' she said, ``the ducks in the pond here have had
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother and son shared a dry, understated wit as well. A short
time before Ella Symons died in 1982, she asked her son if he would
conduct her funeral. He told her he wasn't sure that would be
possible but that he'd check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if you can't do it, who the heck would?'' Jim Symons
remembers her joking. Not long after, she passed away due to heart
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, after the funeral, I told him it was a shame,
especially for him. I lost a mother, but he lost a friend and a
mother,'' Jim said. ``They were so close.''
</P>
<P>
   Without prompting, the youngest brother mutters, ``Thank
goodness my mother's not around to see all this.''
</P>
<P>
   As a reward for his efficiency, loyalty and dedication, Symons
was named auxiliary bishop in St. Petersburg in 1981. Two years
later he was chosen bishop of the Diocese of Pensacola-Tallahassee,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   During his seven years there, he was known for his tireless
travel to parishes and schools throughout the Panhandle. It's a
diocese with two cathedrals, one in Pensacola, the other across the
street from Florida State University's campus in Tallahassee. Such
a division kept him on the road almost non-stop.
</P>
<P>
   Symons was ``a nice guy'' but ``not a convivial guy. He did not
have the greatest personality in the world,'' but he was good to
work for, said Thomas Horkan, who as the former executive director
of the Florida Catholic Conference worked under Symons and other
Florida bishops.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very direct. You could talk to him and get an answer,''
Horkan said. And, he said, when new issues would arise, Symons was
a quick study.
</P>
<P>
   Symons' successor in the Panhandle, Bishop John H. Ricard,
issued a statement last week praising Symons' hard work there and
urging prayer for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ready to assist anyone who has been hurt by Bishop
Symons,'' Ricard's statement continues. ``If they would please
contact me, I wish to assure them that any contact made to the
diocese will be held confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1990, Symons was transferred to the Diocese of Palm
Beach, overseeing churches and schools in Palm Beach, Martin, St.
Lucie, Indian River and Okeechobee counties in Florida. The job
brought a $5.4 million annual budget to administer, 1,000 clergy,
teachers and other workers to manage, and 51 parishes to direct, as
well as schools, missions, outreach centers and shelters.
</P>
<P>
   His first five years on the job, the diocese spent $75 million
on renovation and construction. And Symons, micromanager that he
is, claims to have signed every document.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just afraid all his good work and accomplishments will be
forgotten because of this,'' Larkin said. ``What he did in Palm
Beach was a testament to his dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   Few have spoken to Symons since he was sent away for treatment
last week, and neither the Palm Beach nor St. Petersburg dioceses
have disclosed his location.
</P>
<P>
   Even his brothers don't know where he is. Jim Symons, who spoke
frequently with Symons by phone and last saw him a few weeks ago at
the celebration of his 40th anniversary of entering the priesthood,
said he hasn't talked with him since the news broke Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has his brother Clayton, who lives in Michigan, nor has
any of the eight nephews and nieces.
</P>
<P>
   Symons' old boss, Bishop Larkin, said he called Symons before he
left the Palm Beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was devastated about all this. He said that this all
happened 35 years ago and that he's tried to be a good priest since
then. He wasn't crying, but he was really shaken up about it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there is no reconciling J. Keith Symons the bishop,
brother and son with J. Keith Symons the shamed abuser.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's easier to try to accept that two men wore his
clerical collar: one a healer, the other a flawed soul haunted by
the commission of acts unacceptable under any condition, much less
when performed by a man of God.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Lynch as well as the heads of dioceses where Symons
served have asked that anyone who was abused come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tuesday's resignation _ prompted by one man's allegations
five weeks ago _ two more men have told church officials they too
were molested by Symons, bringing the number to three, according to
Father Michael Edwards, the Diocese of Palm Beach spokesman, the
Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel reported last week. Edwards did not
return repeated phone calls Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   None of the five men Symons acknowledged molesting have been
identified, and it is not known how or when the two latest victims
approached church officials.
</P>
<P>
   Symons has asked for prayers and forgiveness from the faithful
and from his victims. Friends and family say all they can do is
pray.
</P>
<P>
   But from the tone of comments by those who know Symons well, it
is difficult to imagine there will be answers to all the questions
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Lynch, after being assured by Symons that the activities
ceased 25 years ago: ``I want to believe that, but I don't know for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, when asked if he had known about the abuses: ``I had no
idea. Lord no. If I had, I would have had to limit him in some
capacity. You'd have to after something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Corsetti, when asked if anyone could have foreseen this: ``I
would rank him in the top three priests that I've ever known. If
someone gave me 50 guesses to figure out who some bad news was
going to be about that day, I would have figured it was him in 50
guesses.''
</P>
<P>
   William Tapp, while recalling the meticulousness of his family's
dear friend: ``He was always under control . . . well . . . I
thought he was under control.''
</P>
<P>
   And from Jim Symons, who keeps his brother's first official
portrait as bishop high on a living room wall alongside a painting
of their mother: ``If he's asked God for forgiveness, he knows in
his heart he'll be forgiven.''

   ASTRONAUTS UNABLE TO SPOT MIR HULL BREACH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By MARK CARREAU &QL; 
c. 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cosmonauts aboard Russia's Mir space station injected a green,
glowing gas into their crash-damaged Spektr module Saturday, hoping
that visiting U.S. shuttle astronauts could spot it flowing from an
elusive hull breach.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   A more elaborate attempt is planned for Monday as the crew of
the shuttle Discovery departs the Russian orbital outpost after a
four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that there will be a jet of gas visible,'' said
Jim Van Lak, the deputy director of NASA's cooperative human
spaceflight program with the Russians. He characterized Saturday's
test while the two spacecraft were joined in orbit as a dress
rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Mir was struck by an out-of-control Russian Progress cargo
capsule last June 25 in a near-disastrous collision. The force of
the impact breached the hull of the Spektr. The Russian-American
crew survived by quickly sealing off the leaking module.
</P>
<P>
   Several previous attempts to pinpoint the location of the breach
have failed, though engineers believe it is near the base of a long
solar array that was mangled by the collision.
</P>
<P>
   Though the odds of recovering Spektr are low, experts from the
United States and Russia believe the accident has presented them
with an opportunity to develop a harmless marker gas. It could be
used to find a leak if a similar incident occurred on the
international space station.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, cosmonauts Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin
injected a combination of nitrogen, acetone and biacetyl gases into
the lifeless Spektr while Discovery commander Charles Precourt and
his crewmates stationed themselves with cameras at different
windows in their spacecraft to observe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a couple of crystals of ice come from the area of the
solar array but nothing from the base,'' Precourt informed mission
control as the 30-minute exercise got under way.
</P>
<P>
   As the test drew to a close, their luck had not changed. The two
crews, however, had several suggestions to improve their viewing
odds during Monday's attempt.
</P>
<P>
   When Discovery backs away from Mir, shuttle pilot Dominic Gorie
plans to maneuver his spacecraft to a point 240 feet from the
station and then hold position. With the shuttle positioned between
the rising sun and Mir, the cosmonauts will discharge the glowing
gas again. They hope the gas will be fluorescent against the black
background of deep space as it is struck by sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   In August, spacewalking cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Pavel
Vinogradov entered the darkened Spektr with search lamps in a bid
to find the breach.
</P>
<P>
   In September, U.S. astronaut Mike Foale joined Solovyev on an
spacewalk in which they probed around the base of the solar array
and a radiator.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a gas without a tracer was pumped into Spektr while
the crew of the U.S. shuttle Atlantis waited nearby. About 10
crystals of ice emerged from the base of the solar array, but it
was not clear from precisely where.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, astronaut Andy Thomas spoke wistfully of returning to
Earth after his almost five-month stay on Mir, the last by an
American.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I look forward to is free time,'' said Thomas, who
trained for nearly two years in Russia. ``Every moment I'm here is
committed and planned. I'm looking forward to not having anything
to do for a while. That will be a great pleasure.``
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to return to Earth aboard Discovery on Friday.

 CUP-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Talented U.S. has bad luck of the draw
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Ask the soccer experts of the world and most of them likely would
agree: This probably is the best team the United States ever has
sent to a World Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   But that and a few thousand francs might only get the Americans
a caf au lait and an early ticket home.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life at the highest level of the game, where merely
being good rarely is good enough.
</P>
<P>
   And such was the luck of the World Cup draw for the Americans,
who drew the unenviable task of facing the machine-like Germans,
the skilled Yugoslavs and an Iranian team whose players will
compete as if their lives depended on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting only begins to describe the possibilities for Group
F of the World Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   For the Americans, coach Steve Sampson and his 1998 team
continue to prove that not only do they belong among the world's
elite, but on any given day the United States is capable of beating
the best.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, the U.S. national team has defeated
Chile, Mexico, Ireland and Nigeria among other notables. And this
year came the shocker of shockers, a 1-0 victory over World Cup
favorite Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Young, world-class American talents such as superb goalkeeper
Kasey Keller, midfielder Claudio Reyna and defender Eddie Pope seem
to be laying the groundwork for future success. U.S. Soccer's
stated goal of winning the World Cup by the year 2010 does not seem
so unrealistic anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But if the talented U.S. team is going to have any chance of
advancing past the first round of this World Cup, it needs to
improve _ and fast.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, a three-time World Cup champion and probably the most
consistent team in history, is heavily favored to win Group F.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Brazil's recent struggles, few would argue against
picking Germany to win the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran striker Juergen Klinsmann, 33, who was brilliant in the
1990 and 1994 Cup tournaments, returns to lead the Germans again.
He has not lost a step. He paced Italy's Sampdoria in goals for the
third consecutive year this season.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Klinsmann is a defense that strangles opponents with its
efficiency and near-flawless offensive execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we will become world champions, but I think we
are capable,'' said Berti Vogts, Germany's coach. ``Other teams
have more talent, but we could still beat them. I believe we're
heading in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for Yugoslavia, a perennial World Cup
power before civil war ripped apart the nation, forcing Yugoslavia
to miss the 1994 tournament and the 1992 and 1996 European
championships.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs supposedly were struggling to regain form and were
considered on the decline before World Cup qualifying began in
1997. But the story of Yugoslavia's soccer demise was greatly
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has shown steady improvement over the past year, even
rolling to 14 goals in its final three World Cup qualifiers last
year. Strikers Predrag Mijatovic and Dragan Stojkovic are world
class.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Slobodan Santrac told reporters after the draw into Group
F that ``anyone who underestimates us will be making a big
mistake,'' which could be prophetic considering the U.S. team is
counting on making it to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is Iran. If you do nothing else this summer, set
the VCR for the June 21 U.S.-Iran match in Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian team on paper is not nearly as strong as the
Americans. Its defense is considered a huge weak point.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many political ramifications on the line and a
dangerous scorer in Ali Daei at the front, Iran will play the match
of its life against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it seems Iran will finish at the bottom of this group and
Germany at the top, with the United States and Yugoslavia battling
for the second invitation to the second round.

DESPITE THE EARLY CELEBRATION, STARS' REAL CUP RUNNETH EMPTY
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ It seemed like such a shiny trophy, but it sat there,
alone and mostly ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a TV cameraman would pause in front of the big
silver bowl, tape a few seconds of it, then move on.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Red Wings, more than anything, had the right
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sights are set higher,'' winger Darren McCarty said. ``Not
to downplay what we've done or anything, but we've done all this
before.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Stars flew home to four months of golf and mending
from injuries, the Red Wings fixed their sights yesterday on the
next trophy. The only one that counts, once you've sipped champagne
from it like the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Their placid reaction at winning the Western Conference final
series against the Stars on Friday _ and the Clarence Campbell
Trophy that came with it _ was conspicuous. Nobody sloshed around
the locker room, pouring bubbly over the owner's head or puffing on
foot-long cigars. Nobody cried tears of joy or dedicated the
victory to their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have some business to finish,'' explained Martin
Lapointe.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we've mentioned it, the stupidest thing the Stars did
was the banners. Maybe the T-shirts. Or maybe the ball caps.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had the best record in the NHL during the regular
season, 49-22-11. They earned the Presidents' Trophy that
symbolizes it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for some reason, within a day of the regular season-ending
victory against Chicago, banners and T-shirts could be found around
town, celebrating the Stars as ``Western Conference Champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   You don't win anything on paper in the NHL. Otherwise, why would
we have what seem like nine months of playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings media noticed the banners before Game 1 and the
premature coronation made all the Detroit papers. Since this is the
self-proclaimed ``Hockeytown'' and apparently the place where the
game was invented, Red Wings fans duly noted and responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't won anything yet,'' read one memorable, R-rated
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   I knew he was right. The banners were a rookie mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they affected anything that happened in this tensely
played series. On the contrary, the way that Detroit goaltender
Chris Osgood performed in Game 6 made one think he had canceled his
newspaper subscriptions months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The banner faux pas is mentioned only to elaborate on how the
Red Wings know better. In the winning locker room Friday, they had
new ``Western Conference Champions'' T-shirts and caps, too.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was wearing them.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings have done all this before.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like a unanimous decision, if you watched only the six
games on TV or in person. The Red Wings were faster, deeper _
better in almost every way.
</P>
<P>
   But they were also healthier. And to ignore that would
exaggerate the true measurable difference between the two
conference rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Inches, it says here. And a lot of it was between the ears.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, when the Red Wings drink again from the Stanley Cup _
and surely, they will _ they might save a sip for Brian Marchment.
The San Jose punk took Joe Nieuwendyk out of the Stars' lineup and,
in so doing, altered the script of the ensuing 16 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars really aren't as bad as they looked on the power play.
``Au contraire,'' during the regular season they were as efficient
as any unit in the league, thanks mostly to Nieuwendyk being able
to team with Mike Modano. Also, in losing Nieuwendyk, the Stars
lost the NHL's second-best player at winning faceoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars can't look back. They can only look to the future. And
when you factor in Nieuwendyk and a healthy Richard Matvichuk,
Shawn Chambers and Greg Adams, the talent base is closer than the
six games would have some people believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this was a once-every-four-years deal,'' Modano
said. ``I see us as maybe where Detroit was four or five years ago.
They have a lot of champions on that team now. And they play like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-earned off-season lies ahead for the Stars. They have
golf to play. They have wounds to mend. They have some roster
tinkering to do.
</P>
<P>
   For the champion Red Wings, there is ``some business to
finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cups you drink from. Some just sit and shine.

Stars take step up NHL ladder
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DETROIT _ It isn't easy. It isn't supposed to be. For most, there
is a rite of passage before they can drink from the Cup, a price to
be paid before even the most talented of players and teams can have
their names etched on hockey's most cherished prize.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the Dallas Stars would like to think they made
a sizable down payment, even in a season that ended a little
earlier than they had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way, and we've still got a long way to go,''
center Mike Modano said after Friday night's 2-0 loss to the
Detroit Red Wings closed out both the NHL Western Conference final
and a memorable year for Dallas. ``But I see us being in this
position next year and for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a continual thing. We're in the same boat
Detroit was four or five years ago _ a couple of appearances in the
conference finals, a couple of appearances in the (Stanley Cup)
finals and you learn to go over that edge, to get that little extra
that puts you in a championship mode.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars believe they moved in that direction this year. Their
performance in the postseason would seem to support their case.
</P>
<P>
   First, they overcame the loss of center Joe Nieuwendyk (torn
anterior cruciate ligament) in the first playoff game against San
Jose. Next, they exorcised the ghosts of last spring by eliminating
Edmonton (a first-round upset winner over Dallas a year ago) in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Even after losing Game 1 of this Western Conference final, the
Stars extended the defending Stanley Cup champions to six tough
games before bowing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the toughest team we played, because they could shut
you down,'' Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman said. ``We didn't get
many scoring chances against them. They're an extremely
well-coached team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had that chemistry of real hard-nosed players. If you can
get good, hard-nosed players who don't take a lot of penalties,
that's a tough combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas rode that combination, plus the work of goal-tender Ed
Belfour, to 109 regular-season points and the President's Trophy,
awarded to the team with the best regular-season record. All of
that would have been meaningless, the Stars knew, if it had been
followed by another first-round knockout. But 10 postseason wins _
particularly in the face of mounting physical problems _ proved
that this team was no flash in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday night, Nieuwendyk was a spectator. Defensemen Sergei
Zubov (leg) and Richard Matvichuk (knee and shoulder) were more
game than able. Modano (shoulder) was playing at less than 100
percent and so were several others.
</P>
<P>
   Even Detroit players conceded a grudging admiration for Dallas'
grit. Against the gifted Red Wings, however, grit wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our group sustained a lot of injuries to key personnel, and
yet our people battled through it and never made excuses,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``But in the end, it really started to
catch up with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, a resulting lack of firepower proved to be Dallas'
undoing. The Stars gave up just 15 goals in the six-game series,
but scored only 11. A woefully inept power play produced just one
goal in 30 attempts and yielded two shorthanded goals to the Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play against good skilled teams like Detroit, you
can't go in expecting to win 1-0 or 2-1,'' Hitchcock said. ``You
have to expect to score three and maybe four goals to win. If you
expect your goaltender to be your first star every night, you're
not realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Nieuwendyk and Modano healthy will be part of improving
offensively. Deep-pocketed owner Tom Hicks isn't likely to be shy
about letting Hitchcock and general manager Bob Gainey mine the
free-agent market, either. So this should still be a team on the
rise. Even in the wake of Friday night's disappointment, several
players sounded ready to get right back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that it's not that long a summer now,'' Pat
Verbeek said. ``We get back at it pretty quickly and start all
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano indicated that the race for this year's Cup was over,
dismissing Washington's chances of winning the Stanley Cup series
that begins Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to be pretty much a whipping boy,'' he
said. ``I think (Detroit and Dallas) are the best two teams in the
league. Detroit has to feel good about their chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano thinks the Stars do, too, even if it may take a while to
get over the current disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season comes to an end so fast,'' he said. ``It's tough to
sit back and enjoy what you did for the past eight months.
Everything is so magnified in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the good and the bad. After last year's first-round
shocker, Dallas at least can look back on a postseason that was
more good than not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll take a big lesson from this experience,'' Modano
said. ``It's disappointing, but we've got some guys who are going
to be around here a long time. If that's the case, I think we'll be
pretty good for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's growing pains may simply be part of the process.

PICK-AND-ROLL A FAMILIAR TUNE FOR JAZZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ There have been better players.
</P>
<P>
   But not a better play.
</P>
<P>
   Using a simple strategy hatched just after the first peach
basket was hung last century and still being run today in pickup
games at YMCAs across the country, Utah Jazz teammates John
Stockton and Karl Malone have pick-and-rolled their way into an
eventual spot in the NBA Hall of Fame, the record books and their
second consecutive NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   As deadly efficient as Kareem's skyhook, Jordan's fadeaway and
Wilt's dipper, Stockton-to-Malone is one of the most sound,
synchronized scoring methods in basketball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've run it on me a thousand times and I finally came up
with a way to stop it,'' Lakers guard Nick Van Exel said. ``Bring a
bat to the game and kill one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the Chicago Bulls have done successfully through two
games of this Finals, attack the attackers and hope the open shots
the pick-and-roll is sure to bring don't fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've played it about as well as can,'' Bulls forward
Scottie Pippen said. ``But they're still getting Karl that 15-foot
jumper. So far, we've just been lucky he isn't hitting. But,
really, there's not a lot you can do against it.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Bulls and their Doberman defense of perennial
all-defensive team members Pippen, Michael Jordan and Dennis Rodman
contain the pick-and-roll is a key to pivotal Game 3 Sunday at the
United Center and for the rest of the series.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1 the Jazz ran the two-man play 25 times for 41 points,
including springing Stockton for the game-clinching layup in the
final minute. In Game 2, however, the Bulls forced Stockton to the
baseline and tried to trap him. The ploy jostled the Jazz from its
usual patience, limiting them to 14 plays for 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given us different looks and had some success forcing
us out of what we want to do,'' Stockton said. ``But I would guess
we'll run it again at some point. We can run it a lot smoother and
better than we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The mysteries of the pick-and-roll are twofold. Did
Stockton-to-Malone create the play or vice versa? And why is
something so simple so difficult to stop?
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, the NBA all-time leader in assists and perhaps its
best 36-year-old point guard ever, runs the pick-and-roll from two
spots _ the top of the key and the wing _ and usually from the
right side of the court. As Stockton dribbles in place, Malone
moves his 6-foot-9, 260-pound body into the side of his defender.
At that point, the Jazz lets the defense dictate the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Karl started making that 15-foot jumper, it became a
really tough play,'' Stockton said. ``Everyone already knew he
could take it to the hole strong. But now he's just as deadly from
the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Malone: ``We have 11 options off just the action of me
setting the pick. That's the beauty of it. For every adjustment
defenses make, we have an option that's already worked against it a
thousand times.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common move is Stockton dribbling to his right with his
defender ``picked'' by Malone. If Malone's defender switches to
guard Stockton, Malone simply ``rolls'' to the basket against
Stockton's much smaller defender for a layup. If Malone's defender
doesn't help, Stockton is left with an open jumper. Sometimes
Stockton will take advantage of the switch defense by using his
quickness to drive past Malone's bigger defender. Sometimes Malone
will flare instead of roll, giving him a 15- to 18-foot jumper. And
sometimes Malone will fake the screen and ``slip'' to the basket
for a layup while the defenders are preparing for his monstrous
body contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been around so long because it works,'' said Jazz coach
Jerry Sloan, who simply yells ``run it'' when he wants a
pick-and-roll. ``But these guys have taken it to another level.
Every team runs some form of pick-and-roll, but nobody as good as
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have chosen to let Stockton dribble off the pick,
forced him toward the baseline and brought Pippen for a double-team
trap. The move has often left Malone with open jumpers, but the
Mailman has been way off his route. In the Finals, he has missed 22
of 26 shots outside 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't ever remember having three bad games in a row, so I
think I'll be OK,'' said Malone, the NBA's fourth all-time leading
scorer and the player who redefined the power forward position. ``I
don't have any excuses, but we will not win this series if I don't
play better. The worst thing I can do is put the weight of the
world on my shoulders. I've just got to relax and start making the
shots I've made all season, that I've made the last 13 years.''
</P>
<P>
   With Chicago lacking a bruising power forward, Malone figured to
average 30 points or more in the Finals. Somehow the Jazz is 1-1,
despite him making only 14 of 41 shots and averaging 18.5 points a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say he's settling for the outside shot,'' Sloan said.
``But it's the same shot he's made a pretty good living on.''
</P>
<P>
   If Malone starts hitting the midrange jumper, Jordan said the
Bulls have to be prepared to adjust again and make him pass to Jeff
Hornacek or Bryon Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem guarding them is that they communicate
automatically, without words,'' Jordan said. ``And if your
defensive communication isn't as good, they'll kill you. We've got
to keep on _ however we do it _ disrupting them from that rhythm
they get in. If they start clicking, it'll be too late.''

USC WINS COLLEGE WORLD SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ USC bashed its way back to the top of the college
baseball world Saturday with a College World Series-record five
home runs - and a ``book''-defying maneuver by the coach, Mike
Gillespie, that even he said would have people thinking he'd taken
a few too many spills off of Traveler.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans beat back persistent Arizona State, 21-14, in the
championship game of the CWS, a heavyweight slugfest that The Old
Coach, Rod Dedeaux, said ``reminded me of the SC-Notre Dame game in
1931.''
</P>
<P>
   Except there probably wasn't as much hitting in that one.
</P>
<P>
   USC (49-17), which climbed through the loser's bracket after
losing its first game here, to LSU, 12-10, and ASU (41-23), which
came into the championship unbeaten after ousting Long Beach State
on Thursday night, 14-4, battered out 39 hits between them. Each
club used five pitchers, few with much success at all in the
highest-scoring and, surprisingly, one of the most entertaining
games in the 52 years of the CWS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game had everything in it,'' said Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   What was in it for Gillespie, who played on USC's 1961 CWS title
team, was his first national championship in his 12 years as the
Trojans' coach, and SC's record 12th.
</P>
<P>
   ``But almost all of that tradition,'' Gillespie was quick to
note, ``was between 1948 and 1978. Since then we've been good,
we've had a lot of success, but we had not won a national
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   This one will be remembered mostly for the record 62 home runs
in the 14 games, a record, and the nine hit on Saturday, another
record - among the 23 that fell in the championship game alone.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be recalled for a steal of home by Morgan Ensberg
in the seventh inning, a play of which Gillespie said, ``In spite
of the fact it makes no sense, and there's not one baseball person
who thinks there's a place for that play, we know that it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Pat Murphy, the ASU coach, also knows it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steal of home was a big momentum change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   USC rocketed out of the gate for an 8-0 lead its first two
at-bats, driving ASU starter Ryan Mills, the sixth player taken in
last week's draft, off the mound in just the second inning. First
baseman Robb Gorr homered in the first and second innings, and
second baseman Wes Rachels - who was selected the Most Outstanding
Player after driving in seven runs on Saturday, another record -
crashed a three-run homer in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ASU then knocked out the Trojans' starter, freshman Rik Currier,
with a five-run second that included a grand slam by shortstop
Michael Collins.
</P>
<P>
   And it was that way the rest of the long afternoon, in a game
one minute short of four hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys battled, they fought to the end,'' Rachels said,
respectfully, of ASU. ``No lead was safe . . . one run, three runs,
eight runs.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU got to within a run at 9-8 in the fourth, and still had the
Trojans well within sight after six innings, trailing, 11-8.
</P>
<P>
   That's when, with the bases loaded, two outs and the hot-hitting
Rachels at the plate, Gillespie ``decided to roll the dice,'' as he
explained his daring theft of home.
</P>
<P>
   Ensberg bluffed from third base three times, once racing nearly
halfway down the line before stopping. Then, on Chad Pennington's
1-2 pitch to Rachels, Ensberg came all the way, sliding under the
tag of catcher Greg Halvorson and touching a wild celebration in
front of the Trojans' first base dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Rachels then followed with a two-run single for a 14-8 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun Devils weren't through even then. A two-run single
by Rudy Arguelles off of Steve Immel, the former Lakewood High
hurler making his first appearance in the CWS, a run-scoring double
by Mikel Moreno and then a two-run homer by Andrew Beinbrink off of
Mike Weibling got ASU right back in it, trailing only, 14-13, after
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells you something about our team, the way we kept
battling back,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans weren't done either. Right fielder Brad Ticehurst
broke an 0-for-10 with a two-run homer in the eighth inning, his
fourth home run of the series, and in the ninth designated hitter
Jason Lane, who led the CWS in hits with 15, hit his fourth homer
of the series - a grand slam - in the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling that might finally get it done,'' said Lane,
who hit .517 (15 for 29) in the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Krawczyk came out of the bullpen in the bottom of the
eighth and retired the only five batters he faced to earn his 23rd
save of the season and the 49th of his career, both NCAA records.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, who was the second Trojan to take the mound, was awarded
the win, although it could have gone to Immel, mostly because Immel
was the only USC pitcher, outside of Krawczyk, not to allow a
homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team win, it doesn't matter who got it,'' said Immel,
who last pitched on May 21 in USC's opening game in the East
Regional. ``I hadn't gotten into a game here, but what better one
to get into than the championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, an emotional Rachels said, ``In 1995 (when USC lost
in the championship game to Cal State Fullerton, 11-5) I sat on the
bench, crying like a baby. It was horrible. Now I'm crying again .
. . tears of joy.''

   ATLANTA _ Five-month-old Samuel Smith smiled as soon as he saw

cameras, reporters and FBI agents crowded around the reunited pair
at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, where a Delta flight
from Montreal brought Samuel back home.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a single mother from Carroll County, Ga. had gone five
days without seeing her son. On Monday, a woman she thought was her
friend took Samuel, using the excuse that she wanted to show the
boy to her husband, police said. Samuel's brother, Randy, 2, went,
too. But a jogger found Randy abandoned at a nearby church Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting a baby of her own, Dayna Nicole Dunn, 20, called the
baby her's and named him Billy, said Dunn's brother-in-law, Patrick
Dunn, who saw her with Samuel on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Samuel wore a hospital wrist band and a belly-button
clip, Dunn wasn't able to convince her family she had just given
birth to the hefty 5-month-old, Patrick Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   So Monday night she fled north, driving to Canada in a beat-up
pickup truck with her husband, Glenn, and the baby, accordinig to
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's family helped the FBI catch them. The couple ran out of
cash and on Thursday were expecting to receive money at a Western
Union branch in Quebec City when Quebec police arrested them, the
FBI said. The Dunns face kidnapping charges in Carroll County, Ga.
Canadian authorities expect the couple to be extradited back to the
U.S. on Monday.

BAFFERT TRIES TO ENJOY MOMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBBIE ARRINGTON  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ On the longest day of his life, Bob Baffert tried
to stay loose. He joked around, talked baseball with friends, even
went out for burgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honest, I'm much more relaxed this year,'' said the trainer of
Real Quiet. ``I figured this day would take forever, but I haven't
even had time to look at a Racing Form. Who's running?''
</P>
<P>
   His horse had a date with destiny, but Baffert couldn't let the
pressure get to him. ``I've done everything I can do,'' said the
former Long Beach resident. ``Why worry?''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight year, Baffert had come to New York with
a potential Triple Crown champion. No one had ever been in that
position before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just enjoying the moment,'' he said during the almost
endless afternoon. ``You never know when you'll be back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's day started extra early by his laid-back standards. He
arrived at Barn 9 before 6 a.m. after a late night at Yankee
Stadium, spent with his three sons and best friend, Mike Pegram,
Real Quiet's owner. On the eve of the Belmont Stakes and a
potential $5.6 million payday, Baffert relaxed watching baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert and company were scheduled to throw out the first pitch,
part of a whirlwind week of Big Apple photo opportunities. Instead,
Yankee owner George Steinbrenner starred them in Triple Crown
Night, presenting them with a van-load of mementos and hosting them
in his private box. Steinbrenner, a long-time thoroughbred owner,
wanted to talk horses the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot believe all the stuff my kids got,'' said Baffert.
The highlight: A baseball autographed by the Yankees' legendary
slugger, Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told George this story: When I was training quarter horses,
I was up at Bay Meadows (in San Francisco) for a race and I met Joe
DiMaggio,'' Baffert continued. ``I told DiMaggio, `Wow, you were a
heck of a pitcher!' He looked at me like I was nuts. I didn't know
any better; I wasn't a big baseball fan when I was growing up. All
I knew is that he could make a great cup of coffee (from Dimaggio's
Mr. Coffee commercials).
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I say to George, `Tell DiMaggio that idiot in the cowboy
hat from Bay Meadows says hi.''' Steinbrenner quickly fetched the
autographed ball, telling Baffert, ``This will help you remember
who he is next time.''
</P>
<P>
   After a morning packed with TV and radio interviews, Baffert
drove back to his New Jersey hotel room to maybe take a nap and
pick up his wife Sherry, four kids and assorted relations. Although
there are several hotels closer to Belmont Park on Long Island,
Team Baffert and Pegram could only find the 66 rooms they needed
together in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   His trip back was delayed two hours by heavy traffic with 80,000
racing fans all headed to Belmont, too. ``I'm happy my horse can
bring so many people out,'' said Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram, meanwhile, had problems convincing Belmont clubhouse
ushers to let him in. He lost tickets for some 30 box seats. ``When
I said just give us some other seats, they laughed at me,'' he
said. So, he came on over to the barn to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's crew had delivered 15 cases of light beer (``We're all
on a diet,'' joked Pegram) for a post-race party. Pegram quickly
downed two brews and called to Baffert to ``make yourself useful''
and fetch him some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been like Disneyland, Magic Mountain and Knott's
Berry Farm all rolled into one,'' said Pegram of his Triple Crown
trip. ``Win or lose, we've had one great time. What more could you
ask?''
</P>
<P>
   ABC and ESPN TV crews converged on Barn 9 for more pre-race
interviews. But just 90 minutes before post-time, Baffert and a
couple of cohorts disappeared in a van, arriving back only five
minutes before going on the air during ABC's live Belmont coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hungry!'' explained Baffert. ``So, we drove over to
this little diner that's across the street from the track. They
were definitely surprised to see me and said, `Shouldn't you be at
the Belmont?' I asked them if they had a TV so we could watch the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Time finally arrived to take Real Quiet to the paddock for
saddling. The champ napped and snacked on hay most of the
afternoon, more relaxed than his boss.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the track, Real Quiet gawked at fans as much as
they did at him. Gleaming in the sun, the bay colt pranced to loud
applause in the post parade.
</P>
<P>
   The next few minutes blurred by. After saddling his horse,
Baffert could barely squeeze through the crowd to his family in the
clubhouse terrace. He could see little of the 1{-mile race except
the home stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In the test of the champion, Real Quiet failed by a whisker to
rival Victory Gallop. The finish so close, Baffert thought he had
won.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they turned for home, I wanted to cry. Everyone around me
was telling me we got it,'' said Baffert. ``For a moment, I knew
what it was like to win the Triple Crown. I could see the
headlines. But The Fish floundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting closer. Silver Charm lost by a half-length; this
time it was a nose. We still had a great run. I won't look back and
second guess what we did. Eventually, I'm going to win this
thing.''

STARS NOT ANTICIPATING MAJOR CHANGES TO ROSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Hicks stood in the visitors locker room at Joe Louis Arena
on Friday night, consoling the Stars hockey team that he owns but
not getting too caught up in the sorrow of a 2-0 Detroit Red Wings
victory that eliminated his team from the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there was time for reflection, but Hicks is a man who
likes to think big and plan big.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I would have hoped was going to happen last
year,'' Hicks said of an appearance in the Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   If the Stars have a schedule, they're likely one year behind.
Last season, the Edmonton Oilers pulled off a first-round upset of
the Stars. This year, the Stars dispatched the San Jose Sharks and
Oilers before falling to the defending Stanley Cup champion Red
Wings. The Stars were Presidents' Trophy winners for best
regular-season record. They were among the final four teams
remaining in the NHL playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman called the Stars his toughest
playoff opponent in the past two years _ a span of seven series.
Popular opinion says the Stars are ``this close'' to beating the
Red Wings. The only problem is that the Red Wings aren't quite
ready to give up the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a message in what they've done,'' Hicks said of
Detroit. ``They've progressed a little bit more each year, and
that's what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have the best regular-season record in the NHL during
the past two seasons, so they have closed in on setting a Stanley
Cup on Hicks' mantel. But what more can the team do during the
summer to bring that goal closer?
</P>
<P>
   Relatively little, considering the Stars have 13 regulars under
contract. But they also have nine players of whom they have to make
a decision concerning free agency, and another seven players
fighting to get into the lineup. While there will be a few
interesting negotiations with key restricted free agents such as
Richard Matvichuk, Darryl Sydor and Jamie Langenbrunner, the Stars
already have the core of their team in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as contracts go, it won't be near as busy as last
summer,'' said Doug Armstrong, who as an assistant to Stars general
manager Bob Gainey is the man responsible for negotiating player
contracts. ``Last summer, we had our captain (Derian Hatcher) and
our premier center (Mike Modano) not under contract. This summer,
we have some important components, but we're in pretty good
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the key signings for the Stars are Sydor, Matvichuk,
Langenbrunner and restricted free agent Juha Lind. Matvichuk is
scheduled to have major knee surgery and will likely miss the next
six months, so his contract negotiations could be sticky.
Langenbrunner expects to get his $500,000 salary more than doubled
and Sydor will probably get a small raise from his $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   As for unrestricted free agents, the Stars have some tough
decisions to make. They'll likely ask 38-year-old center Guy
Carbonneau back. He was magnificent in the playoffs. Not so certain
is the role of 37-year-old defenseman Craig Ludwig, who played well
in the playoffs but might not be able to hold off young defensemen
such as Sergey Gusev, Brad Lukowich or Petr Buzek.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also have to ponder the future of wingers Greg Adams
and Benoit Hogue. Do the Stars make room for younger players such
as Jamie Wright and Jason Botterill? Do they keep the skilled Hogue
and Adams? Or do they venture out into the free-agent market as
they have done the previous three summers to find a winger who can
add some scoring?
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said it's too early to make personnel
decisions. He wants to reflect on the season and have a clear mind
before addressing key moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether we can clearly evaluate right now,'' he
said. ``What you find out is that once you get a taste of this,
once it gets in your blood, for me anyway, it becomes everything
that you want. And now you have to decide how as an organization do
you get to that next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have enough horses? Do you change things? When you
reach this level, you can't afford to gloss anything over. You have
to be truthful and realistic with the coaching staff, with the
players, with all the personnel. You need to spend a lot of time
looking at everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will likely do that. The expansion draft to stock the
new Nashville franchise will be on a date yet to be set in late
June _ and the Stars will likely lose one player. Free agency
begins July 1 and the bidding will begin on available players.
</P>
<P>
   There are key decisions looming for the Stars. But if you listen
to those closest to the team, they don't believe much change is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys will come away disappointed, but it's still a great
season,'' Modano said. ``I really see ourselves being in this
position next year and for a long time to come. I don't think it's
a once-every-four-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a continual thing. We're in the same boat
that Detroit was four or five years ago. A couple of appearances in
the conference finals, a couple of appearances in the finals, and
you learn to go over that edge, to give that little extra that puts
you into that championship mode. That's where we are.''

Sanchez Vicario outduels Seles
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ At 17, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario surprised herself and
everyone else by winning the 1989 French Open. Steffi Graf was
tennis' ranking whiz kid back then, already a two-time teen-age
champion at Roland Garros coming off her Golden Grand Slam year, so
Sanchez Vicario's victory over Graf in the final would be a most
shocking of upsets.
</P>
<P>
   What's an Arantxa, we asked? Some kind of spider? The world
could hardly spell, or pronounce, her name.
</P>
<P>
   Five Junes later, the stocky little Spaniard won a second French
title, but that one carried an asterisk. Graf was hurt and Monica
Seles was gone from the scene, left a recluse by a knife-wielding
maniac. With a new wave of teen terrors beginning to rattle the
gates as well, the counter-punching Sanchez Vicario seemed unlikely
to add any more major pelts to her collection.
</P>
<P>
   But there she stood Saturday, stained with red mud and soaked
with sweat, a 26-year-old afterthought when the tournament began,
holding the Suzanne Lenglen Trophy aloft for a third time as the
French fans grudgingly gave Sanchez Vicario her due.
</P>
<P>
   Seles, 24 and going on middle age after everything she has had
to endure, was their dame, with good reason. But you had to admire
how Sanchez Vicario fought back here, too, shrugging off wrist and
leg injuries that had plagued her preparations to ultimately
survive three consecutive draining matches.
</P>
<P>
   Having managed this do-over of the 1991 final against Seles,
Sanchez Vicario also battled hard enough and played well enough for
two sets to reverse the result, producing a victory more startling
perhaps than the original one nine years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard because I have to be realistic that I was not
winning much,'' she said after the 7-6 (7-5), 0-6, 6-2 victory that
secured only her second championship of any kind over the last 26
months. ``But I work harder, I push myself to be a better tennis
player. It paid off, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario's third Roland Garros title, tying her for third
with Seles among the post-Open era players behind Chris Evert
(seven) and Graf (five), ensures Spain of its second clean sweep at
the French in five years. Alex Corretja and Carlos Moya, both
friends and countrymen of hers, play in the men's final today.
</P>
<P>
   After Sanchez Vicario won in 1994, Sergi Bruguera then defeated
fellow Spaniard Alberto Berasategui for the men's title.
</P>
<P>
   While the Seles comeback, stalled again of late because of her
father's long illness and recent death from stomach cancer, was the
hotter story of this day going in, Sanchez Vicario was determined
not to let it overshadow her own desires. If there was going to be
a fairy-tale finish to the French fortnight, she intended for it to
be her fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had pretty similar years,'' she said. ``It's been very
tough for both of us, in different situations. This was good for
women's tennis because it shows that we can still make unbelievable
matches.''
</P>
<P>
   The match was indeed unbelievable on several levels, not the
least of which was how radically it kept swinging back and forth.
Seles got up a break straight away, but Sanchez Vicario broke right
back. When Seles' second break set her up to serve for the first
set, the Spaniard answered in kind again.
</P>
<P>
   In the tiebreaker, Sanchez Vicario held on despite dropping four
points in a row, watching a 5-1 lead disappear in a matter of
seconds. And then Seles blew her off the court in the second set,
losing only six points total and apparently, once she quickly
gained a break point in the first game of the third set, securing
the momentum for keeps.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Sanchez Vicario saved the game by digging out three
consecutive winners and then broke Seles easily for a 2-0 lead.
When Seles was unable to capitalize on break points in the next two
service games, blowing two in the latter with horrible errors, the
day was lost for her.
</P>
<P>
   During the changeover, trailing 1-4, she sat with her eyes
closed, breathing deeply, apparently trying to block out the
opportunities squandered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arantxa is such a great player, she just ran down
everything,'' Seles said. ``I had to work very hard. At the end,
she just made less errors than I did. I was up in so many games on
her serve in the third set. They just slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect to have that happen and win the match against
someone like Arantxa.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles got a break when rain delayed the match 45 minutes,
leaving the courts slower than she would have liked given the foot
speed of her opponent. Sanchez Vicario, the consummate
counter-puncher, will chase down pretty much any ball that isn't
hit into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario's determination made her play more offense than
normal, at least when circumstances dictated. And, while she hit
only half as many winners as did Seles, she also made 19 fewer
errors. The fact that Seles would win 10 more points in the match
proved irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, she puts a lot of pressure on a person who has a
hitting style like myself,'' Seles said. ``Sometimes you go for too
much and you make errors.''
</P>
<P>
   She conceded the defeat ``disappointed'' her, but she has felt
worse in her life. Lots worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very different two weeks,'' Seles said, ``just
because I was able to concentrate on tennis, which was a very nice
feeling. I haven't been able to do that in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   In defeat then, she won.

VICTORY GALLOP DENIES REAL QUIET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ The record books will show only that Real Quiet
came agonizingly close to sweeping the Triple Crown, missing by a
nose in the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   But he was destined to lose, by heartbreak or controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop, second in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness
Stakes, finally caught ``The Fish'' yesterday, turning the tables
on Real Quiet in the mile-and-a-half Belmont Stakes by the closest
possible margin.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet blew a four-length stretch advantage as onrushing
Victory Gallop emerged as the photo-finish winner of a dramatic,
head-bobbing conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to lose like that,'' said trainer Bob Baffert, who
also missed a Triple Crown bid last year when Silver Charm lost the
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   But the alternative might have been worse. If Real Quiet had won
the photo, the three Belmont Park stewards said that because of
stretch interference he ``probably'' would have been the first
horse in 130 years to face Belmont disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred as Real Quiet weakened and jockey Kent
Desormeaux saw Victory Gallop gaining fast. Desormeaux tugged on
the right rein, hoping to intimidate Victory Gallop or turn Real
Quiet's head in Victory Gallop's direction to elicit a competitive
surge.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Real Quiet veered toward Victory Gallop and bumped him
twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a desperation measure,'' Desormeaux said.
</P>
<P>
   The finish was so close that jockey Gary Stevens, aboard Victory
Gallop, didn't know which horse had won. While pulling up, Stevens
told an outrider that he intended to claim foul if necessary, but
the result of the photo made that academic.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Stevens rode Silver Charm last year for Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bittersweet,'' Stevens said. ``The whole country was
watching that other horse. I know what it feels like to come up
short like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Victory Gallop _ Houston brothers Art, Jack and
J.R. Preston _ also know how it feels to narrowly lose.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kentucky Derby, Victory Gallop's late charge came up a
half-length short. Stevens, selected to replace Alex Solis, changed
tactics in the Preakness and hustled Victory Gallop to stay in
front of Real Quiet, but that resulted in a 21/4-length loss.
</P>
<P>
   Recovering quickly from a skin rash in the week after the
Preakness, Victory Gallop was permitted to keep his pace in the
Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   He was next to last in the 11-horse field before getting into
gear. But even as Victory Gallop was advancing, Stevens was worried
that Real Quiet's quick move to leaders Chilito and Grand Slam
around the second turn would be too much to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was getting away from us,'' Stevens said. ``I really didn't
know if we could get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Desormeaux moved Real Quiet too early. Perhaps Baffert's
decision to give Real Quiet a week off after the Preakness made a
difference in the closing furlong. Maybe Real Quiet doesn't want a
mile-and-a-half.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Real Quiet suddenly became rubber-legged in
the last 200 yards as Victory Gallop poured it on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We split horses at the eighth-pole and this colt saw
daylight,'' said Stevens, who twice moved Victory Gallop between
horses for room in the lane. ``I was very confident we were going
to pick (Real Quiet) up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the closing few strides, Real Quiet made serious contact
with us. I felt like (Victory Gallop) was going to win by a neck or
more and all of a sudden he hit me and it broke this colt's
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, we got up. The stewards didn't have to go into
that decision. That would have been a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas-bred gelding Thomas Jo, partly owned by breeder Larry
Smith of Pilot Point, finished third, six lengths back.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop, the 9-to-2 second betting choice behind 4-to-5
favorite Real Quiet, paid $11 to win and completed the distance in
2:29, five full seconds slower than Secretariat's race and track
record.
</P>
<P>
   First place in the Belmont was worth $600,000 to the Prestons,
but that pales in comparison with the first-place prize that would
have awaited Real Quiet's owner, Mike Pegram.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram made $200,000 for finishing second, but missed out on a
$5 million Visa Triple Crown Challenge bonus. More disappointing,
he said, is that Real Quiet is not the 12th horse to sweep the
classics. Now he is the 14th horse to capture the first two legs
and fail in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the famous horses on the list of Triple Crown
near-misses, Real Quiet _ a crooked-legged $17,000 bargain
nicknamed ``The Fish'' by Baffert _ came the closest to glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had it,'' Baffert said. ``I could just see the headlines
tomorrow: `The Fish Does It.'''
</P>
<P>
   But with yet another failed Triple Crown assault on the books,
the morning papers will read differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fish floundered,'' Baffert said.

IRL LIKELY TO REWARD TMS WITH TWO RACE WEEKENDS NEXT YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Motor Speedway is likely to retain its
distinction as the only venue with two race dates on the Pep Boys
Indy Racing League's 1999 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Mehl, the IRL's executive director, said he is working on
next year's lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a while before we have a schedule for next year,''
Mehl said after the drivers' meeting for the True Value 500K
yesterday. ``But there's no reason not to come back to Texas twice.
I mean, we've got a night race and a day race _ and they like us
down here.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRL's second 1998 visit to North Texas, for the Lone Star
500K, is booked for the afternoon of Sept. 20. It is the 10th of 11
races on a schedule highlighted, as usual, by the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   IRL officials added the fall race at TMS, a July 19 event at
Dover (Del.) Downs International Speedway and Atlanta Motor
Speedway on Aug. 29 to this year's lineup. Those venues fit the
IRL's all-oval criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have an oval facility that's got a place for us
on the schedule. That's what we're looking for,'' Mehl said. ``I
think our schedule will grow in 2000. There are some things
happening, but they're not going to happen in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, IRL founder Tony
George said he hoped to grow the league ``in a managed way so that
we can run 16 or 18 races. That would be my guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehl and George, who also is president of the IMS, declined to
name specific markets for expansion. But an IRL source says the new
oval planned by International Speedway Corp. in Kansas City, Mo.,
another new oval planned as a joint venture between ISC and the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corp. for the Chicago area and even the
high-banked Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Fla.,
are candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to grow the schedule, and it's tough right now because
there aren't a lot of options available to us,'' George said. ``We
still have hopes of expanding into other major markets in the next
year or two. I hope we have the same number of races, if not more
(in 1999). We've got a few irons in the fire and with the simple
nod of the head we could add a couple. Teams need to know, because
they're trying to put their sponsorship packages together. And TV
obviously wants to know what dates are on so they can give us
primary consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   George said he has enjoyed both of the IRL's June visits for
night races here, and working with developer Bruton Smith and his
Speedway Motorsports Inc. staffs at Atlanta and Charlotte motor
speedways.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a beautiful facility, it's a big market and it's sort
of been starved for racing,'' George said. ``Right now, Speedway
Motorsports has been very good to work with. Plus, Bruton is just
relentless.''

 &HT;    Gingrich renews his attacks on Clinton 'defendant-in-chief'
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave President
Clinton a new title Saturday, ``defendant-in-chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending a brief cease-fire in his war of words on Clinton, the
speaker, in a play on the president's role as commander-in-chief of
U.S. armed forces, said Clinton was erecting barriers to
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of alleged
wrongdoing in the White House and to congressional probes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the spectacle in Washington today of the president
frankly as defendant-in-chief,'' Gingrich said at a Heritage
Foundation dinner for nearly 400 people in this western Michigan
city. ``It would have been inconceivable for (George) Washington or
(Benjamin) Franklin or (Thomas) Jefferson or (Alexander) Hamilton
to have the person sworn to uphold the Constitution as the chief
law-enforcement officer using every defense item he can find from
every defense lawyer in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich came to former President Gerald Ford's hometown to talk
about the concept of responsibility as part of Heritage's 25th
anniversary celebration. Previous speakers in the conservative
think tank's lecture series include Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas and Lady Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   He never mentioned Clinton's name, but talked at length about
two of Clinton's predecessors, George Washington and Dwight
Eisenhower, returning to the same themes he has used repeatedly to
criticize the president.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, he said, knew that ``the being is more important
than the talking. ... You can talk about the country being under
the law, but if you break the law, in fact others will break the
law, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarking on the 54th anniversary Saturday of the D-Day landings
in Normandy, Gingrich said, ``Eisenhower said the greatest of all
the lessons of Normandy was the courage and idealism of young
Americans. That goes to the heart of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday in Marietta, Gingrich spoke at a drug awareness
seminar sponsored by U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   The federal government needs to set a tough zero-tolerance
policy for violence in all public schools, one that would prohibit
schools from readmitting students who have brought a weapon to
school, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said that while many school districts expel students
who bring weapons on school grounds, there needs to be a
further-reaching federal law that mandates all of them to do so.
``We need to change the federal law,'' Gingrich said, outside
Wheeler High School in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's ``Operation Drug Free Georgia'' organization hosted
the morning seminar, which drew about 50 people. Parents were
encouraged to talk to their children about the danger of drugs,
before the kids are offered marijuana, LSD or another illegal
substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If necessary, we need to test kids, and that should be a
condition of going to school,'' Gingrich told them. ``If you want
your child to be in school and that child behaves in a way that is
suspicious, they should have the right to test him or immediately
send him home.'' Before his Michigan speech, Gingrich heard several
calls for Clinton's impeachment from the people who waited in line
at a suburban book store to get an autographed copy of ``Lessons
Learned the Hard Way,'' his new book.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker was noncommittal, saying any decision about
impeachment hearings would await a report from Starr, if he decides
to send one to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Brigle, a real estate appraiser, said he welcomed
Gingrich's more aggressive approach, but said he hasn't gone far
enough. ``I still don't see the leadership I'd like.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven-year-old Taylor Niebor also had kind words for the
speaker. ``Thank you for telling the truth,'' she told Gingrich as
he signed books for her father and grandmother.

Bulls want to make most of upper hand
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ The Bulls are in the NBA Finals, but they aren't even the
hottest team in their city. Just ask the Astros about the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no denying Michael Jordan and friends are the new
sizzling team of the Finals, having cooled off the Utah Jazz in
Game 2 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part for the Bulls. It's so hard nobody has
done it. And even though these Bulls have made a habit of doing
uprecedented things, this undertaking was too much for people such
as Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and a lot of other legends.
</P>
<P>
   They embark this evening on a quest to become the first team to
win the middle three games of the NBA Finals on its home floor.
After the way the Bulls handled themselves in the first two games
at Utah, who would bet against them?
</P>
<P>
   With the series knotted at a win apiece, the Bulls return to the
United Center tonight for Game 3 knowing if they can sweep the
middle three games of the best-of-seven Finals, they can win title
No. 6 of the '90s without having to return to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind the Bulls have swept the three middle games before
_ as the visiting team. They did so at Los Angeles against the
Lakers in 1991 after splitting the opening two games at home.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulls can do it on the road, who's to say they can't do
it at home?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe their coach. Phil Jackson doesn't exactly sound
overconfident about a sweep of the next three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long playoff (series),'' Jackson said. ``I can see
it in the making. It's going to be one of those playoffs that are
going to be very difficult. So I think disregard for either team in
this situation is (unwise).''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls have nothing about which to be upset. They lost
the opener against the Jazz, but had an excellent chance to win.
Then they made all the right plays in Game 2 to grab the home-court
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Scottie Pippen is concerned, things have gone right on
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we lose a game, Chicagoans worry,'' Pippen said.
``But we have a good feel for where we are. We knew we needed to
win one game in Utah and we did. People should just relax and enjoy
the show. We're very confident.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not? The Bulls stopped Utah's seven-game playoff winning
streak Friday. Jerry Sloan's forces looked tentative in both games
at Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulty home teams have had in the middle games since
the Finals went to a 2-3-2 format in 1985 is cause for the Bulls to
recognize they are vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go there and steal one or two,'' said the Jazz's
Bryon Russell. ``So it's not over. It's one loss. We ran off seven
in a row, so we have to lose one sometime. This wasn't a good time,
but we lost it, so now we have to regroup.''
</P>
<P>
   This series has followed the same path as the Rockets' 1994
Finals with New York. The Rockets won the opener, then lost Game 2
at The Summit. They then won Game 3 in New York to regain the
home-court advantage. Still, they needed seven games to close out
the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pressure of protecting their home floor, the
Bulls face several other interesting subplots today:
</P>
<P>
   Can the Bulls duplicate the impressive job they have done
defensively, particularly against Karl Malone?
</P>
<P>
   It's clear the Jazz is having doubts because of the way the
Bulls are choking off scoring opportunities for Malone. Dennis
Rodman did a wonderful job in Game 2 and for the series Malone is
shooting only 14-for-41 (34 pecent).
</P>
<P>
   Malone must play better if Utah is to have more success in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's will to win still seems stronger than anybody else's in
the game, including Malone's.
</P>
<P>
   After five NBA championships, it would be understandable if
Jordan's hunger is not as great as earlier in the decade. But he's
shown he isn't satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan's return to Chicago always creates a sideshow. He had his
No. 4 retired by the Bulls and, even though Sloan likes to say,
``They think I've been dead for 10 years,'' there's still an
attachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Bulls' dynasty is to end, I couldn't think of a better
coach to end it than Jerry,'' Orlando president Pat Williams said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was general manager of the Bulls when Sloan played for
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry was the Bulls' first franchise player,'' Williams said.
``So it would be sweet consolation to Chicago because Jerry is one
of its all-time sports greats _ Bobby Hull, Dick Butkus, Gale
Sayers and Ernie Banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Motta used to say that what people underestimated most
about Jerry was the size of his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, we'll find out if he can will some of that heart to his
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sloan was unhappy after sleeping on the Game 2 loss.
His team watched film at its practice facility, then, as they
exited the locker room and headed to the court, Sloan lashed out at
the media for not being in their assigned waiting area.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Malone was asked if Sloan was as short with the Jazz as
he was with the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but we expect that,'' Malone said. ``He's always short
with us, especially when we don't give him a reason to be long with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, meanwhile, seem to have an inner confidence that they
can become the first team to win all three of the middle games of
the Finals at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to beat a good team three times in a row,''
Jordan said. ``We may very well have to win another one in Utah.
But right now, we're just taking it one game at a time. If we do
that, we'll be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've beaten some good teams to get here. So if that's what
they consider to be dead, I don't mind being dead for a little
while longer.''

SKY HARBOR AIRCRAFT UNDER CLOUD IN OZONE FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ They pollute. They're virtually unregulated. And
they're one of the reasons the Valley is losing its battle against
summer ozone pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes take off or land at Sky Harbor International Airport
more than 1,400 times a day, leaving nearly invisible trails of
ozone-causing chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   But local regulators are powerless to rein in the emissions.
It's a power that belongs to federal authorities _ and they rarely
exercise it.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a disparity in the air-pollution wars that
frustrates local authorities and fuels charges of double standards.
As Phoenix area officials are being pressured by the federal
government to improve air quality, a major source of pollution
can't be touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want everybody to play by the same rules,'' said Rep.
Marilyn Jarrett, R-Mesa. At the state Legislature, she's griped
about aircraft emissions being outside her reach while she is asked
to tighten restrictions on cars or to consider whether to ban leaf
blowers.
</P>
<P>
   Max Shauck, chairman of the Aviation Sciences Department at
Baylor University, said airlines' unregulated nature deepens the
rift.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting off scot-free,'' he said. ``It's such an
inequitable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The local rumblings about aircraft emissions echo those of other
areas, most notably Los Angeles. There, in the nation's smog
capital, regulators are pressuring for something to be done to curb
airport emissions.
</P>
<P>
   A national environmental group complains that aircraft are
getting off easy when it comes to contaminating the skies. In a
1996 report, the Natural Resources Defense Council spotlighted
airports _ and aircraft in particular _ as unchecked pollution
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft can produce as much ground-level ozone as power plants
or smokestacks, the NRDC stated. And while those industrial sources
have to hew to clean-air guidelines, it's different at the local
airfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aviation industry is being given a free ride,'' stated the
NRDC report, ``Flying Off Course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither airports nor the airlines are held accountable for the
aggregate impacts of their ground-level aircraft emissions.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The takeoffs, landings and idling times of aircraft Valleywide
make them the number-one industrial source of nitrogen-oxide
pollution in the region. They're the third-biggest offender for
industrial hydrocarbon pollution, statistics show. &UR; Those two
chemicals combine to form ozone, a pollutant that has kept the
Valley from meeting federal clean-air standards.
</P>
<P>
   At Sky Harbor alone, aircraft emissions contribute nearly 25
percent of the total pollution _ almost double their emissions from
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Spread across the entire region, aircraft at Sky Harbor and a
dozen smaller airports are responsible for 3 to 5 percent of the
Valley's air pollution, local studies show. That's much less than
motor vehicles but substantially more than most other contributors
to bad air _ lawn mowers, leaf blowers and wood-burning fireplaces,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of airlines and airports say curbing
aircraft emissions is outside of their control. The problem, they
say, lies in the crazy quilt of agencies and groups that use and
regulate airport activities. There are many sources of pollution,
but no one with control over the whole picture.
</P>
<P>
   For example, federal authorities are in charge of aircraft
emissions. But rather than exercise their power, they conform to
less rigid international standards, fearful of disrupting
international commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials say that for all the focus on aircraft, the
main source of the problem is something that airports and airlines
can't do much about: The automobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing we can do can force passengers into using public
transportation or a shuttle,'' said Bonnie Wilson of the North
American branch of the Airports Council International.
</P>
<P>
   At Sky Harbor, emissions from all the cars coming and going
outstrip those from planes by a factor of 3-1, according to the
airport's most recent environmental impact statement.
</P>
<P>
   Add the motor vehicle exhaust and plane emissions to byproducts
of plane engine combustion, such as benzene and formaldehyde, and
airports add up to one big pollution headache. That's a good reason
to reduce jet emissions while cutting back on car trips at
airports, the NRDC reported.
</P>
<P>
   Left unregulated, airplanes' share of pollution at Sky Harbor is
likely to increase as cars and trucks face even more restrictions
and as airports shift their service vehicles to alternative fuels.
The airport expects air travel to grow 30 to 50 percent over the
next 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sky Harbor's environmental statement bears this out: In just
seven years, the pollution balance between cars and planes has
shifted from 7-1 to 3-1. During this time, car engines have gotten
cleaner and aircraft engines have remained virtually unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft pour five to seven tons of nitrogen oxides into the
Valley's atmosphere daily, according to two local 1996 studies.
Airplanes are responsible for 1.4 tons to 2.2 tons a day of
hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
   Measured against fixed pollution sources, such as microchip
plants or electrical generators, airplane exhaust is sizable.
Aircraft produce 19 percent more nitrogen oxides, the second source
in that category, according to the Maricopa County Environmental
Services Department. &UR; Airplane exhaust ranks third behind
wood-furniture manufacturers and industrial solvent use as a source
of hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, plane engines are being built cleaner today than
before, said Shauck of Baylor. Since 1981, standards have aimed at
cleaning up smoke, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Just this
spring, standards were tightened again, for nitrogen oxides.
</P>
<P>
   The rub, Shauck said, is that airplanes last a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just junk these (existing) engines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's where cleaner-burning aviation fuel comes into play, said
Shauck, who is researching alternative fuels. He predicts such
fuels are four to five years away from being certified for use by
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, most attempts to cut emissions at airports are
occurring on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   At Sky Harbor, SuperShuttle vans and most cabs run on
alternative fuels. In August, a fleet of 16 buses powered by
compressed natural gas will replace diesel-powered shuttle buses.
To city Aviation Director Dutch Bertholf Jr., such moves are part
of the airport's effort to be a good neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes also show how little sway airport officials have
over Sky Harbor's pollution. Ground vehicles and operations make up
only a sliver of the picture, according to local and national
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are also trying to help out: Since last fall, Southwest
Airlines has been experimenting with 22 electrically powered
baggage tugs, about half of its fleet. The tugs whirr across the
tarmac, ferrying bags from airplanes to terminals.
</P>
<P>
   But the effect of such strategies is so small that some
clean-air advocates have offered a more drastic solution: Build a
new airport outside Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that plan would only make things worse. An airport
in a city such as Casa Grande would add to pollution by increasing
the number of miles driven by most travelers, said Gaye Knight,
environmental-program specialist for the city of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of a third runway at Sky Harbor, currently
under way, is a more practical solution, Sky Harbor officials
argue. That's because it will reduce the time aircraft idle waiting
to take off.
</P>
<P>
   Some who favor a new airport have seen a link between Denver's
clean-air victories and the closing of centrally located Stapleton
International Airport. But the achievements came prior to Denver
International Airport opening 24 miles northeast of downtown Denver
in February 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado officials attribute their recent clean air record to
tighter restrictions on cars and trucks. The airport's move
probably helped, but it's not the reason for the cleaner skies,
said Christopher Dann of the Colorado Department of Public Health
and Environment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles region, some are preaching decentralized air
travel. As Los Angeles International Airport contemplates yet
another expansion, neighboring El Segundo is promoting the idea of
beefing up surrounding airports instead. That way, travelers would
have shorter commutes and pollution would not be concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   But for such a proposal to have much effect, airlines would need
numerous locations within a single metro area _ a costly prospect
they are not likely to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, some degree of decentralization is being
contemplated as Sky Harbor grapples with restraints on its
geographic growth. Planners already are talking about using
Williams Gateway Airport in Mesa for cargo and passenger operations
as air travel grows.
</P>
<P>
   Airport pollution is likely to get some attention in local
debates as regulators scramble for ways to improve the Valley's air
quality.
</P>
<P>
   It's already happened in California, said Sid Greenwald, an
airport consultant with the firm of Landrum and Brown of
Cincinnati. &UR; Communities should promote mass transit to get people
to and from airports, she said. &UR; And they should take aim at the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them to hop up and down and get on the feds' backs to do
more about (airplane) engine emissions,'' she said. &QL;

You can't help it _ and you won't admit it _ but you want the

   And yet, here you are, rooting for the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Not out loud, of course, because that would be like admitting
you en joy a grilled porterhouse now and then, or the occasional

</P>
<P>
   You don't like any of those things _ not really, not much _ but
you still like the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   It worries you.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have won five champi onships, while the team from Utah
has none. Five championships is enough. One is enough. That's what

</P>
<P>
   You want the Chicago Bulls to win because you know it's more
than basketball you're watching when Michael Jordan and Scottie
Pippen are on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   It's something special, like fire works bursting in a night sky.
Wish ing for them to fade is like wanting to hurry a sunset, like
rubbing off a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won more champi onships than they needed to or de

without Ruth and Gehrig.
</P>
<P>
   Without Mantle and Maris.

Winning sometimes with his presence alone because the other people
knew how good he was and choked up a lit tle.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, if you follow the game I play, you know Cannon was the
Jordan of his time. And Grantland Rice the Ruth. And Red Smith the
DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   And the great Shirley Povich, who died at 92 last week after 75
years on the job, the Gehrig.

   When Gehrig played with Ruth, the writer Franklin P. Adams
(F.P.A.) explained it all in a sen tence.
</P>
<P>
   Of Gehrig he wrote, ``He was the guy who hit all those home runs
the year Ruth broke the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without an Adams or a Rice or a Smith or a Povich to spell
it out, you know why you're backing the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just about sports. Memo ries are great, and the
highlights are on film. But something in you still longs for a new
movie from Jimmy Stewart. A new bit from the Marx Brothers. It's
not selfish. It has more to do with self-preservation than with
greed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls will break up at the end of this season and you'll be
left among those who ``saw them when.''
</P>
<P>
   You've been around long enough to appreciate all the great ones

REAL QUIET JUST MISSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ In the end, the critics were correct. Real Quiet
didn't fit the picture of a Triple Crown winner.
</P>
<P>
   By a photo-finish margin, officially termed a nose but actually
the width of your hand, Real Quiet and jockey Kent Desormeaux
didn't measure up Saturday, losing the 130th Belmont Stakes to
Victory Gallop and Gary Stevens in front of 80,167 tortured fans.
</P>
<P>
   Had the finish line arrived a stride earlier or a stride later,
Real Quiet would be hailed today as the 12th horse to sweep the
Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont. Or, at least, he
would be hailed as a tough and tenacious overachiever.
</P>
<P>
   Had the result been different, Desormeaux and trainer Bob
Baffert would go back to work at Hollywood Park as conquering
heroes, and owner Mike Pegram might never have to pay for another
beer despite having a $5 million Triple Crown bonus in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   But after watching Real Quiet lose a race he had led by four
lengths in the middle of the quarter-mile Belmont Park homestretch,
his team can only play the ``woulda, coulda, shoulda'' game with
which horseplayers are so familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my fault,'' Baffert offered minutes after the race,
saying Real Quiet lost simply because he lacked the stamina for the
1{-mile marathon. ``The Fish (Real Quiet's nickname) floundered and
that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to do it again, I can tell you that,'' Desormeaux
said, trying to take the blame, saying he sent Real Quiet to a
commanding lead too early, squandering the colt's dwindling energy,
and was too aggressive about trying to let Real Quiet ``see''
Victory Gallop coming, turning the colt's head so hard he veered to
the right in the final yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not his fault,'' Baffert responded. ``Today, we just got
beat. That's all there is to it. It wasn't (Desormeaux), the horse
just got beat.''
</P>
<P>
   That slight swerve in deep stretch _ actually two swerves
strides apart _ put Real Quiet in the path of Victory Gallop and
briefly stopped the latter's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   If Real Quiet had won on the track, he might have lost the
Triple Crown in the stewards' stand, a chilling thought that must
have haunted the Belmont Park officials overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, unsure he'd won the head-bobbing finish, immediately
asked an official outrider to put a ``hold'' on the result so he
could claim foul. The stewards posted the ``inquiry'' sign and it
was eight minutes before they announced that the result would stand
_ Victory Gallop first, Real Quiet second, Thomas Jo and Chris
McCarron six lengths back in third. (Disappointment of the day was
Grand Slam, who finished seventh as the 7-1 third choice.)
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop, who was timed in 2:29.16, one of the slower
recent Belmonts, paid $11 as the 9-2 second choice of the track's
second biggest crowd ever. Real Quiet was 4-5 _ the heaviest
Belmont favorite since Alysheba 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape showed that the bumping between the two horses was
all Real Quiet's fault, whether because of his staggering fatigue
or because of Desormeaux's work with the reins.
</P>
<P>
   In a printed statement, the stewards said that had Real Quiet
won the photo, he ``probably'' would have been disqualified for
interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he got beat, then. That would have been worse,'' said
Baffert, who kept his famous sense of humor after watching Real
Quiet lose the Belmont and the Triple Crown in even more dramatic
fashion than Baffert-trained Silver Charm did in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet is the fifth Triple Crown hopeful to fail in the
Belmont since Affirmed accomplished the last sweep 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was Stevens who rode Silver Charm last year, and
thought he had the Belmont won until Touch Gold rallied on the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in the race whose sheer length makes it a classic
jockeys' race, Stevens rode brilliantly to win the Belmont for the
second time. (He teamed up with Thunder Gulch in 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   He had to thread Victory Gallop through traffic several times
before finally seeing daylight in the shadow of the grandstand.
Stevens' performance was a triumph of patience.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, he had a chalk talk with Elliott Walden, who
trains the son of Cryptoclearance for the Preston brothers, Texas
oilmen who breed horses at Prestonwood Farm in Kentucky. Stevens
was urged not to chase Real Quiet if the favorite made the same
mid-race move toward the leaders that won him the Derby and
Preakness. It was a rope-a-dope strategy _ let Real Quiet tire
himself out.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop was 10th, eight lengths behind early leader
Chilito, as they ran up the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very difficult to hit the three-eighths pole and
see Real Quiet opening up on me and not hit the button,'' Stevens
said. ``But that's the way you ride when you have confidence in
your horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop lost the Derby by half a length after a sweeping
rally, and Walden thought his horse had deserved to win. After
Saturday's race, maybe Walden was right.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Real Quiet bashers were right, though not by much.

SEARCH WIDENS FOR ARMED FUGITIVES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JO THOMAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLANDING, Utah _ As the trail of two armed fugitives seemed to
grow cold, a massive search was expanded east and west on Saturday
to include 100 square miles in the Four Corners area of Utah,
Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 police officers and National Guardsmen, as well as
Navajo Nation police officers and trackers, are searching the
desert canyons here for Alan Pilon, 30, of Dove Creek, Colo., and
Jason Wayne McVean, 26, of Durango, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who have been described as survivalists, are suspects
in the killing of one police officer and the injuring of three
others.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Jerry Martin, of Dolores County, Colo., said that the
search, which has centered on the town of Bluff, Utah, has been
expanded to the west near Mexican Hat, Utah, and east to include
southwest Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   As evening approached, police checked spotlights on a bridge
over the San Juan River just south of Bluff. Navajo Police Officer
Charles Smith Jr. said the landscape south of town, much of it on
the reservation, was ``inaccessible all of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunt began in Cortez on May 29, when a police officer, Dale
Claxton, 35, was shot to death with a machine gun by three hooded
men dressed in camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   Two Montezuma County, Colo., sheriff's deputies were injured in
the chase and shootout that followed. The gunmen, who had been
stopped for driving a stolen water truck, fled on foot after
leaving the truck near the entrance to three canyons in the
Hovenweep National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had 100 men and three weeks, you could search one of
them,'' said Martin, who has a five-man force.
</P>
<P>
   The search moved to Bluff on Thursday when Kelly Bradford, 35, a
San Juan County sheriff's deputy, was shot while investigating a
report that a man in camouflage had shot at a social worker.
</P>
<P>
   At a campsite near this spot, a third suspect, Robert Matthew
Mason, 26, of Durango, was found dead, shot between the eyes. ``All
indications are suicide,'' said Sheriff Mike Lacy of San Juan
County.
</P>
<P>
   The search is ``kind of a waiting game,'' Smith said. ``You try
to figure out: What would I do if I was a bad guy? Where would I
go?''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got time on our side,'' he said.

REAL ESTATE: DOWNTOWN MILWAUKEE HOUSING PICKS UP  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JILL SCHACHNER CHANEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE, Wis. _ The recently completed conversion of three
historic manufacturing and warehouse buildings into a mixed-use
downtown development is considered an early success story in this
city's effort to build a full-time residential population in the
heart of its business and financial district.
</P>
<P>
   Called City Hall Square, the $17-million, 135-unit mixed-income
rental complex is the first large downtown residential project in
10 years. It also contains 32,000 square feet of ground-floor
commercial space.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 75 percent of the apartments have been leased since the
developer _ Housing Horizons LLC, a wholly owned company of the
Kimberly-Clark Corp., based in Dallas _ began renting the units in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Market-rate rents range from $780 a month for a one-bedroom unit
to $1,200 for a two-bedroom. Half of the apartments are set aside
for moderate-income tenants. For a household of four with an income
of no more than $32,340 a year, a one-bedroom rents for $450 a
month, a two-bedroom for $650.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, two apartment buildings were developed downtown with a
total of 322 units, but the recession quashed hopes at the time of
creating a residential component there. It is only in the last
three years that developers have found a renewed interest among
young professionals and empty-nesters in moving out of the suburbs
and into the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it was senseless for me to live in the suburbs,''
said Jose Yamat, who rented a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment in
City Hall Square.
</P>
<P>
   Yamat, a 34-year-old stockbroker, had previously lived in the
suburbs and planned to rent another suburban apartment with his new
wife, Stephanie. That was until he began thinking about the
benefits of living downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Giving up his 20-minute commute would give him more time to
enjoy the city, including summer jazz concerts and boating on Lake
Michigan, whose downtown shoreline is peppered with marinas.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone in my age group with no kids, living downtown is
more desirable,'' Mr. Yamat said. ``Everything is happening
downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   He has found the downtown to be surprisingly friendly for
living, offering nearly everything he needs within walking distance
with the exception of a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Both developers and residents say the renewed interest in
downtown Milwaukee is due in large part to public and private
efforts to make it more livable, including a variety of year-round
cultural events like art exhibitions, concerts and a $15-million
pedestrian walkway along the banks of the now clean Milwaukee
River, which snakes through the area.
</P>
<P>
   Several upscale restaurants, cafes, and microbreweries have
opened along the riverwalk, with outdoor seating when weather
permits. In addition, the three-year-old Betty Brinn Children's
Museum on the lakefront is drawing more families downtown, and
plans have been completed to expand the nearby Milwaukee Art
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say they also are streamlining the zoning and
approval process to encourage more residential and commercial
development downtown. According to Peter Park, the city's planning
director, the current downtown zoning permits residential uses only
by special approval. But, he said, the city is changing its
regulations to allow such uses by right to encourage developers to
convert more of the older, low-rise commercial buildings into
residences.
</P>
<P>
   The city also is completing a downtown plan to encourage an
organized development of the square-mile area, rather than allowing
it to occur on a piecemeal basis, Park said. Part of the plan
includes the addition of some 5,000 units of downtown housing, said
Daniel McCarthy, urban development coordinator for the Department
of City Development.
</P>
<P>
   To help accomplish this goal, the city is in limited instances
providing loans, infrastructure and other assistance to developers
whose projects have the potential to spur other development in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about eight blocks west and across the river from
City Hall Square, the city condemned at a total cost of $4 million
a half block of blighted property for the benefit of a
not-for-profit developer, who took over the property for $1.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said the city took the unusual step of condemning the
property for the developer because of a large amount of investment
in the area, including the city's new convention center, a new IMAX
theater and its main library.
</P>
<P>
   A further consideration was that because the project would be
testing the waters for more residential development there rents
might not be able to support the construction debt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the $10.5-million project, called Library Hill
Apartments, call for 140 units with rents for one-bedrooms to
two-bedrooms-with-den ranging from $800 to $1,100 for said Jon
Wellhoefer, executive vice president of the Milwaukee Redevelopment
Corp., its developer. Construction is scheduled to begin this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Wellhoefer said the project already had received a great amount
of interest from Marquette University students, whose campus is
less than a mile west of downtown Milwaukee, and from employees of
many of the businesses in the west side of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   These projects and the riverwalk already are helping to spur
additional development of market-rate rental and condominium
apartments in the downtown.
</P>
<P>
   One of those spin-off projects, called Riverfront Lofts,
originally was intended to be a small commercial development. But
David Zazove, president of Tandem Realty Corp., of Chicago, its
developer, said he had received so many inquiries about whether he
would use his 80-year-old warehouse on the Milwaukee River for loft
apartments that he jettisoned his original plans and began
construction of Riverfront Lofts four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 17 of the planned 36 condominium apartments almost
directly across the river from City Hall Square have been sold. The
lofts, which will include three duplex penthouse apartments, range
in price from $170,000 to $795,000 and in size from 1,800 to 5,000
square feet, Zazove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started this project, we were going to make
small units and price them as inexpensively as possible,'' he said.
``But when we started to market the building we found out there was
enough of a market for luxury lofts.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of the market also has begun to spark development in
neighborhoods adjacent to the downtown.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's historic Third Ward, a one-time produce market on
the Milwaukee River on the southeast edge of downtown, two former
warehouses are being converted to condominiums and a 12-year-old
rental apartment building is being converted to condominiums, said
Peter Ogden, president of Ogden &AMP; Co., a Milwaukee real estate
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden said that half of the 103 apartments in the building,
called The Broadway, sold in the first month of sales with prices
ranging from $61,000 for a 750-square-foot one bedroom, one-bath
unit to $144,000 for a nearly 1,200-square-foot two-bedroom, two
bath unit with den.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden reports a variety of purchasers including an unexpected
number of older couples who are selling spacious suburban homes to
buy downtown apartments.
</P>
<P>
   One of the buyers was Charles Cain, who recently signed a
contract for one- bedroom with den.
</P>
<P>
   Cain, who is 49 and lives in the suburb of Lake Geneva with his
wife, Lorraine, has commuted nearly an hour to his downtown
construction equipment supply company for 15 years. Now that his
three children are grown, he says he is looking forward to enjoying
the city's offerings without facing a long commute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired of driving,'' he said. ``We do a lot of things
downtown, and we just made the decision to move and not commute
anymore.''

INMATE'S FOLLOWERS WHO MOVE INTO HUD HOMES ARE TOUGH TO DISLODGE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
A baby-faced con artist peddling reli gion and anti-government
fervor from behind prison bars has prodded his flock to take over
at least six federally owned houses in the Phoenix area.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; The Regency House Church, led by prison inmate Jason Corey
Bullard, began claiming the houses this year, sending members into
the homes under cover of a flurry of apparently bogus legal claims
that have tied the federal govern ment into knots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that they belong to God, period,'' Bullard said of
the houses. ``When God moves a church to action, the church is not
go ing to restrain it self.''
</P>
<P>
   In several cases, legitimate buyers were lined up by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development only to be left out in
the cold as church members beat them through the door.
</P>
<P>
   The church claims in court documents that the homes will be used
``for the purpose of sharing the Word of God in these neighborhoods
and the community as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard, in a Friday telephone interview from prison, said
church members will ``watch the neighborhoods . . . be good
citizens in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But HUD officials are concerned not only because they can't sell
the homes _ worth up to $110,000 _ but because the effort is being
led by a felon whose followers are spouting anti-government dogma
and ignoring a judge's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Bullard and papers filed by church members in Superior Court
espouse a philosophy similar to that of well-publicized Freemen
groups in the western United States. Claim ing not to recognize the
authority of the courts or the federal govern ment, they tout a
loose mix of 200-year-old common law, early constitutional doctrine
and funda mentalist Christian beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Flanagan, HUD's deputy state coordinator, is convinced
forceable evictions will be necessary to end the unusual face-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to be reasonable with them,'' Flanagan said. ``But
we cannot sell these properties to anyone else, because we do not
have clear title.''
</P>
<P>
   HUD is now working with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office to
determine how to get them out. It could be tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them we're not going anywhere,'' church member Kelly
Hollingshead told a reporter last month after a sheriff's deputy
vis ited her at the house she and her three children share with her
hus band, Leslie, in the 600 block of West Sixth Avenue in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   At week's end, the homes were still occupied by church members
more than four months after they began filing legal documents claim
ing the properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said ``Dave,'' of Tempe, who asked that
his real name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Dave was days from owning a HUD home _ a ranch-style house with
pool and whirlpool in the 600 block of North Orlando in Mesa _ when
Regency House took it over in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a first-time home buyer. I really thought I got lucky,''
he said. ``It was my dream home.''
</P>
<P>
   Church members apparently thought so, too. They moved in a day
or two before Dave sealed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bid on that house, and I won the bid. I was ready to
close,'' Dave said. During a long weekend, while waiting to get a
last bit of informa tion to his title company, he offered to show
the house to friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``A neighbor said someone had moved in,'' he said. ``They had
changed the locks.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredulous, Dave called a company manag ing the property for
HUD. The company sent someone to change the locks back. A day
later, Regency House swapped locks once more and moved in. &QL; 
WHO'S MAKING THE MONEY? &QL; 
It wasn't the first time HUD has had to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, an Apache Junction man who ran his own church moved
friends into vacant HUD homes for a fee, claiming God had given him
the properties. He was later con victed of writing nearly $15,000
in bogus checks in an unrelated scam.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities aren't sure who, if any one, is making money off the
latest house grabbing. But Flanagan said that in one or two cases,
those who have moved into a church-oc cupied house have been
charged several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a man who tried to occupy a vacant Veterans Adminis
tration home in Mesa told authori ties he had paid Regency House
$6,000 for the right to move in. He surrendered the house and it
was later sold by the government, said Jerry Gessner, VA public
affairs officer.
</P>
<P>
   The question, Flanagan said, is: ``Are these people victims, or
are they part of the scheme?''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard calls himself ``reverend'' and ``presiding bishop'' of a
church about which little is known. He signs many of the documents
mem bers have filed as well as many of the church's court filings.
</P>
<P>
   Bullard says Regency House is a Philadelphia-based church that
has paid for the houses and many others in the country, and that
they were selected by a national council of members. None of his
claims could be verified, however, and Bullard would not identify
other members who could back up his assertions.
</P>
<P>
   At age 26, Bullard has already run afoul of the law in three
states. He is now serving a 23-year Arizona prison sentence on a
variety of theft and fraud charges. The Department of Corrections
says he isn't eligible for release until June 2016.
</P>
<P>
   When first arrested in Arizona for fraud and theft in 1992,
Bullard was on probation in Montana for counterfeiting. While out
on bail awaiting his first Ari zona trial, he was ar rested on a
second series of fraud and theft charges. Authori ties later
learned he had a Colorado fraud conviction as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant has demonstrated that he is not capable of
remain ing in society without attempting con and de frauding
others,'' Mari copa County probation officer Angela Chavar riaga
wrote in Bul lard's presentence report.
</P>
<P>
   Prison hasn't stopped Bullard from papering the courts with
pleadings in which he and support ers claim that the houses are
divine gifts and that the courts are power less to remove them.
</P>
<P>
   Among those helping Bullard, whose names often appear in church
documents filed in Maricopa County Superior Court and Record er's
Office, are James W. Smithart, Larry Ray Ford and Rockney Wil lard
Martineau. All have been spotted in or at church-occupied houses,
although Ford and Marti neau list an identical Kirkland address in
some court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Smithart, Ford and Martineau were
unsuccessful. &QL; 
FILING BOGUS DEEDS &QL; 
The process church members fol lowed in taking over HUD houses was
similar in each case. First, they found houses they liked by posing
as interested HUD home buyers and asking unsuspecting real estate
agents to show them around.
</P>
<P>
   For houses they liked, church members recorded ownership deeds
at the Maricopa County Recorder's Office. In them, Bullard claimed
to be ``motivated by and moved by the Spirit of God'' to use the
houses for his church. He deeded the houses to church ``trustees''
to oversee their care.
</P>
<P>
   HUD says the deeds are bogus. Church members paid nothing for
the homes _ at least not to HUD, which came to own the houses when
previous occupants defaulted on government-insured mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Before HUD could resell them, church members moved in.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, HUD caught church members as they tried to move
into a home in the 4000 block of West Solano Drive South in
Phoenix. Church members left without occu pying the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trustees of the church have been assigned by me,'' Bullard
wrote in one court pleading, ``to protect and maintain the claimed
properties of the church and to use them for the benefit of the
church and its members to spread the word of Jesus Christ, our only
savior who gave his life for us and every property and mineral this
earth contains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church, by and through me, has filed protective measures
to ensure that these sacred properties cannot be disturbed by
creditors or governments.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Superior Courts have rejected his arguments. In the
three cases that have been heard in their entirety, the church's
deeds have been tossed out. Judge Robert Budoff has ordered church
members out. But nobody is moving.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, church members indicated they would appeal, but
they have failed to post a $9,000 bond required by the judge. In
two other cases, the occupants have simply refused to leave,
despite regular visits from the law.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, church members Ford and Martineau have filed separate
self-authored federal lawsuits against Budoff, HUD attorney Gary
Butler, HUD official Tom Frizzell and several members of the Mari
copa County Sheriff's Office. They claim church members' due
process rights are being violated.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying in court has left the houses in legal limbo,
making them impossible to sell. For HUD, the legal fees and
carrying costs of the homes continue to mount. It is also
irritating some neighbors who are fearful of the church members and
can't understand why they haven't been arrested and removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police say they (church members) own it, and the homeown
ers association says HUD owns it,'' a Superstition Springs resident
who declined to be named said as she pointed to a HUD home occupied
by the church.
</P>
<P>
   One of southeast Mesa's newer subdivisions, Superstition Springs
has two church-claimed homes in the 7300 block of at East Navarro
Avenue and 7500 block of East Monte Avene Only one appears to be
fully occupied _ a two-story stucco model facing a public park,
with a swimming pool and a view of the Superstition Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Subdivision residents are rou tinely answerable to a homeowners
association that polices everything from front-yard obstructions to
weeds in the lawn. Yet one resident says the homeowners association
has been unwilling to take on Regency House directly. Supersti tion
Springs' property management company suggested neighbors call
police when they saw church mem bers at the occupied homes.
</P>
<P>
   The advice has been less than helpful. Mesa police have told
residents there is little they can do until HUD legally clears up
owner ship.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of nearly all the occu pied properties say church
members keep largely to themselves. Often, the only notice of their
activities has been when police or sheriff's vehi cles have arrived
to discuss eviction.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor of one of the homes witnessed a confrontation two
weeks ago. The neighbor, who asked that her name not be used out of
fear of reprisal, said a female church mem ber told a
law-enforcement officer parked outside her home, ``I'm going into
my house and locking my door and calling my attorney!''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the occupied homes have a document in the window
identify ing them as church properties. Several have a ``No
Trespassing'' sign, or a more direct admonition taped in large
letters to front windows: ``Please Leave Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all church members have been distant, however. Cindy Harris,
who lives across the street from a home occupied by the Hollings
heads, said the church members have been good neighbors. Harris
said HUD had a hard time evicting the previous tenants, and the Hol
lingsheads have taken better care of the place since moving in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been working on the yard _ trying to make it look
nice,'' Harris said. ``They've been really nice. Our kids play
together.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview at her home two weeks ago, Kelly
Hollingshead said she learned of the church by ``word of mouth.''
She supports what it is trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   Hollingshead said she has met Bullard and that church members
correspond with him in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very spiritual _ very God-minded,'' she said. ``He has
the welfare of people on his mind. He's consciously aware of what
governments are trying to do to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his conviction, his prison dossier shows, Bullard has been
written up for everything from illicit drug possession to lying to
guards. He was suspected of taking part in the beating of another
prisoner, and had contact visits temporarily suspended last year
after alleged involvement in bringing contraband into the prison.
His 1995 request for a commuted sentence was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, prison officials say his disciplinary record is not
signifi cant and his security rating has continuously improved.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 presentence report says that Bullard showed ``what
appears to be an insatiable need for money, power and control
coupled with a compulsive type of behavior.'' As a result, the
probation officer said Bullard had ``immersed himself in fraudulent
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard said he's moved by a higher authority. ``We do as we're
directed by God,'' he said. &QL;

LIFE IN A SHELTER: DAYS OF QUIET TEARS AND TIMID SMILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rambling, ranch-style house is full, again. Two over
capacity. But two more are on their way _ a mother and her toddler
who have had a rough night.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the staff has found room. While they wait for the new
arrivals, they turn to other problems, other decisions.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m., there's plenty to deal with. Most are not dramatic
scenes of screams and blood _ that happens elsewhere. Here in one
of the Valley's eight domestic-violence shelters, the day passes in
moments marked by working and waiting, by quiet tears and timid
smiles. Sometimes, even by laughter.
</P>
<P>
   The phone is ringing. Donations need sorting. A job applicant
wants the nickel tour. A young boy wants a ride to finish his
community service. Volunteers have to organize the latest
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ground chuck for lunch is thawing on the counter
top.
</P>
<P>
   And someone has to keep an eye on Anna's kids.
</P>
<P>
   There's been a death in her family, and she needs to be with her
sister. It's too hard to take along the girls, an infant and a
1-year-old who's learned to walk and likes to explore. So they need
watching.
</P>
<P>
   With each hour come more challenges and tasks, both tiny and
monumental. The day is really no worse, or better, than any other.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 p.m., the woman and her toddler will have arrived, hot and
a little shaky, but safe. Three other moms, with 14 children among
them, will have been turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cook, clean, counsel, sort those donations, solve
problems,'' the shelter director said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, joking, she added, ``We just try to save the world.''
</P>
<P>
   10:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year-old boy is sweating outside, working off his
community service, his punishment for misbehaving at school, by
pulling weeds and watering plants. He lived here not too long ago
when his mother was a resident, so he knows the place _ the house
that's been expanded and remodeled so many times, the backyard play
area, the shade trees, the bright potted flowers.
</P>
<P>
   A second round of donations comes through the door. More
clothes, a coffeemaker, coffee mugs. They are put outside on the
back patio, next to the other bags and the donated mattresses. The
women will go through them later and take what they need.
</P>
<P>
   10:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Maria is chopping tomatoes and onions and lettuce in the
kitchen. The women's lunch will be tacos, with Maria's leftover
rice and stuffed peppers. Maria enjoys the cooking, and the other
women would gladly let her do it all. But chores are shared by
everyone in the house. She works and smiles as her four children
play with toys and watch a Winnie-the-Pooh video in the living
room. She speaks little English, and no one here right now speaks
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Maria arrived last month, the same day as another resident, a
single working woman named Donna, a counselor says: ``Both with
black eyes on Cinco de Mayo.''
</P>
<P>
   11:40 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It's lunch time, and Anna is back. The staff gathers in the
kitchen and listens patiently. Her voice cracking, Anna slowly
describes the accident that has left her young nephew dead, the
last thing Anna needs.
</P>
<P>
   She's been in and out of doctors' offices, trying to figure out
what happened when her boyfriend slugged her in the eye _ something
called a blowout fracture that has left her face numb. She has two
kids with her at the shelter and three others staying with her
ex-husband. She recently went to a job interview and has been
sorting through the donations to furnish her future home. She's
eager to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Anna rocks her baby in her lap and watches her toddler take
uncertain steps. The little girl's soft brown hair is gathered on
top of her head, and it bobs up and down with each move.
</P>
<P>
   ``She learned to walk here,'' Anna said.
</P>
<P>
   12:50 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The newest residents arrive. Mother and son, two pale blondes,
faces flushed from the early afternoon heat. The mother wears a
T-shirt bearing a large smiley face. Her own expression shows only
sadness and confusion. The other women in the house are asked to
introduce themselves and make the pair feel at home.
</P>
<P>
   She's Ruthie, and the baby is Michael.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my nephew's name,'' Anna says quietly. She fights
back tears.
</P>
<P>
   1:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money, money, money,'' said the shelter director, carrying the
day's mail into the kitchen. Welfare checks are in. ``I tell them
to save their money. They want to spend it, but I tell them they
gotta save.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria's face brightens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money,'' she said. ``That's English.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughs loudly at the joke. All the women do. For one quick
moment, the shelter, with all its pain and desperation, sounds like
a dormitory full of giggling students.
</P>
<P>
   Maria returns to her chores, humming as she clears the table and
washes the lunch dishes.
</P>
<P>
   1:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn keeps one eye on her golden-haired toddler and the other on
the TV. ``Next, on Sally Jessy Raphael,'' the announcer's voice
booms. ``My husband controls me!''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn smirks. ``That sounds familiar. When he came home, dinner
had to be ready, the house had to be spotless,'' she says, shaking
her head. ``If it wasn't, he'd hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn has battled drugs and suffers from a mental illness. She
wants work, maybe a career in cosmetology, but for now she collects
disability and tries to care for her son. She admits that she's
called her abusive husband a few times from the shelter. Still, she
thinks she'll make it.
</P>
<P>
   1:55 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthie meets with the counselor, recounting a life of failed
relationships, heartache and abuse. She's ready for a change.
Michael, a chunky toddler wearing a red t-shirt and red shoelaces
in his sneakers, doesn't stray far from her side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not used to being away from me,'' she says, plopping down
on the floor with him.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthie could use a cigarette. So could Dawn. ``Show me where to
go,'' says Ruthie, and the pair retreat outside, cigarettes in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   2:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   More donations arrive. More phone calls come in. More work is
done by volunteers. A local beauty-pageant winner helps clean the
kitchen; an 89-year-old grandmother sorts brochures. ``I came in
one day to drop off a donation. The next day I was working,'' says
the grandmother, her young eyes twinkling.
</P>
<P>
   4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Staff meeting. The counselor briefs the others on Ruthie. One
son is in trouble with police, another is leaving town for a while,
the third, the baby, might need to see the doctor. What would make
her happy is to see son No. 2 one more time. There is no safety
risk, the staff agrees, so she can go.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthie walks in, studying a bus schedule and smoothing back her
long blonde hair. She has just $1.25. The shelter director gives
her a bus pass and handful of quarters for the phone. ``I'm
shaking,'' Ruthie says, and tears run down her pale face. The
counselor offers a hug before Ruthie leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rings. A long-ago client is having problems with
another man. This time, her husband has tried to burn down her
home, with her still inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the beat goes on,'' the counselor ays. &QL;

MONDESI'S ARM LIFTS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was one of the American League free-for-alls, with
the Kingdome crowd on its feet and Edgar Martinez racing home with
the tying run. Raul Mondesi not only stopped the Seattle Mariners,
he froze time.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, new to center field, but savvy to cutting down runners
and opposing teams, did more than throw out Martinez in the seventh
inning of the Dodgers' 10-6 victory Saturday afternoon. He sent
chills through the both dugouts and the crowd of 49,559.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only a few guys who can make that play,'' Mariners
manager Lou Piniella said, ``and that guy is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   What made it so spectacular was that Mondesi came across his
body to grab Rob Ducey's base hit to medium left-center and came up
throwing. Martinez was tagged out at the plate and the Mariners
never threatened again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get over to cut the ball off and it was
already by me, like someone had thrown it from second base,'' said
first baseman Paul Konerko. ``That throw was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   This should have been Konerko's day, with four RBI including a
431-foot home run off Bob Wells (0-1) that was the first of his
career. Instead, Konerko became a footnote, as did Jim Bruske, who
resurrected the Dodgers battered bullpen with three innings of
shutout relief.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mondesi who stopped the Mariners and allowed the Dodgers
(30-31) to win for just the third time in seven games and get their
first victory over Seattle in five inter-league meetings at the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big for us, because we need to get something going,''
manager Bill Russell said. ``It has been one step forward, one step
back for awhile. This could be a spark.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who shifted from right to center three weeks ago when
Gary Sheffield came over from Florida, already had won two Gold
Gloves. But now that he has moved to baseball's glamour position,
it might not be a stretch to say he is the best in the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   One other would be Piniella's guy Ken Griffey Jr., who opened
the second inning with his 23rd homer of the year off Dodgers
starter Dave Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had six runs by the third inning and the Dodgers
tied them in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko, 0 for 7 since his return from Triple-A Albuquerque, had
a pair of RBI in the Dodgers four-run third. Jose Vizcaino also had
two RBI, including a game-tying single in the fourth that chased
Mariners starter Jeff Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   But this one seemed destined to last awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki never got on track in his first start since coming over
from the New York Mets in the Hideo Nomo trade. Dennis Reyes wasn't
much better, walking the bases loaded in the fifth before manager
Russell came to get him.
</P>
<P>
   Bruske took over and pitched out of the jam. Sheffield, whose
skill in right forced the Mondesi move, ended the fifth when he
threw out David Segui at the plate after a fly ball by Dan Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both players have great arms,'' catcher Charles Johnson said.
``Gary is very deceiving. The opposing teams don't think the ball
is going to get there and all of a sudden it's upon them. Mondy has
a quick release and an incredible arm. His release is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruske (3-0) retired the next five batters until Martinez
doubled high off the fence in right-center, inches from a home run.
Bruske, who allowed a game-winning homer to the Cardinals' Brian
Jordan last Tuesday, then gave up a single to Ducey but was saved
by Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I let it go, I knew I made a good throw,'' Mondesi said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers acquired Sheffield in the blockbuster 5-2 trade
with the Marlins, manager Bill Russell asked Mondesi to make the
change.
</P>
<P>
   He had played 30 games in center to start the 1995 season but
was better known as the best right-fielder in the NL. He had 16
assists last season before teams stopped trying to take the extra
base. Saturday's was just his fourth assist this season, third
since making the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited about it; it is center field,'' Mondesi said.
``Maybe I could win a Gold Glove there, too.''
