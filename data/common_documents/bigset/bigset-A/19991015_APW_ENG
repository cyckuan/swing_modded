<HEADLINE> Dollar Plunges Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar plunged against the yen and the euro  
in New York Friday, dragged down by an across-the-board selloff in 
U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.42  
Japanese yen, down from 107.35 yen late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Currency traders abandoned the U.S. currency as the Dow Jones  
industrial average lost 266.90 points to close at 10,019.71. Stock 
markets tumbled after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan 
warned that overvalued stocks prices could eventually hurt 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's comments were immediately taken to mean the Fed  
would likely raise interest rates at its next meeting Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to investors' fears was the release Friday of the  
producer price index, a key inflationary guage. Producer prices 
rose 1.1 percent in September from August, according to the Labor 
Department, more than twice the increase forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	The jump in producer prices was the largest increase in nine  
years, and spurred more sales of U.S. currency by further fueling 
speculation Federal Reserve policy-makers will raise lending rates 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0889, up from  
$1.0781 late Wednesday. . 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4585 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4741, and 1.4884 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4810. The British 
pound rose to $1.6714 from $1.6642. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7962 German 
marks, down from 1.8141; 6.0824 French francs, down from 6.0844; 
and 1,778.19 Italian lire, down from 1,796.00.

	Dow Down 165.59; Nasdaq Down 50.80  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled at today's open, threatening to  
send the Dow Jones industrial average below 10,000, amid news of a 
spurt in inflation and a warning by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan against excessive optimism by investors. Just before 11 
a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 165.59 at 
10,121.03, the lowest level since April and nearly 1,300 points 
below the Aug. 25 closing record of 11,326.04. Earlier in the 
session, the Dow was off as much as 241 points. Broader stock 
indicators also plunged in very heavy trading. The 
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was down 50.80 at 
2,756.04.

	Wholesale Prices Spike in Sept.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices at the wholesale level surged 1.1  
percent in September, the biggest increase in nine years, the 
government said today in a report that helped send stocks into a 
spiral. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 200 points 
shortly after the opening bell as investors focused on the 
worrisome inflation news and fresh concerns voiced by Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that investors could be 
underestimating the risk of a sudden sharp fall in the value of 
stocks and other assets. The Labor Department said the huge runup 
in its Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures 
before they reach the consumer, was more than double a worrisome 
0.5 percent gain in August. The increase was blamed on higher 
prices for energy and food.

	Surprises in Store for Holiday Computer Buyers  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Consumers expecting to see ever-lowering  
computer prices as they begin their holiday shopping may be in for 
a surprise. Manufacturers are beginning to pass on the higher costs 
of memory chips, known as RAM, to consumers, who have been seeking 
more and more powerful chips as they go after faster computers with 
the best graphics. Sixty-four megabytes of RAM -- a typical amount 
of memory in a $1,000 computer -- once sold for as low as $40. Now 
the same memory is retailing for about $100 and could reach $150 
next month, analysts said yesterday.

	GADSDEN, Ala. (AP) -- Union workers at Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber  
Co.'s plant here approved a plan to continue making light truck 
tires, saving at least hundreds of jobs, rather than end production 
in December as earlier planned. The decision by United Steelworkers 
members in voting this week was announced by Goodyear yesterday 
afternoon. Goodyear officials said union members voted 655-210 to 
continue making tires with a scaled-back workforce and other 
changes sought by the company, which in February had announced it 
would cease tire production in Gadsden and lay off some 1,320 
workers.

share of LeukoSite, a 49 percent premium to the stock's closing 
price yesterday. Shares of LeukoSite yesterday closed up $1.75, or 
7.8 percent, at $24.12 1/2 on the Nasdaq. Shares of Millennium closed 
at $83.47, down three cents.

	Vietnam Resort Plan May Be Scrapped

<P>
	DALAT, Vietnam (AP) -- A $706 million plan to build Vietnam's  
biggest tourist resort may be dismantled after the Singapore 
consortium slated to finance it postponed its investment 
indefinitely, according to Dow Jones Newswires. The project's 
demise would be a serious blow to Lam Dong, the central highlands 
province for which it was planned. Provincial leaders had hoped 
money spent by an anticipated 300,000 additional tourists each year 
would triple local incomes after a decade. The 5,750-acre project 
was to have included two golf courses, a theater, a botanical 
garden and a zoo.

praise for the government's economic management, but without saying 
when it will upgrade the country's rating. ``We have a lot more 
confidence in the policy-makers than we did at the time of the 
crisis,'' Thomas Byrne, senior analyst of Moody's sovereign risk 
unit, told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview today. Sovereign 
risk measures the ability of a government to pay back its 
borrowings.

	Trump Casino Holds Liquidation  
</P>

	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Trump World's Fair Casino prepared  
for demolition yesterday with something that resembled a garage 
sale, pawning off TVs, lamps and alarm clocks. The casino, which 
opened in 1981 as the Playboy and later operated as the Atlantis, 
has always bled money. It was forced into bankruptcy in 1989. 
Donald Trump bought it for $63 million and operated it as a 
non-casino hotel -- Trump Regency -- for years before investing $48 
million and reopening it in 1996 as Trump World's Fair Casino. It 
was losing $10 million a year by the time Trump decided to demolish 
it and start over.

	Chips Could Get Much Smaller  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers using a computer-driven microscope  
say they can now draw a pattern with lines separated by only 
200-billionths of an inch, an advance that could lead to electronic 
chips much smaller and of different materials than those now in 
use. Chad A. Mirkin of Northwestern University said that the new 
technology is able to draw a lines that are 15 to 30 nanometers 
wide and separated by only 5 nanometers. A nanometer is 
one-billionth of a meter. A fine human hair is about 10,000 
nanometers wide. A report on the new research appears Friday in the 
journal Science.

Mich.-based company also announced that it would renovate 166 
smaller stores. About half of the new stores will be Super Kmarts, 
which are bigger stores that carry groceries along with wide array 
of general merchandise goods, such as clothes and home furnishings. 
But Kmart is still struggling to keep pace with rival Wal-Mart 
Stores Inc., which continues to dominate the discount store market 
with their aggressive pricing strategy.

<HEADLINE> Moratorium Sought in Agribusiness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm-state Democrats are proposing an 18-month  
moratorium in agribusiness mergers after a spate of acquisitions 
involving food processors, grain traders and seed and chemical 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the latest deals, Smithfield Foods Inc. of Smithfield,  
Va., the biggest pork processor as well as the largest hog 
producer, is seeking the Justice Department's approval to acquire 
No. 2 producer Murphy Family Farms of Rose Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the department allowed Cargill Inc., North America's  
second-largest grain trader, to acquire the grain operations of 
Continental Grain, provided the companies sold some of their 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Justice Department is supposed to be the referee, but it  
has not stepped in to keep the fight fair,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, 
D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials have said it is in the interest of  
farmers for U.S. companies to cut their costs because they have to 
compete overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This industry is restructuring like a lot of industries  
outside of agriculture in response to many economic factors,'' said 
Janet Riley, a spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute, which 
represents meatpackers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agricultural economy is stuck in its worst downturn  
since the mid-1980s, and although economists blame it on 
overproduction of crops and livestock, many lawmakers have been 
pointing to agribusiness mergers as a culprit. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation was also proposed in the Senate Friday that would  
ban Smithfield and other meatpackers from owning livestock. The 
sponsors include two Republicans, Charles Grassley of Iowa and 
Craig Thomas of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers won a battle with the packers this week when the  
Senate gave final approval to legislation that would require them 
to start reporting the prices they pay for cattle and hogs. 
Producers say that it will make it easier for them to bargain with 
the packers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers have been told to rely on the free market for their  
price, but the market isn't free because it isn't fair,'' said Sen. 
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Returns to Formula One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEPANG, Malaysia (AP) -- Michael Schumacher, injured in a crash  
three months ago, returned to Formula One racing Friday during 
practice for the Malaysian Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the first of the two timed practices -- ahead by a lot in  
the rain -- and then finished fifth in the second during faster and 
drier conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``No problem, no pain,'' said Schumacher, who fractured his  
right leg in the British Grand Prix on July 11. ``The Ferrari seems 
in good shape and so am I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Villeneuve, in a BAR-Supertec, had the fastest time  
overall. Villeneuve, a former world champion struggling with a new 
team, was timed in 1 minute, 42.407 seconds over the 3.4-mile 
course, 40 miles south of Kuala Lumpur. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car was like a little bit of magic today but we need to do  
the same tomorrow when we will have learned more about the limits 
of the circuit,'' Villeneuve said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Malaysian Grand Prix is making its debut on the world  
championship calendar, and Friday's practice marked the first time 
all the Formula One cars were on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice had an unexpected visitor. A leopard was lurking  
near the tires just off the track but was scared away by the 
roaring engines. 
</P>
<P>
	The official qualifying is Saturday, and teams are still making  
adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked on the setup today but the car is not quite there  
yet,'' Schumacher said. ``As we are not far off the pace and have 
enough time to improve, I am confident for tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher's best was 1:42.875 after going fastest with 1:44.824  
in the morning after morning rains. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the beginning of the monsoon season in Malaysia, and it  
has rained almost every day for a month. 
</P>
<P>
	David Coulthard was second in a McLaren-Mercedes in 1:42.519,  
and Jean Alesi was next with 1:42.701. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ferrari duo of Eddie Irvine, 1:42.725, and Schumacher  
followed. Defending world champion Mika Hakkinen was eighth in 
1:43.153 in a McLaren-Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen leads Irvine 62-60 after 14 races and has a chance to  
clinch the title in this racer. A win by Hakkinen and no better 
than a fifth by Irvine gives Hakkinen at least a 10-point margin 
heading into the last race in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In case of a tie, Hakkinen would take the title because he would  
have more wins than Irvine.

Norway-based Fast Search &AMP; Transfer to develop a search engine. Pax 
Fast &AMP; Safe Search Engine is expected to be released early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>

and the return of the search will not have any obscene materials or 
even the headlines,'' Ben Ly, Paxson's online business development 
director, said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Gore Banks More Than $10 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore reported today that he  
had raised $6.8 million for his presidential race from July to 
September and had $10.3 million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign also applied for $9.2 million in federal  
assistance, which gives Gore almost $20 million to spend. The 
federal government matches the first $250 of each individual 
contribution for candidates who agree to limit the amount of money 
they spend on their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased with our fund-raising efforts so far,''  
Gore campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said. ``With the matching 
funds and the number of low-dollar donors, we're very close to 
completing the fund-raising portion of the campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since January, the vice president has raised $24.3 million for  
his campaign and $2.5 million for his general election account. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's figures are slightly higher than the estimates his  
campaign issued Sept. 30, the end of the reporting period. At the 
time, Gore's Democratic opponent, former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, 
reported raising an estimated $6.7 million to Gore's $6.5 million. 
In addition, the Bradley campaign said it had more than $10 million 
in the bank, while Gore's campaign said it had between $9.5 million 
and $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley and the other campaigns had yet to report their final  
figures, which are due at the end of today. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans, Texas Gov. George W. Bush has estimated that  
he raised $19 million from July 1 to Sept. 30, bringing his 
record-setting total to more than $56 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona was a distant second, raising an  
estimated $3 million during the last three months, bringing his 
total to $9.3 million. That includes $2 million transferred from 
his Senate campaign account. 
</P>
<P>
	The McCain campaign took in $64,000 over the Internet during the  
last four days of September, after sending out an e-mail seeking 
last-minute contributions. ``We must continue the momentum we have 
shown in the press and the polls by showing continued fund-raising 
strength,'' McCain wrote in the e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans Gary Bauer, Patrick Buchanan, Elizabeth Dole, Steve  
Forbes and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah each raised more than $1 
million from July to September. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain had $2 million in his campaign bank account as of Sept.  
30; Forbes had $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who is largely financing his own campaign, raised an  
estimated $1.4 million over the last three months, bringing his 
total to $4.2 million through Sept. 30. In addition, Forbes spent 
about $15 million from his own pocket.

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Prices Spike in Sept. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prices at the wholesale level surged 1.1  
percent in September, the biggest increase in nine years, the 
government said today in a report that sent stocks diving on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 200 points  
shortly after the opening bell as investors focused on the 
worrisome inflation news and fresh concerns voiced by Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that investors could be 
underestimating the risk of a sudden sharp fall in the value of 
stocks and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said the huge runup in its Producer Price  
Index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach the 
consumer, was more than double a worrisome 0.5 percent gain in 
August. The increase was blamed on higher prices for energy and 
food. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, both bond and stock prices were dragged down by  
the inflation report and the reaction of overseas markets to 
Greenspan's new worries about high asset values. The Dow lost more 
than 200 points in the first minutes after the opening bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to a conference on risk management Thursday night,  
Greenspan said that banks ``must be careful not to overlook'' the 
threats posed by a big decline in asset values. 
</P>
<P>
	``History tells us that sharp reversals occur abruptly, most  
often with little advance notice,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Greenspan has expressed such concerns before, investors  
have been put more on edge by the fact that the Fed has already 
raised a key U.S. interest rate twice this year because of 
inflation worries and may act again. Japan's benchmark Nikkei Stock 
Average fell by 178.69 points, losing 1 percent of its value in 
turbulent trading before Wall Street opened. 
</P>
<P>
	In another economic report, the government said today that  
industrial production at the nation's factories, utilities and 
mines fell an unexpected 0.3 percent in September, the first 
decline since a 0.2 percent drop in November 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, which issued the report, attributed the  
decline to Hurricane Floyd, which raked the East Coast in 
September. The Fed said the storm held down production of 
electricity, motor vehicles and some other goods. Excluding the 
storm's effects, industrial product would have posted a small 
increase, the Fed said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. industry operated at 80.3 percent of capacity in September,  
down from 80.7 percent the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the Producer Price Index was the biggest gain  
since a 1.3 percent jump in September 1990, when oil prices were 
surging following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting the volatile energy and food categories, the  
so-called core rate of inflation at the wholesale level rose a 
troublesome 0.8 percent in September, the largest increase since 
December 1998, when the core rate rose 1 percent. In August, the 
core rate fell 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the Fed decided not to raise interest rates following  
quarter-point increases in June and August. But financial markets 
are worried that when the Fed next meets on Nov. 16 the increased 
inflation pressures will prompt a third rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The report ``is causing some alarm bells to go off at the  
hallowed halls of the Federal Reserve,'' said Paul Kasriel, chief 
economist for The Northern Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, wholesale prices have been rising at an annual  
rate of 3.5 percent, compared with no change for all of 1998. The 
pickup in this year's wholesale prices is coming from big increases 
in energy costs, which had been declining for much of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For September, energy costs rose 2.2 percent, reflecting higher  
gasoline, heating oil and natural gas prices, and followed a 3.7 
percent gain in August. A 5.5 percent spike in energy prices in 
April put the Fed on inflation alert, and on June 30 the central 
bank raised interest rates for the first time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	A 2.2 percent rise in gasoline prices last month contributed to  
the advance in overall energy costs. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a nationwide check of gasoline stations by the  
Lundberg Survey, gasoline prices, which normally fall after Labor 
Day, were rising in September as the price of crude oil jumped. 
</P>
<P>
	Heating oil prices rose 6 percent and residential electric power  
rose 0.8 percent. Residential natural gas increased 2.5 percent, 
the biggest gain since November 1997 when natural gas prices rose 
3.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices posted a 1 percent increase, the biggest gain since  
January, when food costs rose 1.5 percent. The rise in food prices 
comes as the East Coast and other parts of the country suffered bad 
weather last month. In August, food prices rose 0.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in food prices last month was led by a 9.7 percent  
increase in pork prices, the largest gain since a 19.3 percent 
increase in January. Fresh fruits rose 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In another report, the Commerce Department said today that the  
level of inventories held by businesses on shelves and backlots 
rose 0.3 percent in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Passenger car prices rose 2 percent, the biggest since a 3  
percent rise in September 1990; tobacco product prices rose 8.4 
percent, the largest increase since a 26.1 gain in December 1998 
and cigarette prices rose 9.5 percent, the biggest gain since a 
30.7 percent increase in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Closer Rivera a Savior for Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Roger Clemens vs. Pedro Martinez is a pitching  
matchup worthy of the hype. 
</P>
<P>
	If Game 3 of the American League championship series is like the  
first two, though, it will be decided by the finishers, not the 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last couple of games, the team that's had the most depth  
in the bullpen has been able to come up the winner,'' said Yankees 
outfielder Bernie Williams, whose 10th-inning Game 1 homer also had 
something to do with it. ``I certainly believe in the power of 
bullpen depth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Yankees, that means Mariano Rivera and a supporting cast  
of setup men who have helped make him one of the game's best 
closers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great pitcher and a great closer,'' said Boston  
outfielder Damon Buford, whom Rivera struck out for the final out 
in New York's 3-2 victory on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox managed to beat Cleveland in the first playoff round  
using a simple formula: Outlast the starting pitcher, and beat up 
on the bullpen. Boston scored 29 runs against Indians relievers 
while winning three in a row to rally from a two-game deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	That won't work against the Yankees.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're so strong out there. We've got guys out there with so  
much experience in these types of games,'' New York starter Andy 
Pettitte said. ``I don't foresee that happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees lead Boston 2-0 in the AL championship series, just  
as Cleveland did. But the Yankees have something the Indians 
didn't: Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	``Different lineups, different pitching,'' he said. ``It doesn't  
mean they're going to score 23 runs in this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera had 45 saves with a 4-3 record and a 1.83 ERA during the  
regular season, his third as the Yankees' closer. He converted his 
last 22 save opportunities, and did not allow a run in his last 28 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Add in four scoreless postseason appearances -- including a  
victory in Game 1 and a save in Game 2 against Boston -- and he has 
pitched 36 2-3 shutout innings in 32 games since giving up a run 
against Tampa Bay on July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, he has allowed only two earned runs in 41 innings in  
postseason play -- an 0.44 ERA that's best in major league history 
among pitchers with at least 30 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre praised his closer for his consistency  
and also for putting personal statistics aside to become a better 
pitcher. Rivera's strikeout total decreased for the third 
consecutive year, for example, from 130 to 68 to 36. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of just rearing back and throwing ... now he doesn't  
really care if he strikes people out,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox answer with closer by committee. Derek Lowe gets  
most of the calls but also shares time with Tom Gordon and Rod 
Beck. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting up for for Rivera are Mike Stanton and Jeff Nelson. It's  
a role Rivera filled under John Wetteland, who was the Yankees' 
World Series MVP in 1996 before he left for Texas as a free agent. 
Torre then handed the closer's job to Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little different when there's nobody behind you,  
somebody cuts that safety net out from under you and you realize 
that when the ball gets by you, the game is over,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took him time. But we kept handing him the ball, saying, `I  
don't care how bad it is, you are going to still do this thing.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said confidence in a closer can only go so far.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once you start taking things for granted,'' he said, ``things  
can turn around for you.''

<HEADLINE> Piazza Gets Slight Concussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All-Star catcher Mike Piazza of the New York  
Mets sustained a slight concussion in a first-inning collision at 
home plate Friday night in Game 3 of the National League 
Championship series against the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza was bowled over by Bret Boone, who was trying to score  
from third on a fly ball to center fielder Melvin Mora. Piazza held 
on to the throw and made the tag for the out before falling 
backward. 
</P>
<P>
	He remained down for a few moments as Boone bent over him.  
Piazza walked off under his own power and remained in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza missed the final two games of the division playoff  
against Arizona with a sprained and swollen left thumb. He was 
0-for-7 in the first two gamnes of the NLCS.

<HEADLINE> Asarco Accepts Grupo Mexico Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Asarco Inc. today accepted a $1.24 billion cash  
takeover offer from Grupo Mexico SA de CV, following a seven-week 
bidding contest for the nation's third-largest copper producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Grupo Mexico increased its proposal by 25 cents to $29.75 a  
share, topping an offer by rival Phelps Dodge Corp. Grupo Mexico 
also will assume Asarco's $1.02 billion in debt. Phelps had 
previously said it would not raise its bid. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of Asarco's 1 billion pounds of annual copper  
production, Grupo Mexico will be the world's third-largest copper 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The jousting for control of Asarco underscores the pressure  
copper companies face to cut costs by consolidating. The price of 
copper has fallen by almost one-third over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of New York-based Asarco were up 12 1/2 cents at $29.43 3/4 in  
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The losing bidder, Phoenix, Ariz.-based Phelps Dodge will have  
to content itself with its $1.8 billion acquisition of Cyprus Amax 
Minerals Co. of Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge shares were up 37 1/2 cents at $57.62 1/2, also on the  
NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Bauer: Forbes' Bid Has 'Peaked Out' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Publisher Steve Forbes' bid for the  
Republican presidential nomination has ``peaked out'' and has gone 
as far as his personal fortune can take it, rival Gary Bauer said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has spent $65 million since 1996 and ... he's basically in  
a dead heat with me in the polls,'' Bauer said at a news 
conference. ``I don't think money can buy him any more support than 
it already has and conservatives will continue to consolidate 
behind my candidacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer opened his latest campaign swing by announcing the backing  
of three key conservative leaders in the state where precinct 
caucuses launch the nominating season, and by making the financial 
case for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer and Forbes are competing for the same base of social and  
religious conservatives, but the wealthy publisher argues that he 
is the only conservative with the financial resources to compete 
with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the favorite in the race for the 
Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Disclosure reports released Friday show that Bauer raised more  
than $1 million between July 1 and Sept. 30, while Forbes raised 
$1.4 million. Forbes, however, has access to his personal fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer has developed a direct-mail fund-raising operation that,  
while expensive to run, has shown an ability to generate money. He 
said that organization has been carefully crafted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are more than competitive financially,'' Bauer said. ``I  
don't think anybody else has the kind of broad-based, campaign 
foundation I do, with 110,000 donors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those are generally smaller donors who can be tapped again,  
Bauer argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the campaign begins to pick up, we're going to be able to  
go back to those people time and time again,'' he said. ``That's 
why we spent seven months building that very substantial list of 
conservatives around America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Forbes has attracted some important conservatives because  
of the money he is able to bring to the race, that has slowed, 
Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's already peaked out,'' said Bauer.  
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, meanwhile, named Gopal Krishna as his state campaign  
chairman. Krishna is a former co-chairman and treasurer of the Iowa 
Republican Party, and a significant financial force in GOP affairs. 
Bauer also named two state lawmakers to co-chair his campaign.

<HEADLINE> NYC Cop Discusses Diallo Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four police officers shot and killed an unarmed  
African immigrant after he ran from them, refused their orders to 
stop, and then reached into his pocket, one of the officers said in 
a magazine interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Carroll made his remarks in the November issue of  
``American Police Beat,'' made available to reporters on Friday. 
It's the first time any of the officers have spoken publicly since 
they fired 41 bullets at Amadou Diallo on Feb. 4 while he stood 
outside his Bronx home. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting led to daily civil disobedience demonstrations and  
inspired a painful examination of police attitudes and tactics 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers' attorneys have said their clients fired at Diallo  
because they thought he had a gun. In the article, Carroll said 
Diallo matched the description of a rape suspect they were looking 
for and they called for him to stop. But Diallo started running and 
the officers pursued him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stop, police. Stop, police,'' they yelled, according to  
Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Once outside his Bronx apartment building, Diallo turned around  
and reached into his pocket, Carroll said, and that's when they 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said his family has received death threats since the  
shooting, and protesters have marched on his home on Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the officers were indicted earlier this year on  
second-degree murder charges and are awaiting trial.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Launches Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Taking another step away from its  
socialist past, Mozambique opened its first stock exchange 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first company to be listed on the market is Cervejas de  
Mocambique, a privatized brewing company in which the majority 
shareholder is South African Breweries. It had net profits of $11.3 
million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The government intends to sell off the shares it still holds in  
some of the 1,000 companies that have been privatized this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	After independence from Portugal in 1976, Mozambique adopted a  
socialist government. Since the first democratic elections in 1994 
ended more than a decade of civil war, the country has gradually 
moved toward a free market economy and has attracted foreign 
investment.

<HEADLINE> Houdini Cone Escapes Jams in Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe what David Cone needed all along was to be  
on the 12-day rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching for the first time in nearly two weeks, Cone never gave  
in Thursday night, escaping jam after jam and pitching seven gritty 
innings in a 3-2 victory over Boston that gave the New York Yankees 
2-0 lead in the best-of-7 series which resumes Saturday in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in trouble all night,'' Cone said. ``They got tough  
at-bats all night and I had to make big pitches. It seemed like 
every inning, there were runners on base and you can't afford 
mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``David was sensational,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``He got in a  
groove a lot quicker than I thought he would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was important because he was in constant trouble.  
</P>
<P>
	Cone left runners stranded in every inning, time after time  
getting big outs to escape jams like Houdini on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not easy on a cold, brisk night.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're hot right now,'' he said of the Red Sox. ``They're a  
resilient team. Every batter gets quality at-bats and puts pressure 
on the pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The extra time off may have provided Cone with the reserve of  
energy he needed to keep avoiding disaster against the Red Sox. 
Except for a two-run home run by Nomar Garciaparra, Cone kept 
Boston at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	He walked two batters in the first inning but left them  
stranded. He gave up a one-out triple to Jason Varitek in the 
second but got the next two hitters. There were two more hits in 
the third before he struck out Troy O'Leary to end the threat. In 
the fourth, Varitek doubled but again Cone escaped by retiring 
Darren Lewis and Trot Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone surrendered Garciaparra's home run in the fifth but struck  
out the Boston slugger to end the seventh, leaving another Red Sox 
runner stranded, and that was the end of his night. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run was hardly embarrassing to Cone.  
</P>
<P>
	``He is just one great ballplayer,'' the pitcher said. ``I was  
trying to waste a pitch. I threw a sidearm slider off the plate to 
get to the next pitch. It was the only slider all night that didn't 
break. He doesn't miss that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone last pitched on Oct. 2 and the 12-day layoff was more than  
either the pitcher or manager would have preferred. But it worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good all night,'' he said. ``The extra rest really  
helped. It's been that way in the past. I seem to work well with 
extra rest. I seem to respond to rest very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone came out after seven innings. He threw 128 pitches, 84 for  
strikes, and his nine strikeouts tied his career playoff high. He 
struck out nine in Game 5 of the division series against Seattle 
Oct. 8, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He told Torre he felt he could come out for the eighth but the  
manager decided to turn the game over to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very pleased,'' Torre said. ``He gave us seven strong  
innings. To maintain his stuff the whole seven innings was great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone had been something of an enigma after pitching a perfect  
game against Montreal on July 18. He was just 2-5 in 13 starts 
following the perfecto and winless in eight starts from Aug. 14 to 
Sept. 25, the longest such stretch in his career. He finished the 
season a so-so 12-9. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the perfect game, I was so grounded about not having a  
letdown,'' Cone said. ``Maybe I should have allowed myself to 
absorb and enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees certainly enjoyed his effort in Game 2.

<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Irene Nears Fla. Keys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- The leading edge of Hurricane Irene  
brought rain and high wind to the Florida Keys today after the 
storm drenched Cuba's tobacco fields and caused scattered building 
collapses around Havana. At least one person was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though barely a hurricane with 75 mph winds around its center,  
Irene brought torrential rains that threatened to flood the lower 
third of the Florida peninsula as the storm crawled across the 
straits separating Cuba from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Were experiencing some strong tropical storm conditions right  
now from Key West all the way up the Keys as far as Ocean Reef 
right now,'' Billy Wagner, Monroe County Emergency Management 
director, said this morning. Big Pine Key had a gust recorded at 
103 mph, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said areas as far north as Tampa could be flooded,  
and rainfall totals could top 15 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a well-organized hurricane, and there's a huge swath  
of storms and rain to the east'' of its center, said Richard Pasch, 
a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center outside 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m. EDT, Irene was about 25 miles southwest of Key West.  
Irene had moved slowly and erratically late Thursday, but was 
moving north at about 8 mph today. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said the center of the storm was likely to hit land  
between Tampa and Fort Myers by Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Monroe County, which covers the Keys, ordered a  
mandatory evacuation of mobile homes and recreational vehicles. 
Schools were closed for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been raining throughout the night; we've been getting  
quite a few inches of rain and the wind has picked up enormously 
from when I came in at (midnight),'' said David Holliman, a 
security guard at the Lower Keys Medical Center in Key West. ``The 
trees are swaying quite a bit ... and it's getting worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four shelters were opened in the Keys: two in Key West and one  
each in Marathon and Key Largo. Fewer than 100 people were staying 
at the shelters Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked all day yesterday. By the time we finished, it was  
too late to go north,'' said Jose Guadarrama, a mobile home 
resident who arrived at the shelter this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm left Cuban territory after soaking Havana on Thursday  
evening. Early reports were that the island escaped relatively 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
	During a televised briefing, Havana authorities told President  
Fidel Castro that one person had been electrocuted and a second 
person was missing following the storm's march across the capital 
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Irene Nears Fla. Keys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- The leading edge of Hurricane Irene  
brought rain and high wind to the Florida Keys today after the 
storm drenched Cuba's tobacco fields and caused scattered building 
collapses around Havana. At least one person was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though barely a hurricane with 75 mph winds around its center,  
Irene brought torrential rains that threatened to flood the lower 
third of the Florida peninsula as the storm crawled across the 
straits separating Cuba from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Were experiencing some strong tropical storm conditions right  
now from Key West all the way up the Keys as far as Ocean Reef 
right now,'' Billy Wagner, Monroe County Emergency Management 
director, said this morning. Big Pine Key had a gust recorded at 
103 mph, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said areas as far north as Tampa could be flooded,  
and rainfall totals could top 15 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a well-organized hurricane, and there's a huge swath  
of storms and rain to the east'' of its center, said Richard Pasch, 
a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center outside 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m. EDT, Irene was about 25 miles southwest of Key West.  
Irene had moved slowly and erratically late Thursday, but was 
moving north at about 8 mph today. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said the center of the storm was likely to hit land  
between Tampa and Fort Myers by Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Monroe County, which covers the Keys, ordered a  
mandatory evacuation of mobile homes and recreational vehicles. 
Schools were closed for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been raining throughout the night; we've been getting  
quite a few inches of rain and the wind has picked up enormously 
from when I came in at (midnight),'' said David Holliman, a 
security guard at the Lower Keys Medical Center in Key West. ``The 
trees are swaying quite a bit ... and it's getting worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four shelters were opened in the Keys: two in Key West and one  
each in Marathon and Key Largo. Fewer than 100 people were staying 
at the shelters Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked all day yesterday. By the time we finished, it was  
too late to go north,'' said Jose Guadarrama, a mobile home 
resident who arrived at the shelter this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm left Cuban territory after soaking Havana on Thursday  
evening. Early reports were that the island escaped relatively 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
	During a televised briefing, Havana authorities told President  
Fidel Castro that one person had been electrocuted and a second 
person was missing following the storm's march across the capital 
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Havana Mayor Conrado Martinez said that 149 buildings were  
damaged by the heavy rains, including 13 that collapsed, and power 
outages were scattered around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	About 130,000 people from western and central Cuba, many of them  
students in government boarding schools, were evacuated as the 
hurricane approached. Classes across the region were suspended. 
Stores, government offices and banks in Havana closed shortly after 
noon Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Chimp Paternity Mystery Solved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- All the monkey business at the Los Angeles  
Zoo has been figured out. 
</P>
<P>
	A paternity test has revealed which chimpanzee fathered three  
chimps whose arrival was unexpected, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
	The births surprised keepers because, of the six males in the  
chimpanzee exhibit, two were too young to be fathers, one was too 
old and three had undergone vasectomies. It turns out that 
11-year-old Shaun got a bum vasectomy in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``So Shaun was having a real good time,'' laughed Lora LaMarca,  
the zoo's longtime marketing director. The chimp was once described 
in a news release as being small for his age and picked on by 
females. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few years later, he was picking on them.  
</P>
<P>
	The paternity mystery drew international media attention and  
helped boost zoo attendance by 10 percent. The DNA results were 
announced on ``The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' during a visit by 
surviving babies Jean and Jake. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterinarians analyzed blood and hair samples to prove beyond a  
reasonable doubt that Shaun was daddy to Jean, Jake and the late 
Toshi. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I went to veterinarian school, nobody dreamed of this  
kind of stuff,'' said Charles Sedgwick, the zoo's chief 
veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
	The births came as keepers thought they had finally succeeded in  
stopping the monkey business -- at least to the extent that there 
would be no more new chimps. 
</P>
<P>
	They had tried handing out birth control pills, but the females  
passed them around and everyone chomped them down, including males 
and babies. Contraceptive implants weren't strong enough to stop 
the population boom. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was off to the operating room for the exhibit's three  
capable males to have their sperm-carrying vas deferens ducts 
snipped. It's a procedure that's virtually 100 percent effective in 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
	But apparently not in chimpanzees.  
</P>
<P>
	It's likely that the ducts weren't completely severed during the  
operation. Another possibility was that the severed tubes grew back 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean and Jake are being raised in a nursery but will be  
introduced to the troop. Later this month, a chimp born to a mother 
at a Florida park will join Jean and Jake.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Has Midnight Madness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The Kentucky players who will take the  
self-proclaimed ``Team of the Century'' into the next one took the 
court early Saturday as the Wildcats opened the college basketball 
season with Midnight Madness. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Memorial Coliseum lights dimmed, players entered one by  
one down the arena's aisles, high-fiving some of the more than 
7,000 fans as they descended to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering last was coach Tubby Smith. He walked arm in arm with  
Miss America Heather Renee French, who last month was the first 
Miss Kentucky to win the national pageant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't it a great night when we can have Miss America here?''  
Smith asked the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	French, a Cincinnati graduate from Maysville, wore a black gown  
and her crown and agreed to act as a judge of the Wildcats' dunking 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always wanted to be a coach, so this is my time,'' she  
said, urging players to jump higher as they warmed up with dunks, 
layups, alley-oops and 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the men taking the floor at midnight, the earliest time  
the NCAA allows teams to practice, fans welcomed the Kentucky 
women's team, which last year reached the second round of the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Kansas, North Carolina and UCLA might put up a fight over  
Kentucky's ``Team of the Century'' claim, the Wildcats can point to 
this: 
</P>
<P>
	Entering their 98th season of basketball, they have won 1,748  
games and compiled a winning percentage of .764, both tops among 
college programs. Their 41 NCAA tournament appearances are a record 
and their seven national championships are second only to UCLA's 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Friday evening, Smith said he saw nothing wrong with  
Kentucky anointing itself that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not so much this particular team, but all the teams, because  
we are the winningest team in college basketball and (because of) 
the great tradition,'' he said. ``I think we're second to none, and 
I think most people would say that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith led the Wildcats to the seventh championship in 1998, his  
first season on the job. After reaching the final eight last 
season, Smith may have his biggest challenge yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are the seniors who were the backbone of last year's team,  
Wayne Turner, Scott Padgett and Heshimu Evans. This season, the 
only seniors are former walk-on Steve Masiello and center Jamaal 
Magloire, who has a history of disciplinary problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Magloire considered entering the NBA draft last spring, deciding  
only at the last minute to return to Lexington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats expected to have three returning juniors, but were  
caught by surprise in April when guard Ryan Hogan and center 
Michael Bradley abruptly transferred, apparently unhappy with 
Smith's coaching. That leaves Smith's son Saul, the heir apparent 
to Turner at the point, and transfer big man Nate Knight, younger 
brother of Travis Knight of the Los Angeles Lakers, as the team's 
only juniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Five sophomores will be the team's core: swingmen Desmond  
Allison and Tayshaun Prince, power forward Jules Camara, and guards 
J.P. Blevins and Todd Tackett. 
</P>
<P>
	Three freshmen made their debuts before the Wildcat faithful  
early Saturday: big man Marquis Estill and Kentucky's two 
McDonald's All-America recruits, guard Keith Bogans and 
forward-center Marvin Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also noted Friday would have been the 19th birthday of  
John Stewart, the 7-foot Kentucky signee from Indianapolis who 
collapsed and died last March during an Indiana high school playoff 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're saying a prayer for John Stewart,'' Smith said. ``I know  
he's missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Minneapolis, the University of Minnesota was looking for a  
new start at midnight practice. Since March, most talk about the 
team has concerned academic fraud, a costly investigation, a new 
coach and pending NCAA sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the kids and the program, it's been a long six months,''  
new coach Dan Monson said. ``The beginning of the end is to start 
practice, put it behind you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monson, whose Gonzaga team beat the Gophers in the first round  
of the NCAA tournament, was hired during the summer after Clem 
Haskins resigned when the university bought out his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's going to be watching every move we make,'' guard  
Kevin Nathaniel said. ``When we're walking to class, in class, how 
we conduct ourselves. As players, we kind of know we have to be 
extra careful with the things we do and say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky and Minnesota were among a number of schools that held  
Midnight Madness, including defending national champion 
Connecticut.

	Doctors' Group Wins Nobel Prize  
</P>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Doctors Without Borders won the 1999 Nobel  
Peace Prize today in recognition of the organization's ``pioneering 
humanitarian work on several continents,'' the Norwegian Nobel 
Committee said. Medecins Sans Frontieres, the international name of 
the volunteer organization that treats victims of war, famine and 
other disasters, has more than 2,000 medical professionals 
volunteering in 80 countries. ``Since its foundation in the early 
1970s, Doctors Without Borders has adhered to the fundamental 
principle that all disaster victims, whether the disaster is 
natural or human in origin, have a right to professional assistance 
given as quickly and as efficiently as possible,'' the committee 
said.

	Kosovo Drivers Given License Plates  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Seeking to get a fix on the number  
of stolen cars in Kosovo, U.N. police begin issuing license plates 
today to drivers across the province with dubious claims to their 
vehicles. Under the plan, drivers have until January to register 
their cars with U.N. police. After that, any vehicle without plates 
or proper papers will be seized. The majority of cars now in the 
province have no license plates. Their present owners claim that as 
they fled the province this spring to escape the bloody Serb 
crackdown, Serbs took their license plates, vehicle registration 
documents and other identity papers.

	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene took aim at the Florida  
Keys today after drenching Cuba's tobacco fields and causing 
scattered building collapses and power outages around Havana. At 
least one person was killed. Though barely a hurricane with 75 mph 
winds, Irene's torrential rains threatened to flood the lower third 
of the Florida peninsula as the storm crawled across the straits

	BEITUNIYA, West Bank (AP) -- Israel freed 151 Arab security  
prisoners today, moving its peace agreement with the Palestinians 
back on track after minor delays. Cheering relatives greeted 
convoys of buses at drop-off points in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. Prisoners leaned out of windows, flashing victory signs, 
their hands still tied with plastic cuffs. ``Mother, he's out,'' a 
teen-age boy shouted into a cellular phone when he saw his brother 
on one of the buses. Prisoner releases are an emotional issue for 
both sides.

	Sparring Continues on Treaty Vote

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans are defending their  
opposition to a rejected nuclear test ban treaty against charges by 
President Clinton that they engaged in ``reckless partisanship.'' 
As Clinton and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott sparred via 
dueling news conferences, both Democrats seeking the presidency -- 
Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley -- said they would resubmit 
the treaty if elected. Gore did it with a television ad, the first 
of his campaign. Republicans remained supportive of Wednesday's 
51-48 rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

protests and opposition lawmakers condemned a speech that defended 
his troubled 16-month tenure. Hundreds of protesters were back on 
the streets of the capital today, setting fires and blocking 
Jakarta's main boulevard with commandeered buses and makeshift 
barricades. Rocks, bottles and other debris littered the road not

<HEADLINE> Soybean Futures Down; Grains Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices fell sharply in trading  
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, despite strong export sales. 
Uncertainty in the stock market and forecasts calling for weekend rains 
in dry areas of Brazil ahead of the planting season contributed to 
the slump. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn futures prices also fell due to increased farmer selling,  
weak exports and stock-market jitters. Wheat and oats futures rose. 
</P>
<P>
        Forecasters are calling for scattered showers this weekend  
across the corn belt, possibly causing temporary delays. But analysts 
did not expect a significant slowdown in the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery rose 1 cent to $2.56 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 3/4 cents to $1.99 1/4 a bushel; December oats 
rose 1 1/4 cents to $1.10 a bushel; and November soybeans fell 4 3/4 
cents to $4.92 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef prices fell and pork futures were mixed in trading on  
the Chicago Mercantile exchange. 
</P>
<P>
        October live cattle fell .30 cent to 70.92 cents a pound; October  
feeder cattle fell .45 cent to 80.65 cents a pound; December lean hogs 
fell .30 cent to 47.10 cents a pound; and February frozen pork bellies 
rose 1.10 cents to 65.40 cents a pound.

<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Doctors without Borders won the 1999 Nobel  
Peace Prize today in recognition of the organization's ``pioneering

Committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors Without Borders is a volunteer organization that treats  
victims of war, famine and other disasters around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Medecins Sans Frontieres, the international name of the  
organization founded by French doctors, has more than 2,000 medical 
professionals volunteering in 80 countries. They work in hospitals, 
refugee camps and nutrition centers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since its foundation in the early 1970s, Doctors Without  
Borders has adhered to the fundamental principle that all disaster 
victims, whether the disaster is natural or human in origin, have a 
right to professional assistance given as quickly and as 
efficiently as possible,'' the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``National boundaries and political circumstances or sympathies  
must have no influence on who is to receive humanitarian help. By 
maintaining a high degree of independence, the organization has 
succeeded in living up to these ideals,'' the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-member awards committee works in secrecy during its  
five or six meetings a year, and refuses to comment on or release 
candidates' names. This year it said only that there were 136 
nominees and the winner was selected on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Some names were known because those making the nominations  
announce their candidates for the prize, which includes a cash 
award of $960,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In past years, favorites have emerged from world events and the  
committee's wish to nurture ongoing peace efforts. Last year, the 
Northern Ireland peace process was at a key junction and prize went 
to Protestant David Trimble and Catholic John Hume. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 prize went to American Jody Williams and the  
International Campaign to Ban Landmines, the 1994 award to 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin 
and Shimon Peres, and the 1993 prize was awarded to South Africa's 
Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes, first given in 1901, are always presented on the  
Dec. 10 anniversary of the death of their creator, Swedish 
industrialist Alfred Nobel. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, and 
the others in Stockholm.

<HEADLINE> Medical Tests on Inmates Reassessed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- AIDS doctors and other experts who say  
HIV-infected inmates are being denied the latest treatments are 
calling for an expansion of research on prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, top health, prison and legal experts met here to  
begin drafting guidelines that would ensure such research is done 
ethically. 
</P>
<P>
	Conference organizer Dr. Anne De Groot, co-chair of the  
HIV/Prison Project at the Brown University AIDS Program, said 
guidelines regarding research on prisoners were written in the 
early 1970s -- before AIDS and hepatitis C -- and are in need of 
updating. 
</P>
<P>
	According to De Groot, 17 percent of people infected with HIV,  
and 33 percent of those infected with hepatitis C, pass through the 
nation's prison system each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the outside, patients have the right to participate in  
medical research and there is no ethical reason to deny them that 
right in prison,'' De Groot said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone at the conference agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This country has a terrible history on this issue, and that  
there are physicians and medical ethicists who want to get back 
into this gives me a chill,'' said Allen Hornblum, who teaches at 
Temple University and has written a book, ``Acres of Skin,'' about 
medical testing done on inmates in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, U.S. researchers conducted medical tests on  
American prisoners that were likened by critics to Nazi 
experiments. Inmates were injected with herpes, hepatitis and 
syphilis. Some had their testicles radiated; others were inflicted 
with wounds to see how they healed. 
</P>
<P>
	Partly because of such abuses, research on inmates dropped  
dramatically and was banned in some states. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Neveloff Dubler, a lawyer, said prisoners may feel coerced  
to participate in research programs to get better medical care, 
more comfortable accommodations or other such considerations. 
Prisoners are also sometimes paid for participating in drug trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ailing inmates should be given access to experimental  
treatment, said Dubler, director of the Division of Legal and 
Ethical Issues in Health Care at the Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Duncan, a former inmate from Pennsylvania who was invited  
to the conference, underwent traditional treatment for HIV while in 
prison. He said prisoners should be given the option of 
participating in research projects. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> House Panel Clears Disability Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill making it easier for people with  
disability to return to work has cleared a House committee and is 
headed to the House floor next week. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar measure has already passed the Senate, and backers  
were hoping for a final agreement by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``As technology provides new ways to clear hurdles presented by  
a disability, government must also keep pace by providing 
opportunity, not just dependence,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, 
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which approved the bill, 
33-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the legislation would let many of the  
nation's 9 million adults with disabilities keep their 
government-funded health insurance when they take jobs. Advocates 
say many people with disabilities would like to work, but don't for 
fear of losing crucial health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would inject competition among those who  
train the disabled to work. Those with disabilities could choose to 
continue getting services from government rehabilitation programs, 
or they could go to privately run programs. 
</P>
<P>
	And it would give the trainers an extra incentive to get people  
to work -- the trainers would get some of the money saved because of 
decreased government disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 1 percent of people who come onto government  
disability rolls ever leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional auditors estimate that the House bill would help  
an additional 35,000 people return to work over the next 10 years. 
It also would quadruple the number of people who get rehabilitation 
and employment services, the Congressional Budget Office predicts. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill is expected to cost $826 million over five years.  
Part of the cost will be defrayed by cutting off disability 
payments to people in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version is expected to cost $727 million over five  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Under both versions, Americans who use the Social Security  
Disability Insurance program could keep their Medicare benefits 
after returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senate would let those who leave over the next six years  
keep Medicare for good. The House only lets them keep the coverage 
for six years after they leave. 
</P>
<P>
	In both bills, states would get the option of extending Medicaid  
to those in the Supplemental Security Income program for low-income 
people, allowing them to buy into the program and pay premiums that 
would rise as their income grows. Each state would have to decide 
whether to extend Medicaid, which is paid for with a combination of 
state and federal money.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Founding Father Dies at 90 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Joseph Burg, an Israeli founding father,  
longtime Cabinet minister and advocate of coexistence between 
religious Jews and secular Israelis, died today at a Jerusalem 
hospital. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	The German-born Burg who escaped to pre-state Palestine just  
before the outbreak of World War II in 1939, was a figure of 
moderation and reconciliation in Israel's rough-and-tumble 
political scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``His most important legacy is that he tried to build a bridge  
over the biggest gulf in Israeli society, the gulf between 
religious and secular Jews,'' said Israel's elder statesman, former 
Prime Minister Shimon Peres. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a religious man but he believed in compromise.''  
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Burg took the path of moderation  
and tolerance and showed a love for Jewish traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Burg was an avuncular man with a round face and glasses, famous  
for his erudite wit. Political writers dubbed his appearances at 
question time in parliament ``Burgtheater,'' after the famous 
playhouse in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
	Burg died at Jerusalem's Shaarei Tsedek Hospital early today,  
said hospital spokeswoman Orna Cohen. She did not give the cause of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Dresden, Germany, in 1909, Burg was active in the Young  
Mizrahi religious Zionist movement while attending university in 
Leipzig. He was studying in Berlin when the Nazis came to power in 
1933, but he managed to complete his doctorate as well as qualify 
as an ordained rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1939 he came to Palestine, and worked as a high school  
teacher, but was soon elected to the executive committee of the 
Jewish Agency, which served as a pre-state shadow government for 
the Jews in Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of the founders of the National Religious Party  
(NRP), which has been a coalition partner in almost every Israeli 
government, whether of the right or the left. 
</P>
<P>
	Burg viewed the NRP as a bridge between the ultra-Orthodox and  
the secular, and between the left and right wing in Israeli 
politics. He had a habit of hyphenating the expression ``national 
religious'' and when he was asked which of the two elements was 
more important in the doctrine of his party, he quipped ``the 
hyphen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 19 years, the NRP played a centrist role in Israeli  
politics, but when Israel captured the West Bank and the Gaza Strip 
in the 1967 Mideast war, the younger generation in the party moved 
rapidly to the right. For them, the West Bank was the heartland of 
the biblical land of Israel and they spearheaded the movement to 
establish Jewish settlements there. 
</P>
<P>
	Burg remained a Cabinet minister until October 1988, but the  
leadership of the NRP had long since passed into the hands of the 
younger generation. He served in the Cabinet for 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, he was placed in charge of peace negotiations with  
Egypt. Burg wholeheartedly supported the 1979 land-for-peace deal, 
but many in his party opposed it, fearing an Israeli withdrawal 
from the Sinai Peninsula would set a precedent for a pullback from 
the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Peres said Burg would bring along hard-boiled egg sandwiches to  
the negotiations in Cairo and Alexandria so he would be able to 
keep Jewish dietary laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Hebrew and German, Burg spoke English, French,  
Spanish, Latin, Greek and Yiddish. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by a wife, a son and a daughter. The son, Avraham  
Burg, is the current speaker of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Burg's funeral is scheduled for Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Gore Outlines Anti-Hunger Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore marked World Hunger Day  
by paying a campaign stop today at a local soup kitchen, where he 
proposed steps to help working parents feed their families. ``In 
our time of plenty there shouldn't be anybody hungry in the United 
States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore rushed out his hunger platform ahead of a long-scheduled  
address on child poverty next week by Bill Bradley, his rival for 
the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	At the core of a ``policy paper'' Gore released today are the  
full restoration of food stamps for legal immigrants and a 
nutritious, daily school breakfast for every child. Gore did not 
detail how he would reach this goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing an apron over his crisp dress shirt and necktie, Gore  
briefly chipped in with volunteers layering bologna and cheese on 
wheat bread. He lamented that, of the 36 million Americans who do 
not get enough to eat each day, 14 million are children. 
</P>
<P>
	``That should gnaw at our conscience because we have the food,  
we have the resources, we have the means to do something about 
it,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	If elected president, Gore said he would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Give communities unspecified resources to design innovative  
strategies, such as expanding the number of schools that provide 
free meals or making sure parents know that breakfast is available 
at school for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow working families to own a car without jeopardizing their  
food stamp eligibility. Under current policy, families receiving 
nutritional assistance cannot own a car worth more than $4,650. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Push for full food-stamp eligibility for legal immigrants.  
Last year, Congress restored food stamps for elderly, disabled and 
minor non-citizens, covering 250,000 of the 935,000 legal 
immigrants who had lost those benefits under 1996 welfare reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Reward states that do a ``good job'' signing up families for  
food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Support anti-hunger partnerships among local, state, national  
and religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a growing child, going to bed hungry, night after night,  
is more than unpleasant,'' Gore said. ``Its powerful effects will 
be felt for a lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Agriculture Department study released Thursday found that at  
least 10 percent of households in 18 states and the District of 
Columbia don't have enough food.

<HEADLINE> Body of Abducted Kansas Girl Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAIN VALLEY, Mo. (AP) -- The nude body of a 10-year-old Kansas  
girl was found in a rural area Friday, three days after she was 
abducted in front of her home while roller skating with her sister, 
her parents said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI would not disclose how the girl, Pamela Butler, died.  
</P>
<P>
	A suspect, Keith B. Nelson, 24, was captured Thursday after a  
manhunt and a high-speed chase in Kansas City, Kan., where the girl 
lived. He was charged with kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, the FBI quoted a co-worker of Nelson's as  
saying that Nelson told him two weeks ago that he ``would like to 
kidnap a girl to rape, torture, electrocute, kill and bury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent Monte Strait confirmed that the body and some clothing  
found separately matched the fifth-grader's description. The body 
was not buried but was covered with sticks. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 officers had searched a field and woods Friday in  
Grain Valley, about 25 miles from the girl's home. The body was 
found near a church where a pickup truck believed to have been used 
in the kidnapping was spotted a few hours after Pamela disappeared 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found her. That's all I can say,'' Pamela's father, Paul  
Butler, said tearfully said outside her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela was skating Tuesday evening when her 11-year-old sister,  
Penny, saw a man get out of a white pickup, grab Pamela around the 
waist and throw her into the cab. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started screaming, and so did she,'' said Penny, who was on  
her front porch at the time. She yelled for an older sister to call 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses reported a license number after they chased the truck  
but couldn't keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck was registered to a company formerly owned by David  
Cunningham, Nelson's boss. Cunningham said Nelson had been driving 
the truck for two weeks, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson was captured after he was spotted near the Kansas River.  
Police said he tried to swim away as officers approached. 
</P>
<P>
	While authorities searched for Pamela, classmates decorated her  
home with cards made out of construction paper and gave teddy 
bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela's mother, Cherri West, had appealed to the kidnapper to  
give back her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``For someone to come here and do this, it's just not right,''  
she said. ``She was just a little girl, she had a whole life 
ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson underwent surgery Friday for injuries to his knee and leg  
suffered in a fall, the FBI said. He was in fair condition.

<HEADLINE> Williams May Start for Saints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Earlier in the week, New Orleans Saints coach  
Mike Ditka said it might be time to allow injured running back 
Ricky Williams to heal. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Ditka indicated Williams is likely to start against the  
Tennessee Titans on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is listed as questionable with a hyperextended right  
elbow and a left ankle sprain. But he returned to practice Thursday 
at full speed after sitting out Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky ran the best he's run in six weeks,'' Ditka said of his  
top draft pick. ``It looks very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tight end Cam Cleeland also practiced after sitting out  
Wednesday with a sprained ligament in his left knee. Ditka also 
said earlier that Cleeland was doubtful for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks very good for both of them,'' Ditka said.  
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Billy Joe Hobert, who has a bruised and pinched  
nerve in his neck and right throwing shoulder, dressed for practice 
and did some throwing. But Ditka said he's leaning towards Hobert 
as the No. 3 emergency quarterback. Ditka declined to commit to a 
starter between Billy Joe Tolliver and Danny Wuerffel.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Makes Two Recalls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is recalling  
417,000 1998 and 1999 Chrysler Cirrus, Dodge Stratus and Plymouth 
Breeze cars to inspect a brake tube that could be worn by contact 
with an exhaust clamp. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker said that there have been three reports of the  
clamp wearing a hole in the right rear brake tube, causing a fluid 
leak and the loss of some brake capacity. There have been no 
injuries as a result, DaimlerChrysler said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate action, the German-American automaker is recalling  
3,700 1999 Plymouth Prowlers to repair a dashboard warning light. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall is intended to assure the proper function of the  
brake warning light in the case a hydraulic pressure differential 
is detected, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no customer reports of this issue.  
DaimlerChrysler said car owners will be notified by mail and 
repairs will be made at no cost to the owners.

<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Happyanunoit, a New Zealand-bred filly,  
took the lead in midstretch and then pulled away to a four-length 
win Friday in the $558,500 Vinery First Lady Stakes at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Brice Blanc, the 4-year-old filly moved into  
contention at the top of the stretch and charged down the middle of 
the course to catch Pleasant Temper with an eighth-of-a-mile to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Happyanunoit ran the 1 3-16 miles on a firm turf course in 1:53  
4-5 to lower the course record by two-fifths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
	Pleasant Temper, the leader for more than a mile, finished  
second in the field of nine fillies and mares. Fiji, the 7-5 
favorite, was a neck back in third. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the sixth victory in 11 career starts for Happyanunoit,  
who earned $346,270 for John Amerman and his wife. Happyanunoit, 
trained by Robert J. Frankel, has earned $662,266. 
</P>
<P>
	Happyanunoit paid $7.40, $4.20 and $3. Pleasant Temper, ridden  
by Pat Day, returned $4.20 and $2.60, while Fiji, ridden by Jerry 
Bailey, paid $2.40 to show.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Criticizes GOP on Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton tested her  
national security wings Friday as a potential U.S. Senate candidate 
by criticizing Republican senators for voting down an international 
treaty banning nuclear weapons testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing her husband's sentiments, Mrs. Clinton said Senate  
Republicans shunned an opportunity to be peacemakers when they 
rejected the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	``Signing that treaty would have been taking a giant step toward  
creating a world of peace,'' she told about 100 community leaders 
and congregants at Antioch Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Her comments elaborated on a written statement released Friday  
in which she said the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would ``reduce 
the risk of nuclear war, curtail the spread of nuclear weapons, and 
help guarantee America's national security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has denounced the treaty's rejection as  
``reckless partisanship'' and warned other nuclear powers not to 
misinterpret it as a softening of the U.S. position against the 
spread of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., says Democrats were  
the partisans. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, however, said the Senate ``sent a dangerous  
message to people around the world, to our allies, and to Americans 
at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also told the invitation-only crowd that the treaty should  
be important to them because ``everyone has an obligation to be a 
peacemaker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is expected to face New York City Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani in a bid for the Senate seat being vacated by Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who is retiring.

	Giuliani defended Senate Republicans earlier in the week.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell today following a fresh  
warning from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan against 
excessive optimism by stock traders. The dollar tumbled against the 
Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 178.69  
points, or 1 percent, to close at 17,601.57. The index closed up 
25.77 points, or 0.15 percent, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 105.78 yen late today in Tokyo, down  
1.49 yen from late Thursday and also below its overnight New York 
level of 107.35 yen. During the day, it ranged from 105.73 yen to 
107.63 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to bankers Thursday night, after U.S. markets  
closed, Greenspan urged continued vigilance in managing risk at a 
time of prosperity, robust economic expansion and roaring stock 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan has warned for years against excessive economic  
optimism that can lead to risky business decisions and his comments 
Thursday followed recent warnings by federal regulators that signs 
of risk are spreading in the banking industry despite high earnings 
and hefty assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economists have been unable to anticipate sharp reversals in  
confidence,'' Greenspan told a Washington conference organized by 
the Office of the Comptroller. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a minimum, risk managers need to ... set aside somewhat  
higher contingency resources ... to cover the losses that will 
inevitably emerge from time to time when investors suffer a loss of 
confidence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also said that the decline in equity premiums that has  
kept U.S. stock prices rising in recent years could be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	The equity premium is the difference between the returns yielded  
by stocks and the returns yielded by U.S. Treasury bonds. It 
effectively reflects the reward investors demand in return for 
taking risks on stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the speech, Greenspan waded indirectly into a debate over how  
long U.S. stock prices can keep rising, although he offered no 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks are often sensitive to developments that could  
affect market sentiment in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market turned very cautious ahead of the opening of  
trading in New York, and the weekend,'' said Masatoshi Sato, 
manager at Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices also got little support from a government report  
that slightly upgraded the assessment of Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The country is mounting a ``modest'' recovery from its worst  
downturn in decades, but weak corporate spending and high 
unemployment are still hindering the economy, Japan's Economic 
Planning Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 26.48 points, or 1.72 percent, to 1,510.26. The 
TOPIX closed up 9.78 points, or 0.64 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 757.23 million shares, down from 841.42 million shares 
Thursday. Retreaters overwhelmed advancing issues 746 to 453, while 
137 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
closed up 54.45 points, at 10,286.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's comments also sent the dollar lower.  
</P>
<P>
	``Greenspan's words have heightened concerns among traders that  
the Dow Jones Industrial Average could be on the verge of a 
significant fall and we saw the dollar losing ground to the yen, 
euro, Swiss franc and the pound today,'' said Shuji Takano, 
assistant foreign exchange manager at ABN-AMRO in Tokyo.

	BOSTON (AP) -- A U.S. immigration officer was fined $500 and  
given a year of probation Friday for smuggling her lover into the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Jesmer, 35, pleaded guilty in June to taking 36-year-old  
Jose Cabral-Simas over the Canadian border in her car. 
</P>
<P>
	She met him in 1996 when he was a prisoner under her supervision  
at an Immigration and Naturalization Service center in Boston, 
where he was awaiting deportation to his native Portugal for a drug 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the country in 1997, but the pair met up in Montreal in  
August last year and drove to Ms. Jesmer's home near Boston. They 
were caught after someone tipped authorities that Cabral-Simas was 
back in town. 
</P>
<P>
	``He professed real affection and then used her like a chip in a  
poker game,'' said Ms. Jesmer's lawyer, Charles Balliro. 
</P>
<P>
	She was also ordered to perform 500 hours of community service.  
</P>
<P>
	Cabral-Simas is awaiting sentencing for illegally re-entering  
the country.

<HEADLINE> Power Goes Out at Hurricane Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The National Hurricane Center switched over to  
backup generators when the power went out Friday morning, blacking 
out computer screens as Hurricane Irene swirled to the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The power was only out for about 30 seconds, said director Jerry  
Jarrell, but a system designed to bridge the gap between commercial 
and generator power failed, bringing down most of the center's 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	It took about 90 minutes to reboot all the machines.  
</P>
<P>
	During that period, which began shortly after 11 a.m., the  
center was not able to process satellite data. However, forecasters 
were able to get all the data they needed from National Centers for 
Environmental Prediction computers in Kansas City, Mo., and 
Washington, Jarrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as communications are working, we can work,'' Jarrell  
said. ``It was more a delay than a loss of data.''

<HEADLINE> White House Attacks Starr Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The prosecutor who will finish up Kenneth  
Starr's investigation of the president and first lady is now in his 
second independent counsel probe of the Clinton administration. The 
White House on Friday called the choice ``dubious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While working for Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz, Robert Ray  
won convictions against a Tyson Foods executive and a Tyson 
lobbyist in an investigation of illegal gifts to then-Agriculture 
Secretary Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House seized on the fact that Ray, 39, was part of  
Smaltz's investigation, which lost the biggest case it brought -- 
against Espy himself on charges of taking illegal gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's somewhat of a dubious proposition that someone involved  
both in the Espy investigation and the Starr operation'' is 
``getting a promotion,'' said President Clinton's spokesman, Joe 
Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lawyer Barry Levine, who represented the Tyson  
lobbyist, said of Ray: ``My experience with him is that he is not 
measured, that he will look at any transgression benign in effect 
and submit the lives of those people to unfair torture. ... There 
have been instances where independent counsels have served this 
nation well. I have no confidence that Bob Ray will do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Word leaked out Thursday night that the three-judge panel of  
appeals court judges that selects independent counsels had chosen 
Ray to replace Starr next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said good riddance to Starr.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Americans will be glad that from now on, he'll be  
taking his garbage out each morning in private,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Starr's office, where he started working early this year, Ray  
helped prosecute longtime presidential friend Webster Hubbell. 
Hubbell, the former associate attorney general, pleaded guilty to a 
felony in June for allegedly concealing his and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's legal work on a fraudulent Arkansas land deal owned by 
her Whitewater partner, Jim McDougal, and Hubbell's father-in-law, 
Little Rock businessman Seth Ward. Hubbell says he knows of no 
wrongdoing by the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	If Mrs. Clinton follows through on plans to run for the Senate,  
her legal work on the project could prove politically troublesome 
in Ray's final report on the six-year, $50 million-plus probe of 
the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray is ``a decent guy and I think he'll make a good replacement  
for Starr,'' said William Gardner, a defense lawyer who represented 
several clients in the Espy investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not a zealot and he's not particularly political,'' said  
attorney Barry Coburn, a former prosecutor who worked with Ray for 
several years in Smaltz's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know his political orientation to this day,'' Coburn  
said of Ray. ``He's a prosecutor's prosecutor with good people 
skills and excellent judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray ``has a high level of credibility; if he didn't know  
something, he said he didn't know,'' said U.S. District Judge 
Michael Mukasey of New York, who presided over two cocaine 
conspiracy jury trials Ray won as an assistant U.S. attorney in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Ray supervised and participated in a number of  
public corruption and organized crime prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Starr's office early this year, the lack of bad  
publicity surrounding Ray may have won him the job. Three other 
candidates for Starr's post have been depicted by Clinton 
supporters as overly aggressive prosecutors biased against the 
president and first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the three judges interviewed Ray and at least  
five other Starr prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates for Starr's job included the head of his Arkansas  
operation, W. Hickman Ewing, and Washington prosecutors Mike Emmick 
and Paul Rosenzweig. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing once drafted an indictment of Mrs. Clinton. Emmick was  
present at the controversial daylong confrontation in which Starr's 
investigators tried to get the former White House intern to 
cooperate in the investigation of the president. Rosenzweig was the 
first in Starr's office to receive word in January 1998 that a 
witness, who turned out to be Linda Tripp, had information for them 
in what turned out to be the Lewinsky investigation. Clinton 
supporters pointed to Rosenzweig's early warning as support for 
their allegation that Starr's office was working in concert with 
Paula Jones' legal team to hurt the president.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Dive; Dow Ends Down 266.90 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials briefly fell below  
10,000 Friday as a whiff of inflation and a warning to investors by 
the Federal Reserve chairman sent stocks tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop below 10,000 lasted only moments, and the Dow fell no  
further than 9,998.18. But the average still finished 266.90 points 
lower at 10,019.71 for its worst close since early April. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow lost a record 630.05 points for the week, slicing 1999's  
gain to about 9 percent. The measure of 30 major companies now sits 
1,300 points below the record close of 11,326.04 set Aug. 25 -- when 
it was up more than 23 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also suffered heavy damage on Friday.  
The Nasdaq composite index fell 75.01 to 2,731.83, and the Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500 fell 36.01 to 1,247.41. 
</P>
<P>
	The selloff followed a report revealing that prices at the  
wholesale level spiked 1.1 percent in September, the largest 
increase in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in a speech to bankers Thursday night, Fed Chairman  
Alan Greenspan issued his latest warning about investor exuberance 
at a time of robust economic expansion and roaring stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Both developments aggravated market fears that the Federal  
Reserve will raise interest rates for the third time this year in a 
bid to fight inflation by slowing the economy. Fed policy makers 
meet next on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	A host of other factors also conspired to spook the market,  
including rising interest rates in the bond market, another drop by 
the dollar in currency trading, and the prospect of a crush of 
company profit reports next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The markets use (these worries) as an excuse or confirmation  
that there's trouble afoot and that building cash might be a 
prudent move,'' said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for 
Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif. And thanks to the 
recent increase in Treasury bond yields, ``there's some very 
desirable alternatives in fixed-income investments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial companies, which could see demand for loans hurt by  
rising interest rates, led Friday's decline. American Express fell 
7 to 135 and J.P. Morgan fell 5 3/16 to 105 11/16 -- accounting for 
the equivalent of more than 70 points in the Dow's retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the Dow, General Electric fell 4 3/8 to 115 3/4 and Union  
Carbide fell 3 5/16 to 53 3/4. Among leading Nasdaq technology names, 
Microsoft fell 2 5/8 to 88 1/16 and Intel fell 2 15/32 to 70 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend, Sun Microsystems rallied 3 5/32 to 92 9/16 in  
Nasdaq trading after a better-than-expected profit report from the 
maker of powerful business computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than a 3-to-1  
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 687 up, 2,400 down and 
436 unchanged. Nasdaq decliners led by a slightly smaller margin. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 907.56 million shares as of 4 p.m., up from  
879.46 at the same point on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.61 to 414.70.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas markets also took a big hit. In Europe, Britain's FT-SE  
100 fell 2.2 percent, Germany's DAX index fell 0.7 percent percent 
and France's CAC-40 fell 1.3 percent. Japan's Nikkei stock average 
fell 1.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Deal Struck on Bank Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and the Federal  
Reserve have agreed to share power over banks that move into the 
securities and insurance businesses, reaching a compromise in a 
long-simmering dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord announced Thursday could mean President Clinton would  
sign sweeping legislation Congress was close to enacting that would 
lift Depression-era legal barriers and allow banks, brokerage firms 
and insurance companies to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration had been threatening a veto of the package,  
which was closer to the Fed's view. 
</P>
<P>
	However, other key issues remained to be resolved. The  
administration continued to object to provisions in the measure 
that it said would weaken the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, 
which requires banks to make loans in low-income and minority areas 
in which they operate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department, reflecting the administration's view,  
has wanted to let banks get into new kinds of financial activities 
through subsidiaries of the banks themselves, not just through 
affiliated companies within the same parent holding company. That 
arrangement would increase the power of Treasury's Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates nationally chartered 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve, led by Chairman Alan Greenspan, and most  
GOP lawmakers, on the other hand, want to let banks diversify 
through a holding company structure. That would expand the 
independent central bank's role as a regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	In their new compromise, the Treasury and the Fed agreed to  
share regulatory authority over banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks would be allowed to set up subsidiaries to conduct the new  
activities, but with some restrictions to accommodate the Fed's 
concerns about securities and insurance businesses gaining access 
to the federal bank-deposit insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord ``reflects compromise on both our parts towards a  
mutually satisfactory agreement,'' Greenspan and Treasury Secretary 
Lawrence Summers said in a note to key lawmakers, including the 
chairmen of the House and Senate banking committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan and Summers asked that their proposal be included in  
the legislative package being shaped by Congress for a final vote 
by both chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan told a banking conference Thursday night he was ``very  
pleased'' with the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The substance of our joint proposal addresses the concerns of  
both sides and reflects our common goal of modernizing our nation's 
financial structure,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to the group, he said bankers must continue to be  
vigilant in managing risk at a time of prosperity, robust economic 
expansion and roaring stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The speech reprised earlier warnings by Greenspan against  
excessive economic optimism that can lead to risky business 
decisions. It also was in line with a recent series of warnings by 
federal regulators that signs of risk were spreading in the banking 
industry despite high earnings and hefty assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economists have been unable to anticipate sharp reversals in  
confidence,'' Greenspan told the conference organized by the Office 
of the Comptroller. ``Collapsing confidence is generally described 
as a bursting bubble, an event ... evident only in retrospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At a minimum, risk managers need to ... set aside somewhat  
higher contingency resources ... to cover the losses that will 
inevitably emerge from time to time when investors suffer a loss of 
confidence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In related developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Jesse Jackson criticized the financial overhaul legislation,  
calling it ``a major step backwards'' that he said would gut the 
Community Reinvestment Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should banks be granted the right to merge with insurance  
and (securities) companies, but at the same time make fewer 
commitments to the communities that house them?'' the civil rights 
activist said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	--A diverse coalition including consumer activist Ralph Nader,  
conservative Phyllis Schlafly and conservative Republicans and 
liberal Democrats in the House and Senate, denounced the 
legislation on grounds it fails to adequately protect consumers' 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	--Twelve financial trade associations said in a joint statement  
that the measure would ``greatly benefit our nation's consumers and 
strengthen our economy'' and ``provide low-cost financial services 
for millions of Americans.''

<HEADLINE> House Apt To Consider $1 Wage Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill to raise the minimum wage by $1 over  
three years and cut taxes by $35 billion to ease the impact on 
business is likely to reach the House floor this month, Speaker 
Dennis Hastert said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we will have a minimum wage bill up within the next  
couple of weeks,'' Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters. ``There needs 
to be some things that help small businesses survive as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The version gaining the most steam was introduced late Thursday  
by Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., and is co-sponsored by nine others 
including five Democrats. It would raise the current $5.15-an-hour 
minimum wage by 33 cents in April 2000 and 2001 and by 34 cents on 
April 1, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax cuts and regulatory relief would start in 2001, using  
projected non-Social Security budget surpluses. That package 
includes a five-year reduction in the estate tax, an increase in 
the business meal deduction from 50 percent to 60 percent, expanded 
pensions, making self-employed health insurance premiums 100 
percent deductible in 2001 instead of 2003 and extensions of 
welfare-to-work and other hiring-incentive business credits. 
</P>
<P>
	There is overwhelming support among Democrats and many  
Republicans to increase the minimum wage, but the GOP wants to put 
its own imprint on the measure by giving businesses some tax 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good-faith effort to find middle ground,'' Lazio  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats said the bipartisan bill's wage increase is too  
meager and that the tax package could run into trouble because it 
is not paid for with revenue-raising offsets. Reps. Charles Rangel, 
D-N.Y., and John Tanner, D-Tenn., are working on a smaller 
Democratic alternative that is paid for in part by closing abusive 
corporate tax shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need commonsense tax relief that goes directly to small  
businesses in this country, but it has got to be paid for,'' said 
Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., the minority whip. ``The Lazio bill is 
a tax package, disguised as small business relief, that will bust 
the budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also could run into some trouble among Republican  
leaders because it includes several tax provisions that were not 
part of the 10-year, $792 billion GOP tax cut vetoed by President 
Clinton. Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and 
Means Committee, says he will insist on hearings if such items 
remain in the bill, which could cripple its chances of passing this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be a limited package for the people most affected  
by the wage increase,'' said Archer, R-Texas. ``I don't think it 
ought to develop into a Christmas tree.''

<HEADLINE> Va. Tech's Hawkes Seeks Vindication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Probably more than anyone else, Virginia  
Tech's Michael Hawkes has suffered the memory of last season's 
last-play loss to Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because he also absorbed most of the blame.  
</P>
<P>
	Hawkes wasn't the Hokies defender assigned to Stephen Brominski  
on the final play of the Orangemen's 28-26 victory, but as the 
nearest defender when the tight end pulled in Donovan McNabb's 
13-yard TD pass, he sure looked the part. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere I went, people were bringing it up to me, blaming  
me,'' Hawkes said this week as the fourth-ranked Hokies prepared to 
play the 16th-ranked Orangemen on Saturday night. ``When I was out 
downtown, at a store or even in class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Tech's players and coaches have refused to identify the  
player who did blow the assignment on the touchdown, and over time 
Hawkes' refusal to defend himself and set the record straight have 
made it his cross to bear. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you make the play, you're the hero and when you don't,  
you're looked down on,'' said Hawkes, seen rushing toward Brominski 
on the play. ``Even if he wasn't my responsibility, I should have 
gotten there and made the play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was one of three Virginia Tech suffered last season,  
all in dramatic fashion and all with an apparent goat. Ricky Hall 
dropped a potential game-winning touchdown in the final seconds of 
a 28-24 loss to Temple, and Anthony Midget was beaten for a 47-yard 
TD pass as Virginia rallied to beat the Hokies 36-32. 
</P>
<P>
	For Hawkes, Saturday night is a chance to enjoy his revenge.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't just want to get back at them for that one play,'' the  
linebacker said. ``I want to get back because this is another step 
toward our goal of winning the Big East. All the criticism has made 
me work to be a stronger, more mature person. And a better player. 
That's what I want to show Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orangemen (5-1, 2-0) have been beaten 31-7 and 31-3 in their  
last two visits to noisy Lane Stadium, so this week coach Paul 
Pasqualoni tried to simulate the noise of 52,000 fans with speakers 
blaring as the Orange offense practiced. 
</P>
<P>
	The players said practice was so loud they couldn't hear a  
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasqualoni said last week's victory at Pittsburgh, when the  
Orangemen took a 24-0 lead and had to hang on to win 24-17, could 
help against the Hokies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of got tested there in the fourth quarter, had to keep  
our poise,'' Pasqualoni said. ``We can make something positive out 
of that experience.''

<HEADLINE> New Technology May Spur Tiny Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers using a computer-driven microscope  
say they can now draw a pattern with lines separated by only 
200-billionths of an inch, an advance that could lead to electronic 
chips much smaller and of different materials than those now in 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	Chad A. Mirkin of Northwestern University said that the new  
technology is able to draw a lines that are 15 to 30 nanometers 
wide and separated by only 5 nanometers. A nanometer is 
one-billionth of a meter. A fine human hair is about 10,000 
nanometers wide. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the technique eventually may be used to build very tiny  
electronic circuits, or to store vast volumes of information in a 
very small space. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this technique, we can put 80 million words in a square  
inch,'' said Mirkin. It may be possible, he said, to store a whole 
library in a wafer and then retrieve the information for use. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the new research appears Friday in the journal  
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirkin said the technique combines the ancient technology of the  
quill pen with the precision of a computer-driven atomic force 
microscope to draw lines on a surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Ink flows down the microscope pen tip onto a surface, just as  
ink flows onto paper from the hollow of a dipped quill pen. 
</P>
<P>
	Water, which collects naturally on the microscope tip, is a key  
part of the process. The water forms a tiny hollow tube, like a 
capillary, that allows the ink, or other materials, to flow to the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northwestern researchers demonstrated drawing single lines  
with the system earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they have improved the technique so that it can draw  
multiple lines, one after the other, and create a pattern in 
nanometer proportions. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a sense, we have transitioned dip-pen nanolithography from  
a single ink process to a four-color printing type of process on a 
nanometer scale,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirkin said that instead of using ink, the technique could use  
any of a variety of useful molecules that would be assembled into 
pattern lines just 30 molecules wide. This would make it possible, 
he said, to build electronic circuits of organic materials that 
some experts believe will be the heart of computers in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next frontier is determining what type of molecules that  
could be used for circuits,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nanometer drawing might also be used to create DNA arrays, a  
type of organic assembly that can be used to identify genes in 
blood or other medical specimens. By building such arrays on a 
nanometer circuit scale, said Mirkin, it might be possible to 
screen for thousands of genes with just one DNA chip.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell today following a fresh  
warning from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan against 
excessive optimism by stock traders. The dollar tumbled against the 
Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 178.69  
points, or 1 percent, to close at 17,601.57. The index closed up 
25.77 points, or 0.15 percent, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 105.78 yen late today in Tokyo, down  
1.49 yen from late Thursday and also below its overnight New York 
level of 107.35 yen. During the day, it ranged from 105.73 yen to 
107.63 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to bankers Thursday night, after U.S. markets  
closed, Greenspan urged continued vigilance in managing risk at a 
time of prosperity, robust economic expansion and roaring stock 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan has warned for years against excessive economic  
optimism that can lead to risky business decisions and his comments 
Thursday followed recent warnings by federal regulators that signs 
of risk are spreading in the banking industry despite high earnings 
and hefty assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economists have been unable to anticipate sharp reversals in  
confidence,'' Greenspan told a Washington conference organized by 
the Office of the Comptroller. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a minimum, risk managers need to ... set aside somewhat  
higher contingency resources ... to cover the losses that will 
inevitably emerge from time to time when investors suffer a loss of 
confidence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also said that the decline in equity premiums that has  
kept U.S. stock prices rising in recent years could be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	The equity premium is the difference between the returns yielded  
by stocks and the returns yielded by U.S. Treasury bonds. It 
effectively reflects the reward investors demand in return for 
taking risks on stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the speech, Greenspan waded indirectly into a debate over how  
long U.S. stock prices can keep rising, although he offered no 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks are often sensitive to developments that could  
affect market sentiment in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market turned very cautious ahead of the opening of  
trading in New York, and the weekend,'' said Masatoshi Sato, 
manager at Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices also got little support from a government report  
that slightly upgraded the assessment of Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The country is mounting a ``modest'' recovery from its worst  
downturn in decades, but weak corporate spending and high 
unemployment are still hindering the economy, Japan's Economic 
Planning Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 26.48 points, or 1.72 percent, to 1,510.26. The 
TOPIX closed up 9.78 points, or 0.64 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 757.23 million shares, down from 841.42 million shares 
Thursday. Retreaters overwhelmed advancing issues 746 to 453, while 
137 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
closed up 54.45 points, at 10,286.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's comments also sent the dollar lower.  
</P>
<P>
	``Greenspan's words have heightened concerns among traders that  
the Dow Jones Industrial Average could be on the verge of a 
significant fall and we saw the dollar losing ground to the yen, 
euro, Swiss franc and the pound today,'' said Shuji Takano, 
assistant foreign exchange manager at ABN-AMRO in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Asarco Accepts Grupo Mexico Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Asarco Inc. on Friday accepted a $1.24 billion  
cash takeover offer from Grupo Mexico SA de CV, following a 
seven-week bidding contest for the nation's third-largest copper 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Grupo Mexico increased its proposal by 25 cents to $29.75 a  
share, topping an offer by rival Phelps Dodge Corp. Grupo Mexico 
also will assume Asarco's $1.02 billion in debt. Phelps had 
previously said it would not raise its bid. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of Asarco's 1 billion pounds of annual copper  
production, Grupo Mexico will be the world's third-largest copper 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The jousting for control of Asarco underscores the pressure  
copper companies face to cut costs by consolidating. The price of 
copper has fallen by almost one-third over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of New York-based Asarco rose 6 1/4 cents to $29.37 1/3 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The losing bidder, Phoenix, Ariz.-based Phelps Dodge will have  
to content itself with its $1.8 billion acquisition of Cyprus Amax 
Minerals Co. of Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge shares rose 62 1/2 cents to $57.87 1/2, also on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> State Cracks Down on Rave Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- It's a typical rave -- loud, throbbing  
dance music, hundreds of young people and drugs, lots of different 
kinds. Synthetic and potent substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Fade Kainer and his friends are here. The 23-year-old musician  
doesn't see anything strange in the all-night dance party on South 
Beach: ``I don't know if it's any worse than living in the '60s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Florida authorities say the parties and their problems are  
among the worst in the nation. They are cracking down. 
</P>
<P>
	Statewide raids this month at 57 raves netted 1,219 arrests and  
nearly $9.4 million in drugs, weapons, vehicles and cash. As of 
June, nearly 1 million pills had been confiscated across the state, 
according to the Florida Sheriff's Association. Agents seized 
nearly 49,000 doses during the recent Operation Heat Rave, with an 
estimated value of $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a big problem in the state,'' state drug czar Jim  
McDonough said. ``It exceeds the rest of the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough blamed Florida's popularity on the state's  
international connection and the flow of tourists, especially from 
Europe where raves are very popular. 
</P>
<P>
	``Florida is on the cutting edge of focusing on this as a public  
health issue,'' said Rob Housman, a spokesman for White House drug 
policy coordinator Gen. Barry McCaffrey. ``Their coordinated effort 
is a model for other states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey's office lauded the recent crackdown and said that law  
enforcement officials across the country were beginning to pay more 
attention to the scene and synthetic drugs popping up everywhere 
from desert parties in Arizona to clubs in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The current alphabet soup of designer drugs with names such GHB,  
MDMA and Special K are more potent, more available and in some 
combinations, more deadly than some of the substances floating 
around during the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida officials say there have been six rave-related drug  
deaths around the state, including two this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lollipops and baby pacifiers are used by some in the rave drug  
set because any product containing methamphetamine, as the 
hallucinogen Ecstasy does, causes one's teeth to grind. You need 
something in your mouth to avoid biting your tongue or your lips. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always think about how many brain cells I'm killing, but  
I'll go back and do it,'' said Josh Mangual, 21, a graphic design 
artist. He added: ``It's not the scene that causes drug use, it's 
the individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Ecstasy, also called Adam, is the drug of choice  
for those involved with the club music and rave scene. Many raves 
attract a younger crowd by advertising that alcohol is not sold on 
the premises. 
</P>
<P>
	The young people who enjoy raving say it isn't fair to reduce  
their culture to a mere drug fest. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Margolis, 17, said the scene promotes peace, love, unity  
and respect. But she acknowledges it is overshadowed by excessive 
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``The music brings people together and the drugs pull them  
apart,'' she said. ``I don't go out to get messed up anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Florida cities have taken steps to regulate or ban  
raves, including Orlando and Tampa. Some say the efforts have 
merely forced the parties to move to warehouses, homes and other 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they put an all-out ban on these shows, things are going to  
get a lot more dangerous,'' said Jason Donovan, an organizer of the 
Zen Festival in Coconut Grove last month. ``If you try and tell a 
young person not to do something, they're going to want to do it 
even more.''

<HEADLINE> Suit Says Marines Jailed Wrong Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Arrested for jumping a commuter train turnstile,  
Martin L. King was shocked to find himself shackled and taken to 
the brig at Camp Lejeune, N.C., charged with deserting the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	King said he told authorities they had the wrong man; he'd never  
been in the military. Still, he was held for 40 days, during which 
he claims he was sexually assaulted by another inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nightmare,'' King said Thursday. ``It basically felt  
like I was being terrorized by the government. That was very, very 
scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, 33, is suing the Marines and the U.S. government for  
unspecified damages, alleging he was falsely imprisoned. The suit, 
filed in federal court in Atlanta, is awaiting a trial date. 
</P>
<P>
	According to King's suit, his ordeal began when someone stole  
his Social Security number and used it to enlist in the Marines. 
The unknown man finished basic training in 1992 at Parris Island, 
S.C., then disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in early 1996, King was fired on his first day as a YMCA  
counselor because a background check showed he was wanted for 
desertion. When he went to a Marines recruiting office in Atlanta 
to clear up the error, he said, he was laughed at and sent away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here was an innocent guy who told everybody he possibly could  
that he was innocent, that they had the wrong man,'' said Marc 
Bardack, one of King's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, King, a former college student, had a  
late-night janitor's job, no money and was living in a shelter. 
That's when he was arrested for jumping the turnstile and sent to 
Camp Lejeune. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines could have solved the problem quickly by looking at  
their own records, King's lawyers say. The impostor's file 
contained his medical and dental records, fingerprints, 
handwriting, and most importantly, his picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Camp Lejeune released King the day after he told his story to a  
television station. King now lives in Oakland, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Marine Corps officials confirmed King was in the brig at from  
Aug. 23 to Sept. 13, 1996, and declined further comment. A 
spokesman Assistant U.S. Attorney William Traynor also declined 
comment.

<HEADLINE> IRS Says Tax Delay Could Be Costly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service says it must  
spend up to $11.5 million extra to print and mail forms and 
probably will perplex taxpayers because of congressional delays on 
a tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to act now to assure timely delivery of tax forms and  
instructions to individuals,'' IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti 
said in a letter to congressional leaders. ``Unfortunately, despite 
our best efforts, some taxpayers still may be confused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of middle-class taxpayers who claim personal credits  
such as the $500 per-child credit could be required to calculate 
both their regular income taxes and alternative minimum taxes 
unless Congress acts to exempt those credits from applying to the 
latter levy. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1 million of those taxpayers could get hit with  
unexpectedly higher income taxes -- and those numbers will only get 
higher in the future because the alternative minimum tax is not 
indexed for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax was created in 1969 to ensure the wealthy did not escape  
income taxes through legal loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-year exemption passed last year has expired. The House and  
Senate are far from agreement on legislation extending the 
exemption -- included in bills that would renew several popular 
business tax breaks -- and President Clinton is threatening to veto 
any tax bill that spends some of the future non-Social Security 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The morass on Capitol Hill is causing big headaches at the IRS,  
which is preparing tax forms and instructions that assume the 
personal credits exemption for the alternative minimum tax will be 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	But just in case the exemption lapses, the IRS is prepared to  
print up a 16-page supplement of forms and instructions that would 
be mailed to taxpayers by Jan. 15. A notation explaining the 
situation will be included in the original package and on the IRS 
Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	If the provision is extended, the IRS may send a follow-up  
postcard to assure taxpayers of that fact. Total cost is estimated 
at between $7.5 million and $11.5 million, Rossotti said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will do our best to provide help to every taxpayer who  
needs it, given the uncertain legislative situation,'' Rossotti 
said in the letter dated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There is broad bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for extending  
the alternative minimum tax fix. But there is disagreement about 
how to pay for it and how long the exemption should last. 
</P>
<P>
	A $23.3 billion bill approved by the House Ways and Means  
Committee would make permanent the fix and extend other expiring 
tax provisions for five years. It has drawn opposition from 
Democrats and a veto threat from Clinton, however, because it would 
spend surplus dollars in four of its five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're for the extenders,'' House Minority Leader Dick  
Gephardt, D-Mo., told reporters Thursday. ``We just think you have 
to pay for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The alternative minimum tax would have been abolished gradually  
by the $792 billion Republican tax cut vetoed by the president in 
September. Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the Ways and Means 
Committee, blamed the higher IRS costs on the administration's 
opposition to using any surplus dollars for both the big tax cut 
and the slimmed-down bill of extensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got that bill out of committee in plenty of time,'' said  
Archer, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Finance Committee, meanwhile, is struggling for a  
bipartisan agreement on a more modest package of tax extensions 
currently estimated at $7.8 billion. A draft of that bill, which 
would be paid for with a variety of revenue raisers, would extend 
the alternative minimum tax fix for two years.

<HEADLINE>  Prosecutor Admits JonBenet Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Prosecutor Alex Hunter says the decision  
not to indict anyone in the murder of JonBenet Ramsey left him with 
``an aching heart,'' and he declared the search for her killer is 
not over. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the girl's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, have not  
been eliminated from the investigation. Police Chief Mark Beckner 
said the Ramseys remain ``under an umbrella of suspicion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two men spoke on Thursday, a day after Hunter announced that  
a 13-month grand jury investigation into the 1996 slaying did not 
find enough evidence to charge anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Hunter said the four prosecutors and their  
advisers working on the case unanimously agreed there was 
insufficient evidence to warrant charges in the death of the 
6-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to discuss the grand jury's investigation, including  
why JonBenet's parents were not called to testify. He also said the 
case is stronger as a result of the grand jury's work, though he 
acknowledged that ``mistakes were made'' in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have an aching heart about where we are with this case, but  
by no means do I or any of the men who you see at this table feel a 
sense of failure,'' said Hunter, flanked by other prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to follow the evidence in this case as long  
as there is work to be done. We find no reason to give up heart, we 
find no reason to quit and we plan to continue with diligence the 
effort we believe has been under way since the beginning of this 
case,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Gov. Bill Owens said a team of attorneys,  
including Attorney General Ken Salazar, will review the case and 
recommend whether a special prosecutor should be named. Owens said 
he would decide within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on Dec. 26, 1996, Mrs. Ramsey told police she found a  
ransom note demanding $118,000 for her daughter's safe return. 
Eight hours later, JonBenet's father said he found his daughter's 
body in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks later, Hunter assembled a dream team of prosecutors  
and advisers, but the investigation soon became bogged down with 
infighting between his office and police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were accused of mishandling the evidence and allowing too  
many people to have access to the crime scene; Hunter was accused 
of trying to protect JonBenet's wealthy and influential parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter turned the case over to the grand jury in September 1998.  
The grand jurors heard from investigators, the police, Ramsey 
friends and associates, JonBenet's brother Burke and her 
half-siblings. 
</P>
<P>
	After the decision not to charge anyone was announced, the  
Ramseys asked police to continue the investigation to find a 
``child killer'' still on the loose. 
</P>
<P>
	At his own news conference, Beckner said he agreed that ``there  
are things that we should have done differently and wish we would 
have done differently.'' But he added: ``To say that mistakes have 
made this an unsolvable case is not accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is not dead in the water,'' Beckner said. ``We still  
have things to do, still have evidence that is being processed and 
examined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During morning radio talk shows, angry callers lambasted Hunter,  
demanding to know why no one has been charged in the nearly three 
years since JonBenet was killed. Some defended Hunter and accused 
police of bungling the case and mishandling evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hunter got stuck with a bad case, and so did the grand  
jurors,'' said Emily Brown, who was playing with two children 
outside the Boulder County Justice Center, where the grand jury 
met. ``It upsets me.''

<HEADLINE> Oregon Suspends Starting Cornerback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Oregon starting cornerback Tamoni Joiner has  
been suspended indefinitely for ``repeated violation of team 
rules,'' Ducks coach Mike Bellotti said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joiner, a junior, will not play next week at Arizona, in his  
hometown of Tucson. The Ducks (3-3, 1-2 Pac-10) are idle this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Joiner also was suspended for a Sept. 11 game against Texas-El  
Paso. The reason Bellotti gave then also was unspecified violation 
of team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Joiner started the Ducks' other five games this season,  
recording 18 tackles and leading the team with 18 pass break-ups. 
He had one interception and one fumble recovery.

<HEADLINE> Indians Fire Manager Mike Hargrove </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- More than 700 victories couldn't save Mike  
Hargrove's job. Neither could five straight AL Central titles, two 
trips to the World Series or being a nice guy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland Indians, who went from sad-sack losers to  
perennial power under Hargrove, still haven't won a World Series 
title since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	If they win another, it won't be with Hargrove.  
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, who eight years ago inherited an Indians team which  
would lose 105 games, was fired Friday just four days after 
Cleveland's collapse against the Boston Red Sox in the AL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for me to say if I'm paying the price,'' Hargrove  
said in a phone interview. ``I don't know that this would have 
happened if we hadn't gone farther in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Hargrove became emotional when talking about his  
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	He had heard reports of his firing on local radio, and listened  
to general manager John Hart's news conference during which the GM 
talked about his team needing a manager who could get them to the 
``next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``And that's so wrong,'' Hargrove said, his voice choking with  
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said no single event prompted the firing, which came after  
the Indians lost their third straight game to Boston. But 
Cleveland's inability to put the Red Sox away, and the complete 
disintegration of the Indians' pitching staff in the final three 
games, certainly factored into Hart's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm flabbergasted,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said. ``That's  
really a shocker. ... To me, he's a real good manager. There must 
have been underlying problems with the front office. That's the 
only thing I can think of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indians pitchers gave up 44 runs in the final three games,  
including a postseason-record 23 in Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, who was second-guessed for some of his pitching moves  
in Game 3, said he doesn't think he's being used as a scapegoat by 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't pitch in the 23-run game,'' Hargrove said. ``I don't  
think I've been set up as the fall guy. We just didn't get the job 
done in the postseason and somebody has to be responsible. And I'm 
responsible for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart admitted the Indians' failure to close out the Boston  
series was painful and the team needed to start ``a new era of 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a need for a new energy, a new voice, coming from the  
clubhouse,'' he said. ``This change will create a different 
atmosphere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said the team would immediately begin interviewing  
candidates to replace Hargrove. The Indians coaching staff, with 
the exception of bullpen coach Luis Isaac, has been given 
permission to explore other opportunities, Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said the search for a manager would begin immediately, but  
set no deadline for hiring someone. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the names that could surface are Indians first base and  
infield coach Brian Graham, batting instructor Charlie Manuel, 
former Detroit manager Buddy Bell and New York Yankees coaches 
Chris Chambliss and Willie Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, 49, had just completed his eighth full season with the  
Indians, and his 721 victories make him the second-winningest 
manager in club history, behind Lou Boudreau's 728. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been able to oversee the resurgence on the field of a  
proud franchise that was in a very sad state,'' Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Indians player, Hargrove became manager on July 6,  
1991. By 1995, Hargrove's Indians won 100 games and the first of 
five straight AL Central titles in their new home at Jacobs Field. 
In '95 and 1997, Cleveland won the AL championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hargrove's inability to get Cleveland its first World Series  
title since 1948 cost him his job. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Indians won the first two games against Boston,  
Cleveland appeared in control of the series. But Game 3 starter 
Dave Burba had to leave after four innings with a strained forearm, 
leading to some harshly criticized pitching moves by Hargrove. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I perfect?'' he said. ``No. I make mistakes like everybody  
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Cleveland easily won its division year after year,  
Hargrove was constantly second-guessed and many wondered why a team 
with so much talent couldn't win a World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of All-Star second baseman Roberto Alomar,  
Cleveland looked set this year for another World Series run. But 
injuries, another year of suspect pitching and some questionable 
moves left the Indians short. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a perception that managing the Cleveland  
Indians is a cushy job,'' Hargrove said. ``There's a lot more to do 
than just fill out the lineup card.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that wasn't always easy.  
</P>
<P>
	The grumblings about Hargrove increased in July, when he  
incorrectly filled out his team's lineup card, forcing Indians 
pitcher Charles Nagy to bat against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove even joked about the gaffe Friday. Asked if he had any  
regrets, Hargrove paused and said he couldn't think of any. 
</P>
<P>
	``Except for maybe checking that lineup card over one more  
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove enjoyed a good relationship with his players.  
Affectionately known as ``Grover'' around Cleveland, he was a 
fixture on local television and radio, not only as the manager but 
as a commercial pitchman. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also credited with comforting the Indians when pitchers  
Steve Olin and Tim Crews were killed in a boating accident during 
spring training in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	His tenure as manager was third in the major leagues behind  
Minnesota's Tom Kelly and Atlanta's Bobby Cox. Hargrove was signed 
with the Indians through 2000, with a club option for 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said Hart called him Friday afternoon and said he  
wanted to see his manager at Jacobs Field. As he drove to the 
ballpark, Hargrove said he prepared himself for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Hart, Hargrove said he first called his wife,  
Sharon, and then third-base coach Jeff Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoyed my time here,'' said Hargrove, who said he wants to  
manage again. ``We're still going to live in Cleveland. There may 
be some people who don't like that.''

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Ukraine To Step Up Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- An International Monetary Fund official on  
Friday urged Ukraine to step up its sluggish reform efforts after 
the presidential elections this month, a news report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed Shadman-Valavi met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery  
Pustovoitenko to discuss resuming the fund's $2.6 billion aid 
program for the former Soviet republic, the Interfax news agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has held off on releasing $90 million, saying the  
government needed to abolish some state subsidies and revoke a tax 
on sunflower seed exports, the fund's mission in Kiev said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has repeatedly delayed aid to Ukraine in previous years,  
accusing the government of not doing enough on reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine has received more than $900 million since the three-year  
aid package was approved last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukrainian officials have repeatedly stressed the need for IMF  
loans. They say that that without assistance from the IMF and the 
World Bank, Ukraine will have trouble meeting next year's foreign 
debt obligations of more than $3 billion.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian TV Dismisses Hundreds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- The Hungarian government announced a  
plan Friday to revamp state-run television that includes the sale 
of the station's buildings and firing more than 1,000 staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	A list with the names of 500 employees who will lose their jobs  
was posted Friday inside the TV station. Another 530 were given 
notice last month. 
</P>
<P>
	State TV is the last major socialist enterprise to face drastic  
budget cuts. It amassed a $50 million debt, including missed 
utility payments, broadcasting fees, social security payments and 
employee salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan will allow the State Privatization and Holding Agency  
to purchase the Hungarian State Television building for $13 
million, two-thirds of which will go toward severance payments and 
one-third for late social security payments, according to Istvan 
Stumpf, the minister in charge of the prime minister's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither the government nor I have ever interfered in the  
transformation of state television, but the government has a 
responsibility to prevent the total financial collapse of public 
television,'' Stumpf said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper closest to the government, Napi Magyarorszag,  
reported Friday that the dismissed workers are planning to sue 
their former employer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hungarian TV is experiencing the most critical months in its  
42-year history,'' Istvan Wisinger, president of the Hungarian 
Journalists Union and a longtime television presenter, wrote Friday 
in the daily Nepszabadsag. 
</P>
<P>
	Across a park from the U.S. Embassy in downtown Budapest, the  
huge TV building must be vacated by mid-December. It was built in 
the last century and housed the stock exchange until the communist 
takeover after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	If parliament approves the plan, state TV will receive the  
equivalent of $25 million from the privatization agency this year 
for other properties it owns. 
</P>
<P>
	Program production will move to a suburban location, according  
to the plan.

<HEADLINE> House Apt To Consider $1 Wage Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill to raise the minimum wage by $1 over  
three years and cut taxes by $35 billion to ease the impact on 
business is likely to reach the House floor this month, Speaker 
Dennis Hastert said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we will have a minimum wage bill up within the next  
couple of weeks,'' Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters. ``There needs 
to be some things that help small businesses survive as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The version gaining the most steam was introduced late Thursday  
by Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., and is co-sponsored by nine others 
including five Democrats. It would raise the current $5.15-an-hour 
minimum wage by 33 cents in April 2000 and 2001 and by 34 cents on 
April 1, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax cuts and regulatory relief would start in 2001, using  
projected non-Social Security budget surpluses. That package 
includes a five-year reduction in the estate tax, an increase in 
the business meal deduction from 50 percent to 60 percent, expanded 
pensions, making self-employed health insurance premiums 100 
percent deductible in 2001 instead of 2003 and extensions of 
welfare-to-work and other hiring-incentive business credits. 
</P>
<P>
	There is overwhelming support among Democrats and many  
Republicans to increase the minimum wage, but the GOP wants to put 
its own imprint on the measure by giving businesses some tax 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good-faith effort to find middle ground,'' Lazio  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats said the bipartisan bill's wage increase is too  
meager and that the tax package could run into trouble because it 
is not paid for with revenue-raising offsets. Reps. Charles Rangel, 
D-N.Y., and John Tanner, D-Tenn., are working on a smaller 
Democratic alternative that is paid for in part by closing abusive 
corporate tax shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need commonsense tax relief that goes directly to small  
businesses in this country, but it has got to be paid for,'' said 
Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., the minority whip. ``The Lazio bill is 
a tax package, disguised as small business relief, that will bust 
the budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also could run into some trouble among Republican  
leaders because it includes several tax provisions that were not 
part of the 10-year, $792 billion GOP tax cut vetoed by President 
Clinton. Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and 
Means Committee, says he will insist on hearings if such items 
remain in the bill, which could cripple its chances of passing this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be a limited package for the people most affected  
by the wage increase,'' said Archer, R-Texas. ``I don't think it 
ought to develop into a Christmas tree.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopefuls John McCain  
and Gary Bauer on Friday accused Vice President Al Gore of 
politicizing the Senate's defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after the Senate rejected the treaty Wednesday, Gore  
filmed a campaign ad criticizing the 51-48 vote. President Clinton 
also criticized the Senate's GOP majority for its handling of the 
treaty vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Both McCain, a U.S. senator from Arizona, and Bauer said Gore  
had politicized the treaty's defeat for his own benefit in the race 
for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who voted against the treaty, said Clinton and Gore were  
wrong to accuse the Senate of ``politicizing national security.'' 
He also said he knew of no effort by Gore to lobby senators to vote 
to ratify the test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a former senator, surely the vice president knows that it  
is best to support a treaty before it is actually voted on,'' 
McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer also said Clinton was trying to use the vote to aide  
Gore's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a desperate attempt to revive Al Gore's floundering  
campaign, Bill Clinton has politicized the Senate's nuclear test 
ban treaty vote,'' Bauer said. ``It is no coincidence that Al Gore 
was filming campaign commercials on the test ban within hours of 
the Senate vote.''

	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Campaigning in the home state of her  
husband's rival, Tipper Gore told reporters Friday that Bill 
Bradley's strong challenge for the Democratic presidential 
nomination was not a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore complimented Bradley, a former U.S. senator from New  
Jersey and a native of Crystal City, Mo. But she said she prefers 
to focus on Vice President Al Gore's accomplishments and his 23 
years of service to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been a very good vice president, doing the business of  
the country,'' Mrs. Gore said after addressing the 48th annual 
convention of the Girl Scouts of the USA. ``He's offering a real 
change that would work for working families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore earlier told the Girl Scouts she fondly remembered her  
scouting days, particularly the projects and camping. 
</P>

the homeless and get involved in their communities.

	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Delaware's presidential primary next year  
will attract more candidates than magazine publisher Steve Forbes.

	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner, plans to run  
hard in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has had a virtual monopoly on primary campaigning here  
since the state created a primary vote in 1992, but Bush has 
announced he will visit on Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	His appearance is expected to give some relevance to the Feb. 8  
GOP primary, now third in the nation behind Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush visit also signals the settling of a feud that simmered  
between Delaware and New Hampshire these last two primary seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Delaware's law dictates that its state-run primary fall four  
days after New Hampshire's. But New Hampshire politicians, 
protective of their status as first in the nation, has warned 
candidates not to campaign in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last primary, everybody opted out of coming here,  
except for Forbes,'' said W. Laird Stabler Jr., chairman of the 
Bush campaign in Delaware.

<HEADLINE> Source Says Starr Will Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 39-year-old assistant to Kenneth Starr will  
take over the final phase of the independent counsel's 
controversial investigation that led to the impeachment of 
President Clinton, say sources familiar with Starr's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr will formally step aside next week and be replaced by  
Robert Ray, an assistant U.S. attorney who worked for Independent 
Counsel Donald Smaltz in the probe of ex-Agriculture Secretary Mike 
Espy, say the sources, who are allies of Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's somewhat of a dubious proposition that someone involved  
both in the Espy investigation and the Starr operation'' is 
``getting a promotion,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of three federal appeals court judges that selects  
independent counsels chose Ray after interviewing a number of 
people inside Starr's office as possible successors. The judges 
told the prosecutor's office of their plans this week, said the 
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	That cleared the way for Starr, who has hinted for months his  
desire to step down, to return to private law practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office declined to comment Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Ray will try to wrap up an investigation that has ranged from  
allegedly fraudulent land deals in Arkansas to impeachment charges 
of presidential perjury and obstruction of justice in the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he is relatively young, Ray has extensive experience as a  
prosecutor. He was an assistant U.S. attorney in the southern 
district of New York starting in 1989, supervising and 
participating in a number of public corruption and organized crime 
prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to work for Smaltz's office in 1995, winning convictions  
against a Tyson Foods executive and a Tyson lobbyist in the probe 
of illegal gifts to Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office has two pending investigative matters:  
</P>
<P>
	--An alleged attempt to influence the testimony of presidential  
accuser Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Possible false statements regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
role in the purge of White House travel office employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Starr's successor must produce a final report on  
the Whitewater scandal -- a document that could prove to be a 
political headache for Mrs. Clinton if she follows through on plans 
to run next year for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	During Starr's tenure, his office convicted 14 people, including  
the Clintons' Whitewater business partners, Jim and Susan McDougal, 
then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, who resigned his office, and 
former associate attorney general Webster Hubbell, the first lady's 
former law partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's investigation of the Lewinsky scandal -- the president's  
affair and subsequent cover-up -- led to the first presidential 
impeachment since 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr's long tenure was marred by questions over whether he  
conducted his investigation properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The starting point for the Clinton White House's public war with  
Starr's office was January 1996 when the prosecutor subpoenaed Mrs. 
Clinton before a federal grand jury to explain how her long-sought 
law firm billing records had mysteriously resurfaced inside the 
White House family residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about the first lady focus on her legal work on the  
Castle Grande real estate venture in Arkansas co-owned by Jim 
McDougal, and businessman Seth Ward, Hubbell's father-in-law. 
Federal regulators concluded Castle Grande was riddled with insider 
transactions and land flips that bank examiners concluded lost 
money for McDougal's collapsing savings and loan. The Whitewater 
convictions of the McDougals and Tucker underscored the fraud at 
Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's legal work -- none of which she says she remembers  
-- could prove an explosive issue if she decides to take on New York 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in a Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Lewinsky affair, Clinton's lawyer accused Starr's office  
of leaking grand jury material to the news media. Complaints about 
the conduct of Starr's prosecutors in the Lewinsky investigation 
poured into the Justice Department from Democrats on Capitol Hill 
as impeachment loomed late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Whitewater portion of Starr's probe, Susan McDougal said  
Starr's investigators tried to get her to tell lies that falsely 
implicated the Clintons in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The constant attacks took their toll. Public opposition to Starr  
soared. The prosecutor said the campaign against him infected the 
judicial process, leading to deadlocked juries that refused to 
convict. Starr gave up on prosecuting Susan McDougal, whose 
cooperation he never was able to get. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's impeachment by the House in the Lewinsky scandal was  
followed by acquittal in the Senate.

	Or the Atlanta Braves return to the city they left 47 years ago  
and face the Boston Red Sox, who look to break ``The Curse'' and 
win their first title since 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe a rematch of the series in 1986 when the New York Mets --  
and Bill Buckner -- ended Boston's chances. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's not even taking into account the most likely scenario  
-- a rematch of the 1996 World Series when the New York Yankees beat 
the Braves in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter who makes it because there's such appealing  
clubs and each has something different to offer,'' said Fox analyst 
Tim McCarver, who did last year's World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarver would have been the ideal person to do this year's  
finale, especially if the Mets get past the Braves and face the 
Yankees. He was fired by the Mets before the season after 16 years 
as the team's analyst and worked Yankees games instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But fans won't hear McCarver once the Series begins. Instead,  
it'll be NBC's Bob Costas and analyst Joe Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan, who worked an amazing seven games in seven days in seven  
different cities to begin the postseason, has clicked with Costas 
this season after admittedly struggling a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the duo went into the League Championship Series  
without having worked together all season. Morgan also works for 
ESPN and was used to partner Jon Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an adjustment for me working on both networks,'' Morgan  
said. ``NBC is more traditional baseball while both ESPN and Fox 
have more pizazz and color. Jon and I take more chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ESPN agreed to allow Costas to work two regular-season games  
with Morgan this year as a tuneup to the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	It helped ESPN get a big name for a couple of telecasts -- and it  
benefited NBC, too. The viewers also win because Costas and Morgan 
are in sync, something lacking in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't have to get reacquainted on the air,'' NBC  
producer David Neal said. ``Last year was not an ideal situation. I 
can't overstate the importance of those two games on ESPN. Now Bob 
and Joe have picked right up and we have one of those rare 
situations where you can't miss -- any of the four matchups you get 
are all great.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	 *FOOTBALL PUSH:* Even the rash of injuries to NFL stars can't  
stop the ratings from climbing. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN has made the biggest jump, a 27 percent increase from last  
season. Fox is up 11 percent and CBS increased 13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' was up 13 percent before the  
Jacksonville Jaguars lackluster win over the New York Jets. But 
that game, going up against Game 5 of the Red Sox game against the 
Indians, fell 38 percent from last year's Packers-Vikings game. 
</P>
<P>
	``MNF'' is still up for the season, but barely -- at 1 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	The pregame shows have also done well. Fox is up 10 percent; CBS  
ahead 5 percent and ESPN up 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	 *LIVE BAIT:* The first live network fishing championship is  
about three weeks away and Fox has made a change. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Buck is in. Terry Bradshaw is out.  
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Bradshaw, who was originally going to be a co-host  
with baseball analyst Bob Brenly, will still do some taped 
segments. However, Brenly and Buck will share the hosting duties. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know nearly as much compared to the guys in this  
competition,'' said Brenly, who took up the sport about 10 years 
ago. ``It's like the weekend softball player going to the Yankees 
game. I'm just a novice fisherman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox decided to scrap the idea of taking Bradshaw away from its  
rating-winning football pregame show for a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Terry figured out fishing is not hand-to-hand combat,'' Brenly  
said. ``Terry would have probably jumped out of the boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for the show came from Fox sports president David Hill.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's an avid fisherman and is the inspiration,'' Fox's  
executive producer Ed Goren said of the Nov. 7 telecast. ``This is 
a very complicated technical shoot -- more so than a golf tournament 
where you have to be everywhere. This covers more area and you 
can't cable it.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Officer Charged With Marine's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine captain who allegedly pushed  
his troops too hard during a conditioning hike in the summer heat 
was charged with negligent homicide in the death of a corporal. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal charges resulting from deaths during military training  
exercises are rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Victor A. Arana, 28, of DuPage County, Ill., was accused  
of marching his unit too fast with not enough time for breaks. 
Investigators said his handling of the unit violated training 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Cpl. Giuseppe Leto, 21, of New Milford, Conn., died after  
completing the eight-mile hike at Camp Lejeune on July 8. Camp 
Lejeune spokesman Capt. James Rich said Friday that temperatures 
were 80 to 85 degrees when the hike began. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being charged with negligent homicide, Arana was charged  
with dereliction of duty and failing to obey a lawful order. If 
convicted, he could get more than 3 1/2 years in prison and be 
dismissed from the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigator's report, based on interviews with 30 Marines  
who were on the hike, said Leto was showing signs of heat-related 
stress -- vomiting, dry heaving, excessive sweating -- three miles 
into the hike, but refused to board a vehicle carrying Marines who 
were unable to finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Leto wandered away and collapsed. He was found  
unconscious nearly two hours later, and was pronounced dead on the 
way to the base hospital. Rich said Leto's death certificate 
described his case as probably ``heat-related.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nighttime hike was part of the training in weapons and  
combat techniques that Marines undergo at Camp Lejeune's School of 
Infantry. Another Marine died at the base during a field exercise 
in August when the temperature reached 90, but no charges were 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	In another deadly exercise, three Army officers and six enlisted  
men received only reprimands when four Army Ranger trainees died of 
exposure after spending hours in chilly, chest-deep water in swamps 
at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., in February 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, a Marine lieutenant was convicted of dereliction of  
duty for the death of an enlisted man who was left behind during a 
training exercise in the Mojave Desert in California. He was 
sentenced to four months in the brig and dismissal from the 
Marines. Two sergeants were convicted of negligence and reduced in 
rank. 
</P>
<P>
	In a notorious case in April 1956, a Marine drill instructor was  
court-martialed after six recruits drowned during a night hike at 
the boot camp at Parris Island, S.C. The case stirred a national 
debate over military training.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Accused of Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A group of Asian workers is suing Boeing, lodging  
racial discrimination complaints similar to those of black Boeing 
workers who recently settled for $15 million in a lawsuit against 
the aerospace company. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine current and former Boeing employees are seeking  
class-action status and alleging that Boeing denied them 
promotions, laid them off unfairly and failed to stop coworkers and 
supervisors from making racist remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the company had not seen the  
lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in King County Superior Court in 
Seattle, and could not comment specifically on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``A company the size of Boeing is not immune to the improper  
actions of individuals,'' Conte said. ``Boeing does not tolerate 
discrimination or intimidation. When allegations are substantiated, 
we take action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs include Pakistani, Indian, Iranian and Vietnamese  
engineers and technicians. Khalil Nouri, an Afghanistan native and 
one of the plaintiffs, said Asian Americans fill 25 percent of the 
technical and engineering jobs at Boeing but 98 percent of the top 
two levels of those jobs are filled by white employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The promotions of whites are advancing at a far faster pace  
... Asians are going out the door at a far faster pace than the 
whites,'' said Nouri, a former tool design engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a judge approved a $15 million settlement between  
Boeing and black workers who claimed that they were passed over 
from promotion, harassed and retaliated against when they 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of that settlement, Conte said, Boeing is implementing a  
plan to improve promotion practices. The plan benefits all Boeing 
workers, he said.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Arena Problems Widespread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Officials of a new civic arena  
acknowledged Friday that structural problems are more serious than 
initially thought and could require repairs on nearly all the 
upper-deck support beams. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelations came even as the arena board chairman pledged  
that the $80 million Alltel Arena will be open for the home debut 
of its minor league hockey team in just one week. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety concerns already forced the cancellation of the  
18,000-seat arena's scheduled inaugural event -- a sold-out 
professional basketball game Tuesday. Arena officials said Friday 
the game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Washington Wizards will 
not be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	A construction problem that surfaced when one beam cracked now  
appears to be a pattern throughout the upper deck, said Ron Pierce, 
president of Garver Engineers. Of 11 concrete beams tested as of 
Friday afternoon, all had internal metal reinforcement bars in the 
wrong place and at the wrong angle. Eight more beams remained to be 
tested with an electronic imagining device. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all the beams that have been imaged thus far, we're finding  
virtually the same condition,'' Pierce said at a news conference 
inside the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The defective beams, which could crack under stress, are to be  
braced with metal posts similar to ones installed Tuesday on the 
beam that cracked, Pierce said. But the extra posts could block the 
views of some fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce, who called the problem ``a little extraordinary,'' said  
it's possible that all the beams will need to be fixed. But he said 
that could be completed by the middle of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	At a cost of $9,500 per beam, the tab on repairing 19 beams  
could come to $180,500, said Gus Vratsinas, chief executive officer 
of the Vratsinas Construction Co., a partner in the joint venture 
building the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena board chairman Bob Russell has said that taxpayers will  
not bear the burden for the repairs, but it still was undetermined 
who will pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arkansas RiverBlades are to play host to the New Orleans  
Brass on Oct. 23 in their East Coast Hockey League home debut. 
Workers were making preparations Friday to lay the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said all seats -- the upper deck included -- will be ready  
for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have RiverBlades hockey tickets for the 23rd, and my family  
and I will be there,'' Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Little Rock Mayor Patrick Henry Hays said he planned to  
sit in the upper deck for the hockey game. But he added: ``If the 
facility is not safe, the home game will be canceled, and every 
other event will be canceled.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Fire Manager Mike Hargrove </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Mike Hargrove, who managed the Cleveland  
Indians to two World Series appearances but failed to win a title, 
was fired Friday following his team's latest collapse, a team 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians were to announce the dismissal at an afternoon news  
conference, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The firing comes three days after the Indians lost their third  
straight game to the Boston Red Sox to end the season. Cleveland 
won the first two games in the opening round of the AL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove had just completed his eighth season with the Indians,  
and his 721 wins make him the second-winningest manager in club 
history behind Lou Boudreau with 728. 
</P>
<P>
	A former player with the Indians, Hargrove became their manager  
on July 6, 1991. He led the club to five straight AL central titles 
and two league pennants after the Indians moved to Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hargrove's inability to get Cleveland its first World Series  
title since 1948 cost him his job. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Indians won the first two games against Boston,  
Cleveland appeared in control of the series. But Game 3 starter 
Dave Burba had to leave after four innings with a strained forearm, 
leading to some harshly criticized pitching moves by Hargrove. 
</P>
<P>
	With the score 3-3, Hargrove allowed Jaret Wright to start the  
seventh inning, even though he had already allowed three runs and 
was having control problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright walked the leadoff hitter and hit another before Hargrove  
brought in left-hander Ricardo Rincon, who got two quick outs but 
walked a batter to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of using one of his experienced right-handers, Hargrove  
let Rincon face right-hander John Valentin, who drove in the 
go-ahead runs with a double. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove explained that he was saving his right-handers for a  
possible Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Cleveland easily won its division year after year,  
Hargrove was constantly second-guessed and many wondered why a team 
with so much talent couldn't win a World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Once this season, Hargrove incorrectly filled out his team's  
lineup card, adding to the grumblings. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Hargrove had a good relationship with his players and was  
a fixture on local television and radio, not only as the manager 
but a commercial pitchman. 
</P>
<P>
	His tenure as manager was third in the major leagues behind  
Minnesota's Tom Kelly and Atlanta's Bobby Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of All-Star second baseman Roberto Alomar,  
Cleveland looked set this year for another World Series run. But 
injuries, another year of suspect pitching and some questionable 
moves left the Indians short yet again.

<HEADLINE> Disney's Imagineering Head Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kenneth Wong, head of Walt Disney's famous  
Imagineering division, is leaving the company to pursue 
``independent'' opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale-based Walt Disney Imagineering is, among other things,  
the arm of the Walt Disney Co. that creates all Disney resorts, 
theme parks and real estate developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to pursue his personal interests, and we at Disney  
wish him well,'' Paul Pressler, president of Walt Disney 
Attractions, said in a statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time is right for me to explore independent, creative  
endeavors,'' Wong said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Wong joined Disney in 1991 as senior vice-president for Disney  
Development Company and became head of Imagineering when the 
divisions merged in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He will remain available as an advisor, Disney said.  
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Sotto, one of Imagineering's top designers, and Jake  
Winebaum, head of Disney's Internet operations, recently left the 
company for Internet ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Wong, 44, told the Los Angeles Times that he also is interested  
in the Internet, in combination with ``art, design, technology and 
real estate'' but declined to be specific. He also said he is 
leaving on friendly terms with Pressler. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Wong, the ``Imagineers'' developed Animal Kingdom,  
DisneyQuest, The New Amsterdam Theatre, Times Square Studios, and 
two Disney cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, however, Wong scolded the division for embarrassing  
delays in three high-profile projects. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to 2,000 employees, Wong said the division set  
unrealistic schedules because it underestimated the risk of 
problems with the Disney Magic cruise ship, Disneyland's Rocket 
Rods and the Test Track thrill ride at Florida's Walt Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney also announced several other personnel moves Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Pain Control Raising Legal Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The man was dying of lung cancer. For a while,  
morphine controlled his severe chest pain. But eventually, 
inevitably, the cancer began literally suffocating him. His panic 
grew as his breathing labored. 
</P>
<P>
	More morphine could relieve that horrible feeling of smothering,  
but with a risk: It also could further reduce respiration. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor gave his patient enough morphine to ease his  
suffering. Later that day, the man died peacefully, his family at 
his side. 
</P>
<P>
	How much pain medication to give terminally ill patients, when  
the medication itself might hasten death, long has been a quandary. 
Many doctors are so fearful of being accused of overprescribing 
narcotics or hastening death that patients suffer. Indeed, a study 
last year found one in four elderly cancer patients in nursing 
homes received no treatment for daily pain. 
</P>
<P>
	That trend is starting to change. At least 15 states recently  
have passed laws ensuring doctors' licenses won't be revoked for 
prescribing powerful controlled substances like morphine for severe 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization that accredits hospitals approved standards in  
August declaring that all patients have a right to proper pain 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	And last month, Oregon's medical board became the first to ever  
discipline a doctor for undertreating pain. Among the complaints 
was that the doctor only provided Tylenol for a dying cancer 
patient's pain. 
</P>
<P>
	But some doctors fear that legislation pending in Congress could  
reverse that progress. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial legislation would formally declare prescribing  
controlled substances to alleviate pain a legitimate medical 
decision even if those drugs increase risk of death. Pain experts 
praise the protection as a crucial step to improve patient care. 
</P>
<P>
	But that same bill, the Pain Relief Promotion Act, also enters a  
minefield, by banning controlled substances for the purpose of 
physician-assisted suicide. Take strong steps to control pain, the 
bill says, but don't intentionally hasten death. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, assisted suicide is legal in only one state, Oregon. The  
federal legislation would essentially overturn Oregon's state law. 
Many in Oregon say Congress should not, as Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., 
put it, ``throw the votes of our citizens in the trash can.'' The 
bill's author, Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., counters that the issue 
is no different than Congress intervening if a state legalized 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Oregon fight aside, some physicians -- including those  
opposed to assisted suicide -- raise a bigger health concern: That 
judging whether prescribing decisions are proper or improper could 
cause a backlash against pain treatment. Would a case like the lung 
cancer patient -- who needed morphine even if it hastened death -- be 
questioned? Should the doctor be scrutinized if a patient is sent 
home with a week's worth of medication and then overdoses? 
</P>
<P>
	The average doctor might say, ``I should use less controlled  
substances,'' worries pain expert Dr. James Rathmell of the 
University of Vermont. ``That's not what the legislation is 
intended to do at all, but how do we prevent it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	One key, Rathmell told a Senate committee this week, is proper  
training and oversight of the federal officials who would enforce 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are struggling with how to ensure that balance. The  
issue is ``one of the most difficult subjects this committee has 
ever dealt with,'' said Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt. A version of the 
bill has passed a key House committee, but Jeffords' Senate health 
committee is unlikely to have time to vote on the issue this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, the controversy is raising public awareness of  
proper pain treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	For the vast majority of terminally ill patients, pain can be  
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would plead for better pain control,'' Rathmell advised.  
``Focus their physician's attention on pain being the issue, not 
preservation of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specialists like Rathmell can advise doctors without extensive  
training in pain treatment. As for that other excuse doctors 
sometimes use -- that narcotics are addictive -- research shows 
that's not a big issue when treating intractable pain, especially 
if someone is weeks or months from death. 
</P>
<P>
	Rathmell recalled his lung cancer patient: ``To see a peaceful  
death, which is what we're all looking for -- it would be a shame 
not to have helped with that when we know we could.''

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Economy Seen Weakening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine's economy continued to show more  
signs of decline, with officials reporting today a 23.3 percent 
decrease in the country's foreign trade volume in January-August 
1999 from the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall volume of foreign trade stood at $14.4 billion over  
the first eight months of 1999. Exports dropped 16.7 percent and 
imports went down 29.8 percent, the State Statistics Committee 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the committee announced that the former Soviet  
republic posted a 1.7 percent decline in gross domestic product in 
the first nine months of 1999 compared with the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine has experienced a steady economic downfall since  
becoming independent in 1991, failing to implement market reforms 
fully. The economy was further hurt last year by the financial 
crisis in Russia.

trouble spots around the world, including Kosovo and East Timor, 
today won the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Medecins Sans Frontieres, as the group is known internationally,  
has more than 2,000 medical professionals working in 80 countries. 
It was recognized for its ``pioneering humanitarian work on several 
continents,'' the Norwegian Nobel Committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since its foundation in the early 1970s, Doctors Without  
Borders has adhered to the fundamental principle that all disaster 
victims, whether the disaster is natural or human in origin, have a 
right to professional assistance given as quickly and as 
efficiently as possible,'' the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``National boundaries and political circumstances or sympathies  
must have no influence on who is to receive humanitarian help. By 
maintaining a high degree of independence, the organization has 
succeeded in living up to these ideals,'' the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	``By intervening so rapidly, Doctors Without Borders calls  
public attention to humanitarian catastrophes, and by pointing to 
the causes of such catastrophes, the organization helps to form 
bodies of public opinion opposed to violations and abuses of 
power,'' the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was founded in Paris in 1971 by a small group of  
idealistic French doctors disillusioned with the neutral policies 
of the Red Cross. The group quickly became known as ``the French 
doctors,'' and the first wave of volunteers made their mark in 
helping the starving and ill victims of the war in Biafra. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nearly 30 years since the group was founded, the  
organization's doctors and volunteers have traveled to disaster 
areas in Nicaragua, Vietnam, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, 
Rwanda, Kosovo and now Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm deeply moved, and I'm thinking of all the people who died  
without aid, of all those who died waiting for someone to knock on 
their door,'' the group's founder, Bernard Kouchner, said on France 
Info radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I proud? No. My feeling right now is that I'm very  
emotional, and perhaps, aware of the political importance of this 
prize. There have been detractors, people who laughed at us, but 
that's normal. They didn't understand,'' said Kouchner, who now 
serves as the top U.N. representative in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-member awards committee works in secrecy during its  
five or six meetings a year, and refuses to comment on or release 
candidates' names. This year it said only that there were 136 
nominees and the winner was selected on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Some names were known because those making the nominations  
announce their candidates for the prize, which includes a cash 
award of $960,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In past years, favorites have emerged from world events and the  
committee's wish to nurture ongoing peace efforts. Last year, the 
Northern Ireland peace process was at a key junction and the prize 
went to Protestant David Trimble and Catholic John Hume. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 prize went to American Jody Williams and the  
International Campaign to Ban Landmines, the 1994 award to 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin 
and Shimon Peres, and the 1993 prize was awarded to South Africa's 
Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes, first given in 1901, are always presented on the  
Dec. 10 anniversary of the death of their creator, Swedish 
industrialist Alfred Nobel. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, and 
the others in Stockholm.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Ukraine To Step Up Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- An International Monetary Fund official on  
Friday urged Ukraine to step up its sluggish reform efforts after 
the presidential elections this month, a news report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed Shadman-Valavi met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery  
Pustovoitenko to discuss resuming the fund's $2.6 billion aid 
program for the former Soviet republic, the Interfax news agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has held off on releasing $90 million, saying the  
government needed to abolish some state subsidies and revoke a tax 
on sunflower seed exports, the fund's mission in Kiev said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has repeatedly delayed aid to Ukraine in previous years,  
accusing the government of not doing enough on reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine has received more than $900 million since the three-year  
aid package was approved last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukrainian officials have repeatedly stressed the need for IMF  
loans. They say that that without assistance from the IMF and the 
World Bank, Ukraine will have trouble meeting next year's foreign 
debt obligations of more than $3 billion.

<HEADLINE> Drug Charge Against Boxer Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Former heavyweight boxing champion  
Tommy Morrison won't lose his Corvette to the impound lot as a 
result of a decision to reduce one of the drug charges pending 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison, a former World Boxing Organization champion, was  
arrested last month on numerous drug and driving charges, including 
a felony charge of possession of cocaine with the intent to 
distribute it. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Terry Jones said Thursday that the charge was reduced  
to possession of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could not be established that he had any intent to  
deliver,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The omission of the intent to deliver allegation saves  
Morrison's 1999 Corvette from being impounded, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison is to be arraigned Monday in Washington County Circuit  
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the cocaine possession charge, Morrison also is charged  
with simultaneous possession of drugs and firearms, being a felon 
in possession of a firearm, possession of drug paraphernalia, 
misdemeanor possession of marijuana and driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Other misdemeanor charges of careless driving and failure to  
provide proof of insurance likely will be handled in Fayetteville 
Municipal Court. A city court clerk said Morrison's file had not 
been received. 
</P>
<P>
	Fayetteville police stopped Morrison's car Sept. 17 after  
noticing him driving erratically. Police said the guns and drugs 
were discovered during a search of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 10, Morrison received a two-year suspended sentence for  
drunken driving in Tulsa County, Okla., after pleading guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, a Delaware County, Okla., jury convicted Morrison of  
driving under the influence and other charges related to a 
chain-reaction traffic accident that injured three people. He was 
ordered to spend time in treatment. He also avoided jail time on 
charges of drunken driving and speeding in Kansas in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison became the WBO's heavyweight champion in 1993 by  
defeating George Foreman. He had 40 knockouts during his career, 
the last in 1996 -- just after testing positive for the virus that 
causes AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Bulls' Armstrong To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Bulls guard B.J. Armstrong will have  
surgery on his left knee and could be sidelined two to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, a member of the 1991-93 championship teams, signed  
with the Bulls as a free agent in August. An 11-year veteran, he 
has had operations on both knees. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you keep playing and you keep jumping and bouncing and  
running and cutting, you know you only have so many jumps,'' he 
said. ``When they told me that at 18, I didn't understand. But at 
32 I understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who wanted to avoid the arthroscopic surgery, was  
able to practice Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I still felt the irritation,'' he said. ``I don't know if  
I can do that for 82 games with that irritation there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Toni Kukoc and guard Randy Brown also have been hurting  
during the past week of two-a-day practices. Kukoc sat out 
Wednesday morning's practice with a swollen right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls coach Tim Floyd has no plans to lighten the workload.  
</P>
<P>
	``We do have an awful lot of young guys who need reps and  
there's no other way to get them,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Man Fined for Selling Financial Info </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A state judge has ordered a New York information  
broker to pay $500,000 after finding the broker obtained and sold 
private financial information of Massachusetts residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Easton, 45, and his company, Source One Associates of  
Poughquag, N.Y., were ordered to pay the civil penalty by Superior 
Court Judge Gordon Doerfer, the attorney general's office said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge found that Easton and his company had violated the  
state's consumer protection, financial privacy and fair credit 
reporting laws, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Clements, an assistant attorney general who handled the  
case, said similar cases were pending in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really the first time a judge, having heard all the  
evidence, has made it very clear this conduct is illegal,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When contacted in New York, Easton referred comment to his  
Boston lawyer, Steve O'Malley, who didn't return a telephone 
message Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bench trial in the case lasted one month and ended Sept. 20.  
Doerfer then took it under advisement, issuing his verdict 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This office will not stand for anyone violating the most basic  
financial privacy rights of consumers,'' Attorney General Thomas 
Reilly said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clements said two ``asset search'' firms, which might be hired,  
for example, by lawyers seeking information about a spouse's assets 
in a divorce case, hired Easton to get information about people's 
bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with the name and Social Security number of a person,  
Easton would check their credit reports and try to identify where 
their accounts were, Clements alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Clements said, Easton would use ``false statements,''  
claiming to be a fellow bank employee or the account holder 
himself, for example, to get information. The judge found at least 
1,000 violations, Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear you can't use false statements and other trickery  
to obtain this information from banks,'' Clements said. ``And it's 
clear that consumers and banks view this information as private and 
it is, in fact, private.''

<HEADLINE> Seinfeld Creator Gets HBO Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Larry David, so misunderstood.  
</P>
<P>
	A funny guy? Sure. ``Seinfeld,'' which he co-created and often  
wrote, proved it. So does ``Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' 
his HBO special premiering Sunday at 10 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	But what about the accompanying stigma -- that he's  
mega-neurotic, hypersensitive or simply odd? Where does that kind 
of nonsense get started? 
</P>
<P>
	If a recent interview proves anything, Larry David is in fine  
psychic fettle. For example, even after his triumph with 
``Seinfeld,'' there's no swelled head for him. ``I maybe have just 
a little more confidence in my work now,'' he allows, ``but not 
that much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor has his ``Seinfeld'' payday -- a reported $242 million -- made  
a material difference in his world. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do have thoughts occasionally like, 'Holy cow! I have a  
lot of money!''' he admits. ``But it's not like, 'I must be 
great.''' 
</P>
<P>
	At age 51, David knows exactly who he is: the same as he was a  
long time ago, plus years of experience to seal it. ``I really 
don't think that anything about me has changed since I was, I don't 
know ... 12?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps his biggest life change: the onset of baldness.  
</P>
<P>
	``But I like how I've taken to it,'' he declares with a  
mirthless laugh. ``No toupees. No beard to offset it. I'm quite 
proud of how I've adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I ever did for it was try the Chinese Bald  
Cure. We did an episode about it on the show.'' (That would be 
``Seinfeld'' No. 25, ``The Tape.'') 
</P>
<P>
	``But it actually happened. We asked the guy bringing the  
Chinese food to call China on the phone from my apartment, after we 
tried and couldn't get anybody who spoke English. And the stuff 
came. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worked great.''  
</P>
<P>
	Consider that last remark an exercise of comic license. And  
expect more on ``Curb Your Enthusiasm.'' David's first brush with 
TV since the May 1998 ``Seinfeld'' finale, this is a very funny 
special about Larry David putting together a Larry David special. 
</P>
<P>
	During ``Curb,'' he kvetches to his manager, frets to his wife,  
stews during meetings at HBO, and wonders why he said OK to cameras 
stalking him to get it all. 
</P>
<P>
	On the program, David is a hybrid form of volatile  
impassiveness, someone capable of juggling stubbornness with 
cautious indecision. Meanwhile, as any ``Seinfeld'' fan would 
expect, he has a tendency to deconstruct life's every passing 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	After waiting for his manager to get off the phone, David lodges  
a complaint about the office-greeting policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know I'm in the room, how come you don't pick up your head  
and say, 'One second?''' David asks. ``All you have to do is: `One 
second.''' His right hand cradles an invisible receiver. ``When I'm 
on the phone, I go, `One second.' Or you don't have to SAY `One 
second,' just --'' he hoists the index finger of his other hand -- 
``like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beside such telling glimpses, this ``mockumentary'' includes  
insights from David's friends, Jason Alexander, Richard Lewis and, 
of course, Jerry Seinfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	Best of all, it captures him doing stand up for the first time  
in 9 1/2 years (who knew!), seen in snatches from club dates he books 
to steel himself for his big HBO concert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who do you think has more freedom -- the married men in America  
or the single men in Communist China?'' he asks the room. ``I gotta 
go for the single guy in Communist China, no contest. I'm a married 
guy in America. I can leave the country -- but I can't leave my 
house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was David's real-life itch to get back onstage that led to  
this ``Curb Your Enthusiasm'' spoof: Somebody suggested he should 
film his practice sets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I very reluctantly said, `Oh ... OK,''' recalls David, sipping  
his nonfat decaf cappuccino. ``That's exactly the way I make up my 
mind to do anything: a reluctant OK. I never go, 'Yeah! Great idea! 
Let's do it!' Never. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I thought, `Well, maybe this needs some narrative around  
the stand up.' It became more and more of a comedy film, and less 
and less of a stand-up film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David says he made seven or eight unannounced appearances at  
clubs in Los Angeles and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	And how did it feel? ``I was as anxious as I was 10 years ago.''  
</P>
<P>
	So why did he want to go back? Among comedy cognoscenti, David  
is as well-known for his hatred of stand up as for his mastery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hated it and loved it, all at the same time,'' he explains.  
``When it goes badly, you have one of two attitudes: either, `Well, 
everyone is stupid, but I'm great,' or, 'People are really smart 
and I stink, I have no talent, what am I doing?' 
</P>
<P>
	``But when it goes well, everyone is brilliant and I'm the  
greatest thing on the planet!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words: David doesn't hesitate to assume that the  
consensus of everyone on Earth is reflected by 100 people in a 
comedy club. ``They're a very representative group,'' he insists. 
``A scientific sample.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The funny thing is, he's got proof.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Hampshire Gov. To Endorse Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Gov. Jeanne Shaheen will endorse Vice  
President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination, her 
spokeswoman says. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen will announce her support Monday at an event in Dover,  
Pamela Walsh said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement had been widely expected -- Shaheen's husband,  
William Shaheen, is director of Gore's New Hampshire campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes at a time when Gore's rival, former New  
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, is gaining on him in national polls and 
has pulled even with him in New Hampshire, which will hold the 
first presidential primary, on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll this week had Gore 12 percentage  
points ahead of Bradley nationally, down from a 33-point spread in 
a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in mid-September.

<HEADLINE>  Doctors' Group Wins Nobel Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Doctors Without Borders, which  
revolutionized private aid by asserting a right to intervene in any 
country to treat the wounded, sick and starving, won the 1999 Nobel 
Peace Prize today. 
</P>
<P>
	The volunteer organization -- officially called by its French  
name Medecins Sans Frontieres -- has played a major role in Africa, 
as well as war zones throughout the world, breaking down barriers 
to reach those in need. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking of all the people who died without aid, of all  
those who died waiting for someone to knock on their door,'' 
Bernard Kouchner, one of the group's founders who now serves as the 
top U.N. representative in Kosovo, told France Info radio after 
hearing of the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Kouchner was one of 10 idealistic French doctors who set up the  
group in 1971 because of their growing frustration at the quiet 
neutrality of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors Without Borders ``has adhered to the fundamental  
principle that all disaster victims, whether the disaster is 
natural or human in origin, have a right to professional assistance 
given as quickly and as efficiently as possible,'' the Norwegian 
Nobel Committee said in announcing the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors Without Borders has more than 2,000 medical  
professionals working in 80 countries. They hold as one of their 
most important tenets a ``right to intervene'' regardless of 
international policy toward a government. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been detractors, people who laughed at us, but  
that's normal,'' Kouchner said. ``They didn't understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders does place blame --  
on armed groups, harsh regimes, or governments -- for the suffering 
it finds. 
</P>
<P>
	Many, if not all of the doctors, including Kouchner, were born  
after World War II and were highly aware of the role Nazi death 
camp physicians played during the Holocaust. They were determined 
to change the role of doctors in wartime. 
</P>
<P>
	When Doctors Without Borders began sending physicians to  
conflicts, there were very few independent, privately funded 
humanitarian aid groups working worldwide. The group's actions have 
since been imitated by other organizations and have set the tone 
for independent humanitarian aid work. 
</P>
<P>
	In its nearly 30 years of existence, the organization's doctors  
and volunteers have traveled to disaster areas in Nicaragua, 
Vietnam, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Kosovo and now 
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``National boundaries and political circumstances or sympathies  
must have no influence on who is to receive humanitarian help. By 
maintaining a high degree of independence, the organization has 
succeeded in living up to these ideals,'' the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-member awards committee works in secrecy during its  
five or six meetings a year, and refuses to comment on or release 
candidates' names. This year it said only that there were 136 
nominees and the winner was selected on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Some names were known because those making the nominations  
announce their candidates for the prize, which includes a cash 
award of $960,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In past years, favorites have emerged from world events and the  
committee's wish to nurture ongoing peace efforts. Last year, the 
Northern Ireland peace process was at a key junction and the prize 
went to Protestant David Trimble and Catholic John Hume. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 prize went to American Jody Williams and the  
International Campaign to Ban Landmines, the 1994 award to 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin 
and Shimon Peres, and the 1993 prize was awarded to South Africa's 
Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a peace prize went exclusively to a humanitarian  
field organization was in 1981, when the laureate was the Office of 
the U.N. Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of Doctors Without Borders was expected to  
generate little controversy. Before the announcement, speculation 
that a Chinese dissident, such as exiled pro-democracy activists 
Wei Jingsheng or Wang Dan, might win brought a furious response 
from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	China called the men criminals, and warned against giving them  
the prestigious award. 
</P>
<P>
	After the winners were revealed, there was only praise for the  
humanitarian doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor for France,'' French President Jacques Chirac  
said from Tampere, Finland. ``It is fortunate that these people 
who, in a manner of speaking, epitomize a sort of progress in the 
universal conscience are rewarded today, and I'm very happy about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillipe Biberson, president of Medecins Sans Frontieres France,  
received word of the prize with pride, and a touch of apprehension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting the prize might, in fact, complicate our work,'' he  
said. ``It's not clear that the institutionalization of 
humanitarian aid is the best way to defend endangered 
populations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes, first given in 1901, are always presented on the  
Dec. 10 anniversary of the death of their creator, Swedish 
industrialist Alfred Nobel. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, and 
the others in Stockholm.

<HEADLINE>  Doctors' Group Wins Nobel Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Doctors Without Borders, which  
revolutionized private aid by asserting a right to intervene in any 
country to treat the wounded, sick and starving, won the 1999 Nobel 
Peace Prize today. 
</P>
<P>
	The volunteer organization -- officially called by its French  
name Medecins Sans Frontieres -- has played a major role in Africa, 
as well as war zones throughout the world, breaking down barriers 
to reach those in need. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking of all the people who died without aid, of all  
those who died waiting for someone to knock on their door,'' 
Bernard Kouchner, one of the group's founders who now serves as the 
top U.N. representative in Kosovo, told France Info radio after 
hearing of the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Kouchner was one of 10 idealistic French doctors who set up the  
group in 1971 because of their growing frustration at the quiet 
neutrality of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors Without Borders ``has adhered to the fundamental  
principle that all disaster victims, whether the disaster is 
natural or human in origin, have a right to professional assistance 
given as quickly and as efficiently as possible,'' the Norwegian 
Nobel Committee said in announcing the award. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors Without Borders has more than 2,000 medical  
professionals working in 80 countries. They hold as one of their 
most important tenets a ``right to intervene'' regardless of 
international policy toward a government. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been detractors, people who laughed at us, but  
that's normal,'' Kouchner said. ``They didn't understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders does place blame --  
on armed groups, harsh regimes, or governments -- for the suffering 
it finds. 
</P>
<P>
	Many, if not all of the doctors, including Kouchner, were born  
after World War II and were highly aware of the role Nazi death 
camp physicians played during the Holocaust. They were determined 
to change the role of doctors in wartime. 
</P>
<P>
	When Doctors Without Borders began sending physicians to  
conflicts, there were very few independent, privately funded 
humanitarian aid groups working worldwide. The group's actions have 
since been imitated by other organizations and have set the tone 
for independent humanitarian aid work. 
</P>
<P>
	In its nearly 30 years of existence, the organization's doctors  
and volunteers have traveled to disaster areas in Nicaragua, 
Vietnam, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Kosovo and now 
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``National boundaries and political circumstances or sympathies  
must have no influence on who is to receive humanitarian help. By 
maintaining a high degree of independence, the organization has 
succeeded in living up to these ideals,'' the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-member awards committee works in secrecy during its  
five or six meetings a year, and refuses to comment on or release 
candidates' names. This year it said only that there were 136 
nominees and the winner was selected on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Some names were known because those making the nominations  
announce their candidates for the prize, which includes a cash 
award of $960,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In past years, favorites have emerged from world events and the  
committee's wish to nurture ongoing peace efforts. Last year, the 
Northern Ireland peace process was at a key junction and the prize 
went to Protestant David Trimble and Catholic John Hume. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 prize went to American Jody Williams and the  
International Campaign to Ban Landmines, the 1994 award to 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin 
and Shimon Peres, and the 1993 prize was awarded to South Africa's 
Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a peace prize went exclusively to a humanitarian  
field organization was in 1981, when the laureate was the Office of 
the U.N. Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of Doctors Without Borders was expected to  
generate little controversy. Before the announcement, speculation 
that a Chinese dissident, such as exiled pro-democracy activists 
Wei Jingsheng or Wang Dan, might win brought a furious response 
from Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	China called the men criminals, and warned against giving them  
the prestigious award. 
</P>
<P>
	After the winners were revealed, there was only praise for the  
humanitarian doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor for France,'' French President Jacques Chirac  
said from Tampere, Finland. ``It is fortunate that these people 
who, in a manner of speaking, epitomize a sort of progress in the 
universal conscience are rewarded today, and I'm very happy about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillipe Biberson, president of Medecins Sans Frontieres France,  
received word of the prize with pride, and a touch of apprehension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting the prize might, in fact, complicate our work,'' he  
said. ``It's not clear that the institutionalization of 
humanitarian aid is the best way to defend endangered 
populations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prizes, first given in 1901, are always presented on the  
Dec. 10 anniversary of the death of their creator, Swedish 
industrialist Alfred Nobel. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, and 
the others in Stockholm.

<HEADLINE> Astros' Wagner To Undergo Rehab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston reliever Billy Wagner has tendinitis in  
his left elbow, but no other damage is apparent, the Astros said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Gerry Hunsicker said an MRI showed no serious  
problem and team physicians expected he would be ready for spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	They prescribed rest and exercise, but no additional medical  
procedures, Hunsicker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner, 28, who set a team record this year with 39 saves,  
suffered a mild strain to his left elbow in a Sept. 21 game at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	He had three more regular-season appearances and one in the  
opening round of the NL playoffs against Atlanta, but was 
unavailable to Houston later in the series because of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagner was 4-1 with a 1.57 earned-run average over 74 2-3  
innings this season. He pitched in 66 games and struck out 124.

<HEADLINE> Huskies Open Practice in Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Huskymania, meet Midnight Madness.  
</P>
<P>
	Six months after winning its first national championship,  
Connecticut was holding a Midnight Madness. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest of the honors following the 77-74 victory over Duke  
to win it all last season was a White House reception on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 12:01 a.m. Saturday, the Huskies officially begin working on  
defending their title. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Calhoun's rotation will have some openings this year.  
Gone are All-America Richard Hamilton, drafted by the Washington 
Wizards after his junior year, and the Huskies also are without 
defensive stopper Ricky Moore, who graduated. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three returning starters are seniors, 6-foot-11  
center Jake Voskuhl and 6-7 forward Kevin Freeman. The other is 
junior point guard Khalid El-Amin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first day is going to be a little different,'' Freeman  
said. ``Normally, it would be 12 guys who knew what they were 
doing. We've got some young guys that are going to be learning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the newcomers are redshirts Beau Archibald, Justin Brown  
and Ajou Ajou Deng. They are joined by freshmen Tony Robertson, 
Marcus Cox and Doug Wrenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the thousands of fans in Gampel Pavilion on Friday taking  
in the laser light shows, T-shirt giveways and slam dunk contest 
will be a handful of recruits making official visits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think it's a thrill for a recruit to see what it's  
like when your fans are screaming and they're screaming your name, 
trying to get you to come to the school,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Midnight Madness also features the unveiling of a $1 million  
scoreboard that will show live action and replays.

<HEADLINE> Sparring Continues on Treaty Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans are defending their  
opposition to a rejected nuclear test ban treaty against charges by 
President Clinton that they engaged in ``reckless partisanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott sparred via  
dueling news conferences, both Democrats seeking the presidency -- 
Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley -- said they would resubmit 
the treaty if elected. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore did it with a television ad, the first of his campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans remained supportive of Wednesday's 51-48 rejection  
of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denounced the Senate's ruling-party Republicans on  
Thursday at an East Room news conference. ``They brushed aside the 
views of the American people and betrayed the vision of Presidents 
Eisenhower and Kennedy, who set us on the road to this treaty so 
many years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of the congressional majority have displayed a  
reckless partisanship,'' Clinton said. ``It threatens America's 
economic well-being and now our national security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Lott told reporters in the Capitol: ``If there is  
any partisanship, it's on the other side. Republicans didn't all 
vote one way. We didn't demand this vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart today criticized Senate  
leaders for refusing to delay the vote, despite what he said were 
the wishes of most senators. 
</P>
<P>
	``This titanic debate that's gone on over the last several years  
within the Republican Party has finally been settled in favor of 
fortress America, isolationism, and the same week that the person 
who was pushing it, Pat Buchanan, is leaving the party,'' Lockhart 
said. ``There's an irony in all this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four Republicans broke ranks and joined 44 Democrats in voting  
``yes'' for the treaty. The remaining Democrat, Sen. Robert Byrd of 
West Virginia, voted ``present.'' All 51 votes against the treaty 
were cast by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, meanwhile, said today that  
some of the blame for the outcome rests with Democrats for allowing 
themselves to be trapped into a situation where they couldn't 
approve the treaty or delay the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``In hindsight, I regret we didn't take greater care'' to  
maneuver out of such a bind, the South Dakota Democrat told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people who hold responsibility for that and  
I take my share,'' he said. At the same time, Daschle said, ``I'm 
amazed that so many Republicans who asked that it be delayed in a 
letter simultaneously voted not to delay it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton warned other nuclear powers not to misinterpret the  
Senate vote as a softening of the U.S. position against the spread 
of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States would continue to observe the  
moratorium on testing it has observed since 1992, despite the 
test-ban rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	But he raised the specter of a future U.S. president who might  
think otherwise and decide to resume tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then all bets are off,'' Clinton said. ``You'll see a lot of  
testing'' by Russia, China, India and Pakistan, he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush and other GOP  
contenders have opposed the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans in Congress were right to reject,'' Republican  
Steve Forbes said in a statement. ``It was an agreement that would 
compromise our national security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton denounced the Senate's treaty vote, other Democrats  
pledged to make it a political issue for 2000. Gore, in his first 
television ad of the 2000 presidential race, said he would send the 
treaty back to the Senate for ratification if he wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe in my heart this vote does not speak for the  
American people,'' Gore said in his ad, to be run in Iowa, New 
Hampshire and nationally on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley issued a statement saying, ``I strongly support  
ratification of the Multilateral Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and 
I will ask the Senate to reconsider it after I am elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rejection does not kill the treaty. It will remain  
dormant on the Senate calendar through the end of the current 
Congress next year and could theoretically be taken up again. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, two senators -- treaty opponent Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.,  
and supporter Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. -- joined forces in agreeing 
to try to mount a bipartisan effort to ``build a bipartisan 
consensus for a viable test ban.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it is important to leave the door open to return a  
treaty to the Senate that can be passed,'' Lieberman said.

<HEADLINE> Sea Hero To Be Sold in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Sea Hero, winner of the 1993 Kentucky  
Derby, will be part of the dispersal of the late Paul Mellon's 
thoroughbreds at the 13-day November Breeding Stock Sale at 
Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	A near-record 4,862 horses and two stallion shares are cataloged  
for the sale, which begins Nov. 7 and concludes Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of lots is 65 less than cataloged last year.  
</P>
<P>
	The November sale has become the world's largest thoroughbred  
breeding stock auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The first day will include four major dispersals -- Georgia  
Hofmann and her Wycombe House Stud, Robert and Bea Roberts, 
Mellon's estate and Silverleaf Farms. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Satish Sanan, who has become a major influence in  
the thoroughbred industry, will sell 14 horses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanan will sell two mares who are pregnant to A.P. Indy; mares  
in foal to Gone West and Woodman; and weanlings by Sadler's Wells, 
Mr. Prospector and Seeking the Gold. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of quantity in the sale, but we think that  
there is a lot of quality, too,'' said Geoffrey G. Russell, 
Keeneland's assistant director of sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are quality mares and quality foals. There's some very  
nice racing prospects and horses currently in training and racing. 
We are very hopeful that the strong market will continue.''

<HEADLINE> UPS' Net Income Increases 29 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service reported Friday that its  
net income rose 29 percent during the third quarter, the final 
quarter before the package delivery giant expects to go public. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS said its net income for the quarter ending Sept. 30 was $577  
million or $1.03 per diluted share, compared with $449 million or 
81 cents per share for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately held company credited the growing U.S. economy,  
combined with volume growth and higher rates, for the quarterly 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter totaled $6.72 billion, up 9 percent  
from $6.16 billion in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, UPS earnings took a $1.44  
billion hit from a tax assessment that resulted from a court fight 
with the Internal Revenue Service. A federal judge ruled in August 
that UPS set up a Bermuda company to avoid paying income taxes. UPS 
may appeal, but it set the $1.44 billion aside from second-quarter 
earnings to keep the tax assessment from ballooning further with 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month net income was $222 million or 39 cents per share,  
compared with $1.26 billion or $2.28 per share for the same period 
in 1998. Nine-month revenues were up 8.2 percent, from $18.12 
billion last year to $19.6 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the end of this year, UPS expects to offer about 55  
million shares to the public, using the money to buy out an equal 
number of shares from employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to create a pool of publicly held stock that UPS can  
use in acquisitions and other business deals, UPS spokesman Norman 
Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its international operating profits improved to  
$38 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $15 million for 
the same period in 1998. Domestic packaging profits rose 16.1 
percent to $879 million from $757 million during the same period 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said a cost-management program the company implemented in  
late 1997 also contributed to the quarterly gains.

<HEADLINE> Purdue QB To Face Surging Spartans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- October has been a disappointing  
month for quarterback Drew Brees and Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	That can change Saturday with an upset of undefeated Michigan  
State, which has climbed from unranked in the preseason to No. 5 in 
this week's Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Already this month, No. 20 Purdue had a 10-game winning streak  
ended by Michigan in a 38-12 loss, followed by a 25-22 setback at 
Ohio State. Now Brees will be going against a veteran defensive 
unit that limited him to 196 yards passing last year -- his lowest 
total in a game he started. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Brees completed TD tosses of 9 and 6 yards in the final  
5:07 to produce a 25-24 victory. It was the second consecutive year 
Purdue came from 11 points down in the fourth quarter against the 
Spartans to win by a point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up front they've always got some great players,'' Brees said.  
``Last year even with the absence of Dimitrius Underwood and 
Robaire Smith ... they still had other defensive ends step in and 
play a great game. It seems no matter who their starters are, 
they've always got great depth. Whenever you're good up front, it 
makes it a little bit hard on the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to get rid of the ball faster, and with the talent  
they have at defensive back and linebacker, even if you had time to 
throw it's still tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5, 269-pound Smith has six sacks this season, triple  
his total from last year. The Spartans have 25 sacks, compared with 
30 all of last season. If defenses try to double-team Smith, 
opponents have to contend with ends Hubert Thompson and Nick Myers, 
who have combined for three sacks and 40 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys help him tremendously,'' Spartans coach Nick Saban  
said. ``Last year when we flip-flopped our ends with Julian 
Peterson, they would flip-flop the tight end on us all the time and 
run the ball away from Robaire. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't getting the same opportunities to make plays, and I  
think that he is this year. I think it's a compliment to the entire 
front seven that he plays with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Brees will be hoping Purdue solves its problems  
inside an opponent's 20-yard line. The Boilermakers have scored 
touchdowns 46 percent of the time they've gotten inside the 20, 
compared to 58 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably a mental thing. Last year we were so successful,  
that whenever we got inside the red zone we were going to score,'' 
Brees said. ``Now, since we haven't been so successful, I think 
we're willing to settle for field goals. ... In the past there were 
times when we were inside the red zone and we turned the ball over, 
and we were not getting any points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State's Bill Burke threw for a school-record 400 yards  
in Saturday's victory over Michigan, while Plaxico Burress 
accumulated a school-record 255 yards on 10 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's doing a great job of making decisions with the  
ball,'' Purdue coach Joe Tiller said. ``Burress and (Gari) Scott 
are the type guys, if you put the ball up in the air they've got a 
better than 50-50 chance they're going to end up with it. That's 
regardless of the type of coverage you have on. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (4-2, 1-2 Big Ten) is averaging 447.3 yards and 33  
points. Michigan State (6-0, 3-0) is averaging 434.2 yards and 35.2 
points. Brees leads the conference by averaging 302.2 yards 
passing, while Burke is third at 218.2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans have allowed 36.7 yards a game rushing and only one  
rushing touchdown.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tells U.N. Torture Rare in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration told a U.N.  
committee Friday there were sporadic instances of brutality in the 
United States, but they were rare and the legal system provided 
punishment for offenders and compensation for victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, prepared by the State and Justice departments, was  
the first in what is likely to be a periodic accounting under a 
1994 international agreement against torture approved that year by 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fully acknowledge in this report there continue to be areas  
of concern, contention and criticism,'' Assistant Secretary of 
State Harold Koh said. ``But we note that torture does not occur in 
the United States except in aberrational situations and never as a 
matter of policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Areas of concern include instances of police abuse, excessive  
use of force, brutality and death of prisoners in custody, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are overcrowding in prisons, physical and sexual abuse of  
inmates and lack of adequate training and oversight for police and 
prison guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Because capital punishment is legal in the United States, unlike  
in many other Western countries, there was no obligation to report 
on it, Koh said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a thick appendix, the report offered assurances that U.S.  
law provides ``unique protections'' to defendants who are 
confronted with a possible death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, the report said, in the 38 states that permit death  
sentences most use lethal injections, only one in about 100 
convicted murderers ends up on death row and fewer than 10 percent 
of the sentences are carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	They are meted out to blacks disproportionately, the report  
said. In 1996, for instance, of the 45 men executed 31 were white 
and 13 were black, although blacks comprise 10 percent to 12 
percent of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	``The right to be free from torture is an indelible element of  
the American experience,'' Koh said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, the report said, ``no government can claim a perfect  
record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The beating of motorist Rodney King by four Los Angeles police  
officers in 1991 and the violent treatment recently of Abner 
Louima, a Haitian immigrant, by New York City police were among the 
incidents cited. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, concerns were raised about the use of force by federal  
agents at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and in Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report assured the U.N. committee that torture is a  
criminal offense, perpetrators are prosecuted and victims are 
entitled to compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the federal government may take civil action against  
police misconduct under a 1994 law. As a result, the Justice 
Department's Civil Rights Division filed lawsuits against the 
Philadelphia and Steubenville, Ohio, police departments. 
</P>
<P>
	This led to consent decrees requiring reforms in the  
supervising, training and disciplining of police officers, as well 
as in investigating complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has contributed more than $12.6 million to the  
U.N. Fund for the Victims of Torture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every unit of government at every level within the United  
States is committed, by law as well as by policy, to the protection 
of the individual's life, liberty and physical integrity,'' the 
report said.

<HEADLINE>  Russian Troops Drive Towards Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian tanks and armored vehicles  
advanced toward the capital of breakaway Chechnya today, and the 
top commander said his troops were readying a decisive offensive 
against the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	A column of about 100 Russian armored vehicles moved deeper  
inside Chechnya from the west, clashing with Chechen fighters near 
the village of Pobedinskoye, some 16 miles west of the capital, 
Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
	Arbi Barayev, a Chechen commander in the area, said his men  
destroyed four of the armored vehicles in combat today. 
</P>
<P>
	As rebels fired from forested hills on Russian tanks below, six  
Russian helicopter gunships pounded their positions. Barayev, his 
head bandaged from a fresh wound, said just two of his men have 
been killed in fighting so far. 
</P>
<P>
	The move toward Grozny today was the first time Russians  
advanced deep inside western Chechnya south of the river. There was 
no indication they would try to enter the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian command says it launched its campaign three weeks  
ago to cut off militants who twice invaded neighboring Dagestan in 
August and September. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried about a repeat of the 1994-96 war in which Russian  
troops were routed by a small but determined militant force, Moscow 
has been reluctant to engage the Chechen fighters in street or 
mountain fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Russians have relied on a continuous barrage of air  
and artillery raids. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev, the top federal commander in  
Chechnya, said today that his troops had finished creating a 
security zone in the north and will start a second phase Saturday 
to destroy rebels throughout Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must be waiting for us all the time and everywhere, and  
will suffer losses,'' Kazantsev said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Chechen headquarters said its forces shot down an  
Su-25 attack plane Thursday, the third since Russia began bombing 
the region several weeks ago. Russian officials immediately denied 
the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Kazantsev said today that Russian forces had lost three  
aircraft, one of which was shot down by rebels and two of which 
crashed because of equipment failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia had previously admitted to losing an Su-24 and an Su-25  
over Chechnya in the first few days of October. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazantsev said the Russian troops in Chechnya have seen 47  
people killed and 33 wounded since Sept. 25. He claimed at least 
1,500 rebels have been killed. Chechen officials said that hundreds 
of Russian soldiers have been killed, and put their own losses at 
just a few dozen. Neither side's claims could be independently 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign has fanned anger toward Russia within Chechnya,  
with Chechens not associated with the Islamic militants taking up 
arms to fight the Russians. An estimated 170,000 refugees have fled 
the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Singer Takes Jab at NYC Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A little bit of New York City turmoil has  
made it to the heart of blues country. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer-songwriter Jill Sobule of New York wrote and performed a  
song Thursday at the Associated Press Managing Editors conference, 
tweaking Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for his fervent opposition to an 
exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art that includes a painting of 
the Virgin Mary decorated with dung. 
</P>
<P>
	The song, titled ``Call Rudy,'' includes the lyrics: ``Call Rudy  
if your art's a little queer, call Rudy, election year is near. 
Don't call the Whitney, don't call the Met, don't call MoMa, lest 
you forget. You can be a sensation on every news station, lines 
round the block to see your degradation. It's your duty, call 
Rudy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sobule performed the song during an APME panel discussion on  
music censorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobule, who scored a hit with her 1995 song ``I Kissed a Girl,''  
says she plans to record ``Call Rudy.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Puts Off Hurricanes' Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- For the second year in a row, a game involving the  
Miami Hurricanes was postponed Friday because of a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game between No. 24 Miami and Temple was postponed  
until Dec. 4 because Hurricane Irene prevented the Owls from 
arriving for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous disappointment for us not to be able to  
have a home game this weekend,'' Hurricanes athletic director Paul 
Dee said. ``But our first concern is for the safety of our players, 
fans and opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Temple planned to fly from Philadelphia to Miami on Friday  
afternoon, but most airlines suspended service to South Florida 
after Irene hit the area with strong winds and more than 16 inches 
of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Miami's past four home games have been threatened by  
hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's Miami-UCLA was postponed from Sept. 26 to Dec. 5  
because of Hurricanes Georges. Miami won 49-45. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd threatened Miami's showdown last month against  
Penn State, but the game was played as scheduled at the Orange 
Bowl. A week later, the Hurricanes' game against East Carolina was 
moved from Greenville, N.C., to Raleigh because of floodwaters 
resulting from Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's postponement means the Hurricanes (2-3) will delay  
their Big East Conference opener until next Saturday, when they 
travel to Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple (1-5, 1-1 Big East) will play at West Virginia next  
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Glavine Puts Braves on Brink Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Glavine has pitched a lot of big games in  
his career. This one just might be one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine scattered seven hits in seven scoreless innings to help  
the Atlanta Braves beat the New York Mets 1-0 Friday night and take 
a 3-0 lead in the NL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up there,'' Glavine said of where this start ranks among  
the 25 postseason games in his career. ``Obviously the game against 
Cleveland is a better game for different reasons. That game brought 
us a championship. This just brought us one game closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That game against Cleveland came in 1995, when he allowed one  
hit in eight scoreless innings of a 1-0 victory that clinched 
Atlanta's only World Series title of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty similar,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``They had more  
hits off him tonight, but I'm not sure he didn't throw harder. He 
was just excellent. He really moved the ball around and changed 
speeds at perfect times and did a super job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After winning his second Cy Young Award last season, Glavine had  
his worst year since 1990 -- the year before Atlanta began its run 
of eight straight postseasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 14-11 with a 4.12 ERA, leading the NL in hits allowed  
and struggling at times with a new strike zone. But he had no 
struggles against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an off year,'' he said. ``It was a struggle at times.  
But you have to keep plugging away and hope you can figure it out, 
so when the stretch run comes you can be a factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, was he a factor. The Mets had at least one baserunner in  
every inning, but he was effective enough in the clutch to hold 
them scoreless in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He made an unearned run in the first inning stand up, working  
out of his only two jams to snap a three-game losing streak in the 
NLCS. He struck out eight, including Al Leiter on a pitch below the 
knees to get out of a first-and-third threat in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I ever anticipate having to pitch a shutout,''  
Glavine said. ``I knew Al's been pitching well. I didn't anticipate 
our guys having many opportunities to score runs, so I knew I had 
to limit their opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The success in this year's NLCS contrasts with Glavine's history  
in this round. He lost twice to San Diego, including the decisive 
sixth game, last year and fell in Game 6 in 1997 against Florida to 
end the Braves' season. He was 3-8 with a 3.93 ERA in 12 NLCS 
starts before beating the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	But just like Greg Maddux in Game 1 and Kevin Millwood in the  
second game, the Braves' starting pitching again proved too tough 
for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets have managed only five runs and 18 hits in three games.  
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are in a category where they are expected to throw  
shutouts every time and it's not humanly possible,'' Cox said. 
``But it's amazing to see what they can do in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even shuffling the lineup couldn't break the slump against  
Glavine. Mets manager Bobby Valentine moved John Olerud from No. 3 
to No. 2 in a switch with Edgardo Alfonzo, and Robin Ventura 
dropped one spot to sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite two singles by Mike Piazza and one by Olerud, the Mets'  
usual 3-4-5 hitters -- Olerud, Piazza and Ventura -- are 4-for-31 
with one RBI in the series. Leadoff hitter Rickey Henderson is 
1-for-10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves always seem to shut down the opposition's big hitters  
in the playoffs, from Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla of Pittsburgh 
to Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	After Edgardo Alfonzo and Melvin Mora, none of the other Mets  
picked up the slack. With runners on first and third and two outs 
in the fourth, Glavine got Rey Ordonez on a weak groundout to 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine didn't allow another runner to reach second base.  
</P>
<P>
	``He threw ace after ace for called strikes,'' Valentine said.  
``A couple of guys had good at-bats of him, but they weren't real 
solid at-bats.''

                             *Sam Cohen    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sam Cohen, known to New Yorkers as a master lox  
slicer who held the No. 1 slot at the gourmet grocery Zabar's, died 
Oct. 9 of lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Believed to be 86, Cohen's true age was unknown because he was  
orphaned as a young child. He also survived conditions while 
consigned to a concentration camp under Adolf Hitler's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	His penchant for flirting and friendship, the ability to speak  
Russian, Polish, Hebrew, Spanish and English, and a willingness to 
explain the basics as well as the finer points of enjoying lox -- 
all made Cohen a personality favorite in the Upper West Side 
neighborhood where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen was born in Poland, and worked as a book dealer, the  
secretary of a small bank and a dealer in animal feed before World 
War II. He came to U.S. shores in 1952, tried out television repair 
and then settled into Zabar's, where he weighed salmon, sturgeon, 
gefilte fish, and pickled lox with a smile.

<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- George L. Grassmuck, professor emeritus  
at the University of Michigan and a special assistant in the Nixon 
administration, died Sunday of prostate cancer. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassmuck was the University of Michigan's assistant vice  
president for academic affairs in the 1960s and acting director of 
the Center for Near Eastern and North African Studies. He was a 
founding member of the national Middle East Studies Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The World War II veteran was born in Nebraska City, Neb., and  
earned political science degrees from the University of California 
at Los Angeles in the early 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned a doctorate in 1949 from Johns Hopkins University,  
where he remained to teach for three years. He also taught at 
Boston University, UCLA and the American University of Beirut 
before joining Michigan. He taught there from 1957 until his 
retirement in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, he took a leave from Michigan to serve as chief of  
research of Richard Nixon's presidential campaign.

                          *Julius Nyerere    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Julius Nyerere, Tanzania's first president and a  
universally revered elder statesman who was instrumental in efforts 
to forge African unity, died Thursday of complications stemming 
from leukemia. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Nyerere was diagnosed with leukemia in 1998. His doctors said  
earlier that he had suffered a massive stroke and would not 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya, Uganda and South Africa ordered their flags flown at  
half-staff in his honor, while Nelson Mandela praised the man he 
said had strived for the liberation of Africa as ``part of a single 
struggle for a better world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After 23 years in office, Nyerere stepped down in 1985. But he  
remained a potent force in Tanzanian and regional politics.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Richard B. Shull, a veteran character actor who  
was appearing in the Broadway comedy ``Epic Proportions,'' died 
Thursday of a heart attack. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Shull, whose craggy, hangdog face and impeccable comic timing  
made him a favorite of theater directors, portrayed D.W. Dewitt in 
the play, which spoofs the making of an extravagant biblical movie 
in 1930s. He played both performances Wednesday, said Pete Sanders, 
a spokesman for the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Shull's Broadway musical credits were ``Victor/Victoria,''  
``Minnie's Boys,'' ``Oh, Brother!'', ``Ain't Broadway Grand'' and 
``Goodtime Charlie,'' for which he received a Tony nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Shull also appeared in such notable off-Broadway productions as  
Christopher Durang's ``The Marriage of Bette and Boo'' and the 
Roundabout Theater Company's ``A Flea in Her Ear,'' starring Bill 
Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
	His films included ``Private Parts,'' ``Housesitter'' and  
``Splash.'' He had continuing roles on Diana Rigg's television 
series ``Diana'' and on ``Holmes &AMP; Yo-Yo.''

<HEADLINE> Iowa Schedules Earlier Caucuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Ending a fight over the political  
calendar that could reshape future presidential campaigns, Iowa 
officials have decided to move their precinct caucuses to Jan. 24 -- 
one week earlier than had been planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came about after New Hampshire refused repeated appeals  
from Iowa to reschedule its Feb. 1 presidential primary and 
preserve the traditional eight-day grace period between the 
nation's two leadoff political contests. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by Iowa also will renew debate over the national  
political calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Republican Chairman Kayne Robinson said officials need to  
find a way to bring stability to the political calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't get a handle on this among the states that are in  
this first-in-the-nation area and have some stability here, yes, we 
will be threatened,'' said Robinson. ``We don't want that 
uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire officials welcomed the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that Iowa is moving its date back,'' said  
Pamela Walsh, spokeswoman for New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a 
Democrat. ``We believe it's important to maintain the eight-day 
window ... because it enhances the unique status of both states and 
gives candidates the opportunity to campaign intensely in both 
states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Republicans and Democrats use different methods to set  
caucus dates, but work together to have them on the same day. Iowa 
Democrats today won approval from the national party's rules 
committee for the change in date. The panel also approved New 
Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Republicans are free to set a date without national party  
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's move comes after days of private discussions about the  
2000 political calendar of primaries and caucuses that yield 
presidential nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa caucuses had been set for Jan. 31, but New Hampshire  
officials unexpectedly scheduled their primary on Feb. 1 and 
refused to push it back to Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa originally set the caucuses for Feb. 21 but gradually moved  
them forward as other states set earlier and earlier primary and 
caucus dates. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 75 percent of the delegates will be picked by March 7,  
and both parties are virtually certain to have a nominee within six 
weeks of Iowa's opening test. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Republicans had planned their regional caucuses for  
Jan. 28 -- to be first, and a state GOP official said Thursday that 
Iowa's decision will lead them to pick a new date. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa decided it had no choice but to move the caucus date to  
Jan. 24 -- the earliest they have been held since 1980 -- to preserve 
its leadoff status, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult thing and it's a terribly inconvenient  
thing,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, it's a massive logistical chore.  
</P>
<P>
	Each party will have to find more than 2,000 caucus sites across  
the state. They also will have to reshuffle the logistics of 
totaling the votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, Iowa's political leaders concluded that holding  
the caucuses on the eve of the New Hampshire primary likely would 
dilute their impact and jeopardize their role in the presidential 
selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight between Iowa and New Hampshire also is certain to  
spark a review of the lineup for the next presidential election. In 
past election cycles the two states have banded together to fend 
off challenges from other states seeking some of the attention paid 
to states that open the nomination process.

<HEADLINE> One Dead in Mo. Hayride Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Mo. (AP) -- A wagon hauling participants in a hayride  
overturned Friday night, killing one passenger and injuring up to 
12 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were calling it a ``mass-casualty incident,''  
meaning they feared there could be more injuries than emergency 
crews could handle. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Department 
confirmed the one fatality. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 10 and 12 people were injured. Three were in critical  
condition and one was in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities weren't sure what caused the wagon to overturn.  
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened around 8:30 p.m. at the Rocking J. Ranch  
in High Ridge just southwest of St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Blames Clinton for Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                            *PAUL CHAVEZ   	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve  
Forbes on Friday blamed President Clinton and Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan for the current turbulence on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their misguided policies are putting the American economy at  
risk,'' he said during a campaign trip to Los Angeles. ``High 
taxes, high interest rates, more big government spending and 
busting the spending caps is a recipe for a serious economic 
slowdown. The first to get hurt will be families, farmers, young 
people and minorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes commented after the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped  
266.90 points Friday to close at 10,019.71, its worst finish since 
early April and its biggest point drop in more than a year. The 
biggest jump in wholesale prices in nine years and new worries by 
Greenspan about the sky-high stock prices apparently jolted the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes told about 350 people at a Los Angeles Rotary Club  
luncheon that climbing interest rates, Washington's failure to cut 
taxes and declining consumer confidence are jeopardizing the 
pensions and retirement plans of working families. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Federal Reserve and the White House ``are ruining a  
good thing or at least discombobulating it. I hope they see the 
error in their ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also cited the Gettysburg Address' call for a ``new birth  
of freedom,'' saying the United States could reach its potential if 
Americans have ``freedom of choice'' in matters ranging from 
education to taxes.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Health Officials Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California health officials should have  
released a study showing higher-than-normal lung cancer rates among 
residents living near a Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power laboratory, 
investigators said in a report released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the state Environmental Protection Agency also  
faulted the Department of Health Services for failing to launch a 
new study to learn the cause of the cancer, or at least explain to 
the public why further study was not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Gray Davis ordered the state EPA to investigate the  
department last May after a lawmaker accused Health Services 
personnel of suppressing the 1997 survey of cancer rates. The 
survey found that the rate of cancer in neighborhoods around 
Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field Laboratory were 17 percent higher 
than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's parent, the Health and Human Services Agency,  
is studying the report and its recommendations, which include 
establishing clear guidelines for followup study and requiring that 
all cancer incidence research be released to the public and to 
other researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report does point out that some poor decisions were made,  
but no guidelines or statutes were violated,'' said Anita Gore, a 
spokeswoman for Health and Human Services. ``It provides a series 
of recommendations that at first blush appear to be reasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Rocketdyne spokeswoman did not return a call for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Rocketdyne International Corp. ran 10 nuclear reactors at its  
Santa Susana Field Laboratory, 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles 
along the Ventura and Los Angeles county line, from the 1950s to 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigators' report said there appears to have been no  
deliberate effort to suppress the 1997 study. Two researchers who 
received the report did not feel the 17 percent spike was 
``significant or unusual,'' investigators wrote.

<HEADLINE> Russian Gymnast Nemov Wins 2 Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- Russian gymnast Alexei Nemov was crisp,  
flexible and flawless tonight, winning the world championship in 
the floor exercises and on the pommel horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Compatriot Svetlana Khorkina watched two Chinese gymnasts set  
high scores on the women's uneven bars, then beat them with a 
daring, intricate performance including cross-handed twists upside 
down on the top bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Khorkina, all-around and uneven bars champion at the last World  
Championships in 1997, gained the night's best score -- 9.837 -- to 
9.825 for Huang Mandan and 9.812 for Ling Jie. She atoned for 
mistakes earlier here that left Russia second in the team 
competition and herself 12th in the all-around event. 
</P>
<P>
	On the floor, defending champion Nemov went last among the eight  
finalists and surpassed them all with sprightly flips and twists 
and clean landings, scoring 9.787 points. Spain's Gervasio Deferr 
was second with 9.750 and Xing Aowei, a member of China's gold 
medal team, was third with 9.737. 
</P>
<P>
	Nemov, sixth in the all-around, then went on the pommel horse,  
where he scored 9.775 with a flashy windmilling of legs. Romanian 
Marius Urzicka took silver with 9.762 and all-around champion 
Nikolay Krukov of Russia won the bronze with 9.750. Germany's 
Valeri Belenki, the 1997 pommel horse champion, placed sixth with 
9.700. 
</P>
<P>
	Dong Zhen, a native of the host city of Tianjin, won the gold  
medal on the rings with 9.775. Hungary's Szilveszter Csollany was 
silver medalist for the second consecutive time, scoring 9.737. 
Greece's Dimosthenis Tambakos was third with 9.712. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Elena Zamolodchikova, the all-around bronze medalist,  
beat 1997 vault gold medalist Simona Amanar of Romania 9.718 to 
9.631 for the women's vault title. Maria Olaru, the all-around 
champion and leading scorer of Romania's gold medal team, took the 
bronze with 9.593. 
</P>
<P>
	Olaru finished sixth on the uneven bars with 9.712. American  
Elise Ray was seventh with 9.687. 
</P>
<P>
	Belarus gymnast Ivan Ivankov, the 1997 all-around champion,  
pulled a hamstring muscle in warming up for Thursday's all-around 
competition. He tried to start on the high bar, fell off, restarted 
and then dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
	He later withdrew from the speciality finals in rings and  
parallel bars.

<HEADLINE> Nations Upset by U.S. Treaty Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Nations around the world have sharply criticized  
the U.S. Senate's defeat of a multinational nuclear test ban 
treaty, with at least one leader saying other nations will use it 
as an excuse not to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	From Russia to China, Brazil to Germany, government leaders  
criticized the Senate's Wednesday night decision to reject the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would outlaw underground 
testing of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid widespread fears, Western powers on Thursday appealed to  
the Senate to think again. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed dismay and renewed  
his call for all countries to sign the pact. Annan, who oversees 
ratification of the treaty, noted in a statement that just last 
week, the treaty's signatories ``reaffirmed the importance of a 
universal ... and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear test 
ban treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India hinted it may take its time before signing on to the  
treaty, saying ``national consensus'' must be built first. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pakistan -- which along with India is a new nuclear power --  
the military leaders who seized control after a coup Tuesday had 
nothing to say. But a spokesman for Pakistani opposition leader 
Benazir Bhutto said it is virtually certain now that neither 
Pakistan nor India will sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every country will use it as an excuse not to sign,''  
opposition leader Naveed Qamar said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rejected the treaty 51-48, making the United States  
the first of the world's declared nuclear powers to specifically 
reject it. The treaty has been signed by 154 nations, including the 
United States, but has been ratified by only 26 of the 44 
nuclear-capable states that must approve it to put it into force. 
</P>
<P>
	In Vienna, the commission set up to administer the proposed  
global ban said it would continue work anyway and hopes the United 
States changes its mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain and France have signed and ratified the treaty, China  
and Russia have signed but not ratified, and India, Pakistan and 
North Korea have done neither. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, the Foreign Ministry said Russia was ``disillusioned  
and seriously concerned,'' and labeled the vote part of a U.S. 
attempt to ``destabilize the foundations of international 
relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China, more restrained than Moscow, said it would nevertheless  
speed up its own efforts to ratify the treaty and continue with a 
self-imposed moratorium on nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia stood virtually alone in showing some sympathy.  
</P>
<P>
	``As the world's one remaining superpower, (the United States)  
sees itself as having a special global responsibility,'' 
Environment Minister Robert Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents in the Senate argued that the treaty would not halt  
the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran and would endanger 
the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Clinton 
said Thursday he would proceed according to the terms of the treaty 
despite the Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no intention of doing anything other than sticking with  
the obligations imposed by the treaty on the United States,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has not conducted nuclear tests since 1992.

<HEADLINE> General Challenge, Old Trieste Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- General Challenge and Old Trieste, the  
West Coast's leading horses for the Nov. 6 Breeders' Cup Classic, 
square off Saturday in the $500,000 Goodwood Breeders' Cup Handicap 
at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge and Old Trieste will share the high weight of  
120 pounds in the field of six, which also includes Hollycombe, a 
5-year-old who has won four of his five starts. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, who drew post position No. 3 and will be  
ridden by David Flores, has been training well under Bob Baffert 
for the 1 1/8-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible the way he does it,'' Baffert said, ``and he's  
just getting better and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, a 3-year-old, has won $1.5 million from six  
victories in nine starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got so much talent,'' Baffert said. ``I have never seen  
anything like him in all my years of training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge defeated stablemate River Keen by three  
lengths in the Aug. 29 Pacific Classic at Del Mar, his last start. 
River Keen defeated the East Coast's top older horses in last 
week's Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Trieste will start from the No. 2 post under Chris McCarron.  
The 4-year-old has earned $787,944, with six victories in 12 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing well, everything's fine, and we're ready to run,''  
trainer Mike Puype said. 
</P>
<P>
	Old Trieste won four graded stakes by a combined 28 lengths  
before finishing third to Hollycombe in the Sept. 5 Del Mar 
Breeders' Cup Handicap while hampered with recurring foot problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The field in post position order with jockeys and weights:  
</P>
<P>
	Barter Town, Victor Espinoza, 114 pounds; Old Trieste, McCarron,  
120; General Challenge, Flores, 120; Hollycombe, Gary Stevens, 117; 
Koslanin, Goncalino Almeida, 112; and Budroyale, Garrett Gomez, 
119.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Vasco Advances in Hoops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Rogerio Klafke scored 21 points to lead  
Brazil's Vasco da Gama to a ragged 92-86 overtime upset of European 
champion Zalgiris Kaunas on Friday, putting a South American club 
in the McDonald's Championship final for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Klafke had just two points at halftime, but hit a 3-point shot  
in the final minute of regulation and another in the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brazil, Klafke is considered the heir to retired superstar  
Oscar Schmidt, who torched the United States for 46 points in a 
120-115 Brazilian victory in the 1987 Pan American Games at 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	American guard Charles Byrd played 51 of a possible 53 minutes  
for Vasco da Gama and contributed 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA champion San Antonio Spurs faced Italian League titlist  
Varese in Friday's second semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
	The title game of this unofficial world club championship is  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, the final is not going to be America vs. Europe,'' said  
Vasco da Gama center Jose Vargas, who had 19 points and nine 
rebounds. ``How do you like that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zalgiris Kaunas led Vasco da Gama by as many as 12 points in the  
second half, but fell apart late with turnovers and poor foul 
shooting. The Lithuanian club got little help from 7-foot-1 
Eurelijus Zukauskas, whose NBA rights are held by the Milwaukee 
Bucks. Zukauskas managed just six points and two rebounds before 
fouling out with 6:37 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't the only player who played poorly.  
</P>
<P>
	Zalgiris Kaunas shot 38.3 percent for the game, while Vasco Da  
Gama hit 44.9 percent of its shots. The 152 points at the end of 
regulation represents the lowest combined total for a McDonald's 
game. Spain's Real Madrid and Germany's Bayer Leverkusen combined 
for 160 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The second semifinal gave Varese guard Andrea Meneghin a chance  
to do something his father wasn't able to: share the basketball 
court with NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
	Meneghin failed to land a spot with the Toronto Raptors after a  
three-day tryout with the NBA team in August. His father, Dino, 
generally considered the finest Italian basketball player ever, had 
a similar opportunity turn out the same way with the New York 
Knicks 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it caps a long-term dream,'' the younger Meneghin said  
Thursday, when Varese beat Asian champions C.S. Sagesse of Lebanon 
98-88 to advance. ``When I was little, I always thought about 
playing in the NBA, and now I have a chance to see what that would 
be like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meneghin, 25, had a sub-par game Thursday, scoring just four  
points in the first half before finishing with 12. But he did hit 
two 3-pointers during a 14-2 run that decided the game in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't feel like all eyes are on me, like this is another  
test for me,'' the 6-foot-7, 216-pound guard said. ``I had my 
chance this summer, and I tried. It just didn't work out at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, who received a first-round bye, were trying to extend  
the NBA's 16-0 record in the 12-year history of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, what they do doesn't matter,'' said Spurs guard  
Antonio Daniels, who attended Varese's victory over C.S. Sagesse. 
``It's all about us and how we play.''

<HEADLINE>  Fire Ready To Defend MLS Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- All year, Chicago Fire coach Bob  
Bradley has been waiting to see a little attitude from his players. 
</P>
<P>
	No, he doesn't want them partying and hanging out with rock  
stars. This isn't Manchester United. But a little of that hunger, 
that feistiness, that, well, fire Chicago showed in its improbable 
run to the MLS title last year would be nice. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with the playoffs beginning Saturday, Bradley is liking  
what he sees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been easy for this team to go off track because  
nothing has come easy,'' he said Thursday. ``I believe it's taken 
all year to get to that point, but yes, now we have the same hunger 
we had last year to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still believe we're a team that can win the championship.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Fire (18-14) begin their defense of the title they won their  
first year with a conference semifinal matchup against the Dallas 
Burn (19-13), a best-of-three series that begins Saturday night in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rapids (20-12) play the Los Angeles Galaxy (20-12)  
in the other Western Conference semifinal. In the Eastern 
Conference, it's two-time champion D.C. United (23-9) against the 
Miami Fusion (13-19), and the Columbus Crew (19-13) vs. the Tampa 
Bay Mutiny (14-18). 
</P>
<P>
	Winners of the conference finals will meet Nov. 21 in the MLS  
Cup at Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling, walking on the stage and holding up that  
trophy, celebrating in the locker room,'' said Frank Klopas, one of 
the Fire's veteran members. ``Last year was last year, but that 
feeling comes back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perfect timing, too. The regular season wasn't exactly how the  
Fire wanted to defend its title. They fell to third place in the 
MLS Western Conference when Dallas won its final game last weekend. 
They had a tough loss in the CONCACAF Champions Cup, and they were 
beaten by an A-League team, the Rochester Raging Rhinos, in the 
U.S. Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	They lost five of their eight shootouts, including one to the  
Burn in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The season took a toll physically, too. Josh Wolff, the No. 2  
scorer with 10 goals and one of the team's top young players, is 
out with a torn ligament in his left knee. Midfielders Diego 
Gutierrez and Jesse Marsch and defenders Francis Okaroh and Tommy 
Soehn are ailing, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of things that could have brought us down, but  
we got through them,'' said forward Ante Razov, whose 14 goals led 
the Fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, everything starts over. And even though Dallas and Los  
Angeles have better records, the Fire have something no other team 
but D.C. United has. They've been there, done that and took home 
several free T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always harder to repeat, but the positive thing is we've  
been through it,'' Klopas said. ``We realize how hard we worked 
last year and the demands and sacrifices we had to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to have that same hunger and attitude we had last  
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting by Dallas won't be easy. The Burn ended the regular  
season strong, winning their last five games and eight of the last 
nine. Dallas and Chicago split four games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Jason Kreis had an MVP-like season, leading the league  
with 18 goals and 15 assists. He won player of the week honors for 
a second straight week after scoring the game-winner in Dallas' 
last game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're expecting some tough games,'' Razov said. ``But if we do  
the things we're capable of and the things we do well, I don't see 
why we can't get to Foxboro and win it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we're on a roll, we're hard to stop.''  
</P>
<P>
	Now that's positive attitude.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Erected To Honor Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The first permanent memorial outside of  
Germany to honor 11 Israeli athletes and officials killed by 
terrorists at the 1972 Munich Olympics was unveiled today at the 
site of the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial stands outside Sydney's Olympic showpiece, Stadium  
Australia, and is suspended from one of 16 light towers along the 
Olympic plaza dedicated to all the modern Games. 
</P>
<P>
	It consists of a stainless steel panel with the names of the 11  
dead and, above it, a blue glass panel displays Hebrew inscriptions 
on one side and a Biblical passage on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	On the morning of Sept. 5, 1972, eight Palestinian terrorists  
broke into the Olympic village in Munich and went to the dormitory 
of the Israeli team. Two Israelis were killed instantly and another 
nine were taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
	The terrorists demanded the release of 200 prisoners from  
Israeli jails, and safe passage for themselves out of Germany. They 
got as far as a military airport where West German police killed 
three of the terrorists. However, the battle that ensued left all 
the hostages dead.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Re-sign Valentin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jose Valentin signed a one-year deal with the  
Milwaukee Brewers that likely includes a pay cut for the slumping 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but Brewers  
general manager Dean Taylor announced Friday that the club's option 
on Valentin for the 2000 season had been restructured. Valentin, 
who turned 30 on Thursday, had an injury-plagued 1999 season and 
played in just 89 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin's offensive numbers have steadily declined since 1996,  
when he batted .259 with 24 homers and 95 RBIs, all career-highs. 
He has spent his entire eight-year career with Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season he hit .227 and drove in 38 runs. He spent most of  
the first two months on the disabled list with a torn ligament in 
his left thumb.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 279.57 at 10,007.05 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials briefly plunged below 10,000  
today as stocks tumbled amid news of a spurt in inflation and 
another warning about market exuberance by Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	With about an hour left to the session, the Dow was down 279.57  
at 10,007.05. Moments later, the barometer of 30 major companies 
dipped below 10,000 for the first time since April, slipping to 
9,998.18. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop yanked the Dow's gain for the year below 10 percent and  
put the average about 1,300 points below its Aug. 25 closing high 
of 11,326.04, when the Dow was up more than 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also suffered heavy damage. The Nasdaq  
composite index was down 87.59 at 2,719.25, and the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500-stock index was down 38.14 at 1,245.28. 
</P>
<P>
	The selloff followed a morning report that revealed prices at  
the wholesale level spiked 1.1 percent in September, the largest 
increase in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the Producer Price Index, which measures  
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was much worse 
than expected. Many analysts were anticipating that prices would 
rise 0.5 percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in a speech to bankers Thursday night, Greenspan  
issued his latest call for investor sobriety at a time of robust 
economic expansion and roaring stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Both developments aggravated market fears that the Federal  
Reserve will raise interest rates for the third time this year in a 
bid to fight inflation by slowing the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	This afternoon, in a prepared speech on the Year 2000 date  
change, Greenspan made no mention of today's inflation report or 
the overall financial backdrop. Fed policy makers hold their next 
meeting Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, which could see demand for loans hurt by  
rising interest rates, led today's decline. Among the Dow's 30 
components, American Express was down 7 at 135, and J.P. Morgan was 
down 4 3/32 at 93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the day's downward trend, Sun Microsystems surged 4 3/32  
to 93 3/4 in Nasdaq trading after the maker of powerful business 
computers posted better than expected profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumber advancers by nearly a 4-to-1 margin  
overall. Trading eased from the morning's hectic pace, with 696.19 
million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, down 
from 715.12 million at the same point on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 5.00 at  
414.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas markets also took a big hit today. In Europe, Britain's  
FT-SE 100 fell 2.2 percent, Germany's DAX index fell 0.7 percent 
percent and France's CAC-40 fell 1.3 percent. Japan's Nikkei stock 
average fell 1.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gore Banks More Than $10 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley held a slight  
fund-raising lead over Vice President Al Gore over the last three 
months, with both Democrats taking in more than $7 million during 
the period. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican front-runner George W. Bush continued to surpass  
the rest of the fund-raising field, taking in $20.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley had more money in the bank at the end of September than  
Gore did, $10.7 million to $10.3 million. Bush had a larger bank 
account than both Democrats put together, $37.7 million as of Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports filed with the Federal Election Commission today show  
that Bradley took in $7.4 million between July 1 and Sept. 30, as 
compared with $7.3 million for Gore. Bradley had $10.7 million in 
the bank as of Sept, 30, while Gore had $10.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, Gore raised $24.9 million to Bradley's $18.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased with our fund-raising efforts so far,''  
Gore campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said. ``With the matching 
funds and the number of low-dollar donors, we're very close to 
completing the fund-raising portion of the campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's average donation was $187, while Bradley's was $334. In  
addition, the former senator reported raising more than $472,000 
from his campaign web site over the last three months, bringing his 
Internet fund-raising total to more than $772,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The steady growth in fund-raising support we have received,  
particularly through our direct mail program and our web site, is 
indicative of the increasing enthusiasm we are seeing at the 
grassroots level across the country,'' said Bradley campaign 
chairman Douglas Berman. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has raised more than $57 million, more than any  
presidential candidate has ever had to spend on a campaign for the 
White House. His average contribution was $386. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am honored that so many Americans are supporting my message  
of rebuilding the military, modernizing Social Security and 
Medicare, improving America's public schools and cutting taxes,'' 
Bush said today. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republican side, Sen. John McCain of Arizona was a  
distant second, raising $3 million during the last three months to 
bring his total to $9.4 million. That includes $2 million 
transferred from his Senate campaign account. He had $2.1 million 
in the bank as of Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The McCain campaign took in $64,000 over the Internet during the  
last four days of September, after sending out an e-mail seeking 
last-minute contributions. ``We must continue the momentum we have 
shown in the press and the polls by showing continued fund-raising 
strength,'' McCain wrote in the e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans Gary Bauer, Patrick Buchanan, Elizabeth Dole, Steve  
Forbes and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah each raised more than $1 
million from July to September. Alan Keyes raised $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who is largely financing his own campaign, raised an  
estimated $1.4 million over the last three months, bringing his 
total to $4.2 million through Sept. 30. In addition, Forbes spent 
about $15 million from his own pocket.

<HEADLINE> EPA Helps Gore on Animal Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration took steps this  
week to minimize animal testing after animal rights protesters 
demanding the change had dogged Al Gore's presidential campaign 
since July. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Administration Agency sent a letter Thursday  
to 900 corporations saying, among other things, that no animal 
experiments should be performed when other test methods are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	It also called for a delay in the testing of several chemicals  
while new methods are developed and said federal funds will be 
dedicated to finding more alternative testing methods. The letter 
was released Friday by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've taken a number of steps, including clarifying that  
certain tests that animal rights groups were concerned about will 
not be performed, approving other valid tests that don't inlcude 
animal testing, and encouraging companies involved in this program 
to minimize tests on animals,'' said EPA spokesman David Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
	People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals had run TV and  
newspaper ads accusing Vice President Gore of supporting the EPA 
program that tests the toxicity of chemicals on animals. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also deployed a man in a bunny suit to trail Gore on  
his campaign travels. 
</P>
<P>
	PETA said the change would save the lives of as many as 800,000  
animals. It also issued a statement saying it had ``agreed to call 
off its national grass-roots campaign against the vice 
president....'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Gore referred queries to the EPA.

<HEADLINE> Gore: No Help from Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, who adamantly defended  
his boss during the impeachment trial, now says he is considering 
telling President Clinton not to help him as he campaigns for the 
Democratic president nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't made a decision yet,'' Gore said Friday during a  
luncheon interview with reporters and editors of The Washington 
Post. ``I may do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, whose grip on the nomination is being seriously challenged  
by former Sen. Bill Bradley, said running for the White House is a 
``very personal quest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be successful, ``I have to have a very personal connection  
and line of communication with the American people,'' said Gore, 
comparing the campaign to his first race for the House in 1976, 
when he asked his late father, a senator, not to speak on his 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore criticized Bradley's suggestion that he was waging a ``left  
of center, insurgent'' bid for the White House. Gore said a more 
accurate description of Bradley's 18-year record as a senator from 
New Jersey would be ``cautious moderate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his professed desire to be his own man on the campaign  
trail, Gore acknowledged that Clinton already is injecting himself 
into the race by wooing major donors and talking up his vice 
president whenever and wherever possible. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton praised Gore as ``by far the best vice  
president in history'' and said he did the right thing by moving 
his campaign operation out from Washington to Nashville, Tenn. 
``And I expect him to win,'' Clinton said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said Clinton has done a ``superb'' job but added that he  
understood the American people's anger and disappointment with the 
president over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Gore said, his campaign is more about tomorrow, than  
yesterday. ``In this campaign, the American people want to look at 
who can best lead them in the future. I don't think they want to 
look at the past,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NYC Tourists Telling Tall Tales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the city of a million scams, police say  
tourists are finally taking their turn by spinning tales of 
muggings that never happened in a bid to collect travel insurance 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Phony victims ``give us a Hollywood version,'' explained Capt.  
James O'Neill of the New York Police Department's Central Park 
Precinct. ``Something corny, like the perp said, `Stick 'em up.' 
Nobody says that anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police say they've heard tall tales from visitors from England,  
Germany, Japan, Australia and the United States. Tourists seem to 
believe the 840-acre Central Park is akin to the Wild West, and a 
few are determined to cash in. 
</P>
<P>
	Police know of 10 tourists who've filed false mugging reports  
this year in the park, along with six New Yorkers. Filing a false 
report can cost $500 to $1,000 in fines and jail time of 60 days to 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We arrested a man from Wales in March, and he said it was a  
well-known fact in Wales that you can report a robbery in Central 
Park and no one would question you because so many robberies happen 
here,'' O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrong on both counts.  
</P>
<P>
	Crime is down 30 percent this year in the park. As of Oct. 10,  
there were 53 robberies there this year, compared with 66 to the 
same time last year. The Central Park Conservancy says 20 million 
people visit the park annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are used to separating fact from fiction.  
Sometimes, the stories take on Indiana Jones proportions. A few 
favorites around the precinct: 
</P>
<P>
	--The armed-to-the-teeth tale: ``One guy from England said he was  
robbed by three men, and one guy had a knife in his belt, up his 
arm and up another sleeve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The ``robbers on Rollerblades ruse,'' involving two purported  
victims and three scofflaw skaters. 
</P>
<P>
	--The ``robbed in broad daylight surrounded by hundreds of  
people'' scenario. (This one really had cops rolling their eyes.) 
</P>
<P>
	European insurance companies have cracked down on travel  
insurance fraud, said Suzanne Moore, spokesperson for the 
Association of British Insurers. Travel insurance fraud costs Great 
Britain 50 million pounds a year -- about $82.5 million in U.S. 
currency, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, the ``victims'' claim that some time has lapsed since the  
purported crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``They come in and say they're leaving that night to go back  
home and all they need is the complaint number for the insurance 
company,'' O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, he said, they crumble under questioning.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some people plan it before they get here,'' he said. ``Others  
say they spent too much money here and wanted to get some back.''

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Arena Has Widespread Faults </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Construction problems on a new  
civic arena are more widespread than initially thought, as tests on 
10 additional beams found that all had flaws. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the faults with the arena's upper deck supports, Arena  
board chairman Bob Russell remained confident today that the Alltel 
Arena will open safely for an Oct. 23 Arkansas RiverBlades East 
Coast Hockey League game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are most concerned with safety and solutions,'' Russell  
said at a news conference. ``I have RiverBlade hockey tickets for 
the 23rd and my family and I will be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The building was scheduled to open Tuesday night with an NBA  
exhibition game between Washington and the Los Angeles Lakers. But 
the board opted to cancel the game when engineers said they had 
questions about beams supporting the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety questions about the $80 million arena originated when  
workers discovered a crack in one of the beams about a month ago. 
After chipping away some of the cement, engineers discovered that 
metal reinforcement bars within the beam were 12 inches lower than 
intended. 
</P>
<P>
	The rods' poor placement made the beam less able to withstand  
stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers using a high-tech imaging system worked overnight to  
look inside the beams and found problems in all 10 tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell said all 10 of the beams had reinforcement rods lower  
than they were supposed to be, though none were as badly off as the 
cracked beam that forced the arena to cancel the NBA game. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena officials said Thursday that any additional problems could  
be quickly fixed, likely by using metal support posts, which was 
done Tuesday with the cracked beam. 
</P>
<P>
	A preferred but more lengthy solution would be to place a  
carbon-fiber wrap around the beams, similar to what is done in 
buildings in earthquake zones. 
</P>
<P>
	A post would obstruct the view of the arena floor while a  
carbon-fiber wrap would not. 
</P>
<P>
	The arena was funded in part by taxpayer dollars after a  
temporary one-cent sales tax was approved in 1995. The state 
chipped in $20 million and private sources contributed $17 million, 
including $7 million from Alltel to put its name on the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena general manager Michael Marion said about 1,000  
ticketholders got refunds for the canceled Lakers-Wizards game on 
Thursday, the first day refunds were available. He said he still 
trying is to reschedule the game.

<HEADLINE> Goodyear's Gadsden Plant Plan OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GADSDEN, Ala. (AP) -- Union workers at Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber  
Co.'s plant here approved a plan to continue making light truck 
tires, saving at least hundreds of jobs, rather than end production 
in December as earlier planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by United Steelworkers members in voting this week  
was announced by Goodyear in a news release Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear officials said union members voted 655-210 to continue  
making tires with a scaled-back workforce and other changes sought 
by the company, which in February had announced it would cease tire 
production in Gadsden and lay off some 1,320 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the company nor the union would say how many employees  
might be retained or how long tire production would continue if 
union members accepted the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Tire operations at the Gadsden plant had been scheduled to shut  
down in December, with no more than a couple of hundred employees 
to be kept on to mix rubber compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Already about 1,050 people have been laid off from the plant,  
with another 700 still on the job making tires. Of those who lost 
their jobs in Gadsden, 365 have gone to work in other Goodyear 
factories. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal for continued tire production emerged from a series  
of meetings between union leaders and the company. Goodyear said it 
was considering maintaining production at the plant because of 
higher-than-anticipated tire demand. It said the new plan would 
also make the factory more efficient and competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Last February, the company said the Gadsden plant was one of its  
oldest and most inefficient factories. Opened in 1929, it was the 
first major tire factory to be built in the South and, prior to 
cuts in its workforce, the driving economic force in this city of 
some 43,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mickey Williams, president of USWA Local 12, had said the new  
proposal ``would be good for our membership if they want to 
continue building tires in Gadsden.''

<HEADLINE> Plummer: I'm Playing Against 'Skins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- With help from an injection to numb the  
pain, Jake Plummer expects to play against the Washington Redskins 
on Sunday night despite a hip pointer that has kept him out of 
practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not big on using pain-killers, but with the importance of  
this game, us going into the bye week with an even record is very 
important for us, and that's something I want to do,'' the Arizona 
Cardinals' quarterback said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be able to play Sunday, because I think it helps the  
team's chances. Right now, I think with the pain-killer I will be 
able to play,'' Plummer said. ``I came back in the game last 
weekend after taking the pain-killer, and the pain went away in my 
hip, so I know that the pain-killer does work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer was hurt when he was tackled while scrambling early in  
the third quarter of last Sunday's 14-3 victory over the New York 
Giants. Sandwiched between two defenders, he hurt his hip and ribs. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury came just as he finally was recovering from a  
sprained right thumb that severely limited his practice time since 
the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've played a lot of football and until now I've been  
injury-free,'' Plummer said. ``These things are going to happen in 
the sport we're in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer said the injury affects him whenever he tries to throw  
with any authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hips, that's where you make your money throwing the  
ball,'' Plummer said. ``You get the torque and you get the twisting 
and the motion there. It's all generated from that left hip, the 
one that leads, and that's the one that's hurting me now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can stand and throw it 15 or 20 yards, but that's when I'm  
standing flat-footed. If I step into it, that's where I feel a 
little pain. We'll just have to keep getting treatment on it, and 
by Sunday hopefully it goes away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants game was Plummer's best of the season. After throwing  
13 interceptions and two touchdowns in his first four games, he 
completed 13 of 19 for 156 yards and a touchdown in a little more 
than one half of play. He did not throw an interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Vince Tobin said Plummer seems to be feeling better each  
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He missed two very valuable days of practice, which you don't  
like to see, but sometimes that happens, because the objective is 
to get him healthy enough to play on Sunday,'' Tobin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer might have his favorite target, wide receiver Rob Moore,  
who missed the last two games with a strained hamstring. Moore 
participated in part of Thursday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	However, cornerback Tommy Knight sprained his left ankle. Knight  
was the projected starter because Corey Chavous has a sprained 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be OK,'' said Knight, bothered by injuries  
throughout his NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive ends Simeon Rice and Andre Wadsworth also sat out the  
practice -- Rice with a bruised thigh and Wadsworth with a sore toe 
-- but both are expected to play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Cardinals said defensive tackle Mark Smith has  
told them that noted knee specialist Dr. Richard Steadman will 
perform arthroscopic surgery on Smith's right knee. The surgery 
won't be done until Oct. 25, because Steadman isn't available until 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	Steadman performed the second surgery on Eric Swann's arthritic  
right knee last year after Swann was dissatisfied with the results 
of his first surgery, done by team doctor Russell Chick.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Exposing to AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A man infected with AIDS was sentenced  
to 17 years Friday for exposing three unsuspecting women to the 
deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Jones, 37, faced up to 60 years after pleading guilty to  
nine counts of criminal exposure to AIDS and three counts of 
statutory rape involving one of the women. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the women was 17 when she began an affair with Jones. She  
later had his baby and is now HIV positive. The other two women 
have tested negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had pleaded guilty on the second day of his trial in July.  
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Jackson County, Mich., brought and then dismissed  
AIDS exposure charges against Jones in 1994 involving two women 
there. Jones is from Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones sobbed throughout Friday's hearing as his attorneys tried  
to calm him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to be loved, your honor,'' he told Knox County  
Criminal Court Judge Ray Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to be rejected. All my life, I've been  
rejected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jenkins said the punishment should be strong, considering  
the number of victims, the degree of personal injury and the length 
of time over which the crimes happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew he had the virus, then he moved South to inflict this  
disease or expose this disease to three victims,'' Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones apparently contracted AIDS through heterosexual sex. He  
was first diagnosed in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said one of Jones' victims didn't learn that he  
was infected until a detective showed up to arrest him on charges 
of having sex with the teen-ager. Another victim found out by 
reading about Jones in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they were pleased with the sentence, while  
Jones' attorneys called it excessive. Jones will be eligible for 
parole after serving 30 percent of the sentence.

<HEADLINE> Agribusiness Merger Stoppage Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm-state Democrats upset with the Clinton  
administration's handling of recent mergers in the agribusiness 
industry proposed an 18-month moratorium Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through the exercise of raw power and unfair tactics,  
corporate agribusiness interests have family farmers on the 
ropes,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``The Justice Department is 
supposed to be the referee, but it has not stepped in to keep the 
fight fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the latest deals, Smithfield Foods Inc. of Smithfield,  
Va., the biggest pork processor as well as the largest hog 
producer, is seeking the department's approval to acquire No. 2 
producer Murphy Family Farms of Rose Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the department allowed Cargill Inc., North America's  
second-largest grain trader, to acquire the grain operations of 
Continental Grain, provided the companies sold some of their 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials have said it is in the interest of  
farmers for U.S. companies to cut their costs because they have to 
compete overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This industry is restructuring like a lot of industries  
outside of agriculture in response to many economic factors,'' said 
Janet Riley, a spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute, which 
represents packers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agricultural economy is stuck in its worst downturn  
since the mid-1980s, and although economists blame it on 
overproduction of crops and livestock, many lawmakers have been 
pointing to agribusiness mergers as a culprit. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation was also proposed in the Senate Friday that would  
ban Smithfield and other meatpackers from owning livestock. Packers 
can manipulate prices more easily when they own their own cattle or 
hogs, said Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D. The sponsors include two 
Republicans, Charles Grassley of Iowa and Craig Thomas of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers won a battle with the packers this week when the  
Senate gave final approval to legislation that would require them 
to start reporting the prices they pay for cattle and hogs. 
Producers say that it will make it easier for them to bargain with 
the packers. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed moratorium would apply to mergers involving at  
least one firm with revenue or assets of more than $100 million.

<HEADLINE> Chimpanzee in Custody Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST COVINA, Calif. (AP) -- He's been described as ``a good  
citizen'' and ``a political prisoner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moe the chimpanzee, the subject of an emotional custody dispute,  
is having his day in court and it's creating a local sensation. 
</P>
<P>
	An army of lawyers is fighting over whether Moe, who has bitten  
a couple of people, should remain in quarantine or be allowed to 
return to his surrogate parents, St. James and LaDonna Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Davises rescued him from the wilds of Africa 30 years ago  
when his mother was killed by poachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want our family back together,'' a weeping St. James Davis  
told reporters outside the local courthouse on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Picketers -- mostly neighbors who have lived on the same street  
as Moe for years -- marched with signs saying, ``Bring Moe Home,'' 
``West Covina Loves Moe'' and ``Moe is a political prisoner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He causes a lot less problems than the kids in the  
neighborhood,'' said Susan Stewart, calling Moe ``a good citizen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had tried to evict Moe from West Covina in the 1960s  
but a judge let him stay, saying the chimp ``doesn't have the 
traits of a wild animal and was somewhat better behaved than some 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moe went on to become a local celebrity, appearing at ribbon  
cuttings, helping sell cookies for the Girl Scouts, even appearing 
in a movie or two. 
</P>
<P>
	His troubles began in August 1998 when a worker fixing something  
in Moe's cage accidentally caused an electrical shock to the chimp. 
Moe panicked, escaped and ran through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal control officers tried to calm him, neighbors said, but  
police roared up with flashing lights and sirens and Moe became 
more agitated. He bit a police officer and an animal control 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a community relations officer asked to visit Moe.  
Sheryl Ortiz was told not to go too close, according to the 
Davises, but she stuck her finger into Moe's cage. At first he 
sucked on the finger, then he bit off the tip. 
</P>
<P>
	They explained that because he likes red licorice, he thought he  
was biting into a piece of the candy when he saw her red nail 
polish. 
</P>
<P>
	Moe has been taken to the Wildlife Way Station to be  
quarantined. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Court Judge Carol Williams Elswick postponed all  
action until Nov. 19, expressing hope that the parties will reach 
an out-of-court settlement.

<HEADLINE> Incumbent Ky. Gov. Not Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Gov. Paul Patton isn't seeking re-election  
so much as a mandate. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton, a Democrat who is the first Kentucky governor in two  
centuries to be eligible to seek successive terms, has drawn no 
serious opposition. He faces an oddball Republican who was all but 
abandoned by her party, and another candidate -- adopted by the 
Reform Party -- who has lost three previous statewide campaigns and 
has backed legalization of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton has ``made a pretty good Republican,'' said GOP state  
Sen. Albert Robinson. ``I think that's one reason he's not had 
serious opposition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A millionaire former coal mine operator who served a term as  
lieutenant governor, Patton spends most of his campaign appearances 
warning supporters against complacency. He has made a plea for a 
big vote, a mandate for Patton to enter the uncharted territory of 
a second term. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working as hard as we can to produce a victory that  
will allow the governor to go into the General Assembly with what 
he hope will be a mandate,'' said Patton's campaign manager, Kim 
Geveden. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters in 1992 changed the state constitution to allow  
succession for the first time since 1799. 
</P>
<P>
	Patton has championed changes in the state's expensive workers'  
compensation program, which won him points with business groups and 
cost him the support of unions. He also rammed an overhaul of the 
state's higher education system past the political might of the 
University of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican Party failed to field a single candidate for any  
of the five other constitutional officers on the Nov. 2 ballot, 
giving Democrats a free ride. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP gubernatorial nominee is Peppy Martin, a free-lance  
publicist who has never before held political office and barely won 
her own primary over a candidate who did not campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Her most memorable campaign moments have been her choice of  
1950s-era dresses during a televised debate and primary election 
night, and her contention that she could all but eliminate state 
taxes through an ill-defined investment program in church bonds. In 
interview, she has also made wild and unsubstantiated allegations 
about the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Martin is all but ignored by fellow Republicans and raised  
only $20,903 in contributions for her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Second place in the voting may go to Gatewood Galbraith, a  
Lexington lawyer who first ran for commissioner of agriculture in 
1983 on legalize-marijuana platform. He also ran for the Democratic 
nomination for governor in 1991 and 1995. He planned an independent 
campaign this year and then won the endorsement of the Reform 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hochstetter, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors  
Association, where Patton is to take over as chairman in January if 
he is re-elected, said Patton's opponents aren't credible. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's running against a woman who comes to a debate in a prom  
dress and a self-styled leading hemp-slash-marijuana activist,'' 
Hochstetter said.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Sign Minor Leaguers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals signed right-hander  
Mike James and outfielder Steve Bieser to minor league contracts 
Friday and rehired a former general manager as a scout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals said James and Bieser would be invited to next  
year's spring training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Bing Devine, who was general manager from 1958-64 and 1968-78,  
also rejoined the team Friday as special assignment scout. Devine 
was responsible for the Cardinals acquring Lou Brock in a 1964 
trade with the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Devine most recently worked as a scout for the Houston Astros  
and Philadelphia Phillies. He also has held top executive posts 
with the New York Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals football team. 
</P>
<P>
	Devine will be responsible for scouting spring training games,  
National League clubs and the Cardinals' minor league system. He 
will report to general manager Walt Jocketty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Burris, who pitched for the Cardinals in 1986, also was  
hired as a scout/minor league pitching instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Cardinals sent six players outright to their  
Triple-A Memphis team, right-handers Mike Busby, Larry Luebbers, 
Curtis King and Clint Sodowsky; catcher Marcus Jensen; and first 
baseman-outfielder Eduardo Perez. 
</P>
<P>
	James, 32, missed most of this season, recovering from surgery  
on his right elbow and shoulder. He played eight games with the 
Anaheim Angels' Triple-A team in Edmonton, then worked out with the 
Cardinals in late September. 
</P>
<P>
	James is 13-10 with a 3.52 ERA in 184 career games with the  
Angels. He led the club with 81 games pitched in 1996, the 
third-highest total in Angels' history. 
</P>
<P>
	Bieser, 32, played for the Mets (1997) and Pittsburgh Pirates  
(1998). He split time last year between Triple-A Nashville and 
Memphis and Double-A Altoona. Bieser hit .264 with 42 RBIs and 
eight home runs.

<HEADLINE> Advice on Fighting Telemarket Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers' best weapon in the fight against  
fraud: a telephone answering machine to screen calls from 
telemarketers pushing investment schemes, according to state 
securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the mushrooming of securities fraud over the Internet,  
plenty of scams still use the older technique of making unsolicited 
calls to hook investors, they said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The current ``hotbeds'' of telemarketing fraud operations  
include California, Florida, Canada and the Caribbean, the North 
American Securities Administrators Association said in a news 
release. The group represents securities regulators in the 50 
states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	As with all kinds of consumer fraud, the elderly are especially  
vulnerable because they are more likely to be at home when the 
phone rings and can be more susceptible to high-pressure 
telemarketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer the telemarketer can keep the victim on the phone,  
the better likelihood of a sale,'' Anita O'Riordan, a telemarketing 
fraud consultant, was quoted as saying in the release. ``Anything 
to put distance and time between the fraudulent telemarketer and 
the targeted victim, the better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She suggested that people worried about their parents getting  
scammed give them an answering machine and make sure they use it to 
screen calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities regulators have cracked down in recent years on  
so-called boiler rooms, operations in which dozens of salespeople 
are packed into a room, sitting at banks of telephones and making 
hundreds of unsolicited, ``cold'' calls a day to potential 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cold-calling is not illegal as such, but it can become a vehicle  
for telemarketing fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	In the summer of 1998, for example, securities regulators in 29  
states brought 106 enforcement actions against boiler room 
operations selling small-company stocks, foreign currencies, and 
investments in gourmet coffee shops and ostrich farms. The 
enforcement actions ranged from halt-sales orders to fines to 
criminal indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of such crackdowns, regulators say big boiler rooms  
are being replaced by smaller ``rip and tear'' operations, with 
telemarketers working from home or from hotel rooms, using cell 
phones and temporary post office boxes to make it harder for 
authorities to catch them. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraudulent telemarketers increasingly are using a variety of  
channels -- Web sites, direct mail and radio and TV ``infomercials'' 
-- to solicit customers, and eventually closing the sales over the 
phone, the regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hard sell is hard to do with a computer screen,'' said  
Bill McDonald, assistant commissioner for enforcement in 
California's Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators' group advises consumers to hang up the phone on  
aggressive cold callers, beware of anyone promising a 
``once-in-a-lifetime'' opportunity or ``guaranteed returns,'' 
demand information in writing, and call their state securities 
regulator to check out an investment and the person or company 
selling it. 
</P>
<P>
	To locate a state regulator, look under ``Government'' in the  
white pages of the phone directory or call the North American 
Securities Administrators Association at 202-737-0900.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Leiter Needed Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Over and over, Al Leiter kept blaming himself.  
</P>
<P>
	He called it a ``bonehead mistake,'' a ``brain cramp,'' and said  
it cost him a win. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if he hadn't made a first-inning throwing error, you  
can't win without any runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then it cost me a no-decision,'' he said in a Mets' clubhouse  
as quiet as a funeral home, looking for any opening to pound 
himself again. ``We still might be playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just like he has all year, he gave up almost nothing in a big  
game, allowing three hits and an unearned run in seven innings. But 
his first-inning throwing error led to the only run, and the Mets 
lost 1-0 to Atlanta on Friday night, falling behind 3-0 in NL 
Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter actually outpitched Tom Glavine, who allowed at least one  
runner in each of his seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought that run would cost the game,'' Mets manager  
Bobby Valentine said. ``I felt it in my bones. Got to get some new 
bones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He thought back to Sept. 4, 1998, when the he beat Glavine 2-1  
on Mike Piazza's two-run homer. He dreamed about another two-run 
homer erasing the stigma from that bad throw. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mets still trailed by a run when Shawon Dunston pinch  
hit for Leiter in the seventh, finishing his night and probably his 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitcher put on his warmup jacket, sat in the dugout and spit  
at the ground, looking like had run through the streets of New York 
in a marathon. It seemed he had left every drop of his energy out 
on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Leiter turned cheerleader, clapping and trying to shout his  
teammates to a run after Dunston struck out but reached on a passed 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're pulling and you're cheering and you're hoping to get  
the big hit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mets didn't score then. They didn't score all night  
long. Without any runs, the best pitching in the world won't win a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Truth be told, the Braves' heralded pitching staff has been the  
difference in this series, holding New York to five runs in three 
games while the Braves have pushed just nine runners across. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets pitchers have been good, but the Braves' staff of Greg  
Maddux, John Smoltz, Kevin Millwood and Glavine has been great. 
</P>
<P>
	John Olerud is 2-for-11 without an RBI in the three games.  
Piazza is 2-for-11 with one RBI. Robin Ventura is 0-for-9 without 
an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt today was a must win, and we didn't come through,''  
Piazza said. ``That makes the task tough. We put ourselves in this 
position and we have to live with it. We have to battle and try to 
put one win on the board, and then see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, the trio combined to drive in 340  
runs, an average of more than two a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do a good job of mixing speeds,'' Olerud said. ``I've  
gotten pitches I can hit, but I've fouled them off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All that doesn't mean much to Leiter now. He gave up the  
unearned run, mainly because he walked Gerald Williams leading off 
the game and then threw away Bret Boone's comebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be the hardest thing to live with. He had no problems  
with throws to the plate, just to first base. 
</P>
<P>
	``I beat myself up in the dugout after the inning,'' he said.  
``I said: `One run, keep them there.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He listened to himself. But the way it turned out, by then it  
was too late.

<HEADLINE> Huskies Open Practice in Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Huskymania met Midnight Madness.  
</P>
<P>
	Six months after winning its first national championship,  
Connecticut treated more than 10,000 fans to Midnight Madness. The 
school unveiled a $1 million scoreboard that shows live action and 
replays, and shortly before the clock struck midnight, the crowd 
relived the highlights of the championship run. 
</P>
<P>
	With Tina Turner's ``Simply The Best'' bouncing off the walls in  
Gampel Pavilion, the 1999-00 edition of the Huskies entered through 
clouds of smoke and laser lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``During Midnight Madness last year, I told the country we had  
the best fans in the country,'' coach Jim Calhoun said. ``We need 
you all this year, because we want to try and do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest of the honors following the 77-74 victory over Duke  
to win it all last season was a White House reception on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 12:01 a.m. Saturday, the Huskies officially began working on  
defending their title, with full court drills, a slam dunk and 
3-point contests. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun's rotation will have some openings this year. Gone are  
All-America Richard Hamilton, drafted by the Washington Wizards 
after his junior year, and the Huskies also are without defensive 
stopper Ricky Moore, who graduated. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the three returning starters are seniors, 6-foot-11  
center Jake Voskuhl and 6-7 forward Kevin Freeman. The other is 
junior point guard Khalid El-Amin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first day is going to be a little different,'' Freeman  
said. ``Normally, it would be 12 guys who knew what they were 
doing. We've got some young guys that are going to be learning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the newcomers are redshirts Beau Archibald, Justin Brown  
and Ajou Ajou Deng. They are joined by freshmen Tony Robertson, 
Marcus Cox and Doug Wrenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The free festivities included fan relay contests, a unicycle  
exhibition and T-shirt giveaways. Some 2,000 fans were turned away 
from a packed Gampel Pavilion. But those who did make it were a 
handful of UConn recruits, getting a taste of big-time college 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think it's a thrill for a recruit to see what it's  
like when your fans are screaming and they're screaming your name, 
trying to get you to come to the school,'' Calhoun said.

<HEADLINE> Father: Body of Kansas Girl Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAIN VALLEY, Mo. (AP) -- A 10-year-old girl who was abducted  
while roller skating with her sister was found dead today, three 
days after she disappeared, her father said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found her, that's all I can say,'' Paul Butler tearfully  
told reporters outside Pamela Butler's home in Kansas City, Kan. 
``Please leave her mother alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Special Agent Monte Strait confirmed a body matching the  
fifth-grader's description had been found early this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 officers had searched a field and woods in Grain  
Valley, about 25 miles from her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Strait said items of clothing also were found that matched the  
description of Pamela's clothing. The clothes were found in a 
separate area, Strait said. 
</P>
<P>
	The body was found north of a church where a pickup truck  
believed to have been used in the kidnapping was spotted a few 
hours after Pamela disappeared Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what the cause of death was, Strait said, ``I don't  
want to go into any details. We still have a lot of investigating 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Keith B. Nelson, the 24-year-old suspect, was  
hospitalized with knee and ankle injuries suffered after Tuesday's 
abduction, authorities said. He was captured Thursday, ending a 
manhunt that gripped the community for two days and included a 
high-speed chase through Kansas City, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson was operated on this morning and was recovering, Lanza  
said. He could be released from the hospital as early as this 
afternoon, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had said earlier today that Nelson refused to say  
anything about the girl's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI affidavit quotes a co-worker as saying that Nelson told  
him two weeks ago that he ``would like to kidnap a girl to rape, 
torture, electrocute, kill and bury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela was skating about 5:45 p.m. Tuesday when her 11-year-old  
sister, Penny, saw a man get out of a white pickup, grab Pamela 
around the waist and throw her into the cab. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started screaming, and so did she,'' said Penny, who was on  
the front porch of her home at the time. She yelled for an older 
sister to call police. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses reported a license number after they tried to chase  
the truck, but couldn't keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck was registered to a company formerly owned by David  
Cunningham, Nelson's boss. Cunningham said Nelson had been driving 
the truck for two weeks, the FBI affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The area being searched in Grain Valley, about 25 miles  
southeast of Kansas City, is near a church where the pickup was 
found a few hours after Pamela disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	The church's custodian, who spotted the truck, also had noticed  
an afghan spread across the front seat. Police on Wednesday found 
such an afghan at the Kansas City home of Nelson's mother, Nancy 
Nelson, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	She told officers her son had been at the house and she believed  
the afghan was his. Police also found shovels with cement and dirt 
on them in her yard, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson was captured after he was spotted Thursday lying near the  
Kansas River. Police said he tried to swim away as officers 
approached. 
</P>
<P>
	The abduction led to a search by more than 100 police officers.  
Classmates decorated her home with cards made out of construction 
paper and gave teddy bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela's mother, Cherri West, made emotional appeals for the  
kidnapper to give back her daughter, going sleepless since the 
abduction and finally losing her voice after numerous interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	When told of the affidavit's contents, the girl's father, Paul  
Butler, said, ``It just rips everything apart that I was hoping 
for. Maybe he didn't get it all done, God willing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mother's hope to find her child alive has dimmed.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's just a little girl,'' her mother said. ``I don't know if  
she's alive or dead. Hope is really starting to fade away.''

<HEADLINE> Plot Leader Gets 11 Years in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Calling terrorism ``evil and ungodly,'' a man  
once characterized by prosecutors as the architect of plots to kill 
Egypt's president and blow up the United Nations was sentenced 
Friday to 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali said he was ``arrogant, immature and  
foolish'' in 1993 when he designed the plots and discussed them 
with a government informant who was secretly taping the 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey credited Siddig Ali with  
providing intelligence information to the United States that ``to a 
certain degree made up for what you did and helped the government 
not only in this case but perhaps to prevent future cases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siddig Ali of Jersey City, N.J., had pleaded guilty shortly  
after the start of a 1995 trial of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and 
others in a plot to blow up New York City landmarks and assassinate 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
	In pleading guilty to all charges against him including  
seditious conspiracy, Siddig Ali, 38, said the blind sheik had 
given him a fatwa, or religious edict, to kill Mubarak and bomb the 
landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other Islamic militants then plotted to blow up the  
United Nations, two tunnels and a bridge connecting New Jersey to 
Manhattan and FBI headquarters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks were to take place just months after the Feb. 26,  
1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed six people and injured 
more than 1,000 others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to extend my sincere apologies to the people of  
New York, to the American people for my actions,'' Siddig Ali said. 
``My actions in no way reflect the peaceful spirit of Islam nor do 
they reflect the majority of decent and peace-loving Muslims around 
the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know now more than ever that only through peaceful dialogue  
can we resolve our differences. Terrorism is evil and ungodly,'' 
Siddig Ali said. 
</P>
<P>
	A transcript of the sentencing, which was conducted secretly by  
lawyers and Mukasey, was released late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the sentence ``balances the enormity of what you  
did and intended to do against the substantial cooperation you 
provided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Siddig Ali did not testify at the trial of the sheik,  
the cleric was convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to life in 
prison without parole.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 158.62; Nasdaq Down 55.73 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled today, nearly sending the Dow  
Jones industrial average below 10,000, amid news of a spurt in 
inflation and a warning by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
against excessive optimism by investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow was off 158.62 at  
10,127.99, partially recovered from an early 241-point plunge. 
Still, the drop pushed the Dow to the lowest level since April and 
about 1,200 points below the Aug. 25 closing record of 11,326.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also bounced from their morning lows,  
but continued to hold sharp losses for the day. The 
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was down 55.73 at 
2,751.11 after halving an early 102-point plunge. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500-stock index was down 22.67 at 1,260.75. 
</P>
<P>
	The selloff followed a morning report that prices at the  
wholesale level spiked 1.1 percent in September, the largest 
increase in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the Producer Price Index, which measures  
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was much worse 
than expected. Many analysts were anticipating that prices would 
rise 0.5 percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in a speech to bankers Thursday night, Greenspan  
issued his latest call for investor sobriety at a time of robust 
economic expansion and roaring stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Both developments aggravated market fears that the Federal  
Reserve will raise interest rates for the third time this year in a 
bid to fight inflation by slowing the economy. The central bank's 
policy makers hold their next meeting Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, which could see demand for loans hurt by  
rising interest rates, led today's decline. Among the Dow's 30 
components, American Express was down 4 3/4 at 137 1/4, and J.P. Morgan 
was down 3 at 107 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the day's downward trend, Sun Microsystems surged 4  
23/32 to 94 1/8 in active Nasdaq trading after the maker of powerful 
business computers posted better than expected profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumber advancers by more than a 3-to-1  
margin overall. Trading was heavy, with 426.52 million shares 
changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, up from 393.49 
million at the same point on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas markets also took a big hit today. In Europe, Britain's  
FT-SE 100 fell 2.2 percent, Germany's DAX index fell 0.7 percent 
percent and France's CAC-40 fell 1.29 percent. Earlier, Japan's 
Nikkei stock average fell 1.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> UN Sanctions Taliban Over bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council imposed limited  
sanctions on Afghanistan's Taliban Islamic movement on Friday to 
pressure it to turn over Osama bin Laden for trial in the twin U.S. 
embassy bombings in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures will go into effect Nov. 14. That gives the Taliban  
one more month to surrender the Saudi exile for trial in the United 
States, where he has been indicted in federal court, or turn him 
over ``to appropriate authorities in a country where he will be 
arrested and effectively brought to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States drafted the resolution, which freezes the  
Taliban's overseas assets and bans flights owned, leased or 
operated by the Taliban from taking off or landing internationally. 
It allows exemptions to the flight ban for humanitarian reasons or 
to allow Afghan citizens to perform the religious pilgrimage to 
Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution demands the militia deliver bin Laden for trial  
on charges he masterminded the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in 
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed 224 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Taliban leaders have said they want proof of bin Laden's  
involvement in terrorism before turning him over, saying he is a 
guest of the Afghan people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban has been deeply distrustful of the U.S. accusations  
following the Aug. 20, 1998, American airstrikes on bin Laden's 
camps in Afghanistan, launched because of what Washington said was 
evidence bin Laden planned more attacks on Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The militia's representative in New York, Abdul Hakeem Mujahid,  
denounced Friday's vote, saying it would add misery to the 
long-suffering people of Afghanistan while undermining efforts to 
resolve the bin Laden issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did want to solve the problem by talks and negotiations and  
still it is our policy,'' Mujahid said. ``But putting pressure, it 
will have more negative effects than the positive ones, and it will 
make the problem more complicated than it was before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Taliban had offered to negotiate the issue with the  
United States but hadn't received a reply. ``My government is 
absolutely against all forms of terrorism of any kind,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. sanctions are more modest than those imposed by the  
United States earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. administration banned U.S. trade with and investment in  
Taliban-controlled parts of Afghanistan, barred Americans from 
using the Taliban-run Ariana Afghan airlines and started seizing 
the airline's $500 million in U.S. assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has also placed bin Laden on the FBI's 10  
most-wanted list and has offered a $5 million reward for his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban religious army has imposed a strict brand of Islam  
in the 90 percent of the country it controls, barring women from 
work and girls from school. 
</P>
<P>
	The Security Council has in the past threatened to take  
unspecified measures against Taliban leaders to force them to stop 
the military campaign and negotiate peace with their ethnic rivals 
in the northern part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came as Afghanistan's opposition claimed Friday to have  
captured two districts from the Taliban, killing or wounding scores 
of Taliban soldiers.

<HEADLINE> No. 1 Kafelnikov Out at CA Trophy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Nicolas Kiefer upset top-seeded Yevgeny  
Kafelnikov 6-0, 6-4 Friday to advance to the semifinals of the 
$800,000 CA Trophy tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	With a crowd of 8,000 at Vienna's Stadthalle sports arena  
cheering him on, the 22-year-old German outclassed Kafelnikov, who 
is ranked second in the world. The victory also makes Kiefer the 
fourth German after Boris Becker, Michael Stich and Tommy Haas to 
be ranked in the Top Ten in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am overjoyed,'' Kiefer said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov started the match with three double faults. The  
Russian caved in after Kiefer's second service break gave the 
German a 3-0 lead. Kiefer needed only 19 minutes to zip through the 
first five games. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second set, Kafelnikov rallied somewhat, but Kiefer was  
able to convert on his fourth match point to post his second win 
against the Russian. 
</P>
<P>
	Also advancing to the semifinals were Roger Federer, a promising  
Swiss player, and sixth-seeded Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Federer scored a 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory over Karol Kucera, who  
has a sore wrist and was forced to pull out of next week's 
tournament in Lyon, France. Federer will take his place in the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old Federer is ranked 93rd, the youngest player  
among the top 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Krajicek routed Australia's Stefan Koubek 6-2, 6-1 and will next  
play Kiefer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Krajicek served unbelievably well, and that increased the  
pressure on my own serve,'' said Koubek, who beat Goran Ivanisevic 
the day before. ``My serve today didn't go well.''

<HEADLINE> E-Mails to Gates Lead to Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A teen-ager was indicted Friday on  
extortion charges for allegedly threatening to bomb the 
headquarters of IBM and Microsoft unless each company paid him $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The threats came in e-mails addressed to Microsoft Chairman Bill  
Gates and IBM Chief Executive Officer Lou Gerstner. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted on both counts, 18-year-old Jahair Joel Navarro of  
New York could be sentenced to 40 years in prison. When he was 
first arrested in August, he was charged with threatening to use a 
weapon of mass destruction, which carries a penalty of life without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	No bombs were ever found, said FBI spokesman Joseph Valiquette.  
But a raid on the youth's apartment found literature on bomb-making 
and terrorism that had been downloaded to his computer, the 
indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
	Navarro, a Panamanian with permanent resident status, allegedly  
sent the bomb threats in August to Gerstner at IBM headquarters in 
nearby Armonk and to Gates at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, 
Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Navarro is to be arraigned Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Air Force at Crossroads Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. (AP) -- Through five games last season,  
Air Force had a 4-1 record and, with some difficult opponents 
remaining, was poised to either fashion a standout season or slouch 
toward mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons chose the former, winning their next eight games,  
including a bowl victory over Washington, in a glittering 12-1 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	They're in precisely the same position this year. And with a  
Saturday night game against Utah and, after an off week, another 
toughie against BYU, the Falcons face a crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is in a place now where it really needs to make up  
its mind which direction it's going to go,'' coach Fisher DeBerry 
said. ``We've got the potential to be a fine football team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of adversity, just like the Utah team has had.  
We don't have our quarterback. We've lost several guys who were 
proven players for the season, just like Utah has. Every team has 
that type of adversity. Players have to step up whenever they get 
an opportunity and elevate their level of play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Cale Bonds sprained his right ankle early in the San  
Diego State game two weeks ago and missed a 19-14 victory over Navy 
last week. Backup Mike Thiessen bolted 53 yards for a third-quarter 
touchdown to help spark the victory against Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBerry believes Bonds is ready to return but insists he must be  
``100 percent to play in such an important game like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah also faces some quarterback uncertainty.  
</P>
<P>
	In the second quarter of a 42-0 romp over Louisiana-Monroe last  
week, starting quarterback Darnell Arceneaux re-injured the foot he 
sprained the previous week. His availability on Saturday night 
probably will be a game-time decision. T.D. Croshaw replaced him 
and completed 9-of-17 passes for 166 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah and Air Force have played some classic games in the past,  
but because of the overinflated, 16-team Western Athletic 
Conference and resulting realignment, the teams didn't meet in 
1996, 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	That was one of the factors in Utah, Air Force and six other  
schools breaking away from the WAC to form the Mountain West 
Conference, ensuring the survival of such rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
	Their last two meetings have been memorable.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1994 at Falcon Stadium, Air Force rallied from a 17-0 deficit  
behind quarterback Beau Morgan, who was making his first career 
start, to beat the 12th-ranked Utes 40-33. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995 in Salt Lake City, Utah rallied in the final minute,  
scoring 15 points in 10 seconds to upset Air Force 22-21. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some unbelievable games with them,'' DeBerry said.  
``It's always been very, very competitive. I think it's going to be 
a great football game. It always is when Utah and Air Force play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah coach Ron McBride recalls the most recent meeting as being  
``kind of a dull game'' until the closing minutes. ``They kind of 
had it under control, then we made a couple of huge plays: the 
onside kick and then (receiver Kevin) Dyson going down the sideline 
(on a 50-yard touchdown play). All of a sudden we just took the 
game. That was a pretty interesting finish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not having played since 1995 is a problem for the Utes more than  
it is for the Falcons, McBride insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem we have is we haven't seen it (AFA's  
wishbone offense) for a few years,'' McBride said. ``When you see 
it every year, you have your package and you go up and you're ready 
to play. Your players kind of get into the rhythm. The recall is 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen it for a couple of years. To simulate the  
speed of it and make sure your (defensive) package is correct is 
difficult the first time around. In practice, it's hard to get the 
speed down of what they run. Ideally, you'd like to have a bye week 
before you play Air Force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah, also 4-1 overall, is 1-0 in the conference, having downed  
UNLV 52-14 three weeks ago. Air Force is 1-1. The Falcons bowed to 
Wyoming 10-7 but edged San Diego State 23-22.

<HEADLINE> Rahal Discusses CART Defections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SURFERS PARADISE, Australia (AP) -- When Bobby Rahal was growing  
up in the United States, he included American Mario Andretti among 
his racing heroes as well as overseas drivers Jackie Stewart and 
Bruce McLaren. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 25 years later, and with the United States-based CART  
Fed Ex race series facing a major drain of American drivers next 
year, Rahal figures racing fans in the United States feel the same 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the value of a series is not where everyone comes  
from, but the level of their talent,'' Rahal said Friday as he 
prepared his Miller Lite team of Italian Max Pappis and American 
Bryan Herta for Sunday's Gold Coast Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Montoya of Colombia is leading Scotland's Dario Franchitti  
for the season points title, with Canadian Paul Tracy third. Brazil 
leads the country standings, with Canada second and the United 
States third. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been only two CART wins by American drivers this year  
-- Michael Andretti and Herta. Next year, it might not get much 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Unser Jr. is leaving the Penske team to drive in the rival  
Indy Racing League, Scott Pruett is going to NASCAR, Herta's 
contract is not being renewed by Rahal -- although Herta could be 
signed by another team -- and P.J. Jones lost his ride this year 
with Patrick Racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Barron -- currently without a ride but reported to be under  
consideration as Herta's replacement -- Jimmy Vasser, Richie Hearn, 
Memo Gidley, Andretti and Robby Gordon -- also rumored to be 
considering NASCAR -- would be the only American drivers left on 
next year's CART series. 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave as few as five Americans -- possibly less -- out  
of 28 drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't concern Rahal, who said he will look for the best  
available driver to replace Herta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like the National Hockey League or major league baseball, it  
doesn't really matter where they come from as far as I'm 
concerned,'' Rahal said. ``I'd like it to be American, but that's 
not the deciding factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rahal said turnover on the circuit and the emergence of young  
drivers is the reason for the high number of foreign drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This series has gone through a tremendous youth movement the  
last several years,'' Rahal said. ``You don't get guys like me who 
hung around for 15 or 17 years, although Michael (Andretti) has 
been around a lot longer and he started much younger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CART president and chief executive officer Andrew Craig said  
Friday that one of the primary reasons the series acquired the Indy 
Lights and Toyota Atlantic series was to establish a ladder system 
that will increase opportunities for American drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Craig added, ``we're a sport with no borders and we believe  
that our fans expect to see the premier drivers wherever they come 
from in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rahal said foreign drivers like Pappis -- ``a very charismatic  
guy'' -- attract race fans wherever they go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it adds value to have the variation we have with  
nationalities, I don't think it harms the series,'' Rahal said. ``I 
think people are attracted to whoever puts their foot in it. Their 
names might be a little bit unusual, but talent is talent.''

<HEADLINE> Celtics Sign Battie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The Boston Celtics have signed forward  
Tony Battie to a multiyear contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Battie appeared in all 50 games last season with  
Boston, starting in 15. The 6-foot-11, 240-pound Battie averaged 
6.7 points and 6.0 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Battie is a gifted basketball player whose work ethic and  
desire to improve are tremendous,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie was acquired Jan. 21 from the Los Angeles Lakers for  
center Travis Knight. He never played for the Lakers after being 
traded, along with guard Tyronn Lue, for Nick Van Exel on June 24, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie was drafted fifth overall by the Nuggets in 1997 after  
leaving Texas Tech following his junior season.

<HEADLINE> FedEx pilots win Seniority Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Ten pilots for Federal Express Corp. have  
won a $3.59 million jury verdict in a work contract dispute with 
the cargo airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots argued the company violated rules on seniority for  
its flight crews after acquiring another airline, Flying Tigers, in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx said it will appeal the judgment handed down Thursday by a  
Chancery Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe there is any basis whatsoever in fact or in  
law in this case for this verdict,'' said company spokesman Greg 
Rossiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert L.J. Spence Jr., an attorney for five of the pilots,  
called the verdict ``a complete and total victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 140 other FedEx fliers have made similar complaints but  
have not yet gone to court with them, said M. Scott Willhite, 
co-counsel with Spence. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute centers on the company's rules for setting pilot  
seniority, which can affect promotions and pay. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx bought Flying Tigers for $880 million. That acquisition  
added 940 pilots to the 1,100 already working for FedEx. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations over work rules for the combined pilot corps led to  
a new ``master seniority list.'' Some veteran FedEx fliers said 
that list wrongly put hundreds of Flying Tigers pilots ahead of 
them in seniority.

<HEADLINE> Perfect To A Tee Favored at Laurel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUREL, Md. (AP) -- Perfect To A Tee is the early favorite in  
what's expected to be a fast 11-horse field in Saturday's $200,000 
Maryland Million Classic at Laurel Park. 
</P>
<P>
	In a field that features such speedsters as Testafly and Fred  
Bear Claw, Perfect To A Tee trainer Mary Albert said she simply 
wants her horse, ridden by Alcibiades Cortez, to stay close enough 
to make a late run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's some nice speed in there,'' Albert said.  
``We'll be sitting somewhere behind them, no doubt about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-year old has won three of nine starts this year, and  
finished in the money in four others. 
</P>
<P>
	He beat Testafly last month at Philadelphia Park after finishing  
a distant third to him in June at Laurel, and also has split with 
Fred Bear Claw. They are two of several entrants in the talented 
field that have previously traded blows with one another. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's kind of the way all these horses are,'' Albert said.  
``They've beaten each other over the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testafly finished ninth in last year's race as the 6-5 favorite  
and has won just one of his past nine races. 
</P>
<P>
	Another horse that could challenge is Fred Bear Claw, which has  
finished among the top three nine 11 times this year, including an 
August victory in an allowance at Delaware Park. In March, he won 
the $75,000 Sagamore at Laurel. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrenpeace is back again after narrowly missing a huge upset in  
last year's Classic, making up 25 lengths to finish a nose in back 
of two-time champion Algar, who is out this year with an ankle 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Praise Heaven, Steak Scam, Get The Picture, Monk's Falcon,  
Mary's Buckaroo and Testing complete the field for the 1 3/16-mile 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland Million, in its 14th year, was originally  
introduced by ABC sportscaster Jim McKay as a way to promote the 
state's thoroughbred breeding industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-race card also includes the Steeplechase, the Distaff  
Starter, the Lassie, the Distaff, the Oaks, the Ladies, the 
Nursery, the Turf, the Sprint and the Starter.

	Stocks Dive; Dow Ends Down 266.90  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials briefly fell below  
10,000 today as a whiff of inflation and a warning to investors by 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sent stocks tumbling. The 
Dow ended down 266.90 at 10,019.71 for its worst close since early 
April. The selloff followed a report revealing that prices at the 
wholesale level spiked 1.1 percent in September, the largest 
increase in nine years. Greenspan issued his latest warning about 
investor exuberance at a time of robust economic expansion and 
roaring stock markets. Both developments aggravated market fears 
that the Fed will raise interest rates to fight inflation by 
slowing the economy.

	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine captain was charged with  
negligent homicide in the killing of a corporal who died after 
completing an eight-mile hike at the camp in July. Capt. Victor A. 
Arana, 28, of DuPage County, Ill., was accused of marching his unit 
too fast with not enough time for breaks. Camp Lejeune spokesman 
Capt. James Rich said today that temperatures were 80 to 85 degrees 
when began Cpl. Giuseppe Leto, 21, of Milford, Conn. began the 
hike. Arana also was charged with dereliction of duty and failing 
to obey a lawful order. If convicted, he could get more than 3 1/2 
years in prison and be dismissed from the Marines.

	Schindler's Original List Said Found  
</P>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- The original ``Schindler's List'' of  
Jewish workers reportedly has been found in a suitcase full of 
papers left to a German couple. A newspaper reported today that the 
Stuttgart couple, relatives of close friends of Oskar Schindler, 
found among the papers the list of 1,200 employees who were to be 
saved from Nazi death camps. Schindler wrote the names of 1,200 
Jews at the Plaszow concentration camp and gave it to the Nazi SS, 
saying the people on the list were needed for employment at his 
factory in Krakow, Poland, Mordechai Paldiel said. He added 
fictitious jobs for each worker to convince Nazi officials that 
they were vital to the war effort and should live.

	U.S. To Investigate Korea Massacre

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Defense Department's investigation of an  
alleged mass-killing of civilian refugees by U.S. soldiers during 
the Korean War will seek to find the truth ``no matter where it 
leads,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen pledged in a letter to 
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. The letter, dated Oct. 8, was 
made available to reporters today at the Pentagon. On Sept. 30, The 
Associated Press reported accounts by American veterans and South 
Korean villagers who said they saw U.S. soldiers kill up to 400 
civilians at No Gun Ri, South Korea, early in the war.

to rest and sun themselves. ``Last night, one came out and stopped 
in the middle of the street, blocking traffic,'' taxi driver Ruben 
Mendoza said. ``It was very big. No one wanted to move it. It was 
frightening.'' Local environmental officials are warning residents 
to call authorities rather than try to move or overpower the 
crocodiles, which range in size from 3 feet to 8 feet.

Greenspan also repeated his warning that banks will remain safe for 
people to keep their cash.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Reacquire Winger Jody Hull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Flyers acquired right wing Jody Hull  
from the Atlanta Thrashers on Friday, hoping he will help the 
winless Philadelphia team defend leads and kill penalties, team 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull, 30, registered 14 points and 12 penalty minutes in 72  
games for the Flyers last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we need to sure ourselves up defensively. Jody did  
a real good job last year for us that way. That's what we're hoping 
he'll be able to do again,'' coach Roger Neilson said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 195 pounder may play in Saturday's game against  
Detroit, Neilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull, an 11-year NHL veteran, was selected by the Thrashers in  
the expansion draft on June 25 but did not appear in any 
regular-season games with Atlanta. He was acquired by the Flyers in 
exchange for future considerations.

<HEADLINE> Political Cartoonists Meet in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- For editorial cartoonists considering who  
the next president should be, Texas Gov. George W. Bush would win 
the draw -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
	Some cartoonists say Bush, the son of a former president, would  
be easier to caricature than Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trying to draw Al Gore is like trying to breathe life into a  
piece of used carpet,'' said Steve Benson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning 
political cartoonist at The Arizona Republic. ``He doesn't have 
much going for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Benson, as well as Brian Duffy of The Des Moines Register,  
Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner, would be more fun 
to sketch. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of characteristics that his father had that I  
could just borrow and use for him -- just squash the face down a 
little bit, put pointy ears on and change the hair style,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably the one that if cartoonists had to vote for,  
would be not just better for your country, but better for our 
profession,'' said Duffy, the only cartoonist in the country to 
have his work featured on the front page every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Though their comments are lighthearted, some of the nation's  
leading editorial cartoonists are gathering at the University of 
Iowa for a symposium, called ``Drawing the Line: Political 
Cartooning Under Pressure,'' which ends today. 
</P>
<P>
	According to John Soloski, director of the School of Journalism  
and Mass Communication at Iowa, editorial cartoonists are going the 
way of the typewriter at many newspapers across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The symposium, held in conjunction with the journalism school's  
75th anniversary celebration, is ``to really draw attention to what 
could be an endangered species in American journalism,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 150 editorial cartoonists work full-time at U.S.  
newspapers and the number shrinks every year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer newspapers, competition on the Internet and other sources  
are responsible, some cartoonists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a dying profession, but there are fewer cartoonists  
than there were. One of the first places executives go to cut staff 
is editorial cartoonists, or when one retires or leaves, they're 
not replaced. I think that's really sad,'' said John Sherffius of 
the St. Louis Post Dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are seen (as) more of a luxury than a necessity,''  
Benson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Political cartoonists say their goal each day is to promote  
thought, reaction and debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, as Benson says, ``The editorial cartoonist's primary goal is  
to throw the first punch in a bar fight and stand back and watch 
everybody else swing in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Pett, cartoonist at The Lexington Herald-Leader, said too  
many editors underestimate the power of a political cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Editorial cartoons are sort of the newspaper equivalent of a  
sound bite -- they're great,'' said Pett, immediate past president 
of the American Association of Editorial Cartoonists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how many newspapers have a lot of ponderous  
editorials and columns -- and I read them and I like them -- but 
hardly any cartoons. I think that's a real mistake,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soloski agreed: ``There's probably no part of a daily newspaper  
that day in and day out draws as much reader reaction as the 
editorial cartoon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherffius can attest to that.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, when St. Louis Cardinals' slugger Mark McGwire  
acknowledged he used androstenedione, Sherffius drew cartoons 
condemning use of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried not to condemn him. For instance, I didn't draw him  
with big breasts or anything like that,'' he said. ``But I must 
say, every time I've done anything criticizing 'andro,' I've gotten 
a number of calls and letters -- probably the angriest response 
since I've been here -- from people who said I was picking on Mark 
McGwire.''

<HEADLINE> Irene Affecting Sporting Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Two college football games, one involving No. 24  
Miami, and two major thoroughbred races were postponed Friday 
because of Hurricane Irene. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Hurricanes rescheduled their Saturday game with Temple  
because the Owls had trouble getting a flight to South Florida. The 
game will be played Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Bethune-Cookman College postponed its game against South  
Carolina State in Daytona Beach. The game, which had been scheduled 
for Saturday night, will be played Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Many high school games in South Florida were also postponed.  
</P>
<P>
	The Festival of the Sun, Calder Race Course's annual marquee  
event, was postponed until Oct. 23. The festival includes two 
$400,000 stakes races. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Florida bumped the start time of its game against  
Nicholls State from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. in hopes of missing most of 
the effects of Irene. The rest of the state's college football 
games remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Wake Forest at No. 1 Florida State and Greensboro College at  
Jacksonville are scheduled to play Saturday. No. 7 Florida is 
playing at Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sports events in the state are not expected to be affected  
by the weather.

<HEADLINE> Chandler Return Will Boost Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- With Chris Chandler likely to start Sunday,  
the Atlanta Falcons improved their chances of getting back into the 
NFC West race. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves upgraded the quarterback's status to probable  
after practice Thursday. A Pro Bowl selection the last two years, 
Chandler has missed three of the last four games with a strained 
right hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say he's been upgraded from questionable to  
probable,'' said coach Dan Reeves, whose Falcons (1-4) will face 
the St. Louis Rams (4-0) at the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks pretty good. He's had two good days of practice. I  
think he'll be able to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler, a 12-year veteran, was injured at the end of the  
season opener. After sitting out the next game, he tried to come 
back too soon in the Falcons' 34-7 loss at St. Louis on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	He played only the opening quarter and completed 5 of 9 passes  
for only 28 yards and one interception. Chandler, who was not 
available for comment after practice, has not played since. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is 17-4 when Chandler has started and finished a game --  
including 10-1 last season when the Falcons went to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	With Chandler out and running back Jamal Anderson sidelined for  
the season with a knee injury, the Falcons' offense has stalled. 
They are averaging 12.2 points per game -- third-worst in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating because we know we're a better football team  
than the numbers show,'' center Robbie Tobeck said. ``It's not an 
excuse for us to say we've missed Chris and Jamal -- it's a fact. 
Those are the kinds of players you can't replace. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that doesn't mean we can't be a good football team. There  
are still enough players left from a team that went to the Super 
Bowl to get out of the mess we put ourselves in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backup quarterback Tony Graziani has thrown for only 509 yards  
and two touchdowns. The running game hasn't done much either. Byron 
Hanspard is averaging only 3 yards per carry, Ken Oxendine 2.7 
yards and neither has scored a touchdown.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Erected To Honor Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The first permanent memorial outside of  
Germany to honor 11 Israeli athletes and officials killed by 
terrorists at the 1972 Munich Olympics was unveiled today at the 
site of the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial stands outside Sydney's Olympic showpiece, Stadium  
Australia, and is suspended from one of 16 light towers along the 
Olympic plaza dedicated to all the modern Games. 
</P>
<P>
	It consists of a stainless steel panel with the names of the 11  
dead and, above it, a blue glass panel displays Hebrew inscriptions 
on one side and a Biblical passage on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	On the morning of Sept. 5, 1972, eight Palestinian terrorists  
broke into the Olympic village in Munich and went to the dormitory 
of the Israeli team. Two Israelis were killed instantly and another 
nine were taken hostage. 
</P>
<P>
	The terrorists demanded the release of 200 prisoners from  
Israeli jails, and safe passage for themselves out of Germany. They 
got as far as a military airport where West German police killed 
three of the terrorists. However, the battle that ensued left all 
the hostages dead.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Debate Opens Hotly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For two of the main antagonists in the  
campaign finance debate, a Senate bill that would overhaul 
fund-raising rules is either a much-needed reform of money's 
influence in politics or an infringement on the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side flinched as well-worn opening arguments began  
Thursday on the legislation, which centers on a proposed ban of 
``soft money'' given to political parties that is unregulated by 
the federal government. Debate was to continue today. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this fight is all about is taking the $100,000 check out  
of American politics for good,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a 
GOP presidential candidate and leading supporter of changing the 
present system. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who chairs the GOP senatorial  
campaign committee and is vowing to filibuster the bill, called it 
an ``assault on freedom.'' Opposition to it, he said, was evidence 
of ``a constituency for protecting constitutional freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate has become something of an annual Senate ritual in  
recent years, with sponsors struggling unsuccessfully to overcome 
blocking tactics by Republicans who say the measure violates the 
free speech guarantees of the Constitution. In an effort to avoid a 
similar fate this year, McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., 
decided to bring a stripped-down measure to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the ban on ``soft money'' in federal campaigns,  
the bill also would give nonunion members the ability to stop 
unions from using their mandatory dues money for political 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton added a voice in support of the bill in a  
letter to Senate leaders. The president also urged adoption of 
amendments to bring the bill in line with recently passed House 
legislation that contains more sweeping restrictions on campaign 
fund-raising and spending. 
</P>
<P>
	One provision added on a 77-20 vote Thursday would require more  
timely reporting of fund-raising reports, including increased 
electronic distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	No sooner had Senate debate opened than McConnell sought to  
place McCain on the defensive on an issue that the Arizonan has 
made a centerpiece of his bid for the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell quoted the fellow Republican as often having said that  
``we are all corrupted'' by the current system of campaign fund 
raising. He referred to a Web site page that cited a link between 
soft money donations and wasteful ``pork-barrel spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is corruption, someone must be corrupt,'' he said,  
challenging McCain to name names among his colleagues in Congress. 
``It's like saying the gang is corrupt but none of the gangsters is 
corrupt,'' McConnell added. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said, ``I plead guilty'' to seeking  
money for one of the examples cited on the Web site, $2.2 million 
for federal funding for sewer construction to coincide with the 
2002 Winter Olympics in his state. 
</P>
<P>
	But, noting that he cannot raise soft money, he challenged  
McCain to answer these questions: 
</P>
<P>
	``Who gave the soft money? How much was it and where did it go''  
that resulted in any decision to insert funds into a spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, in general rebuttal, said he believed that soft money  
was a ``key ingredient'' in wasteful spending and special interest 
tax breaks. He cited a dictionary definition for corruption as 
``the impairment of integrity'' and said he believed that unlimited 
amounts of campaign money were ``impairing our integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The parliamentary maneuvering was intense at times.  
</P>
<P>
	As a result of a gambit by McConnell, supporters found  
themselves in a position of needing a two-thirds vote of the 
100-member Senate to break a filibuster -- even more than the 60 
votes that have eluded them in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's aides later said the maneuver was of little import,  
though, since it could be readily reversed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell later said he would not press the issue, telling  
reporters, ``We are not placing a requirement on the other side to 
get a 67-vote threshold.''

<HEADLINE> Time Running Out on Young's Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The San Francisco 49ers already have  
been without injured Steve Young for two weeks. Now, they're facing 
the probability that they'll never get him back. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, sidelined indefinitely by lingering symptoms from his  
fourth concussion in three years, is still clinging to faint hopes 
that his problems will somehow clear up. 
</P>
<P>
	But the problem is his history of concussions and the risks  
posed by repeat episodes if he keeps playing. And without coming 
out and saying it directly, the signals from his doctor, agent, 
coach, and the team's general manager all point toward the 
38-year-old Young having to retire from football. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's trying to hang on because he's so darn good at it,''  
coach Steve Mariucci said Thursday. ``Certainly, in Steve's mind, 
there is some hope, somewhere he's reaching for some hope that, 
`Hey, I'll be back.' That's what he thinks about. That's why I 
don't think it's going to happen today or tomorrow. We're going to 
give it it's due time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bill Walsh said the 49ers, who play Carolina on  
Sunday, are girding for life without Young, who led the team to its 
last Super Bowl championship in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just play. This is part of the game,'' Walsh said. ``You've  
seen people out for the season with injuries and people just keep 
on playing. We've had more than our share, with Garrison Hearst 
being added to it. But it can hit anybody at any time in the sports 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gary Steinberg, the chief of neurosurgery at Stanford  
Medical School and Young's neurologist, gave Young and the 49ers 
his recommendation on whether the two-time NFL MVP should continue 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, Steinberg, Mariucci and Walsh all declined to discuss the  
nature of the doctor's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only one who can answer that question is Steve Young,''  
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Walsh said he met with Young, discussed his future and  
encouraged Young to seek additional medical opinions, leading to 
the possible conclusion the doctor recommended Young retire because 
of the potential for long-term health risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five to 10 years from now, when he's feeling really fit, he's  
going to say, `Why didn't I play football?' '' Walsh said. ``I took 
the advice of one physician. I should have really checked into it. 
I want to make sure he really checks into everything. He has to 
have more than one opinion, just for his own well-being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said there might be a formal announcement of Young's  
future in the next two weeks. Young, who declined comment Thursday, 
also is expected to meet with his agent, Leigh Steinberg on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to remember Steve has been playing football all his  
life and for anyone to think that this process is going to be real 
quick and rapid, it's not going to happen that way,'' Leigh 
Steinberg said. ``It's a deliberate process. But all the people 
around Steve are trying to help him do the right things. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing is, he's not playing right now so he's not hurting  
himself. He's 38 and he does have the right to make up his own mind 
about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steinberg said Young has shown improvement since the hit 2 1/2  
weeks ago that caused his latest concussion. However, Young 
underwent a series of neurological tests Wednesday and again failed 
to be cleared to rejoin the 49ers on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason he hasn't been cleared to play up until now is that  
it's my opinion and the opinion of the 49ers that it's in the best 
interest of Steve Young to allow his brain to recover,'' Steinberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who endured two concussions in 1996 and another in the  
1997 season opener, suffered the latest one when he was leveled by 
blitzing Arizona cornerback Aeneas Williams and struck his head on 
tackle Dave Fiore's knee before slamming into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steinberg said there were no signs of bruising or permanent  
damage to Young's brain but there are dangers from repeated 
concussions, which can lead to premature senility and other brain 
dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be cautious in our recommendation,'' he said.  
``This is an unpredictable kind of event. You don't have a crystal 
ball to tell what's going to happen in any particular case. But my 
advice is my opinion and I don't dictate what the ultimate team 
decision is or Steve Young's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said Young is being realistic about the situation and the  
49ers management was there to help him along with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	And if he can't make it on his own?  
</P>
<P>
	``We're here,'' Walsh said. ``It would fall on us.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Schools Chief Defies Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The superintendent of the nation's  
second-largest school district says he is still in charge, though 
everyone who used to work for him is under orders to report to 
someone else. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is only one superintendent in charge of this district  
and you are looking at him,'' Superintendent Ruben Zacarias said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The district is struggling with low test scores and a scandal  
over a $200 million high school built on a badly polluted site. On 
Monday, the school board voted to appoint Howard Miller chief 
executive and gave him ``complete authority'' over everything from 
construction to instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Zacarias met with Miller and then asserted that he  
was still the boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can always use an extra pair of hands.'' Zacarias said ``Mr.  
Miller does report to me. He takes direction from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, board members are preparing a package to buy out the  
remaining 18 months of Zacarias' contract, the Los Angeles Times 
reported today, citing sources it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Zacarias ``has no interest in a buyout'' but would have no  
choice if a board majority approves the offer, said Brad Sales, a 
spokesman for the superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	Becki Robinson, vice president of United Teachers-Los Angeles,  
the union for instructors in the 700,000-student district, called 
the situation ``very distressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We seem to have a train speeding down the track without a  
conductor on board -- or two conductors wanting to go in different 
directions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanic lawmakers who support Zacarias were angry at the  
appointment of Miller by newly elected school board members. 
</P>
<P>
	``By expanding his authority, they have violated the goodwill  
and trust we placed on these individuals,'' said state Sen. Richard 
Polanco, a Democrat. ``It's a clear-cut attempted coup by a shadowy 
corporate elite entity, and we won't stand for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was a school board member in the 1970s until he was  
recalled in a voter backlash against the use of forced busing to 
integrate schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, he was appointed head of the troubled facilities  
division after the board determined that development plans for 100 
new schools were so far behind that the district probably would 
miss a July deadline to qualify for up to $900 million in state 
bond money. 
</P>
<P>
	As CEO, his marching orders include assembling a crisis  
management team to make a ``top-to-bottom'' management review and 
recommend a reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was given until Oct. 22 to recommend action against nine  
school district managers involved in the fiasco over the Belmont 
Learning Center -- the nation's costliest high school. Construction 
began on the school even though its site, a former gas and oil 
field, emits explosive methane and other toxic gases. 
</P>
<P>
	District officials are still deciding whether the school should  
ever open.

<HEADLINE> Armenian Charged in Bombing Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A prominent Armenian-American activist was  
charged with plotting attacks against Turkish targets in the United 
States for two decades, including a bombing that injured three in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourad Topalian, chairman of the Armenian National Committee of  
America, was arrested Thursday on charges of conspiracy, concealing 
and storing stolen explosives, improper storage of explosives, 
possession of machine guns and possession of firearms with defaced 
serial numbers. He could get 31 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment charged Topalian with directing a group that  
stole weapons and explosives used in a car bombing outside the 
Turkish mission to the United Nations in New York City in October 
1980. Three people were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Emily Sweeney said the alleged plot was intended  
to draw attention to Armenian claims that some 1.5 million people 
were slaughtered in 1915 as part of a campaign of genocide aimed at 
forcing the Armenian population from the eastern Ottoman Empire. 
Turkey says there was no systematic campaign of slaughter and that 
many Armenians fled during the war and the civil unrest that 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Topalian, who works as an administrator at a local junior  
college, appeared in U.S. District Court today to surrender his 
passport. He declined to comment after a brief hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Aram Hamparian, executive director of the Washington-based  
activist group that Topalian chairs, had no comment this morning on 
the indictment, saying, ``We're just learning the facts of the 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the investigation began with the 1996 discovery  
of weapons and explosives in a suburban Bedford storage garage that 
was opened after the rent went unpaid for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the indictment, Topalian was questioned in 1988  
about the New York bombing and denied any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Topalian also was accused of sending people to Massachusetts and  
Beirut, Lebanon, for weapons and bomb training. The indictment said 
Topalian demonstrated how to use submachine guns at a camp in 
Franklin, Mass., in 1976 and 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also mentions two 1981 California bombings in  
which no one was hurt but it did not specify whether Topalian was 
involved. They were at the Orange County Convention Center in 
Anaheim and the Turkish consulate in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Before taking a job at Cuyahoga Community College this year,  
Topalian worked as a consultant to the president of Citibank 
Florida from 1995 and helped Miami attract a $130 million federal 
job training grant. He attended a March 1996 White House coffee 
session with other political and community leaders to discuss 
issues with President Clinton, the White House confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Wrong Place Dangerous in Talladega </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) -- The key to staying out of trouble at  
Talladega Superspeedway is being in the right place when the 
inevitable happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it is where you are when it gets ready to hit the  
fan,'' said Ward Burton, one of five drivers in Sunday's Winston 
500 with a shot at a $1 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	To earn the money, offered by series sponsor Winston, Burton has  
to win on a track where he has had more than his share of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been on both sides of it,'' Burton said. ``I've caused  
one accident here. I made one error that turned into a huge problem 
for a lot of drivers. Then I've been caught up in a lot of problems 
that weren't of my making, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you can be really careful and still make a mistake and  
cause a big wreck, too. The cars are just so bunched up here. It's 
almost inevitable that it's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is restrictor-plate racing.  
</P>
<P>
	``You wake up in the morning with an ache in the pit of your  
stomach,'' said Jeff Burton, Ward's younger brother. ``I don't get 
nervous before any races with the exception of Daytona and 
Talladega.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those are the two longest and fastest ovals on NASCAR's top  
circuit, and the only tracks at which the sanctioning body requires 
carburetor restrictor plates to keep the cars under 200 mph in the 
interest of safety for both the drivers and the spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	The plates reduce airflow to the carburetor, thereby cutting  
considerable horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
	It works as intended, but the consequence is that cars all have  
about the same horsepower, keeping them bunched up. That, added to 
a slower throttle response, virtually guarantees at least one 
multi-car crash during each race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult when you're running 20th and the leader is a  
second ahead of you and you're sitting there just hoping to miss 
the wreck,'' said Jeff Burton, also eligible for the $1 million, 
along with Mark Martin, Jeremy Mayfield and Kevin Lepage. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the danger lurking on Talladega's 2.66-mile oval, Dale  
Earnhardt says the plates have taken some of the racing fun here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy racing on the big tracks, but it used to be more fun  
than it is now because we could run wide open with no restrictor 
plates,'' said Earnhardt, who won the spring race in Talladega, as 
well as last year's Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the restrictor plates, you would carry so much speed  
going into the corners that you had to lift to make it around. Now, 
it's straight leg, foot to the floor all the way around the track, 
and the first one that lifts goes back to the end of the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, as much success as Earnhardt, known as a master of drafting  
in Daytona and Talladega, has had at the big tracks, he knows how 
fast they can bite you. 
</P>
<P>
	He was caught up in a 21-car crash in Talladega in April 1998  
that relegated him to a 36th-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward Burton said, ``You've got to be good and you've got to be  
lucky to win at Talladega. You can't be one or the other. You have 
to be both. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll give you a good example. In April, we had a really good  
car, a top-five car that had a chance to win the race. Bad luck is 
another car running into us on pit road and doing enough damage to 
completely take us out of the running for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, it's on the track where most of the problems arise in  
Talladadga. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big wreck is the thing that's on everybody's mind once the  
race starts,'' Ward said. ``If you're going to win the race, you 
have to finish. You start figuring that big wreck is going to 
happen at some point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The older Burton noted Talladega is one of the few tracks where  
running near the rear of the field early could become an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at the big wreck in the first Talladega race last year.  
There were a bunch of guys struggling a little bit during the day, 
but then a bunch of cars starting running into each other with 
about 40 laps to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ones who missed the wreck ended up with, at the worst,  
halfway-decent finishes. The wrecks went to the garage and had a 
terrible day.''

	The euro was quoted at $1.0880 in late European trading, up from  
1.0785. Later, in midday trading in New York, the euro traded at 
$1.0881.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Inspect Visitors' Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Plans for perhaps the biggest Capitol  
construction project since the 1850s moved a little closer to 
reality Friday as a panel of lawmakers took their first official 
look at a model for a $250 million underground visitors center. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Sen. Strom Thurmond,  
R-S.C., co-chaired the first meeting of the Capitol Preservation 
Commission, which will decide whether to accept, alter or reject a 
general design plan submitted by the Architect of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to lay out what the steps are and to get an  
agreement that we can support,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll also need to consider how we might proceed to raise the  
additional funds necessary to complete the visitors center,'' 
Thurmond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has spent a decade considering the idea of a center to  
give up to 18,000 tourists a day access to historical displays, 
bathrooms and food as they wait to begin tours, freeing them from 
long lines in the winter cold and summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican opposition to the cost put the plan on hold in 1991.  
It was revived only after a gunman shot his way into the building 
last year and killing two police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Current plans foresee a three-level underground structure  
totaling 558,000 square feet set into the east side of the Capitol, 
across the street from the Supreme Court and one of the Library of 
Congress' buildings. The Capitol contains 775,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step will be development of a detailed design and  
engineering, a process expected to take more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Constructing the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center remains one of  
our highest priorities, and today's meeting brought us one 
significant step closer to making that vision a reality,'' said a 
commission statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 federal budget included $100 million for planning,  
engineering, designing and constructing the center but also made 
provisions for private donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they are planning for the center to open in  
January 2005.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Before the game, John Rocker gave autographs to  
the New York Mets fans. Afterwards, he pumped his fist at the 
crowd, then lingered on the field as a handful of fans shouted 
profanities at their target. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to shut anybody up is to come in and close the  
door,'' Rocker said Friday night after pitching a hitless ninth to 
complete the Atlanta Braves' 1-0 victory over the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't slip up and say the things I've said and then go out  
and blow the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker quieted most of the sellout crowd of 55,911, helping put  
the Mets down 3-0 in the best-of-7 National League Championship 
Series. For most of the night, he was their target. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's some of the most offensive things I ever heard. I  
couldn't even repeat them on TV, and I'm tired of hearing it,'' he 
said, ``People will say a lot of stuff to you if there's a fence 
between you and them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Rocker walked out of the Atlanta dugout during batting  
practice, he was greeted by game-level booing. He walked down the 
third-base line toward left field, took off his cap and waved to 
the crowd a few times, then went to the front-row seats and started 
signing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was about what I expected,'' Rocker said, holding up a page  
from a New York tabloid targeting his prior remarks. ``It's a lot 
of fun to know that I can get in these people's heads and can get 
them to react the way I want them to. All that does is fire me 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker became a target by saying Mets fans were ``stupid.'' He  
spent most of the game in the bullpen, watching fans react. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quarters, bottles, batteries. I think somebody threw a  
bagel,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vulgarity you have to hear, the sexually explicit remarks,  
the objects being thrown at you, that kind of stuff is going too 
far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Braves third baseman Chipper Jones enraged Mets fans last month  
when, after Atlanta dropped New York two games back with three to 
go, he said: ``This is the next-best thing to winning the World 
Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Annoyed by taunts from the Shea Stadium fans, he responded in  
kind: ``I told them to go home and put their Yankees stuff on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mets fans greeted him Friday with slow chants of ``Lar-ry,  
Lar-ry,'' which is his given name but one he doesn't like. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't that bad. You tune it out,'' Jones said. ``I told  
myself that I wasn't going to acknowledge any jeers or look at any 
signs or do anything that didn't have to do with between the white 
lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans brought signs, among them:  
</P>
<P>
	``I Want To Fight John Rocker.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Hey Rocker -- You Reek.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Yo, Larry. Fuhget About It.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I Wanna Fight John Rocker.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Hey Chipper -- Heroes Don't Commit Adultery.''  
</P>
<P>
	The latter referred to an affair Jones admitted just before he  
and his wife began divorce proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker's latest remarks did not please Braves manager Bobby Cox,  
and the pitcher said he apologized to his manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it irritates me,'' Cox said before the game. ``I don't  
like it. I don't condone it. He was roughed up by the fans, I 
think, our first series here out in the outfield. And he's the type 
of guy that's going to give it right back to them. He's got to work 
on that. He's a great pitcher, a great competitor, but he needs to 
work on his player-fan relationships.''

<HEADLINE> Banks Help Bush's Campaign Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Employees of MBNA Corp., a major bank and  
issuer of credit cards with two major issues before Congress, were 
the biggest contributors to Gov. George W. Bush's presidential 
campaign in the last three months, an analysis shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, former Sen. Bill Bradley's biggest donors during the  
period were employees of the same Wall Street investment houses 
that have supported him throughout his campaign, according to an 
Associated Press computer analysis of contributions to the 
presidential candidates. Bradley is a former consultant to 
financial companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore's top givers were lawyers.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Republican front-runner, raised another $20.2 million  
between July 1 and Sept. 30, bringing his record-setting total to 
$57.4 million. He raised $77,400 from employees of MBNA Corp., the 
nation's second largest issuer of credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is considering legislation to allow banks, insurance  
companies and investment houses to enter each other's markets -- a 
measure sought by all three industries -- and a credit card 
industry-backed bill to overhaul bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also raised $54,750 from employees of Ernst &AMP; Young, an  
accounting firm that lobbies on behalf of electric utilities and 
the high-technology industry, among other clients. Ernst &AMP; Young 
also has been a big financial backer of Gore's presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley outraised Gore in the third quarter of 1999, taking in  
$7.3 million compared with $6.8 million by the vice president. Gore 
also received $534,293 from his general election fund for legal and 
accounting expenses to pay a share of fund-raising costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, Gore's only rival for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, raised $167,200 from employees of Goldman Sachs, 
$75,450 from employees of Lehman Brothers, and $63,440 from 
employees of Merrill Lynch, which also is pushing for the banking 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore took in $21,750 from members of the law firm of Mayer,  
Brown &AMP; Platt, which lobbies on behalf of such companies as Boeing, 
General Electric and United Parcel Service; and $20,750 from 
members of the law firm of Robins, Kaplan, Miller &AMP; Ciresi, whose 
clients include Honeywell. 
</P>
<P>
	``They represent a pretty elite and rarefied group of  
interests,'' said Sheila Krumholtz, research director for the 
Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. 
``These players are among the top bundlers cycle after cycle and, 
of course, they have specific legislative agendas that they are 
pursing. Their giving represents all of the reasons their clients 
are hiring them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush not only raised more money than any other presidential  
candidate, he also spent more. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent $12.8 million in the period, more than doubling his  
campaign expenditures. Overall, Bush has spent $19 million, 
including $7.1 million on fund raising and $2.9 million on travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have to watch his money,'' said Candice Nelson, an  
associate professor of political science at American University. 
``He can spend as much as he needs to. Even doing that, he will 
have enough left over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush even has spent more money than Steve Forbes, who has pumped  
$16.3 million of his own money into the campaign and raised another 
$4.5 million. Forbes spent almost $19 million, including $4 million 
on advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col said much of the money has  
gone to build campaign operations in 10 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to have grassroots organization,'' Dal Col said.  
``We're the only campaign that's organized in all the early 
states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, Gore has spent $14.6 million to  
Bradley's $8.5 million. And Bradley had more money in the bank as 
of Sept. 30, $10.7 million compared with Gore's $10.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has spent as much on salaries -- $2.2 million -- as Bush has  
spent to run his campaign headquarters, including rent, office 
equipment and taxes in addition to payroll. Bradley, spent $1.5 
million on salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also has spent twice as much as Bradley on polling,  
$387,844 to $173,189.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Resort Plan May Be Scrapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALAT, Vietnam (AP) -- A $706 million plan to build Vietnam's  
biggest tourist resort may be dismantled after the Singapore 
consortium slated to finance it postponed its investment 
indefinitely, according to Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	The project's demise would be a serious blow to Lam Dong, the  
central highlands province for which it was planned. Provincial 
leaders had hoped money spent by an anticipated 300,000 additional 
tourists each year would triple local incomes after a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	An executive at LKN Management Service Co., a member of the  
project's Singapore-based consultancy team, said domestic financial 
constraints faced by consortium members mean ``there will be no 
further movement'' on the Dankia project in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal to build the Dalat Dankia Resort was approved by Hanoi  
in January 1998 after nearly six years of talks. Work hasn't 
started on the 5,750-acre project, which would include two golf 
courses, a theater, a botanical garden and a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Singapore investors are NatSteel Resorts International, a  
unit of NatSteel Ltd.; Singapore Leisure Industries; and LKN 
Construction, a unit of Lim Kah Ngam Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Leaky Defense Costs Mets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the beginning, the New York Mets couldn't  
handle the baseball. In the end, that was the difference that cost 
them Game 3 of the National League championship series against 
Atlanta Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The sure-handed Mets defense led the majors with just 68 errors  
all season and was a cornerstone of the team's dash to the 
playoffs. Their .989 fielding percentage was the highest in major 
league history and the 68 errors were the fewest ever by a team in 
a season. New York went 38 consecutive games from May 26-July 6 
without allowing an unearned run. 
</P>
<P>
	But that changed suddenly in the first inning and contributed to  
a 1-0 Atlanta victory that left the Braves one victory away from 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta scored an unearned run without benefit of a hit --  
something that almost never happened to the Mets this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets starter Al Leiter walked leadoff man Gerald Williams and  
then Bret Boone tapped a ball back to the mound. It looked like a 
double play opportunity, but Leiter turned it into a disaster 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the pitcher looked at second base, where it seemed he had  
a good shot at Williams. Then he changed his mind and threw high 
and wide to first, pulling John Olerud off the base for an error. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of two out and none on, the Braves had none out and two  
on. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chipper Jones popped up, Atlanta manager Bobby Cox forced  
the issue, sending the runners. Catcher Mike Piazza's throw to 
second sailed into center field, allowing Williams to score and 
Boone to reach third. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time all season that the Mets made two errors  
in an inning and it came from two of the team's few weak links 
defensively. Leiter led Mets pitchers with four errors and Piazza 
led the team with 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The miscues seemed to wake up New York's defense.  
</P>
<P>
	When Brian Jordan flied to center, Boone tried to score and was  
thrown out at the plate by rookie Melvin Mora. Piazza grabbed 
Mora's throw and held onto the ball as Boone bowled him over. The 
catcher suffered a slight concussion on the play 
</P>
<P>
	In the second inning, with runners at first and second and none  
out after Leiter's wild-pitch third strike to leadoff man Andruw 
Jones, the Mets cut off the rally when Robin Ventura turned Brian 
Hunter's line drive into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth, Chipper Jones singled leading off but was thrown  
out trying to stretch the hit by left fielder Rickey Henderson. In 
the fifth, Eddie Perez tried the same thing with the same result. 
Henderson, who did not have an assist during the regular season, 
tied a playoff record with the two throws. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Rey Ordonez contributed a sliding stop in the hole to  
throw out Boone in the sixth and grabbed Hunter's line drive to end 
the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense was back in business. But by then, it was too late  
to do the Mets any good.

<HEADLINE> Chandler Return Will Boost Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- With Chris Chandler likely to start Sunday,  
the Atlanta Falcons improved their chances of getting back into the 
NFC West race. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves upgraded the quarterback's status to probable  
after practice Thursday. A Pro Bowl selection the last two years, 
Chandler has missed three of the last four games with a strained 
right hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say he's been upgraded from questionable to  
probable,'' said coach Dan Reeves, whose Falcons (1-4) will face 
the St. Louis Rams (4-0) at the Georgia Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks pretty good. He's had two good days of practice. I  
think he'll be able to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler, a 12-year veteran, was injured at the end of the  
season opener. After sitting out the next game, he tried to come 
back too soon in the Falcons' 34-7 loss at St. Louis on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	He played only the opening quarter and completed 5 of 9 passes  
for only 28 yards and one interception. Chandler, who was not 
available for comment after practice, has not played since. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is 17-4 when Chandler has started and finished a game --  
including 10-1 last season when the Falcons went to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	With Chandler out and running back Jamal Anderson sidelined for  
the season with a knee injury, the Falcons' offense has stalled. 
They are averaging 12.2 points per game -- third-worst in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating because we know we're a better football team  
than the numbers show,'' center Robbie Tobeck said. ``It's not an 
excuse for us to say we've missed Chris and Jamal -- it's a fact. 
Those are the kinds of players you can't replace. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that doesn't mean we can't be a good football team. There  
are still enough players left from a team that went to the Super 
Bowl to get out of the mess we put ourselves in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backup quarterback Tony Graziani has thrown for only 509 yards  
and two touchdowns. The running game hasn't done much either. Byron 
Hanspard is averaging only 3 yards per carry, Ken Oxendine 2.7 
yards and neither has scored a touchdown.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Hope To Eat Their Cake Too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The big sheet cake was set on a counter in the  
Boston Red Sox clubhouse. In red letters on the white frosting was 
the message: ``Kill those Yankees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A team photo was set into the top. Last year's. You could tell  
by looking at the player at the far left in the front row -- Mo 
Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a reminder of what Boston had overcome, the loss of its  
top slugger to free agency. And that was just the start of a series 
of adversities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox had injuries to key players, came back from an 0-2  
deficit to win the best-of-5 AL division series against Cleveland 
and now trail New York 2-0 in the best-of-7 AL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	But they'll be home Saturday with baseball's best pitcher, Pedro  
Martinez, in a dream matchup against former Boston ace Roger 
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something I'll never forget,'' said Bret Saberhagen,  
Boston's scheduled starter in Game 4 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox will be surrounded by screaming, abusive fans who  
seem to share the sentiment expressed on the cake. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliever Rod Beck, with Boston less than two months, felt their  
fervor when they hooted Cleveland's slumping right fielder Manny 
Ramirez in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost like a religious experience when Ramirez was out  
there. He hadn't gotten any hits. (They chanted) `Manny's hitless, 
Manny's hitless,''' Beck said Friday. ``I was standing in the 
bullpen going, `Oh my God.' And that was the Indians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And these are the Yankees -- the hated Yankees as they are known  
to Red Sox fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston manager Jimy Williams wasn't getting his blood pressure  
up over his team's predicament against the defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
	He decided not to hold an off-day workout Friday but discussed  
the reasons for his team's resilience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Focus. Attitude. Will to win. Desire to want to play. Win this  
one game. Make it simple,'' he said. ``This is about the way we 
focused from the outset of our first practice in spring training. 
We have bounced back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox lost closer Tom Gordon for most of the second half  
of the season and endured a series of late-season injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman John Valentin missed nearly all of September with  
a knee injury, Martinez strained a back muscle in Game 1 against 
Cleveland, and Nomar Garciaparra hurt his right wrist when he was 
hit by a pitch with nine days left in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	After all those setbacks, the Red Sox are still playing.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have done it all year,'' Martinez said. ``If we did it  
against Cleveland, we could do it against anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players who showed up Friday to talk with reporters wore casual  
street clothes, relaxed in chairs in front of their lockers and 
exuded a calm confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a unique group of guys that sets what happened  
yesterday behind them and focuses on today,'' catcher Jason Varitek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees edged the Red Sox on Wednesday and Thursday nights,  
4-3 in 10 innings and 3-2, at Yankee Stadium where the home team 
got most of the breaks -- from an umpire's bad call to blasts by 
Boston's Troy O'Leary and Varitek that missed clearing the 
right-field fence by inches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it had a chance to go out,'' O'Leary said. ``When I  
got to second base (Yankees shortstop Derek) Jeter was saying the 
wind was blowing in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston did speed its own demise. Beck allowed Bernie Williams'  
winning homer in Game 1, and the Red Sox left 13 runners on base in 
Game 2. Yet they almost won both. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't come up with the big hit,'' Varitek said, ``but it  
can happen'' Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Yankees really beat us up and just dominated us we'd  
have second thoughts,'' Saberhagen said. ``Having come back from 
2-0 against Cleveland, we have a feeling we can do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend in Fenway Park, the Red Sox beat Cleveland 9-3 and  
23-7, forcing a fifth game that they won 12-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentin, hitless in his first 10 at-bats in the series, had two  
homers and seven RBIs in the 23-7 win. O'Leary, 2-for-17 to that 
point, hit a grand slam and three-run homer in the clinching 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra played well after being sidelined for Game 3. And  
Martinez returned from his injury to finish Game 5 with six innings 
of hitless relief. 
</P>
<P>
	After overcoming all that and preseason forecasts that they had  
little chance to make the playoffs, the Red Sox are optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	So what if they have to win four of five games to reach the  
World Series? 
</P>
<P>
	``We just go out there and we're not afraid. You know? We're not  
afraid,'' Valentin said. ``It doesn't matter who you are. When you 
don't have any fear, you can go a long way.''

<HEADLINE> Furniture Sellers Believe in Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIGH POINT, N.C. (AP) -- When Jay Busey's son suggested he take  
his Shaw Furniture Galleries online, his initial reaction was, ``No 
way, you have to touch it and feel it to buy furniture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he thinks differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``Customers do want to buy on the Internet. They're buying every  
day,'' said Busey, president and chief executive officer of Shaw 
Furniture Galleries, a living.com company. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief reason consumers log onto his site is convenience.  
</P>
<P>
	``When a customer wants information, they want it quickly,'' he  
said. ``This is why they turn to the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While e-commerce represents a minuscule segment of furniture  
sales at the dawn of the new century, it is expected to grow 
steadily, a panel of furniture sellers and industry experts agreed 
Thursday as the International Home Furnishings Market opened its 
nine-day fall run. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real key is helping local retailers understand that this  
is just a small piece of the total pie,'' said Steve Antisdel, 
president of FurnitureFind.com, which expects to finish the year 
with $12 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	That's just a tiny fraction of the amount of sales posted by  
traditional furniture stores. The U.S. retail market is $55 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``My belief is that it (e-commerce) will grow the industry  
rather than take away from the traditional retailers,'' said 
Antisdel. ``It will help consumers educate themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analyst Jerry Epperson isn't a believer just yet, but  
admitted he was intrigued by the number of people at the market who 
want to talk to him about e-commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is the gold rush of our age,'' he said Thursday.  
``The last time we had a gold rush, the ones who made money were 
those people who were selling picks and shovels. Not too many 
people found gold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, he said, online retailers that deliver solid  
customer service along with slick Web pages and computer graphics 
will be the ones who survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials estimate e-commerce now represents about $100  
million of the total retail furniture market, but by 2003, the 
amount of goods sold over the Internet will grow to $1.5 billion -- 
still just 3 percent of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	But some are strongly resisting the push by some to take the  
industry online. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan Cutler, furniture analyst with BDO Seidman L.L.P. in High  
Point, touched upon the dissension within the industry over the 
value of e-commerce when he introduced three panelists, whom he 
described as pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these people are hated and reviled by the full-service  
furniture stores. In fact, they are called `dot-commies,''' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest furniture trade show, which runs through  
Oct. 22, draws about 70,000 people from all 50 states and more than 
100 foreign countries. Buyers can choose from more than 2,400 
exhibitors that fill more than 8 million square feet of showroom 
space in High Point and nearby Thomasville.

<P>
	The mood at the start of the show was upbeat.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite a recent rise in interest rates, Epperson said consumers  
are continuing to buy new homes along with the things they need to 
furnish them. That signals good things for people in the industry, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials expect overall 1999 furniture shipments to  
eclipse last year's record figures. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American Furniture Manufacturers Association's  
latest quarterly forecast, 1999, furniture shipments should 
approach $25 billion -- an 8 percent increase over 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail sales will exceed $61 billion this year, the forecast  
says, a 5.5 percent increase over 1998. Retail sales are expected 
to be nearly $63.9 billion in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFMA forecasts shipments of wood furniture to increase 8.7  
percent to nearly $12 billion; shipments of upholstered furniture 
are expected to rise 10.3 percent to $10.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Texas Man Accused of Aiding Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLEASANTON, Texas (AP) -- A housemate of the man who ambushed  
officers earlier this week, killing three before killing himself, 
was arrested today on charges he helped the man plan and carry out 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Vodochodsky, 19, was booked into the Atascosa County  
Jail early today, Department of Public Safety spokesman Tela Mange 
said. He was charged with three counts of capital murder and two of 
attempted capital murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Jeremiah Engleton, 21, who had been jailed early  
Tuesday for beating his wife, made a bogus 911 call later that day 
and then ambushed officers one by one as they arrived outside 
Vodochodsky's trailer home on the edge of Pleasanton. Three were 
killed and two others wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Engleton held 75 officers off for two more hours before shooting  
himself as they closed in, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found evidence that Vodochodsky took ``an active  
role in planning and carrying out the attack,'' Ms. Mange said. She 
had no detail on what officers think his precise role was. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodochodsky had told reporters Thursday that Engleton, his wife  
and two children had lived in Vodochodsky's trailer for the past 
six months with him and his family. He said he and Engleton worked 
together on a construction job. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodochodsky said Engleton had been upset because he believed his  
wife had had an affair, but ``I didn't think that he'd do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officers who were killed were Atascosa County sheriff's  
deputies Thomas Monse, 31, and Mark Stephenson, 31, and Department 
of Public Safety trooper Terry Miller, 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Tommy Williams had speculated Thursday that Engleton may  
have been angry at officers for jailing him after he beat his wife. 
When he got out of jail, she wasn't home because a family violence 
counselor had persuaded her to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found photographs of his wife in the trash.

<HEADLINE> BoSox Stanley Hopeful for Game 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox first baseman Mike Stanley had his  
injured right wrist wrapped in ice Friday but felt he'd be able to 
play Saturday in Game 3 of the AL championship series against the 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley's wrist was bruised in the eighth inning of Thursday's  
3-2 loss that put New York ahead 2-0 in the best-of-7 AL 
championship series. He was hit by a pitch from Jeff Nelson and 
Damon Buford came in to run for him. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is in the same spot where Nomar Garciaparra was hit  
by a pitch from Baltimore's Al Reyes on Sept. 25. That bruise 
forced Garciaparra to miss Game 3 of the AL division series against 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obviously sore at the point of impact,'' Stanley said  
Friday. ``I've never been hit in the wrist. I know in that area the 
bones aren't as strong or durable as in other areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had been worried the wrist might be broken, but  
X-rays were negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Daubach, the designated hitter in the first two games  
against New York, probably would play first base if Stanley can't. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston relief pitcher Rich Garces, who pitched Wednesday night  
but wasn't available Thursday night because of a painful arm, said 
he'd be ready Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CATCHING ON:* After spending most of the season as a backup to  
Jorge Posada, Yankees catcher Joe Girardi is getting most of the 
playing time in the ALCS. 
</P>
<P>
	Posada started Game 1 against Boston, but Girardi caught Game 2.  
And manager Joe Torre said Girardi would start Games 3 and 4, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I am a Joe Girardi person, not to say that I am not a  
Jorge Posada person,'' Torre said Friday. ``Jorge has got a ton of 
ability. One thing he doesn't have that Joe has is the experience. 
Joe has done it in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a great deal of confidence in Joe Girardi, as far as  
using the fingers behind the plate, having a sense of what is going 
on and I sense the pitchers are comfortable with him,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Posada played 112 games during the regular season, batting .245  
with 12 home runs and 57 RBIs. Girardi played 65 games, hitting 
.239 with two homers and 27 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is nothing more than experience,'' Torre said. ``Jorge  
Posada caught most of the games this year. He will catch even more 
next year, and he is the future of the organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO WORK, ALL PLAY:* Boston manager Jimy Williams wanted to give  
his players the day off, but baseball rules required them to be at 
the park on Friday for the media. 
</P>
<P>
	So the players milled around the clubhouse, got treatment and  
talked to reporters. But they didn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said earlier in the week that he would ask the league  
for permission to skip the workout. ``If they say we all have to be 
there, we'll all be there,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the team was reportedly fined $50,000 for not making  
an off-day workout mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HE AIN'T HEAVY:* Boston's Game 2 starter, Ramon Martinez, said  
his brother, Pedro, who will start Game 3, won't be affected by the 
circus atmosphere surrounding the matchup against Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you're going to see is the same Pedro,'' said Ramon, who  
is four years older. ``I don't think even Game 7 of the World 
Series he's going to change anything.''

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Debate Opens Hotly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For two of the main antagonists in the  
campaign finance debate, a Senate bill that would overhaul 
fund-raising rules is either a much-needed reform of money's 
influence in politics or an infringement on the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side flinched as well-worn opening arguments began  
Thursday on the legislation, which centers on a proposed ban of 
``soft money'' given to political parties that is unregulated by 
the federal government. Debate was to continue today. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this fight is all about is taking the $100,000 check out  
of American politics for good,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a 
GOP presidential candidate and leading supporter of changing the 
present system. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who chairs the GOP senatorial  
campaign committee and is vowing to filibuster the bill, called it 
an ``assault on freedom.'' Opposition to it, he said, was evidence 
of ``a constituency for protecting constitutional freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate has become something of an annual Senate ritual in  
recent years, with sponsors struggling unsuccessfully to overcome 
blocking tactics by Republicans who say the measure violates the 
free speech guarantees of the Constitution. In an effort to avoid a 
similar fate this year, McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., 
decided to bring a stripped-down measure to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the ban on ``soft money'' in federal campaigns,  
the bill also would give nonunion members the ability to stop 
unions from using their mandatory dues money for political 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton added a voice in support of the bill in a  
letter to Senate leaders. The president also urged adoption of 
amendments to bring the bill in line with recently passed House 
legislation that contains more sweeping restrictions on campaign 
fund-raising and spending. 
</P>
<P>
	One provision added on a 77-20 vote Thursday would require more  
timely reporting of fund-raising reports, including increased 
electronic distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	No sooner had Senate debate opened than McConnell sought to  
place McCain on the defensive on an issue that the Arizonan has 
made a centerpiece of his bid for the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell quoted the fellow Republican as often having said that  
``we are all corrupted'' by the current system of campaign fund 
raising. He referred to a Web site page that cited a link between 
soft money donations and wasteful ``pork-barrel spending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is corruption, someone must be corrupt,'' he said,  
challenging McCain to name names among his colleagues in Congress. 
``It's like saying the gang is corrupt but none of the gangsters is 
corrupt,'' McConnell added. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said, ``I plead guilty'' to seeking  
money for one of the examples cited on the Web site, $2.2 million 
for federal funding for sewer construction to coincide with the 
2002 Winter Olympics in his state. 
</P>
<P>
	But, noting that he cannot raise soft money, he challenged  
McCain to answer these questions: 
</P>
<P>
	``Who gave the soft money? How much was it and where did it go''  
that resulted in any decision to insert funds into a spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, in general rebuttal, said he believed that soft money  
was a ``key ingredient'' in wasteful spending and special interest 
tax breaks. He cited a dictionary definition for corruption as 
``the impairment of integrity'' and said he believed that unlimited 
amounts of campaign money were ``impairing our integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The parliamentary maneuvering was intense at times.  
</P>
<P>
	As a result of a gambit by McConnell, supporters found  
themselves in a position of needing a two-thirds vote of the 
100-member Senate to break a filibuster -- even more than the 60 
votes that have eluded them in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's aides later said the maneuver was of little import,  
though, since it could be readily reversed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell later said he would not press the issue, telling  
reporters, ``We are not placing a requirement on the other side to 
get a 67-vote threshold.''

<HEADLINE> FedEx pilots win Seniority Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Ten pilots for Federal Express Corp. have  
won a $3.59 million jury verdict in a work contract dispute with 
the cargo airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots argued the company violated rules on seniority for  
its flight crews after acquiring another airline, Flying Tigers, in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx said it will appeal the judgment handed down Thursday by a  
Chancery Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe there is any basis whatsoever in fact or in  
law in this case for this verdict,'' said company spokesman Greg 
Rossiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert L.J. Spence Jr., an attorney for five of the pilots,  
called the verdict ``a complete and total victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 140 other FedEx fliers have made similar complaints but  
have not yet gone to court with them, said M. Scott Willhite, 
co-counsel with Spence. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute centers on the company's rules for setting pilot  
seniority, which can affect promotions and pay. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx bought Flying Tigers for $880 million. That acquisition  
added 940 pilots to the 1,100 already working for FedEx. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations over work rules for the combined pilot corps led to  
a new ``master seniority list.'' Some veteran FedEx fliers said 
that list wrongly put hundreds of Flying Tigers pilots ahead of 
them in seniority.

<HEADLINE> Justice Ginsburg on the Mend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said  
Friday she is still ``a little wobbly'' after her surgery last 
month for colon cancer, ``but I progress steadily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg, the second woman to serve on the nation's highest  
court, spoke to the International Women's Forum, an organization of 
female leaders from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I accepted the invitation to be with you at this  
conference, I did not know how thankful I would be just to be 
here,'' said Ginsburg to loud applause from the audience. ``I am 
still mending, but I progress steadily since my Sept. 17 surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Your invitation, though I remain a little wobbly, was  
irresistible,'' the justice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg, 66, had part of her colon removed, and afterward  
doctors reported the cancer had not spread to any lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
	She had fallen ill over the summer and initially was treated for  
a gastric disorder. A court spokeswoman said that led doctors to 
discover the cancerous tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg told the members of the women's organization she is  
proud to call herself a feminist. 
</P>
<P>
	She said there are ``too many people who regard feminism with  
suspicion, people who are uncomforted by the very word, and even 
people who call it the f-word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best advice she ever received, Ginsburg said, came from her  
mother-in-law on her wedding day: ``It pays sometimes to be a 
little deaf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she has followed that advice at home and at work,  
sometimes ``even in relating to my colleagues at the Supreme 
Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with Ginsburg were Israeli Supreme Court Justice Dalia  
Dorner and Philippines Supreme Court Justice Consuelo 
Ynares-Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ynares-Santiago said her nation's highest court has taken the  
lead in combating sexual harassment in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorner said Israel does not have an overall equality law, but  
her court has sought to fill the gaps ``by finding a broader right 
to equality'' in a basic law that guarantees human dignity and 
freedom.

<HEADLINE> Ramblin' Wreck Heads to Duke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- It's little comfort to Duke that the first  
team to stop Georgia Tech's offense this season was, well, Georgia 
Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 8 Yellow Jackets turned the ball over six times last  
Saturday in a 31-24 overtime victory against North Carolina -- the 
first time in five games Georgia Tech hasn't reached the 35-point 
plateau. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke coach Carl Franks doesn't expect his team to get much  
charity from the Yellow Jackets (4-1, 2-1 Atlantic Coast 
Conference) on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The turnovers, which is very unusual for them, gave North  
Carolina a tremendous opportunity to have a chance to win that 
game,'' Franks said. ``If they don't have the turnovers it may not 
be close. I know they have worked like crazy all week to correct 
those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (1-4, 1-1) gave up 51 points to No. 1 Florida  
State two weeks ago. However, Franks isn't sure the Yellow Jackets' 
offense -- with a variety of formations that can drive a defensive 
coordinator dizzy -- isn't better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what Georgia Tech does is much more difficult,''  
Franks said when comparing the two high-scoring teams. 
``Defensively, you have to adjust everything to their formations 
and sets. You could call a blitz but you don't know what they're 
going to come out in and move guys around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Tech has pretty much had its way with the Blue Devils  
this decade, going 8-1. That includes four straight wins in which 
the Yellow Jackets have scored at least 37 points in each game. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's biggest fear is getting into a shootout. That's unlikely  
since the Blue Devils' highest scoring output in 1999 was their 
24-17 double-overtime victory at Virginia last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're probably not real worried about our offense or our  
defense as well as they've been playing,'' Franks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary admits he worked his team hard  
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you are pleased with where they are at, you are  
sending the wrong message,'' O'Leary said. ``My job is to get them 
to do things they don't want to do. There is no comfort zone. I try 
to make them understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defenses have been searching for possible ways to slow down  
Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton, the nation's top-ranked 
passer who has become the top target for opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The diminutive Hamilton enters this weekend's game with 18  
touchdowns in five games for the nation's best offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's exciting like Charlie Ward,'' Franks said, comparing him  
to the 1993 Heisman Trophy winner from Florida State. ``When he 
can't find somebody open that's when the excitement really starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you've got everybody covered and you think you've got him  
in the pocket he can bust out of there and it's hard to grab his 
flags and get him down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Leary said he's starting to see teams using eight or nine  
defenders near the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It stops the power run game,'' O'Leary said. ``They have an  
extra guy to where you can't block him. But if you're doing that 
then you better be solid in your coverage. You can't be good on 
both in the same down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke has been outscored 34-3 in the first quarter this season,  
and 77-19 in the first half.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Get Financing for NY Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clintons, who plan to move to New York  
after the president leaves office, have found a mortgage lender for 
their new home. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, dropped  
an earlier plan to rely on a prominent Democratic fund-raiser, 
Terry McAuliffe, for financial backing. 
</P>
<P>
	``After they had the initial contract ... they had an  
opportunity to look hard at different financing options,'' Jim 
Kennedy, spokesman for the White House counsel's office, said 
Thursday. ``This home purchase has had a fair amount of publicity 
and I think stimulated a lot of offers from different mortgage 
companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons sought the $1.7 million house in Chappaqua to allow  
Mrs. Clinton to establish residency in anticipation of her bid for 
a Senate seat next year. They expect to close on the property Nov. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	The new $1.36 million loan from PNC Mortgage Corp. of America is  
a conventional 30-year adjustable rate mortgage, but the interest 
rate is locked in at 7.5 percent for the first three years, Kennedy 
said. Later, the rate will adjust annually to reflect the one-year 
Treasury bill rate plus 2.75 percent.

<HEADLINE> Griese To Start at QB for Broncos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Brian Griese -- not Bubby Brister -- will be the  
starting quarterback for the Denver Broncos in Sunday's home game 
against the Green Bay Packers, coach Mike Shanahan said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan said earlier in the week that Brister, sidelined by a  
strained oblique muscle on his left side, needed to practice by 
Friday if he expected to play this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister tried to throw before Friday's practice, but said he was  
still suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will not be able to go, so Brian will be No. 1 and Chris  
(Miller) will be No. 2,'' Shanahan said, adding that he hoped 
Brister would be ready to play again next week. ``It keeps on 
improving,'' Shanahan said. ``He just can't torque it. He can throw 
it, but to go in his normal full rotation it's bothering him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griese found out before Friday's practice that he would be start  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old started the first four games for Denver, but was  
benched and replaced by Brister after an 0-4 start. 
</P>
<P>
	Griese got his job back when the Broncos learned shortly before  
last week's game against the Oakland Raiders that Brister would be 
out with injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL said it has fined the Broncos $25,000 for not promptly  
reporting Brister's injury to the league. Brister was hurt on 
Friday, but the Broncos didn't list him as injured until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Griese led the Broncos to a 16-13 win, their first of the  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't pretty by any means, especially on my part. There  
are a lot of things I could have done better, and I plan to do 
those things this week,'' Griese said. ``I have more confidence, I 
think the team has more confidence, and I know they have more 
confidence in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Derek Loville, who had been listed as questionable  
on the Broncos' lengthy injury report with a strained hamstring, 
also will not play Sunday, Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That hamstring is still tight, I'd say it's about 80 percent,  
hopefully with four to five days' rest he'll be able to go next 
week,'' he said of Loville, the designated starter after Terrell 
Davis' season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Rod Smith, who has a strained groin, returned to  
practice Friday but is still listed as questionable for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Center K.C. Jones and tight end Shannon Sharpe have been  
declared inactive.

<HEADLINE> Ex-U.N. Ambassador Has Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Andrew Young, the former United Nations  
ambassador and Atlanta mayor who helped bring the Olympics to the 
city in 1996, announced today that he has early-stage prostate 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, 67, will have surgery in December at Emory University  
Hospital to remove his prostate, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many of my friends and colleagues have had this operation,  
and at a much younger age, that I consider it a blessing that I've 
made it almost to age 68 with no difficulties,'' Young said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to encourage middle-aged and older men to have regular  
prostate screenings and to do everything they can to lead a healthy 
and spiritually fulfilling life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Echols, a spokesman for Atlanta's Olympic organization, said  
a routine test in late September prompted doctors to do an 
ultrasound and then a biopsy of the prostate tissue, which was 
determined to be cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prognosis ... is good because the cancer has been caught  
at the early stage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Echols said the surgery was put off until December to allow time  
for Young to rearrange his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he was in Washington to testify before a  
congressional subcommittee investigating gifts to International 
Olympic Committee members by Atlanta's bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, Young was elected mayor of Atlanta. He served two terms  
and during the later part of his second term was a key player in 
the effort to get the 1996 Olympics for Atlanta. He continued his 
effort after leaving office in early 1990; the choice was announced 
later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Young is chairman of Atlanta-based Goodworks  
International, a consulting company that brings together investors 
and entrepreneurs, particularly in Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, Young served as executive director of the Southern  
Christian Leadership Conference, which Martin Luther King Jr. 
founded. In 1972, Young was elected to the House of 
Representatives, becoming the first black Georgian sent to Congress 
since Reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jimmy Carter was elected president in 1976, Carter  
appointed Young as ambassador to the United Nations, where he 
served until 1979. Young resigned amid uproar over a clandestine 
meeting he had with members of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization.

<HEADLINE> Downed Lines Kill 5 in Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Hurricane Irene unloaded up to 18 inches of rain on  
Florida, flooding the streets of Miami, stalling cars and knocking 
out power to 1.4 million people Friday. Five pedestrians were 
electrocuted by downed power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	With winds of 75 mph, Irene was a relatively weak hurricane, but  
its heavy rain and sluggish pace made it a menace. And forecasters 
warned it was on a path that could bring more misery to 
flood-ravaged North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered flooding was reported in a 200-mile area from Key West  
to West Palm Beach. In Miami, police listed at least 65 streets, 
including major intersections, with floodwaters at least 6 inches 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Broward County, where streets also had 2 to 6  
inches of water, three teen-agers and a woman in her 50s were 
electrocuted in an intersection after a power line fell, said 
Broward County Fire Rescue spokesman Todd LeDuc. Minutes later a 
child was electrocuted in another part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been given out the message all day that you need to stay  
inside,'' LeDuc said. ``This is not the time to do damage 
assessment. We have lines down throughout the county.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas urged employers to let  
workers go home early to ease traffic. ``It's like a permanent high 
tide,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The floodwaters left cars stalled in the streets and thwarted  
drivers' attempts to get home. The county said 18 inches of rain 
fell on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael LaCombe, 21, was trying to drive from his job in Miami  
to his home 12 miles north in Aventura when his car conked out. 
``This is ridiculous,'' a soaked LaCombe said after pushing his car 
out of shin-deep water. ``I should have called in sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm moved through the Florida Keys and rolled ashore  
Friday afternoon near Cape Sable, 75 miles southwest of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m., it was about 25 miles southwest of West Palm Beach,  
moving north-northeast around 13 mph. It was expected to maintain 
that motion before leaving the state on the east coast near Cape 
Canaveral sometime Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before striking Florida, Irene drenched Cuba's tobacco fields  
and collapsed buildings in Havana, where at least two people were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, 1.4 million people lost power with no hope of  
getting it restored until Saturday, Florida Power &AMP; Light Co. said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Hurricane Center in Miami had to switch over to  
backup generators when the power went out for about 30 seconds and 
blacked out computer screens. It took about 90 minutes to reboot 
all the computers, during which forecasters were able to get the 
data they needed from Kansas City, Mo., and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Area airports remained open, but Miami International Airport  
shut down at 6 p.m. Most airlines suspended service to South 
Florida until at least Saturday. The University of Miami closed its 
campus. High school football games were postponed, as were two 
$400,000 thoroughbred races scheduled for Saturday at Calder Race 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Clevelander Hotel on trendy South Beach, only four of 58  
rooms were occupied. ``It's just nasty, windy and awful,'' manager 
Chris Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton declared a state of emergency in 28 counties  
from Key West to central Florida, making federal money available 
for cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said they expected Irene to push into the Atlantic  
Ocean and then head inland again near the Georgia-South Carolina 
line. Heavy rain was a possibility across North Carolina, still 
recovering from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly it's too early to panic,'' said Tom Hegele of the  
North Carolina emergency management agency. ``If we need to change 
our focus from recovery to preparation and response for another 
event, that's what we'll do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain on eastern North  
Carolina last month, killing at least 49 people and causing 
billions in damage in the state's costliest natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The eye of the hurricane passed near Key West, where the  
floodwaters in the streets didn't stop the beer from flowing. At 
Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville Cafe, loud cheers erupted when the 
lights came back on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get busier when the power goes out,'' bartender Doug Gober  
said. ``There's nothing to do but drink.''

<HEADLINE> Owners Appeal Newspaper Shutdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The owners of The Honolulu Advertiser and  
Honolulu Star-Bulletin on Friday appealed a federal judge's order 
blocking the scheduled Oct. 30 shutdown of the Star-Bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Alan Kay had issued an injunction Wednesday  
pending a trial in the state's lawsuit alleging that an agreement 
between Gannett Co. Inc. and Liberty Newspapers Limited Partnership 
to close the Star-Bulletin violates antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett owns the Advertiser, a morning newspaper, and Liberty  
Newspapers owns the Star-Bulletin, an afternoon paper. The state 
claims that Gannett in effect paid off Liberty to create its own 
monopoly, which the papers deny. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett purchased the Advertiser and sold the Star-Bulletin to  
Liberty Newspapers in 1993, but agreed to continue a joint 
operating agreement between the two newspapers until 2012. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett reached a deal to pay Liberty Newspapers $26.5 million --  
an amount based on the savings Gannett could expect from ending the 
papers' joint operating agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Kay said Wednesday the public interest to preserve separate  
editorial voices in the community is great enough to keep the 
Star-Bulletin running until the state's lawsuit is settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Kay's order is a ``First Amendment violation because it requires  
a newspaper to publish when it does not wish to do so,'' the 
Advertiser and Star-Bulletin owners said Friday in the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing date for the appeal has not been scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Suit Says Marines Jailed Wrong Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Arrested for jumping a commuter train turnstile,  
Martin L. King was shocked to find himself shackled and taken to 
the brig at Camp Lejeune, N.C., charged with deserting the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	King said he told authorities they had the wrong man; he'd never  
been in the military. Still, he was held for 40 days, during which 
he claims he was sexually assaulted by another inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nightmare,'' King said Thursday. ``It basically felt  
like I was being terrorized by the government. That was very, very 
scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, 33, is suing the Marines and the U.S. government for  
unspecified damages, alleging he was falsely imprisoned. The suit, 
filed in federal court in Atlanta, is awaiting a trial date. 
</P>
<P>
	According to King's suit, his ordeal began when someone stole  
his Social Security number and used it to enlist in the Marines. 
The unknown man finished basic training in 1992 at Parris Island, 
S.C., then disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in early 1996, King was fired on his first day as a YMCA  
counselor because a background check showed he was wanted for 
desertion. When he went to a Marines recruiting office in Atlanta 
to clear up the error, he said, he was laughed at and sent away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here was an innocent guy who told everybody he possibly could  
that he was innocent, that they had the wrong man,'' said Marc 
Bardack, one of King's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, King, a former college student, had a  
late-night janitor's job, no money and was living in a shelter. 
That's when he was arrested for jumping the turnstile and sent to 
Camp Lejeune. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marines could have solved the problem quickly by looking at  
their own records, King's lawyers say. The impostor's file 
contained his medical and dental records, fingerprints, 
handwriting, and most importantly, his picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Camp Lejeune released King the day after he told his story to a  
television station. King now lives in Oakland, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Marine Corps officials confirmed King was in the brig at from  
Aug. 23 to Sept. 13, 1996, and declined further comment. A 
spokesman Assistant U.S. Attorney William Traynor also declined 
comment.

<HEADLINE> Japan Radiation Tally Up to 69 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The tally of people exposed to radiation in Japan's  
worst-ever nuclear accident was increased by 20 to 69 today, the 
government said, acknowledging that an inadequate monitoring system 
was behind the undercount. 
</P>
<P>
	The new figure appeared in a report on the Sept. 30 accident  
submitted today to the Nuclear Safety Commission, a government 
panel appointed by the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20 new readings came from badges the workers wore to monitor  
radiation levels, the report said. Investigators only belatedly 
checked the badges. Of those exposed, 59 were workers at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident at a uranium-processing plant in northeastern Japan  
set off an uncontrolled atomic reaction. Employees mixing nuclear 
fuel in a bucket added too much uranium, spewing radiation into the 
air and sending three workers to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said previously that seven people working near  
the site and three firefighters who rescued the three most 
seriously injured workers were also exposed to radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Other workers were exposed to radiation levels 50 to 100 times  
higher than what is considered safe to receive over the course of a 
year, the report found. At least one worker was exposed to more 
radiation than the legal limit allowed for emergency situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident raised serious doubts about the safety of Japan's  
nuclear power policy. An investigation disclosed that workers at 
the facility routinely violated safety procedures, were under 
pressure to get the job done quickly and had not received proper 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety requirements at nuclear facilities will be beefed up,  
Labor Minister Takamori Makino said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to now, only nuclear power plants were inspected by the  
ministry, and they only once a year. 
</P>
<P>
	From now on, the 20 other facilities nationwide that handle  
nuclear fuel will also have to be inspected, and the inspections 
will take place once every three months, said ministry official 
Hiroyoshi Hatanaka. More workers will also be required to receive 
special training. 
</P>
<P>
	Three officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who  
arrived in Japan on Wednesday, inspected the site of the accident 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more experts were due Monday from the United States,  
science agency spokesman Yoshio Abe said.

<HEADLINE> QB Young's Concussions Raise Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- As San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve  
Young ponders his future in football, he can look to an abundance 
of evidence showing that repeated concussions and head injuries can 
cause irreparable damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Attention on brain injuries in sports has been focused in recent  
years on boxers, such as Sugar Ray Robinson, Jerry Quarry and 
especially Muhammad Ali, whose Parkinson's disease may have been 
exacerbated by repeated blows to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	But plenty of other athletes have been forced to retire after  
suffering concussions, including hockey's Pat LaFontaine and Brett 
Lindros and football's Merril Hoge and Al Toon. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, doctors say, is that no one is quite sure how many  
are too many -- or when the next hit could be the blow that takes 
away an athlete's motor skills and memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how many athletes have sat in front of me and  
said, `Doc, what is down the road for me if I've had so many 
concussions?''' said Dr. Michael Collins of the Division of 
Neuropsychology at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't know,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Young, 38, was knocked out during a game against Arizona on  
Sept. 27. It was his fourth concussion in three years. He will sit 
out the next two games, and his diagnosis will be reevaluated at 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Young's neurologist, Dr. Gary Steinberg of the Stanford  
University School of Medicine, categorized the concussion as mild 
and said there was no indication of permanent brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're talking about a Muhammad Ali-type of  
situation here,'' Steinberg said. ``It's nothing of the order of 
magnitude compared to Muhammad Ali.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say that Ali and other boxers helped bring attention to  
the potential problems of brain injury in sports. Robinson and 
Quarry both showed signs of dementia pugilistica, or being ``punch 
drunk.'' Quarry, a hard-punching heavyweight who fought Ali and 
Floyd Patterson, could not dress or feed himself when he died 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Collins led a study published last month in the Journal of  
the American Medical Association showing that college football 
players who sustain multiple concussions are at risk for a decline 
in long-term neuropsychological function. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, players with a learning disability have an even  
higher risk for permanent injury from multiple concussions, the 
study said. 
</P>
<P>
	But research on concussions is scarce and athletes have, in  
general, been taught to ignore some of their injuries -- especially 
those that aren't visibly apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trained as a society that if you have a mild ankle  
injury, or a mild groin pull, you're trained to play through the 
pain,'' Collins said. ``But I think that when you have an injury 
that involves the brain, you have to look at it differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Professional athletes and their leagues are starting to take  
notice. The NFL and NHL have programs to address concussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this season, Mike Modano of the NHL's Dallas Stars was  
checked head-first into the boards by Anaheim defenseman Ruslan 
Salei. A frightening episode -- but it wasn't enough to keep him 
from playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano, who was knocked cold, suffered a mild concussion and  
strained neck ligaments, returned to the ice despite the threat of 
debilitating injury. But it has given him pause. ``I still have the 
rest of my life to live,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Young has told 49ers coach Steve Mariucci and general manager  
Bill Walsh that he wants to play again. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is evidence that once an athlete has a concussion,  
he's more likely to get another one, said Dr. Martin Holland, 
director of the University of California, San Francisco, Brain and 
Spinal Injury Program and a neurosurgeon at San Francisco General 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two theories to support this: first, athletes who are  
risk-takers tend to have a greater chance of getting concussions, 
and second, a concussion can cause enough of an impairment that 
reaction is dulled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve Young is at higher risk for concussions,'' Holland said.  
``There's nothing that tells me he won't have a fifth or a sixth or 
a seventh if he continues to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's one of the reasons Young should take a hard look at  
retirement, Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My personal opinion is that he should probably quit. Not  
necessarily because the next one could do him in, but that he's 
already had four concussions and he's at risk to have more,'' he 
said. ``He has too much lose.''

<HEADLINE>  Prosecutor Admits JonBenet Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Prosecutor Alex Hunter says the decision  
not to indict anyone in the murder of JonBenet Ramsey left him with 
``an aching heart,'' and he declared the search for her killer is 
not over. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the girl's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, have not  
been eliminated from the investigation. Police Chief Mark Beckner 
said the Ramseys remain ``under an umbrella of suspicion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two men spoke on Thursday, a day after Hunter announced that  
a 13-month grand jury investigation into the 1996 slaying did not 
find enough evidence to charge anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Hunter said the four prosecutors and their  
advisers working on the case unanimously agreed there was 
insufficient evidence to warrant charges in the death of the 
6-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to discuss the grand jury's investigation, including  
why JonBenet's parents were not called to testify. He also said the 
case is stronger as a result of the grand jury's work, though he 
acknowledged that ``mistakes were made'' in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have an aching heart about where we are with this case, but  
by no means do I or any of the men who you see at this table feel a 
sense of failure,'' said Hunter, flanked by other prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to follow the evidence in this case as long  
as there is work to be done. We find no reason to give up heart, we 
find no reason to quit and we plan to continue with diligence the 
effort we believe has been under way since the beginning of this 
case,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Ramsey, JonBenet's uncle, told The Atlanta  
Journal-Constitution in an interview published today he was furious 
that the parents still are suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's absolutely ridiculous,'' he said. ``John and  
Patsy Ramsey have been investigated for three years. What's it 
going to take to get Boulder authorities to see they are barking up 
the wrong tree?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Gov. Bill Owens said a team of attorneys,  
including Attorney General Ken Salazar, will review the case and 
recommend whether a special prosecutor should be named. Owens said 
he would decide within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on Dec. 26, 1996, Mrs. Ramsey told police she found a  
ransom note demanding $118,000 for her daughter's safe return. 
Eight hours later, JonBenet's father said he found his daughter's 
body in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks later, Hunter assembled a dream team of prosecutors  
and advisers, but the investigation soon became bogged down with 
infighting between his office and police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were accused of mishandling the evidence and allowing too  
many people to have access to the crime scene; Hunter was accused 
of trying to protect JonBenet's wealthy and influential parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter turned the case over to the grand jury in September 1998.  
The grand jurors heard from investigators, the police, Ramsey 
friends and associates, JonBenet's brother Burke and her 
half-siblings. 
</P>
<P>
	After the decision not to charge anyone was announced, the  
Ramseys asked police to continue the investigation to find a 
``child killer'' still on the loose. 
</P>
<P>
	At his own news conference, Beckner said he agreed that ``there  
are things that we should have done differently and wish we would 
have done differently.'' But he added: ``To say that mistakes have 
made this an unsolvable case is not accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is not dead in the water,'' Beckner said. ``We still  
have things to do, still have evidence that is being processed and 
examined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During morning radio talk shows, angry callers lambasted Hunter,  
demanding to know why no one has been charged in the nearly three 
years since JonBenet was killed. Some defended Hunter and accused 
police of bungling the case and mishandling evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hunter got stuck with a bad case, and so did the grand  
jurors,'' said Emily Brown, who was playing with two children 
outside the Boulder County Justice Center, where the grand jury 
met. ``It upsets me.''

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrials briefly fell below  
10,000 today on news of an inflationary spurt and a warning about 
stock market exuberance from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan. The Dow ended at 10,019.71, down 266.90 points to its 
worst closing level since early April. The selloff followed a 
morning report showing that prices at the wholesale level rose 1.1 
percent in September, the largest increase in nine years. On the 
NYSE, losers led gainers 2,400-687. The Nasdaq was at 2,731.79,

	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene today pounded the Florida  
Keys with 75 mph winds and 10 inches of rain before heading up the 
state's Gulf coastline. The storm is expected to go ashore late 
tonight between Naples and Fort Myers with a 5- to 7-foot surge. 
Irene drenched Cuba's tobacco fields yesterday and caused scattered

it to launch a mission to rescue an American doctor with breast 
cancer symptoms from the South Pole, a U.S. Air Force spokesman 
said. The plane, an LC-130 Hercules from the New York Air National 
Guard's 109th Airlift Wing, was expected to take three hours to 
reach the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Station. The pickup of 
Dr. Jerri Nielsen, 47, was expected to take 20 minutes. The crew

	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Riot police used tear gas and batons  
to disperse thousands of anti-government demonstrators Friday as 
harsh criticism mounted of President B.J. Habibie, eroding his 
chances of retaining his post in a vote next week. About 30 
protesters were hospitalized and 10 policeman were injured Friday 
in clashes that closed Jakarta's business district for hours. The 
turmoil raised the prospect of further instability in Indonesia, 
already reeling from political unrest and its worst economic crisis 
in decades.

tear gas and percussion grenades, French-led troops and foreign 
police drove back hundreds of ethnic Albanians trying to storm 
across a bridge to the Serb side of this Kosovo town today. More 
than 100 people were injured in the melee, the most violent clash 
here in a month, NATO said. Mitrovica's Albanians say NATO forces 
are keeping them from their homes, schools and a mine in the Serb 
part of town. But allowing them to cross would spark far greater 
violence because of ethnic hatred.

	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Doctors Without Borders won the 1999 Nobel  
Peace Prize today in recognition of the organization's ``pioneering 
humanitarian work on several continents,'' the Norwegian Nobel 
Committee said. Medecins Sans Frontieres, as the group is known 
internationally, has more than 2,000 medical professionals 
volunteering in 80 countries. ``Since its foundation in the early 
1970s, Doctors Without Borders has adhered to the fundamental 
principle that all disaster victims, whether the disaster is 
natural or human in origin, have a right to professional assistance 
given as quickly and as efficiently as possible,'' the committee

his troubled 16-month tenure. Hundreds of protesters were back on

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Seeking to get a fix on the number  
of stolen cars in Kosovo, U.N. police begin issuing license plates 
today to drivers across the province with dubious claims to their 
vehicles. Under the plan, drivers have until January to register 
their cars with U.N. police. After that, any vehicle without plates 
or proper papers will be seized. The majority of cars now in the 
province have no license plates. Their present owners claim that as 
they fled the province this spring to escape the bloody Serb 
crackdown, Serbs took their license plates and vehicle registration 
documents.

As Clinton and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott sparred via 
dueling news conferences, both Democrats seeking the presidency -- 
Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley -- said they would resubmit 
the treaty if elected. Gore did it with a television ad, the first 
of his campaign. Republicans remained supportive of Wednesday's

convoys of buses at drop-off points in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. Prisoners leaned out of windows, flashing victory signs, 
their hands still tied with plastic cuffs. ``Mother, he's out,'' a 
teen-age boy shouted into a cellular phone when he saw his brother 
on one of the buses. Prisoner releases are an emotional issue for 
both sides.

<HEADLINE> Albanians Clash With Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- French and Italian  
peacekeepers clashed with ethnic Albanians trying to push their way 
across a bridge today in this divided Kosovo city, injuring dozens 
of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeepers fired tear gas and stun grenades for more than an  
hour at ethnic Albanians trying to cross into the Serb-held half of 
the city. Cannons also were used to unleash a stream of tear gas 
into the crowd, which numbered several thousand. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 people poured into the city's small, Albanian-run  
hospital, seeking treatment. The most seriously hurt was a 
12-year-old boy, who was knocked unconscious and suffered a 4-inch 
head wound, according to hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 20 others were to undergo surgery, and dozens were  
suffering from the effects of tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how many peacekeepers -- who wore helmets and  
bulletproof vests, and wielded plastic shields -- were injured in 
the clash. One French soldier was seen holding his eye, which 
likely was injured by stones or sticks hurled by Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash began after ethnic Albanians launched what is planned  
to be six months of daily protests. After peacefully marching to a 
local mosque and a Catholic church, more than 1,000 protesters 
attempted to cross to the Serb side of the city, as Serbs gathered 
on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
	French peacekeepers, along with some Italian carabinieri, first  
tried to use barbed wire to block their progress. They then rolled 
out eight tanks, and began firing tear gas and stun grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	A Serb woman who had been at the scene said ethnic Albanians  
made it halfway across the bridge spanning the Ibar River before 
being pushed back. 
</P>
<P>
	Armored vehicles were parked on the bridge, and French snipers  
took up positions on buildings overlooking the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of Serbs gathered on the other side and hoisted the  
Serbian flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``The French seem to be keeping the situation under control for  
now,'' said the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs on the other side of the bridge are ready to defend  
our part of Mitrovica,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	After the clashes, ethnic Albanians continued to pack a 700-yard  
stretch of road leading to the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in an attempt to restore a degree of normality in  
Kosovo, U.N. police began issuing license plates Friday to drivers 
across the province, where many cars are thought stolen either from 
Westen Europe or fleeing Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, drivers have until January to register their  
cars. After that, any vehicle without plates or proper papers will 
be seized, and U.N. police will use the registry to check for 
stolen vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Pristina's airport reopened to receive its first  
commercial flight today -- an Adria Airways jet from Slovenia 
carrying 155 passengers, most of them ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	That move comes a day after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's  
first visit to the province. Speaking Thursday, Annan rebuffed 
ethnic Albanian hopes of quick independence, saying Kosovo will 
remain a part of Yugoslavia as long as it is under U.N. 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not here to prepare the people for independence,'' he  
said. ``That is not my mandate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo Albanians, the province's overwhelming majority,  
fervently support independence from Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant 
republic.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Coy on Thailand Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- An analyst for Moody's Investor  
Services left Thailand after a well-publicized visit this week with 
praise for the government's economic management, but without saying 
when it will upgrade the country's rating. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot more confidence in the policy-makers than we did  
at the time of the crisis,'' Thomas Byrne, senior analyst of 
Moody's sovereign risk unit, told Dow Jones Newswires in an 
interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sovereign risk measures the ability of a government to pay back  
its borrowings. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipation of Moody's three-day visit to Thailand, which ended  
Thursday, spurred rallies by the Thai stock market and the baht 
currency in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's currently has a foreign currency ceiling of Ba1 on  
Thailand, one notch below investment grade. 
</P>
<P>
	Any upward revision would open the gates to foreign capital  
inflows, especially from institutional funds which are bound by 
their own rules to put money only in countries with sovereign 
investment grade ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne praised the Thai government's handling of the economy, but  
deferred comment on what Moody's ratings plans are. 
</P>
<P>
	``It (an upgrade) could happen anytime between now and over the  
next year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Standard and Poor's and Fitch IBCA, two other ratings agencies,  
have already raised Thailand's sovereign rating to investment 
grade.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Proposes Dialogue With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is renewing an  
offer to hold face-to-face talks with Iran, but a group of 28 
senators urged Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to take a 
tough line. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after the election of President Mohammad Khatami,  
there is no real evidence of change within Iran or in its stance 
toward the rest of the world, the senators wrote. ``Now is not the 
time to associate ourselves with a regime that continues to subject 
its people to repressive and brutal practices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group, headed by Sens. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and  
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., urged the State Department to ``look 
afresh towards the possibilities that exist within Iran's 
democratic opposition, including the People's Mojahedin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington office of Mujahedeen Khalq, which means people's  
``Mojahedin,'' has criticized the State Department's inclusion of 
it on a list of terrorist groups as an effort to appease ``the 
criminal mullahs'' who rule Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	In renewing an offer to hold talks with Iran without conditions,  
Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk said the United States 
would encourage Iran to support Mideast peacemaking, stop 
supporting terrorism and halt the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar overtures have been made by President Clinton and by  
Albright. ``Unfortunately,'' Indyk told the Asia Society Thursday, 
``the Iranian government's response to this overture has been, for 
the most part, hidebound and unimaginative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, the State Department official said, the administration  
has streamlined U.S. visa policies and supported academic and 
athletic exchanges with Iran while Iran has opened its doors to 
American wrestlers, scholars, graduate students and museum 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Indyk also welcomed a statement this week by a high Iranian  
official that the safety of Americans and other tourists in Iran 
must be safeguarded. 
</P>
<P>
	In a gesture, Indyk said the Mujahedeen Khalq, a group based in  
Iraq that claimed responsibility for the assassination of Iran's 
deputy chief of staff and the killing of two high-ranking members 
of the Iranian government, was redesignated last week by the State 
Department as a foreign terrorist organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Council of Resistance, an alias of the group, was  
listed for the first time, he said. This means contributions to the 
group are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Iran is also a victim of terrorism,'' Indyk said. ``We condemn  
these acts as we condemn all acts of terrorism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, Iran continues to support groups that use  
terrorism, even though senior Iranian officials have denounced 
attacks on innocent people, and Iran continues efforts to develop 
ballistic missiles, causing the United States to oppose investment 
in Iran's petroleum sector.

<HEADLINE> Ford Reorganizes Business Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. announced a wide-ranging  
management shuffle today, aimed at giving more power to lower-level 
executives and making the world's second-largest automaker more 
nimble. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves announced by Ford President and CEO Jac Nasser give 14  
vice presidents new titles and reorganizes their responsibilities 
along brand and regional lines effective Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The new units ``allow Ford to preserve the strengths of Ford's  
global scale and collective knowledge while creating smaller, more 
agile business units,'' Nasser said. ``They will allow Ford to 
consistently deliver innovative products and services that delight 
customers by focusing on brands and consumer needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No executives lost their jobs in the moves. Henry D.G. Wallace  
was chosen as Ford's new chief financial officer. Wallace ran 
Ford's Asia Pacific operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ford name will be handled by units in North America, Europe,  
Asia and South America. The Mercury division was moved into the 
company's Premier Automotive Group that manages its luxury brands -- 
Lincoln, Jaguar, Volvo and Aston Martin -- around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda, which is 33 percent owned by Ford, and parts maker  
Visteon Automotive Systems will operate separately. The company 
will also have four business groups dealing with consumer services 
-- including one aimed at Internet commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said the changes were an ``evolution'' of a  
previous management effort, Ford 2000, started by former chairman 
Alex Trotman. Under Ford 2000, the company cut $5 billion in costs 
by having more cars and trucks share engines, transmissions and 
other parts, and by getting better deals from suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford 2000 gave more power to central managers. The new plan  
pushes more decisions out into the field, and by doing so, Ford 
hopes to give its middle managers better training. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to become the kind of company we talk about in  
terms of business acumen, we have to have a pipeline of really 
great business leadership coming through,'' said David Murphy, 
Ford's vice president of human resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said it would be a year before consumers would notice any  
changes in the way the company operates, and then only in 
marketing. Changes in products are two or three years away, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But over time, ``we really believe this will get us a lot closer  
to our consumers,'' Murphy said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chides GOP on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is accusing congressional  
Republicans of planning ``unconscionable'' cuts in education and 
other programs as the two sides sharpen their positions in the 
ongoing budget fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 93-5 today to give final congressional approval  
to a $99 billion measure financing veterans, housing and science 
programs. On Thursday, the Senate sent Clinton a $268 billion 
defense bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But two weeks into fiscal 2000, just five of the 13 annual  
spending bills have become law, and five others face veto threats. 
And as the White House and lawmakers focus on the remaining, most 
politically charged measures, both sides' rhetoric is sharpening. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used a White House news conference Thursday to say he  
would veto a bill financing labor, health and education programs, 
since it provides little of the $1.4 billion he wants to continue 
hiring new elementary school teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be unconscionable to think that America at its moment  
of greatest prosperity, when we got our first surplus in 30 years, 
is out there cutting education and several other areas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., rejected that,  
noting that overall the Senate version of the bill contains more 
for education than Clinton proposed. He also said Clinton has done 
nothing in months to help Congress complete its budget work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hadn't had a single call from him, not any contact, no  
suggestions, other than a few missiles fired over from the White 
House,'' Lott told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye toward the Oct. 21 expiration of a bill that has  
kept federal agencies open since the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal 
year, House and Senate leaders ordered the authors of the 
labor-education bill -- which surpasses $310 billion -- to try 
crafting a compromise that Congress could pass next week. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems certain that Congress will need at least one more  
stopgap spending bill extension while lawmakers and administration 
officials complete the final bills. Members of both parties said 
they expected Clinton would sign one. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart signaled today that Clinton  
would likely approve another continuing resolution, ``if they come 
back here and they can make a credible case about why they need an 
extra week to finish work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took the opportunity to criticize lawmakers for what he  
called budgetary gimmicks. ``Ultimately, there will be a sense that 
they've got to get their business done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said across-the-board cuts Republicans were considering  
in all 13 bills ``could deny tens of thousands of children Head 
Start opportunities, drastically reduce medical research, sacrifice 
military readiness, jeopardize the safety of air traffic control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders played down the impact of the cuts, which they said  
would be 1 percent or less, and insisted they would honor their 
pledge not to use Social Security surpluses to pay for spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than cut Social Security, I'd cut any program, every  
program across the board,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate gave the defense bill final approval by 87-11 after  
it cleared the House on Wednesday. To gain leverage, Clinton was 
expected to delay signing the measure until Congress completed the 
other spending bills. The Pentagon bill would provide the 
military's biggest pay raise in nearly two decades, slow the Air 
Force's F-22 ``stealth'' fighter program and seek to halt a 
Pentagon decline in readiness. It was also home to gimmicks such as 
declaring $7 billion in military operations and maintenance 
programs an ``emergency,'' meaning the money would not count 
against spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House approved the veterans-housing bill, 406-18. Senate  
approval was planned today, and Clinton was expected to sign it. 
The measure would give Clinton even more than he requested for 
environmental, veterans health and space programs. It is also 
included hundreds of projects for members' districts, including 
$150,000 for a hands-on children's' museum in Florence, Ala., and 
$2 million to buttress a building against earthquakes at California 
State University in San Bernadino. 
</P>
<P>
	--House-Senate bargainers neared agreement on a $38 billion  
measure for the departments of Commerce, Justice and State. White 
House support seemed uncertain. One participant said the bill would 
provide $570 million for Clinton's proposal to help communities 
hire thousands of police officers, less than half of what he 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House approved a District of Columbia spending measure,  
217-202. Clinton vetoed an earlier version because he said it 
intruded on local decision-making, and White House officials warned 
that the new bill would be vetoed too.

<HEADLINE> Clemens vs. Martinez Says It All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Babe Ruth pitched at Fenway Park in the World  
Series. So did Christy Mathewson, Bob Gibson and Grover Cleveland 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	And still, this might be the most fascinating matchup ever at  
the 87-year-old ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens vs. Pedro Martinez.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope it lives up to that hype,'' New York Yankees  
manager Joe Torre said Friday, a day before Game 3 of the AL 
Championship Series. ``I have a sense it will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A combined six Cy Young Awards between them, and surely a  
seventh on the way soon for Martinez. So much more, too, on a fall 
afternoon in October -- enough to make this a dynamic duel for the 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens back on the mound he once ruled, trying to lead the  
Yankees to a record 13th straight postseason victory and extend 
their 2-0 edge over Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not business as usual,'' he said. ``I will have so many  
emotions I'll have to curtail somehow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, the new king of the hill, is hoping the Red Sox stop a  
10-game ALCS losing streak and revitalize their chances in the 
best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not going to change my game because there is more  
pressure or less pressure,'' he said. ``I hope he puts a lot of 
pressure on himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even during Friday's relaxed workouts, there was a buzz at the  
ballpark because of the buildup. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez led the majors in wins (23) and ERA (2.07) and topped  
the AL with 313 strikeouts. Clemens was just 14-10 with a 4.60 ERA, 
but carries a huge reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	```If you take a Koufax against Marichal, that would be  
something of this magnitude,'' Red Sox reliever Rod Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only once before in the ALCS or NLCS have two former Cy Young  
winners started against each other. That was in Game 3 in 1974 when 
Oakland's Vida Blue beat Baltimore's Jim Palmer by, appropriately, 
a score of 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball fans have been treated to plenty of other attractive  
matchups in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1968 World Series, 30-game winner Denny McLain of Detroit  
faced Gibson, who had a 1.12 ERA for St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, there's been Nolan Ryan vs. Palmer, Steve Carlton  
vs. Don Sutton and Greg Maddux vs. Kevin Brown, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the 1986 World Series, it was Clemens vs. Dwight Gooden  
in a duel between the two best young pitchers in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 37, Clemens is 10 years old than Martinez and has five Cy  
Youngs. The Rocket is 1-0 in three starts at Fenway while with the 
Yankees and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, who pitched for the Red Sox from 1984-96, was booed at  
Fenway this summer at the All-Star game when he was introduced on 
the field as one of the sport's 100 best players of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	That probably will not change Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to have a lot of familiar faces around, so we will  
have fun with it,'' he said. ``I think a lot of them are Red Sox 
fans. I think undercover they are going to be rooting for me, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Television viewers will get to find out. Fox, which is  
broadcasting the game, plans to pass up a commercial break after 
the top of the first inning in order to show the reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, meanwhile, is certain to get a huge ovation. Boston  
fans want him to duplicate his last effort against New York -- he 
struck out a record 17 Yankees and pitched a one-hitter Sept. 10 in 
the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers tell you that is probably one of the best games  
that anybody has ever pitched in that stadium,'' he said. ``But 
that is gone. I hope I can do it now in the playoffs. That is what 
counts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez scared Red Sox rooters when he was forced to leave Game  
1 of the division series against Cleveland after straining a muscle 
below his right shoulder blade. He returned to pitch six innings of 
hitless relief in the clinching fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, it is not 100 percent yet,'' Martinez said. ``But after  
pitching in Cleveland, having seen the result, I don't think I need 
my full strength to be a pitcher or to be able to beat another 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre, among many others, is eager to see it all unfold.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that is what the goosebumps are going to be about  
tomorrow,'' he said. ``There is going to be screaming and yelling, 
just like every time we play here, except again magnified because 
it is postseason and what it means. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be a heck of a show,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Congress OKs $99B Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress sent President Clinton a $99 billion  
measure financing veterans, housing and space programs on Friday, a 
bill whose passage was aided by the inclusion of hundreds of 
projects for lawmakers' districts. 
</P>
<P>
	With no quick end to this year's budget fight in sight, White  
House officials indicated they would agree to another stopgap bill 
next week to keep federal agencies open. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate gave final congressional approval to the  
veterans-housing measure by 93-5 a day after the House passed it. 
Clinton is expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders have insisted that this year's budget fight  
pits their fiscal conservatism against a spendthrift president. But 
the veterans-housing measure suggests that other dynamics were in 
play as well: It dispensed hundreds of millions of dollars for 
home-district projects from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The listing of one type of project alone -- community development  
-- covers nearly six pages of fine print in the Congressional 
Record. 
</P>
<P>
	Included is $10,000 for Los Angeles to build a new archway in  
its Chinatown; $1 million for New York's Carnegie Hall; $500,000 to 
rehabilitate the Sitka Pioneer Home in Sitka, Alaska; and $400,000 
to build a memorial in Springfield, Mass., for native son Theodor 
Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill once faced a veto threat, but that vanished after  
Republicans agreed to add $7 billion above what the House 
originally approved. In the end, NASA, the Environmental Protection 
Agency and veterans' health-care got even more than Clinton 
initially requested, and the GOP dropped plans to cut some 
low-income housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure is the 10th of the 13 annual spending bills for  
fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1. Clinton has vetoed one financing 
the District of Columbia, and is poised to veto a second covering 
foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Three others are still working through Congress in the face of  
veto threats, covering the departments of Labor, Health and Human 
Services, Education, Interior, Commerce, Justice, State, and some 
smaller agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the remaining tensions, House Appropriations  
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., accused Democrats of 
withdrawing commitments to support a final $14 billion Interior 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was part of a ``blatant partisan move'' to blame  
Republicans for failing to quickly finish spending work. Democrats 
said they had not made such commitments for a bill they said has 
anti-environmental provisions and lacks enough money. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders want to send Clinton all the bills by next  
Thursday, when a measure keeping agencies temporarily open expires. 
They believe this would bolster their argument that if another 
stopgap extension is needed, it is only because Clinton vetoed 
bills because they did not spend as much as he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	It is all but certain that some of the spending measures won't  
be finished by Thursday night. GOP leaders contemplate a second 
extension that would last a week or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no intent to shut the government down, not on our  
part, not on the president's part,'' said House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart signaled that Clinton would  
sign another extension if lawmakers ``come back here and if they 
can make a credible case about why they need an extra week to 
finish the work.''

<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Irene Nears Fla. Keys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- The leading edge of Hurricane Irene  
brought rain and high wind to the Florida Keys today after the 
storm drenched Cuba's tobacco fields and caused scattered building 
collapses around Havana. At least one person was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though barely a hurricane with 75 mph winds around its center,  
Irene brought torrential rains that threatened to flood the lower 
third of the Florida peninsula as the storm crawled across the 
straits separating Cuba from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Were experiencing some strong tropical storm conditions right  
now from Key West all the way up the Keys as far as Ocean Reef 
right now,'' Billy Wagner, Monroe County Emergency Management 
director, said this morning. Big Pine Key had a gust recorded at 
103 mph, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said areas as far north as Tampa could be flooded,  
and rainfall totals could top 15 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a well-organized hurricane, and there's a huge swath  
of storms and rain to the east'' of its center, said Richard Pasch, 
a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center outside 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m. EDT, Irene was about 25 miles southwest of Key West.  
Irene had moved slowly and erratically late Thursday, but was 
moving north at about 8 mph today. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said the center of the storm was likely to hit land  
between Tampa and Fort Myers by Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Monroe County, which covers the Keys, ordered a  
mandatory evacuation of mobile homes and recreational vehicles. 
Schools were closed for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been raining throughout the night; we've been getting  
quite a few inches of rain and the wind has picked up enormously 
from when I came in at (midnight),'' said David Holliman, a 
security guard at the Lower Keys Medical Center in Key West. ``The 
trees are swaying quite a bit ... and it's getting worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four shelters were opened in the Keys: two in Key West and one  
each in Marathon and Key Largo. Fewer than 100 people were staying 
at the shelters Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked all day yesterday. By the time we finished, it was  
too late to go north,'' said Jose Guadarrama, a mobile home 
resident who arrived at the shelter this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm left Cuban territory after soaking Havana on Thursday  
evening. Early reports were that the island escaped relatively 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
	During a televised briefing, Havana authorities told President  
Fidel Castro that one person had been electrocuted and a second 
person was missing following the storm's march across the capital 
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Havana Mayor Conrado Martinez said that 149 buildings were  
damaged by the heavy rains, including 13 that collapsed, and power 
outages were scattered around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	About 130,000 people from western and central Cuba, many of them  
students in government boarding schools, were evacuated as the 
hurricane approached. Classes across the region were suspended. 
Stores, government offices and banks in Havana closed shortly after 
noon Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the western city of Pinar del Rio, laborers worked made sure  
water didn't leak into warehouses storing the tobacco leaves grown 
to make Cuba's famous cigars. Cattle and livestock in the rural 
region were moved to higher ground.

<HEADLINE> Royals Give Dye $6.1M Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City Royals outfielder Jermaine  
Dye is guaranteed $6.1 million under his new two-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye hit .294 this season and led the Royals with 27 home runs  
and 119 RBIs. He also set a club record with 17 outfield assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great to know that I'll be staying here in Kansas  
City for at least a couple more years,'' Dye said. ``I'm also happy 
that the Royals are showing they want to keep our team together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dye, 25, struggled through injuries in 1997 and 1998 and hit a  
combined .235 with just 12 homers and 45 RBIs in 135 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He gets $2.8 million next year and $3.1 million in 2001 after  
making $260,000 this season. He would have been eligible for salary 
arbitration for the first time.

<HEADLINE> W.Va. Board May Lift Creationism Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- A proposal before a county school board  
would lift a ban on teaching the Biblical story of creation. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, introduced by Kanawha County board member Betty  
Jarvis, was submitted for comment this week to principals and 
teachers of the 87 schools in the state's largest county. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to present all theories,'' Jarvis told The Charleston  
Gazette. ``Creationism is a theory. A lot of science books deal 
only with evolution. Teachers are afraid to stray from the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis did not return telephone calls from The Associated Press.  
</P>
<P>
	The county board will vote on the proposal in December.  
</P>
<P>
	``The part that really disturbs me is the argument that 'this is  
the other theory,''' said Hilary Chiz, director of the West 
Virginia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``Creationism is not a scientific theory. It is a religious idea  
about human development, and this is simply a transparent scheme to 
teach religion in our schools,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Creationism is the belief that a divine power created the  
universe in six days, while the theory of evolution holds that 
humans evolved from more primitive species. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court ruled more than a decade ago that states  
cannot teach creationism. Since then, some creationists have turned 
to attacking evolution's validity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Cecil Underwood, a former teacher, said he does not oppose  
teaching creationism in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think education is search for the truth. We need to look at  
all theories to decide what is the truth,'' Underwood said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas State Board of Education sparked a national debate  
two months ago by approving science standards that de-emphasize 
evolution.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Allow Iowa, N.H. Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iowa and New Hampshire will be allowed to move  
up on the political calendar next winter, a Democratic Party panel 
said Friday without deciding whether several other states can move 
up their presidential primaries, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa will hold its leadoff caucuses Jan. 24 and New Hampshire  
will hold the nation's first primary Feb. 1, the Democratic 
National Committee's rules panel decided. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa caucuses had been set for Jan. 31, but New Hampshire  
officials unexpectedly scheduled their primary on Feb. 1. They 
refused to push it back to Feb. 8 in recognition of the traditional 
eight-day period between the two state contests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' rules panel adjourned until Oct. 22 without  
deciding what to do about four other states whose requests to move 
primaries into February it had rejected. Democratic rules assure 
that New Hampshire is seven days ahead of any other state and Iowa 
is 15 days ahead. The party tries to keep other states from holding 
primaries and caucuses until March 7 or later. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state's request to move its primary to Feb. 29 will  
be reconsidered, and the panel may hear similar requests from 
Arizona, Michigan and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say that you will see some of those four ... approved  
and move up,'' said panel member Gary LaPaille of Chicago. ``But 
they should think it through, and we should think it through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	States have been jockeying for earlier positions on the calendar  
-- and increased influence -- ever since California decided earlier 
this year to move up to March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the states, representing three-fourths of party  
convention delegates, will hold primaries and caucuses between the 
end of January and March 14 -- before many voters typically start 
paying attention to the November election. 
</P>
<P>
	Several panel members complained that the confusion this year  
over the primary schedule has been caused by Republicans' refusal 
to set limits on when states can hold primaries. State Democrats 
complained frequently to the panel that they wanted to hold 
primaries the same day as Republicans in their state to remain 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP spokesman Mark Pfeifle said it was just like Democrats to  
complain when Washington ``is not getting its nose into the 
business of absolutely everything, including the primary and caucus 
calendar.''

<HEADLINE> Roth IRA Change Deadline Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Internal Revenue Service is giving  
taxpayers a little more time to make some changes in their Roth 
IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS said Thursday that taxpayers will now have until the end  
of the year, an extension of 2 1/2 months, to change the retirement 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline is being extended from today because many taxpayers  
have had difficulty figuring out the rules for the Roth IRA, which 
was created by Congress in 1997 and became effective last year. 
</P>

	Unlike a traditional individual retirement account, Roth IRA  
contributions are made on an after-tax basis, but qualified 
withdrawals are generally tax-free. Taxpayers had until the end of 
1998 to switch to a Roth IRA and pay any taxes over four years, but 
the IRS has allowed more time for people to convert to a Roth IRA -- 
or to switch back to a traditional IRA.

	If they don't convert back by the end of 1999, they could have  
to pay taxes on the money withdrawn as well as early distribution

<HEADLINE> SEC Targets Day Trader for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have won a restraining  
order and asset freeze against a day trader they say raised $6.2 
million from investors by fraudulently promising them big returns 
in trading stocks with their money. 
</P>
<P>
	The day trader, Mark Drucker of Atlanta, failed to tell  
investors he has lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the 
rapid-fire computer trading, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Atlanta granted the temporary restraining  
order and a freeze of Drucker's assets. The SEC also is seeking an 
unspecified fine against him and an accounting of his use of 
investors' money, so that he can be compelled to repay the 
allegedly ill-gotten gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Drucker couldn't be reached for comment at three telephone  
numbers Friday. He was not represented by a lawyer, SEC attorneys 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also named in its complaint Michael Weinstock, an  
Atlanta attorney, saying he fraudulently made some $1.6 million 
from participating in Drucker's scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinstock's lawyer, Pat Huddleston, said his client ``was an  
investor and at no time did he have any knowledge that there was 
anything illegal'' in Drucker's scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinstock ``has cooperated fully with the SEC's investigation,''  
Huddleston said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC alleged that from at least July 1998 through September  
1999, Drucker raised some $6.2 million from an estimated 80 
investors, telling them he was a successful day trader and 
promising them returns on their investments of 50 percent or more, 
in two months or less. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the SEC said, Drucker had consistently lost money  
day-trading with the investors' money, losing more than $630,000 
this year. Drucker used the money from recent investors to pay 
returns to earlier investors, the SEC alleged, in the classic 
formula of a Ponzi scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said Drucker, 32, also used the investors' money to  
pay for lavish parties at a big Atlanta hotel and his personal 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drucker is operating a Ponzi scheme and has consistently lost  
money through his trading,'' the complaint says. ``Without 
disclosure to investors, Drucker has siphoned off substantial sums 
for his own private use, including hundreds of thousands of dollars 
... to finance elaborate parties at a local hotel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC and state securities regulators have expressed concern  
in recent months about the risks of day trading. In the practice, 
now engaged in by several thousand people nationwide, traders ride 
the tiniest ups and downs of the stock market, trying to squeeze 
out profits by rapidly buying and selling shares. They pay their 
host day-trading firms commissions on each trade. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said last month that several  
day-trading firms have used deceptive advertising to lure investors 
and have been lax in complying with securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer another Atlanta day trader, Mark Barton, shot and  
killed nine people at two day-trading firms there before killing 
himself. Barton is believed to have lost nearly half a million 
dollars in his day trading -- including $153,000 in one three-day 
``binge.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Schools Chief Defies Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The superintendent of the nation's  
second-largest school district says he is still in charge, though 
everyone who used to work for him is under orders to report to 
someone else. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is only one superintendent in charge of this district  
and you are looking at him,'' Superintendent Ruben Zacarias said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The district is struggling with low test scores and a scandal  
over a $200 million high school built on a badly polluted site. On 
Monday, the school board voted to appoint Howard Miller chief 
executive and gave him ``complete authority'' over everything from 
construction to instruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Zacarias met with Miller and then asserted that he  
was still the boss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can always use an extra pair of hands.'' Zacarias said ``Mr.  
Miller does report to me. He takes direction from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, board members are preparing a package to buy out the  
remaining 18 months of Zacarias' contract, the Los Angeles Times 
reported today, citing sources it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Zacarias ``has no interest in a buyout'' but would have no  
choice if a board majority approves the offer, said Brad Sales, a 
spokesman for the superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	Becki Robinson, vice president of United Teachers-Los Angeles,  
the union for instructors in the 700,000-student district, called 
the situation ``very distressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We seem to have a train speeding down the track without a  
conductor on board -- or two conductors wanting to go in different 
directions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanic lawmakers who support Zacarias were angry at the  
appointment of Miller by newly elected school board members. 
</P>
<P>
	``By expanding his authority, they have violated the goodwill  
and trust we placed on these individuals,'' said state Sen. Richard 
Polanco, a Democrat. ``It's a clear-cut attempted coup by a shadowy 
corporate elite entity, and we won't stand for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was a school board member in the 1970s until he was  
recalled in a voter backlash against the use of forced busing to 
integrate schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, he was appointed head of the troubled facilities  
division after the board determined that development plans for 100 
new schools were so far behind that the district probably would 
miss a July deadline to qualify for up to $900 million in state 
bond money. 
</P>
<P>
	As CEO, his marching orders include assembling a crisis  
management team to make a ``top-to-bottom'' management review and 
recommend a reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was given until Oct. 22 to recommend action against nine  
school district managers involved in the fiasco over the Belmont 
Learning Center -- the nation's costliest high school. Construction 
began on the school even though its site, a former gas and oil 
field, emits explosive methane and other toxic gases. 
</P>
<P>
	District officials are still deciding whether the school should  
ever open.

<HEADLINE> Can Akili Do It Again for Bengals? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Can Akili Smith do it again?  
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Bengals' rookie quarterback knows it's easy to  
dismiss his game-winning drive against Cleveland because it came 
against a winless expansion team with a horrible defense. 
</P>
<P>
	If he looks good in his second start Sunday against Pittsburgh,  
then Smith's career really will be off and running. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's motivation, to show that last week wasn't a fluke,''  
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's going to be a lot harder the second time around.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals (1-4) picked the perfect setting for Smith's NFL  
debut as a starter. The Browns give up a lot of yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was to run Corey Dillon a lot, taking the pressure off  
Smith. The plan worked perfectly as Dillon rushed for 168 yards and 
Smith relied on short, low-risk passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The play calling was good,'' guard Brian DeMarco said. ``I  
thought it was wise. We cut down on a lot of plays and what we did, 
we did right. To be fundamentally sound on 10 plays like we did was 
fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals rushed for 152 yards in the first half and threw for  
only 62. Smith made his debut memorable by going 5-of-7 for 51 
yards on the final drive of the game, culminating in a winning 
touchdown pass to Carl Pickens with 5 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	The way he coolly led his team 80 yards is what everyone  
remembers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't teach that,'' offensive tackle Willie Anderson said.  
``It's just something you're born with. They said all along he was 
a born leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing makes him nervous. He's not going to tense up. If he  
had started to think about it (being his first NFL start) and got 
caught up in it, it could have been a disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith got carried away afterwards, pounding his chest at the  
Browns bench and taunting the Dawg Pound that had taunted him 
during the game. It was his moment and he enjoyed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bruce Coslet hasn't gotten carried away by Smith's  
performance -- 25-of-42 for 221 yards and two touchdowns with four 
sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problem with the way he played,'' Coslet said. ``For  
the first outing, it was really phenomenal, to tell you the 
truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Coslet also is quick to point out his mistakes. Smith missed  
nearly all of training camp and is still learning to run the 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had 80 plays and he had eight critical assignment errors,  
which is way too high. He needs to get us into the right play, the 
right formation and make the right read,'' Coslet said. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers suggest that the offense should have won by more  
than an 18-17 margin. Cincinnati had overwhelming advantages in 
first downs (25-13), total yards (419-224) and time of possession 
(37 minutes to 23), but won by only one point. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the same problem the offense had under Jeff Blake --  
moving the ball well, then freezing up inside the 20-yard line. On 
the Bengals' first two possessions, they drove 66 and 90 yards but 
had to settle for field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was frustrated,'' Smith said. ``I took my helmet off and  
banged it off the bench because we don't need field goals, we don't 
want field goals. We've got to get the ball in the end zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was still celebrating the victory on Monday, breaking into  
a smile every time he thought about it. By the time practice had 
resumed Wednesday, things were back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bruce is still yelling at me,'' Smith said. ``The offensive  
line was on me a little bit. Nobody's going to let me relax at 
all.''

<HEADLINE> Ohio State Extends O'Brien Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State men's basketball coach Jim  
O'Brien will receive over $833,000 a year in a contract that's been 
extended four years through the 2007 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in his third year with the Buckeyes, O'Brien broke a string  
of five losing seasons at Ohio State with a 27-9 record in 1998-99. 
</P>
<P>
	After an 8-22 record in 1997-98, Ohio State finished second in  
the Big Ten last year and advanced to the Final Four for the first 
time since 1968. The Buckeyes lost 64-58 to eventual national 
champion Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agreement will pay O'Brien a base salary of $175,000 a  
year. Additional income from radio and television work, Nike and 
camps raises the compensation to $833,275. 
</P>
<P>
	His contract could be extended by one year each season for  
accomplishments such as winning the Big Ten championship or 
reaching the regional semifinals of the NCAA Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's climb to the Final Four last year gave O'Brien an  
additional $62,100, and another year added to his original 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien, who came to Ohio State from Boston College, has a  
record of 270-248 over 17 seasons as head coach, including 35-31 at 
Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, Ohio State announced agreement on a contract  
extension with football coach John Cooper that will pay at least 
$1.1 million annually and run through the 2004 season.

<HEADLINE> E-Trading Networks Seeking Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consolidation among electronic stock trading  
networks appears to be heating up, as the upstart systems attempt 
to marshal resources and customers in order to stay alive in the 
highly competitive market. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion in online stock trading has resulted in a  
proliferation of electronic communications systems, or ECNs, which 
match buy and sell orders for customers through computerized 
networks that are touted as being faster and cheaper than the 
large, traditional exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	But securities industry analysts have long predicted that a  
shake out among ECNs is just around the corner. Now it looks like 
the industry may have reached that turning point. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports have recently surfaced that two of the smaller players  
in the nascent world of electronic exchanges -- Strike Technologies 
LLC and Brass Utility LLC -- are discussing a possible merger. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Strike Technologies confirmed that Strike was  
talking to other ECNs about joining forces. But the spokesman 
downplayed specific talk of a merger with Brass Utility. Brass 
Utility officials didn't immediately return calls seeking comment 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There are currently nine electronic networks vying for both  
institutional business and the growing number of individual 
investors who trade online through ECNs. 
</P>
<P>
	Scaling back the number is ``necessary, inevitable and good,''  
said Junius Peake, a finance professor at the University of 
Northern Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is essentially a cleanup brought about by the forces of  
competition and customers' demands for a marketplace where a buyer 
has access to every potential seller, '' said Peake, who has long 
supported a more centralized marketplace for stock trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The proliferation of independent ECNs has raised concerns that  
stock markets have become too fragmented, leaving investors unable 
to find the best stock prices available because a given stock is 
being traded in several unconnected markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidation among ECNs could alleviate those fears by reducing  
the number of markets in which stocks are traded. Regulation of the 
new markets might also be easier if there are fewer to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, competition will be the driving force behind the  
shakeout, according to market analysts. Since investors want 
markets where they can find other buyers and sellers, it makes 
sense for ECNs to combine and bring together as many customers as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fragmentation leads to a profit problem. You have a number of  
ECNs competing for the same business, but no one really knows how 
much business there is. They need to consolidate to obtain 
economies of scale,'' said David Bayless, a securities lawyer and 
former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's San 
Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Madoff, head of Madoff Securities in New York, agreed.  
``There just isn't enough order flow to sustain all of these 
ECNs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	ECN survival will depend on which of the fledgling networks can  
generate the most liquidity -- or create the most active markets, 
Madoff added. ``The survivors will be the ones that can create that 
critical mass of trading volume and combine it with the best 
technology,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	ECN operators say investors -- with or without consolidation  
brought about mergers -- will gravitate toward whatever markets are 
most active because that's where the best prices will be found. 
``Order flow will gravitate together because it would be 
inefficient for it not to. Everyone is in search of liquidity,'' 
said Cameron Smith, Island ECN's legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, Island and Instinet, the oldest and largest ECN,  
handle about 90 percent of the trades completed on ECNs. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 percent of all trades of stocks listed on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market now take place on ECNs. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Satow, president of MarketXT, a small ECN that operates  
an after-hours trading session, said investors can only benefit if 
electronic networks are strengthened through consolidation. ``It's 
a good thing for the markets to have each of the players as strong 
as possible,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Disneyland Trainer France Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Van Arsdale France, the sunny optimist  
who created the training program that taught Disneyland employees 
how to sell happiness with a smile, has died at 87. 
</P>
<P>
	France, who died Thursday of pneumonia, was hired before  
Disneyland opened in 1955 to create the training program, called 
the University of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney told France to come up with lessons that would help  
employees avoid a carnival image. The result was France's employee 
training manual, which became legendary in the retail industry 
because of its instructions to treat customers as guests who were 
buying the product of happiness. 
</P>
<P>
	France was so cheerful, fellow employees at the self-described  
Happiest Place on Earth called him Disneyland's Jiminy Cricket. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, Van was as much a part of Disneyland as the castle or  
the carousel,'' said former Disneyland President Jack Lundquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Disneyland's employees included the comic Steve

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Urges Calm Y2K Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The millennium computer bug should not disrupt  
the nation's economy unless consumers and businesses significantly 
change their buying patterns, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to the National Italian American Foundation,  
Greenspan expressed confidence that American business will be ready 
for the Year 2000 date change given the intensive preparations they 
have made to prepare their computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The probability of a cascading of computer failures in  
mission-critical systems is now negligible,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Greenspan said, even though the public's  
understanding of the matter has grown and fears of widespread 
disruptions waned, ``We are not as yet home free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said he still is apprehensive over the potential for  
economic impact of hoarding or other significant changes in 
traditional spending patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why it is crucial for authorities to get out the most  
up-to-date and reliable information to ensure that businesses and 
consumers make economic judgments based on facts and not rumors, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accurate, credible and timely information on the general state  
of readiness will be essential to reducing uncertainties in the 
months ahead,'' Greenspan said. This way, businesses will be able 
to base their decisions on inventory stockpiling on accurate 
information and not overstock out of unfounded fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer reactions also will be critical to determining whether  
the computer change will have a major impact on economic activity, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To this end, Greenspan repeated his warning that banks will  
remain safe for people to keep their cash. ``The safest thing for 
consumers to do with their money around year-end is to leave it 
where it is,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only a ``small number of households, driven by fear of  
the unknown, tell pollsters that they are planning to build large 
stockpiles of food, water, fuel and cash as the millennium 
approaches,'' Greenspan said. But he expressed anxiety about a 
rising level of consumer worries as the news media focus more 
attention on the question. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is too compelling a story for audiences that thrive on  
countdowns to the unknown,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As attention heightens and rumors inevitably mushroom, it is  
important that what is known and what is not known be clearly 
articulated by those of us in both public and private leadership 
positions,'' he said. In the end, he said, ``facts are the only 
antidote for rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Y2K problem exists because many older computers  
and software programs recognize only the last two digits of the 
year and could mistakenly interpret ``00'' as 1900.

<HEADLINE> Bush Courts Hispanic Vote in Wash. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- Courting the Hispanic vote with children  
too young to cast a ballot but old enough to talk to their parents, 
Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush read to students and 
played marbles Friday at a Yakima elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31 million Hispanics living in the United States are the  
fastest-growing minority group and potentially influential voting 
bloc, which polls show tend to favor Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's muy importante,'' Bush, the governor of Texas, said when  
asked how critical the Hispanic vote would be in next year's 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, he received star billing in Seattle at the  
National Federation of Republican Women's last convention before 
the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates cheered his presentation of himself as one of ``a  
rising generation of Republican leaders who are not just explaining 
problems, we are solving them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welfare reform, crime bills and economic expansion are hallmarks  
of Republican leadership, he said in a speech that contained no 
specific policy proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for limited, but compassionate government, with help  
for those who need it, but lower taxes and a leaner, less 
regulation-happy bureaucracy. He also called for worldwide free 
trade and warned against isolationism. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's wife Laura, a member of the group's Texas chapter, will  
speak on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, Bush spent about 90 minutes at the 500-student  
Garfield Elementary School, which is 76 percent Hispanic and 81 
percent minority overall. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief media availability, Bush said he favored changes to  
current guest-worker laws, which would make it easier for foreign 
workers to enter this country temporarily, and that he opposed a 
new amnesty program for illegal immigrants in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are heavily debated topics in agricultural Yakima County,  
where growers depend on migrant labor. Growers have said they would 
like changes in guest-worker laws that would improve access to 
legal workers from Mexico. Some migrant worker advocates have 
opposed such changes and are seeking a new amnesty program instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there ought to be amnesty at this time,'' Bush  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who exhibited the same ease with children that his father,  
former President George Bush, seems to have, selected a book called 
``The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' to read to a group of first-graders 
at Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
	He watched others work on computers and then made a couple of  
shots in the weekly marble tournament here. He told the students 
that when he attended Sam Houston Elementary School, ``I thought I 
was a pretty cool marble shooter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He missed his first shot, however, but made up for it on a  
second try.

<HEADLINE> Body of Abducted Kansas Girl Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAIN VALLEY, Mo. (AP) -- The nude body of a 10-year-old Kansas  
girl was found in a rural area Friday, three days after she was 
abducted in front of her home while roller skating with her sister, 
her parents said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI would not disclose how Pamela Butler died and said it  
did not know whether she had been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	A suspect, Keith B. Nelson, 24, was captured Thursday after a  
manhunt in Kansas City, Kan., where the girl lived. He was charged 
with kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, the FBI quoted a co-worker of Nelson's as  
saying that Nelson told him two weeks ago that he ``would like to 
kidnap a girl to rape, torture, electrocute, kill and bury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agent Monte Strait confirmed that the body and some clothing  
found separately matched the fifth-grader's description. The body 
was not buried but was covered with sticks. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 officers had searched a field and woods Friday in  
Grain Valley, about 25 miles from the girl's home. The body was 
found near a church where a pickup truck believed to have been used 
in the kidnapping was spotted a few hours after Pamela disappeared 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found her. That's all I can say,'' Pamela's father, Paul  
Butler, said tearfully said outside her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela was skating Tuesday evening when her 11-year-old sister,  
Penny, saw a man get out of a white pickup, grab Pamela around the 
waist and throw her into the cab. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started screaming, and so did she,'' said Penny, who was on  
her front porch at the time. She yelled for an older sister to call 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses reported a license number after they chased the truck  
but couldn't keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck was registered to a company formerly owned by David  
Cunningham, Nelson's boss. Cunningham said Nelson had been driving 
the truck for two weeks, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson was captured after he was spotted near the Kansas River.  
Police said he tried to swim away as officers approached. 
</P>
<P>
	While authorities searched for Pamela, classmates decorated her  
home with cards made out of construction paper and gave teddy 
bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela's mother, Cherri West, had appealed to the kidnapper to  
give back her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``For someone to come here and do this, it's just not right,''  
she said. ``She was just a little girl, she had a whole life 
ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson underwent surgery Friday for injuries to his knee and leg  
suffered in a fall, the FBI said. He was in fair condition. He was 
to spent Friday night in the hospital.

<HEADLINE> New Guidelines on Inmate Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- In the 1950s, some inmates in American  
prisons were intentionally infected with live cancer cells, herpes, 
ringworm, hepatitis and syphilis -- all in the name of medical 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	When those and other experiments were publicized in the 1970s,  
they stopped. Research was banned in some state prisons and 
curtailed in others. 
</P>
<P>
	Vowing not to repeat the mistakes of the past, a panel of  
experts has produced a preliminary set of guidelines for clinical 
tests on prison inmates across the country. The moves follows 
requests by prisoners to participate in research again, given the 
advent of AIDS and hepatitis C. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Anne De Groot said clinical tests are now being done in some  
prisons and jails across the country, and are regulated under 
federal guidelines. But, she said, the current guidelines say very 
little about prisoner participation in research and there is little 
oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, prisoners who have AIDS must be given access to  
cutting-edge clinical tests, she said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee believes that research trials should be made  
accessible to inmates under certain conditions,'' said De Groot, 
co-chair of the HIV/Prison Project at the Brown University AIDS 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those conditions may set a higher standard for trials  
conducted in correctional settings than is currently set for trials 
outside corrections, due to the special vulnerability of 
prisoners,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's meeting concluded a three-day conference convened by  
the Brown University AIDS Program and the HIV in Prisons Program of 
Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the preliminary guidelines, De Groot said the team of  
16 AIDS researchers, medical ethicists, lawyers and prisoner 
advocates decided prisons where research is conducted must have 
high quality medical care already available, so inmates do not feel 
coerced into research programs simply to get proper treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	And, De Groot said, former inmates should be used as impartial  
observers to oversee research projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines will take at least two months to be finalized  
because several experts crucial to their development were not able 
to attend Friday's session, De Groot said. 
</P>
<P>
	They will then be submitted to medical and governmental  
organizations for approval and adoption.

<HEADLINE> Brooklyn Studio Plans in Mixed Up </HEADLINE>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Robert De Niro says the city pulled the plug on  
his planned $150 million film and TV studio project at the Brooklyn 
Navy Yard, despite assurances from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani that 
everything was set. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Giuliani announced that instead of backing  
the De Niro group's project, the city had signed an agreement with 
another developer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Thursday, De Niro, Miramax Films  
president Harvey Weinstein and Tribeca Productions executive Jane 
Rosenthal suggested they were misled by the city, which leases the 
Navy Yard. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said that no agreement had ever been reached with the  
De Niro group. As proof, he offered a May 3 City Hall news release 
that announced that the De Niro studio project was being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a lawyer. What does it say in the press release?'' he  
asked, before answering. ``The word in the press release, repeated

<HEADLINE> Diarrhea Vaccine Pulled From Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just a year after the government approved it,  
the world's only vaccine against the leading cause of childhood 
diarrhea was pulled off the market Friday because of fears it may 
increase infants' risk of a dangerous bowel obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The government advised doctors in July to temporarily stop  
vaccinating babies against rotavirus after counting 20 infants who 
developed bowel obstruction shortly after swallowing the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1 million U.S. infants had been vaccinated.  
</P>
<P>
	The government now has at least 99 reports of bowel obstruction  
possibly linked to the vaccine. So manufacturer American Home 
Products took the larger step of pulling its RotaShield vaccine off 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Any doctors who still have doses should return them to the  
manufacturer immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents should not worry if their babies took RotaShield without  
problems, said Dr. Jesse Goodman of the Food and Drug 
Administration. Cases of the bowel obstruction, called 
intussusception, thought linked to RotaShield occurred within the 
first week or two after vaccination. 
</P>
<P>
	This type of bowel obstruction, where a part of the intestine  
becomes enfolded within another, can occur by chance whether or not 
a baby ever had a rotavirus vaccine. One estimate suggests it 
strikes 50 of every 100,000 babies, with boys affected twice as 
often as girls. Symptoms include vomiting, bloody stools and 
abdominal pain. Surgery often is needed to clear the blockage if it 
isn't caught early. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies are most likely to contract intussusception between the  
ages of 5 months and 9 months, about the same age that babies 
received RotaShield. 
</P>
<P>
	A few bowel obstructions occurred during testing of RotaShield,  
so the FDA warned on the vaccine's label of a potential bowel 
obstruction side effect. 
</P>
<P>
	But as additional reports came in once RotaShield began selling,  
the question became whether RotaShield really did increase babies' 
risk, and if so, how much? 
</P>
<P>
	The government has studies under way to try to answer those  
questions but so far cannot say definitively what RotaShield's risk 
was. Part of the investigation is to figure out how a vaccine could 
physically cause part of the intestine to slip out of place. One 
possible theory is that it might cause some bowel inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	RotaShield was hailed last year as a long-awaited way to fight  
the leading cause of severe childhood diarrhea, a virus that 
attacks the lining of the small intestine. Sufferers, mostly under 
age 5, can experience 10 to 20 diarrhea episodes in a single day, 
quickly getting dangerously dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, rotavirus sickens 3 million American children and  
hospitalizes about 55,000. It strikes mostly between November and 
May. Good health care in the United States means rotavirus kills no 
more than 20 Americans a year. Studies showed RotaShield cut 
rotavirus cases in half, thus promising to help avoid thousands of 
hospitalizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotavirus, much more deadly in developing countries, kills up to  
1 million children worldwide each year. So the National Institutes 
of Health scientists who discovered the vaccine had high hopes it 
would be used abroad to save lives. The NIH declined comment 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although RotaShield will no longer be sold, proving what  
happened is important to doctors working to create other rotavirus 
vaccines. Scientists at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati recently 
reported they have created a new candidate, but testing by 
manufacturer SmithKline Beecham will take several years. 
</P>
<P>
	RotaShield is the latest in a string of problems for American  
Home Products. Last week the company agreed to pay $4.83 billion to 
settle claims that its half of the fen-phen diet drug combination 
caused heart problems. Within the last year, American Home had to 
withdraw the painkiller Duract because it caused fatal liver 
toxicity; agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement of lawsuits 
claiming the Norplant contraceptive caused side effects; and 
recalled more than half a million apparently subpotent kits used to 
treat deadly allergic reactions.

<HEADLINE> E-Trading Networks Seeking Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Consolidation among electronic stock trading  
networks appears to be heating up, as the upstart systems attempt 
to marshal resources and customers in order to stay alive in the 
highly competitive market. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion in online stock trading has resulted in a  
proliferation of electronic communications systems, or ECNs, which 
match buy and sell orders for customers through computerized 
networks that are touted as being faster and cheaper than the 
large, traditional exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	But securities industry analysts have long predicted that a  
shake out among ECNs is just around the corner. Now it looks like 
the industry may have reached that turning point. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports have recently surfaced that two of the smaller players  
in the nascent world of electronic exchanges -- Strike Technologies 
LLC and Brass Utility LLC -- are discussing a possible merger. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Strike Technologies confirmed that Strike was  
talking to other ECNs about joining forces. But the spokesman 
downplayed specific talk of a merger with Brass Utility. Brass 
Utility officials didn't immediately return calls seeking comment 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There are currently nine electronic networks vying for both  
institutional business and the growing number of individual 
investors who trade online through ECNs. 
</P>
<P>
	Scaling back the number is ``necessary, inevitable and good,''  
said Junius Peake, a finance professor at the University of 
Northern Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is essentially a cleanup brought about by the forces of  
competition and customers' demands for a marketplace where a buyer 
has access to every potential seller, '' said Peake, who has long 
supported a more centralized marketplace for stock trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The proliferation of independent ECNs has raised concerns that  
stock markets have become too fragmented, leaving investors unable 
to find the best stock prices available because a given stock is 
being traded in several unconnected markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidation among ECNs could alleviate those fears by reducing  
the number of markets in which stocks are traded. Regulation of the 
new markets might also be easier if there are fewer to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, competition will be the driving force behind the  
shakeout, according to market analysts. Since investors want 
markets where they can find other buyers and sellers, it makes 
sense for ECNs to combine and bring together as many customers as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fragmentation leads to a profit problem. You have a number of  
ECNs competing for the same business, but no one really knows how 
much business there is. They need to consolidate to obtain 
economies of scale,'' said David Bayless, a securities lawyer and 
former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's San 
Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Madoff, head of Madoff Securities in New York, agreed.  
``There just isn't enough order flow to sustain all of these 
ECNs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	ECN survival will depend on which of the fledgling networks can  
generate the most liquidity -- or create the most active markets, 
Madoff added. ``The survivors will be the ones that can create that 
critical mass of trading volume and combine it with the best 
technology,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	ECN operators say investors -- with or without consolidation  
brought about mergers -- will gravitate toward whatever markets are 
most active because that's where the best prices will be found. 
``Order flow will gravitate together because it would be 
inefficient for it not to. Everyone is in search of liquidity,'' 
said Cameron Smith, Island ECN's legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, Island and Instinet, the oldest and largest ECN,  
handle about 90 percent of the trades completed on ECNs. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 percent of all trades of stocks listed on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market now take place on ECNs. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Satow, president of MarketXT, a small ECN that operates  
an after-hours trading session, said investors can only benefit if 
electronic networks are strengthened through consolidation. ``It's 
a good thing for the markets to have each of the players as strong 
as possible,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> GM, Suzuki Plan Car for Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- American automaker General Motors Corp. will  
produce a small passenger vehicle it has developed with Suzuki 
Motor Corp. for sale in the Asian market starting in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The new model, called the YGM-1, is based on Suzuki's new small  
car platform and GM's design engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	Both GM and Suzuki, which is 10 percent owned by the U.S.  
automaker, said Friday they haven't decided where in Asia the YGM 
will be manufactured and refused to say how many vehicles they 
expect to produce a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still studying locations,'' said Rudolph A. Schlais  
Jr., president of GM Asia Pacific. But he added the automakers hope 
to make a decision soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshio Saito, chairman of Suzuki, said the company's Kosai plant  
southwest of Tokyo is ``one of the possible options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schlais said the car is likely to be sold in Japan and  
Australia, but that the companies are also looking into other 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The YGM will be GM's first passenger car to be manufactured in  
Asia for the Asian market. The car will be aimed at buyers between 
the ages of 30 and 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlais said the YGM reflects GM's commitment to the Asia  
region, which he estimates will become the second largest 
automotive market in the next 10 years, with sales approaching 20 
million vehicles a year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM aims to raise its market share in the region from 4 percent  
to 10 percent over the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader To Visit Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- President Jiang Zemin will discuss China's bid to  
enter the World Trade Organization with leaders of Britain, France 
and Portugal next week and will sign an oil agreement during a 
visit to Saudi Arabia, Chinese Foreign Ministry officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang leaves Monday on a two-week trip, first to the three  
European countries and then to Morocco, Algeria and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights protests are expected during Jiang's visit to  
Europe, which has become routine when Chinese leaders travel to 
Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news briefing today, Guan Chengyuan, deputy head of the  
Western European section of the ministry, hinted that the trip 
wasn't expected to seal a deal on China's bid to enter the WTO. The 
European Union, the United States and Canada are pressing China to 
open its markets wider before it can join the trade rules-making 
body. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit's purpose is ceremonial, Guan said, ``not to reach an  
agreement on detailed issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang will be accompanied by Foreign Trade Minister Shi  
Guangsheng, who recently resumed negotiations with the EU on 
China's WTO bid. 
</P>
<P>
	China broke off WTO talks with the EU and the United States  
after NATO accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on 
May 7. Talks with the United States resumed recently after a break 
of more than four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Guan refused to comment when asked whether the bombing was still  
troubling relations with NATO countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang's visit to London and Cambridge will be the first by a  
Chinese head of state to England. He will leave for Paris on Oct. 
22 and begin a two-day visit to Portugal on Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Portuguese colony of Macau set to return to Chinese  
control on Dec. 20, China wants to show its hopes for a smooth 
transfer of power, Guan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The second part of Jiang's trip is designed to show China's  
desire for good ties with Islamic countries in the Arab world, said 
a ministry official with the division of West Asian and North 
African Affairs. China also wants to talk about buying more Saudi 
oil and the possibility of joint development of a refinery.

<HEADLINE> Apple Computer Rescinds Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bowing to a surge of customer complaints, Apple  
Computer Inc. backed off Friday from a decision to retroactively 
raise prices on some computers that customers already had ordered 
and paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy had threatened to blemish Apple's public image,  
which has greatly improved over the past year as the company 
delivered a string of popular new computers and strong financial 
results this past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will probably go down in the record books as the most  
customer-unfriendly act this year, if not the last few years,'' 
said Rob Enderle, an analyst at the Giga Information Group, a 
consulting firm in San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be No. 1 on the list of how to send people to other  
companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time Apple has faced criticism for its  
selling practices. On two occasions in the past two years, the 
computer company has reached settlements with the Federal Trade 
Commission over charges that it misled customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over computer pricing erupted on Wednesday when  
the company said it would delay the launch of its fastest G4 model, 
which sports a 500 megahertz microprocessor, until early next year 
due to a shortage of the computer chips from Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also said it would cancel orders from customers who prior  
to Wednesday had ordered slower models of the G4, but hadn't yet 
received their machines. 
</P>
<P>
	When customers tried to reorder the machines, they learned that  
the same units would cost up to $350 more. And those who had 
ordered 500 megahertz machines were offered slower units for the 
same price. 
</P>
<P>
	Web sites quickly filled up with protests from angry customers,  
and Apple fielded complaints as well. 
</P>
<P>
	One customer, Jon-Paul Kelly, a video editor and graphic  
animator based in San Francisco, had ordered a 500-megahertz 
machine for $4,750, and was told he could get a 450-megahertz 
machine instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a bit disappointed to find out I had to pay the same  
price for basically a lesser machine,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday morning, Apple formally reversed its decision. A memo  
from The Apple Store, Apple's Web site for online sales, informed 
customers Apple decided to honor the original price ``after a good 
night's sleep and digesting emails from many upset customers.'' 
Apple also said it would offer discounts on slower machines to 
people who had ordered the top model. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ordered a Power Mac G4 configured with a 400 MHz or 450  
MHz processor prior to October 13, we will honor the original price 
quoted for your order,'' the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused you,''  
it added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhona Hamilton, a spokeswoman with Cupertino, Calif.-based  
Apple, said the pricing reversal also affected retail stores and 
other online distributors of Apple products. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple tried to downplay the impact of the tiff. Mitch Mandich,  
head of worldwide sales for Apple, said that only a ``very small 
percentage of customers'' were demanding the same price. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers ``are not really pleased with the decision but for the  
most part they understand,'' Mandich said. ``We're trying to do the 
best job we can do under the best circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident isn't Apple's first brush with controversial  
selling behavior. Early this year, Apple, in a settlement with the 
Federal Trade Commission, agreed to reimburse customers for a $35 
fee it charged them for a technical support package that it had 
said would be free. And in 1997, Apple settled FTC allegations that 
it overcharged for upgrading some computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Peeler, the FTC's associate director for advertising  
practices, would not comment on whether the FTC was taking a look 
at this week's incident. Mandich of Apple declined to comment on 
legal matters. 
</P>
<P>
	While many customers were upset by Apple's move to raise prices,  
some Apple loyalists were not overly fazed by the turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they charged $300 more, I would have absolutely no problems  
paying that,'' said Sanjay Sakhuja, president of Digital Pre-Press 
International. a printing company based in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	His company ordered 10 G4s prior to Wednesday, and looked  
forward to the speedier performance of the new machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The machines we are replacing with these new machines are 2-3  
years old,'' he added. ``To pay 10 percent or 15 percent more, for 
us it's worth it.''

<HEADLINE> Marshall Looking for Perfect Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Small school. Undefeated season. Top 10  
finish. Marshall is looking to steal Tulane's act. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulane rose from the obscurity of Conference USA last year to go  
undefeated, win the Liberty Bowl and finish ranked No. 7. It has 
given Marshall hope that small can indeed make it big. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 15 Marshall, which hails from the little-recognized  
Mid-American Conference, is 6-0 following Thursday night's 38-13 
victory over Toledo. With four of five remaining games against 
teams with losing records, Marshall also is looking for a perfect 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tulane probably paved the way for some smaller schools to jump  
into the bigger arena quickly and get some recognition,'' Marshall 
receivers coach Gunter Brewer said. ``We feel like here we've been 
a great secret for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The similarities don't end with the two programs.  
</P>
<P>
	Tulane quarterback Shaun King finished in the top 10 in  
balloting for the Heisman Trophy last year. Marshall believes it 
has a legitimate candidate in Chad Pennington. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennington has completed 63 percent of his passes for 1,962  
yards and 17 scores. He ranks second in Division I-A passing 
efficiency behind Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	His 393 yards against Toledo gave him 11,316 for his career,  
moving him ahead of Tennessee's Peyton Manning into eighth place on 
the NCAA's passing list. 
</P>
<P>
	Want more? In 1997, Pennington broke Tim Couch of Kentucky's  
NCAA record for sophomores with 39 TD passes. 
</P>
<P>
	With 95 career touchdown passes, he is looking to become just  
the 11th college quarterback to throw for 100 scores. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of poise and accuracy,'' Toledo coach Gary  
Pinkel said. ``He's a veteran now. He does a lot of checks at the 
line. He can throw any kind of ball. He's a class act all the 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pennington doesn't want himself or Marshall to ride anyone's  
coattails. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were saying we were the '99 version of Tulane. But we  
just want to be the '99 version of Marshall,'' he said. ``We don't 
want to be compared to anybody. We want to set our own standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Tulane had a losing record just a few years earlier,  
Marshall has enjoyed a decade of success. Its 107 victories in the 
1990s are a record for any decade in Division I-A or I-AA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thundering Herd also have Division I-A's longest overall  
winning streak at 10 games and the best home winning streak of 28 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall has three road games left this season. While the  
Thundering Herd are 10-3 on the road since 1997, surprises 
occasionally happen. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago Marshall started 8-0 and was on the verge of cracking  
the Top 25 for the first time before it was upset by 2-5 Bowling 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
	So don't blame Thundering Herd players if they refrain from  
jumping for joy. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a team we have to stay focused and realize we're no better  
than our last performance,'' Pennington said. ``We need to keep 
pressing forward and realize that there are some crazy things that 
go on in college football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall and Toledo have met in the title game the past two  
seasons with the Thundering Herd winning both times to earn an 
automatic berth in the Motor City Bowl in Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	There is talk that Marshall should consider bypassing the Motor  
City if it wins the rest of its games to play in a more prestigious 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bob Pruett isn't willing to turn his back on the bowl that  
has welcomed his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get involved in that. If we can get to the  
Ford Motor City Bowl, we'll be extremely pleased. That means we'll 
have won the conference,'' he said. ``We're very honored and 
tickled that we got to go there twice, and I hope we get to go 
again.''

<HEADLINE> Other Martinez Loses For Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ramon is Boston's second-best Martinez, not bad  
considering how good the best one is -- but not good enough to beat 
the defending champion New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when he pitched an outstanding game Thursday night with a  
surgically repaired right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Classic Ramon,'' raved Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan.  
</P>
<P>
	But not good enough to beat the Yankees.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the greatest teams,'' Martinez said. ``That is  
the reason why they are here. I know that I am going to have a 
tough game. I did the best that I could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it still wasn't good enough to beat the Yankees.  
</P>
<P>
	``He pitched a tremendous game,'' Boston manager Jimy Williams  
said. ``kept us in that game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A game the Yankees still won 3-2 to go ahead 2-0 in the  
best-of-7 AL championship series. And now the other Martinez -- the 
one who just happens to be the best pitcher in baseball -- must try 
to save the Sox again. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez did it with six innings of hitless relief in  
Monday night's deciding fifth game of the first round against 
Cleveland after he sprained a back muscle five days earlier. Boston 
won it 12-8 after it had lost the first two games of that series. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Ramon's younger brother -- a Cy Young award  
certainty with a 23-4 record, 2.07 ERA and 313 strikeouts -- faces 
former Red Sox star Roger Clemens at Fenway Park in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a great atmosphere,'' Boston reliever Derek  
Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	It could have been better if the Red Sox had capitalized on  
Ramon's strong performance to win Thursday's game. In 6 2-3 
innings, he allowed three runs, six hits and three walks and struck 
out five. 
</P>
<P>
	And he was still strong after throwing 120 pitches, 22 more than  
his busiest game of the six he pitched this year. On Sept. 2, he 
made his first start since undergoing rotator cuff surgery on his 
right shoulder nearly 15 months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can go farther than that,'' Ramon said. ``I feel fine when I  
come out of the game. I was just normal. I don't feel any kind of 
pain, tired or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His final pitch was a changeup that Chuck Knoblauch drove into  
left field for a run-scoring double that tied the game 2-2 in the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon, taller and quieter than his more emotional brother but no  
less competitive, strode slowly from the mound as he left the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Gordon came in and Derek Jeter walked.  
</P>
<P>
	Exit Gordon, enter lefty Rheal Cormier to pitch to lefty Paul  
O'Neill. The strategy backfired as O'Neill singled in the winning 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	Cormier ``pitched great,'' Kerrigan said. ``You've got to give  
O'Neill credit for fighting that pitch off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon helped keep Boston from being swept by Cleveland, pitching  
5 2-3 innings in a 9-3 Game 3 win. Williams called on him again 
Thursday night to get Boston back in the series after it lost 
Wednesday night 4-3 in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon allowed runners in each of his seven innings but pitched  
out of most of his jams. He fell behind 1-0 on Tino Martinez's 
homer in the fourth. And he went ahead 2-1 on Nomar Garciaparra's 
two-run homer in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sixth, he allowed only a walk. But in the seventh, Ricky  
Ledee led off with another walk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the only time he strayed off course a little bit was  
the walk to Ledee,'' Kerrigan said. ``But he got it right back in 
the stretch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Brosius' sacrifice bunt moved Ledee to second, and Ramon  
nearly escaped by getting Joe Girardi to pop out to the infield. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was to pitch to only one more batter.  
</P>
<P>
	That's when Knoblauch doubled, tying the game and ending Ramon's  
work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing whatever it takes to win,'' Gordon said. ``To us,  
he's a winning pitcher, regardless of what happened tonight.''

<HEADLINE> Bulls' Armstrong To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Bulls guard B.J. Armstrong will have  
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, a procedure that could keep 
him out of action for 2-4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once he has the procedure, we will get the swelling down, get  
his strength back, get his range of motion back,'' Bulls trainer 
Fred Tedeschi said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who wanted to avoid the operation, is disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to practice (Wednesday and Thursday), but I still  
felt the irritation,'' he said. ``I don't know if I can do that for 
82 games with that irritation there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who signed with the Bulls as a free agent in August,  
was a member of the 1991, 1992 and 1993 championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	An 11-year veteran, Armstrong has had operations on both his  
knees. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you keep playing and you keep jumping and bouncing and  
running and cutting, you know you only have so many jumps,'' he 
said. ``When they told me that at 18, I didn't understand. But at 
32 I understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Toni Kukoc and guard Randy Brown have also been hurting  
during the past week of two-a-day practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Kukoc sat out Wednesday morning's practice with swelling in his  
right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls coach Tim Floyd said he has no plans to back off from the  
workload. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have an awful lot of young guys who need reps and  
there's no other way to get them,'' he said.

                            *Joseph Burg    	
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Joseph Burg, an Israeli founding father,  
longtime Cabinet minister and advocate of coexistence between 
religious Jews and secular Israelis, died Friday at a Jerusalem 
hospital. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Dresden, Germany, in 1909, Burg was active in the Young  
Mizrahi religious Zionist movement while attending university in 
Leipzig. He was studying in Berlin when the Nazis came to power in 
1933, but he managed to complete his doctorate as well as qualify 
as an ordained rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1939 he came to Palestine, and worked as a high school  
teacher, but was soon elected to the executive committee of the 
Jewish Agency, which served as a pre-state shadow government for 
the Jews in Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of the founders of the National Religious Party,  
which has been a coalition partner in almost every Israeli 
government, whether of the right or the left. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the NRP played a centrist role in Israeli politics,  
but when Israel captured the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the 
1967 Mideast war, the younger generation in the party moved rapidly 
to the right. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1977, Burg was placed in charge of peace negotiations with  
Egypt. He wholeheartedly supported the 1979 land-for-peace deal, 
but many in his party opposed it, fearing an Israeli withdrawal 
from the Sinai Peninsula would set a precedent for a pullback from 
the West Bank.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sam Cohen, known to New Yorkers as a master lox  
slicer who held the No. 1 slot at the gourmet grocery Zabar's, died 
Oct. 9 of lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Believed to be 86, Cohen's true age was unknown because he was  
orphaned as a young child. He also survived a concentration camp 
under Adolf Hitler's regime. 
</P>
<P>
	His penchant for flirting and friendship, the ability to speak  
Russian, Polish, Hebrew, Spanish and English, and a willingness to 
explain the basics as well as the finer points of enjoying lox, 
made Cohen a favorite in the Upper West Side neighborhood where he 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen was born in Poland, and worked as a book dealer, the  
secretary of a small bank, and a dealer in animal feed before World 
War II. He came to the United States in 1952, tried out television 
repair and then settled into Zabar's, where he weighed salmon, 
sturgeon, gefilte fish, and pickled lox with a smile.

	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Van Arsdale France, the sunny optimist  
who created the training program that taught Disneyland employees 
how to sell happiness with a smile, died Thursday of pneumonia at 
87. 
</P>
<P>
	Walt Disney told France to come up with lessons that would help  
employees avoid a carnival image. The result was France's employee 
training manual, which became legendary in the retail industry 
because of its instructions to treat customers as guests who were 
buying the product of happiness. 
</P>
<P>
	France was so cheerful, fellow employees at the self-described  
Happiest Place on Earth called him Disneyland's Jiminy Cricket. 
</P>
<P>
	France went into semi-retirement in the 1980s. He continued to  
work as a consultant until his death.

	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Journalist and publisher Yiannis Horn, the  
founder of the Athens News, Greece's English-language newspaper, 
died Friday at age 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Horn founded the Athens News in 1952 and sold it to the  
Lambrakis Research Foundation Company in 1993. He stayed on as 
publisher until August. 
</P>
<P>
	Horn also established the magazine Political Issues in 1973, and  
published Greece's English-language Who's Who in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	As a journalist, he worked at the Athens newspapers Esperini,  
Vradini and Athinaiki. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1967-74 military dictatorship, Horn was jailed for  
several months in 1973 for publishing stories that offended the 
regime.

<P>
	Horn is survived by his wife Stephani.

</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- Former Arkansas Sen. Max Howell, considered  
one of the most powerful people in state government during his 46 
years in the Legislature, died Friday after a long illness. He was 
83. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer, farmer, and Democrat from Jacksonville, Howell served  
in the Legislature from 1947 through 1992. He was a state 
representative from 1947-1950 and senator from 1951 until he 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Howell was elected along with a number of World War II veterans  
who had been sent to the Legislature to reform government. 
</P>
<P>
	He is credited with helping improve the State Hospital and the  
mental health system in Arkansas, pushing for the rights of 
institutionalized patients. In 1947, Howell wrote one of the first 
Freedom of Information Acts, and he helped protect the Old State 
House from destruction in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	Howell also was a leader in the creation of the University of  
Arkansas at Little Rock and its law school, as well as the 
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer, Howell served in the Army Judge Advocate General  
during his military service during World War II. He completed his 
military service in 1946 but served 30 more years in the Arkansas 
National Guard.

                            *Josef Locke    	
</P>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Singer Josef Locke, whose romantic tenor  
voice and colorful life inspired the 1992 film ``Hear My Song,'' 
died Friday after a long illness. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	He was born Joseph McLaughlin in the Creggan district of  
Londonderry, Northern Ireland, son of a cattle dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving with the British army in North Africa in World War  
II, he made a flourishing career as a singer in Britain in the 
1940s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
	A stocky man with a plump face, he was not an obvious candidate  
for matinee idol. But he had great charm and a voice that could 
melt a heart of stone with such songs as ``I'll Take You Home Again 
Kathleen,'' ``Tobermory Bay'' and ``Hear My Song.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Locke fled to the Irish Republic in 1958 just ahead of British  
authorities threatening prosecution for tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
	After he fled, rumors started that he was still in England,  
performing under the name of ``Mr X.'' Police eventually arrested 
``Mr. X'' for tax evasion, slapped him in jail -- and then 
discovered he was not Locke at all, but an impersonator.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Floods Streets of Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Hurricane Irene unloaded up to 16 inches of rain on  
Florida, flooding the streets of Miami, stalling cars and knocking 
out power Friday to hundreds of thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
	With winds of 85 mph, Irene was a relatively weak hurricane, but  
its heavy rain and sluggish pace made it a menace. And forecasters 
warned it was on a path that could bring more misery to 
flood-ravaged North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered flooding was reported in a 200-mile area from Key West  
to West Palm Beach. In Miami, police listed at least 65 streets, 
including major intersections, with floodwaters at least 6 inches 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas urged employers to let  
workers go home early to ease traffic. ``It's like a permanent high 
tide,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The floodwaters left cars stalled in the streets and thwarted  
drivers' attempts to get home. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael LaCombe, 21, was trying to drive from his job in Miami  
to his home 12 miles north in Aventura when his car conked out. 
``This is ridiculous,'' a soaked LaCombe said after pushing his car 
out of shin-deep water. ``I should have called in sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm moved through the Florida Keys and rolled ashore  
Friday afternoon near Cape Sable, 75 miles southwest of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 p.m., it was over the Everglades, about 60 miles southwest  
of West Palm Beach, moving north-northeast around 13 mph. It was 
expected to maintain that motion before exiting the state near Cape 
Canaveral sometime Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before striking Florida, Irene drenched Cuba's tobacco fields  
and collapsed buildings in Havana, where at least two people were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, at least 425,000 people lost power with no hope of  
getting it restored until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Hurricane Center in Miami had to switch over to  
backup generators when the power went out for about 30 seconds and 
blacked out computer screens. It took about 90 minutes to reboot 
all the computers, during which forecasters were able to get the 
data they needed from Kansas City, Mo., and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Airports remained open, but most airlines suspended service to  
South Florida until at least Saturday. The University of Miami 
closed its campus. High school football games were postponed, as 
were two $400,000 thoroughbred races scheduled for Saturday at 
Calder Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Clevelander Hotel on trendy South Beach, only four of 58  
rooms were occupied. ``It's just nasty, windy and awful,'' manager 
Chris Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton declared a state of emergency, making federal  
money available for cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said they expected Irene to push into the Atlantic  
Ocean and then head inland again near the Georgia-South Carolina 
line. Heavy rain was a possibility across North Carolina, still 
recovering from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly it's too early to panic,'' said Tom Hegele of the  
North Carolina emergency management agency. ``If we need to change 
our focus from recovery to preparation and response for another 
event, that's what we'll do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain on eastern North  
Carolina last month, killing at least 49 people and causing 
billions in damage in the state's costliest natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The eye of the hurricane passed near Key West, where the  
floodwaters in the streets didn't stop the beer from flowing. At 
Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville Cafe, loud cheers erupted when the 
lights came back on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get busier when the power goes out,'' bartender Doug Gober  
said. ``There's nothing to do but drink.''

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The city on Friday appealed a judge's  
dismissal of its lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, which 
demanded reimbursement for the costs of providing police, 
emergency, court and prison services for shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert Ruehlman of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court  
dismissed the lawsuit Oct. 7, ruling that it was vague or not 
supported by law or prior court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first dismissal of a suit brought against gun makers  
by a municipality. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Chesley, representing the city, said Cincinnati deserves  
the opportunity to review documents and take statements from gun 
industry officials so a jury can examine safety issues and 
marketing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The City Council voted 5-4 on Wednesday to file the appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed against gun manufacturers, a distributor  
and three trade associations. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-seven other municipalities and two states are pursuing  
similar lawsuits.

<HEADLINE> Officer Charged With Marine's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine officer was charged with  
negligent homicide in the death of a corporal during a hike in 
July, with an investigator saying he marched his group too fast, 
with not enough time for breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Victor A. Arana, 28, faced an Article 32 hearing Thursday,  
which is similar to a civilian grand jury. The hearing will be 
concluded at a later date at the request of Arana's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Arana also has been charged with dereliction of duty and failing  
to obey a lawful order, according to a statement from Camp Lejeune, 
where the hearing took place. 
</P>
<P>
	A camp spokesman, Lt. Nick Ritzcovan, said such charges are rare  
following a training exercise death. ``Obviously it doesn't happen 
very often,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arana, whose hometown was not available, is formerly the  
commanding officer of the unit at the base's School of Infantry to 
which Lance Cpl. Giuseppe Leto, 21, was assigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Leto, of New Milford, Conn., had insisted on completing the  
night conditioning hike July 8 even though he showed signs of 
heat-related stress, authorities said. But after he finished, he 
wandered off and collapsed. He wasn't found until two hours later, 
and efforts to revive him failed. Base spokesman Capt. James Rich 
did not know the result of an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	Arana marched his men faster than specified in training  
guidelines, didn't allow enough time for breaks during the hike, 
and went home when the march was completed rather than remaining 
with the unit, according to the investigator's report. 
</P>
<P>
	A Marine sergeant was faulted for not promptly taking a head  
count at the completion of the hike. That likely would have 
revealed that Leto had wandered off, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report at least appears to be very candid in its  
content,'' said Roland Moots, the Leto family's attorney. ``I'll be 
meeting with the Leto family next week, and at that time, we'll 
have a better idea where we're going with this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigator, Lt. Col. Joseph D. Provenzano, also  
recommended changes in training procedures that would permit more 
effective monitoring of Marines experiencing heat-related 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Provenzano interviewed more than 30 Marines who were on the  
hike. Both Arana and the sergeant cited in the report declined to 
give statements.

<HEADLINE> Keyes Rejects Electability Argument </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Commentator Alan Keyes said Friday that  
people who reject his Republican presidential campaign simply 
because they believe he has little chance of winning are ``very 
stupid'' and are sacrificing their vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Haven't you figured out yet if you never vote for what you  
believe, it can't possibly win?'' Keyes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes spoke during a taping of Iowa Public Television's ``Iowa  
Press.'' The program airs Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was questioned about conservatives who find his fiery message  
appealing but worry about wasting their votes on a candidate with 
little chance of actually winning the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who give in to that logic are either very stupid or  
they're insincere,'' Keyes said. ``To put not too fine a point on 
it, that position is stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes offers a conservative message, saying that the nation's  
moral fiber is crumbling, and he has one of the most eloquent 
speaking styles of any of the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last election cycle, Keyes got 7 percent of the vote in  
Iowa's leadoff caucuses, and most polls rank him about at that 
level this time. That's led many conservatives to look to other 
candidates who can make a stronger case that they can win the GOP 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see it all the time,'' Keyes said. ``I'll say it very  
bluntly to them. I say it to my audiences. 'How stupid can you 
be?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes said he has had success winning over audiences after he  
makes that case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once people pause, I've never had an audience that once I've  
said that, the light bulb didn't go on,'' Keyes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes also campaigns on a conservative theme,  
but contends that he has the money to compete with the Republican 
front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Keyes dismissed that 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think money has an impact,'' Keyes said. ``I'm not sure it's  
as decisive as people say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes noted that he spent little on Iowa's caucuses in the last  
election and got 7 percent of the vote. Forbes spent over $4 
million and got 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``That tells you something,'' Keyes said.

<HEADLINE> Source Says Starr Will Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 39-year-old assistant to Kenneth Starr will  
take over the final phase of the independent counsel's 
controversial investigation that led to the impeachment of 
President Clinton, say sources familiar with Starr's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr will formally step aside next week and be replaced by  
Robert Ray, an assistant U.S. attorney who worked for Independent 
Counsel Donald Smaltz in the probe of ex-Agriculture Secretary Mike 
Espy, say the sources, who are allies of Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's somewhat of a dubious proposition that someone involved  
both in the Espy investigation and the Starr operation'' is 
``getting a promotion,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as Mr. Starr goes, I think Americans will be glad that  
from now on, he'll be taking his garbage out each morning in 
private,'' Lockhart added. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of three federal appeals court judges that selects  
independent counsels chose Ray after interviewing a number of 
people inside Starr's office as possible successors. The judges 
told the prosecutor's office of their plans, clearing the way for 
Starr, who has hinted for months his to leave, to step down. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office declined to comment today.  
</P>
<P>
	Ray will try to wrap up an investigation that has ranged from  
fraudulent bank loans in Arkansas to impeachment charges of 
presidential perjury and obstruction of justice in the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he is relatively young, Ray has extensive experience as a  
prosecutor. He was an assistant U.S. attorney in the southern 
district of New York starting in 1989, supervising and 
participating in a number of public corruption and organized crime 
prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to work for Smaltz's office in 1995, winning convictions  
against a Tyson Foods executive and a Tyson lobbyist in the probe 
of illegal gifts to Espy. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office has two pending investigative matters:  
</P>
<P>
	--An alleged attempt to influence the testimony of presidential  
accuser Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Possible false statements regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
role in the purge of White House travel office employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Starr's successor must produce a final report on  
the Whitewater scandal -- a document that could prove to be a 
political headache for Mrs. Clinton if she follows through on plans 
to run next year for a U.S. Senate seat from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	During Starr's tenure, his office convicted 14 people, including  
the Clintons' Whitewater business partners, Jim and Susan McDougal, 
then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, who resigned his office, and 
former associate attorney general Webster Hubbell, the first lady's 
former law partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's investigation of the Lewinsky scandal -- the president's  
affair and subsequent cover-up -- led to the first presidential 
impeachment since 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr's long tenure was marred by questions over whether he  
conducted his investigation properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The starting point for the Clinton White House's public war with  
Starr's office was January 1996 when the prosecutor subpoenaed Mrs. 
Clinton before a federal grand jury to explain how her long-sought 
law firm billing records had mysteriously resurfaced inside the 
White House family residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions about the first lady focus on her legal work on the  
Castle Grande real estate venture in Arkansas co-owned by Jim 
McDougal, and businessman Seth Ward, Hubbell's father-in-law. 
Federal regulators concluded Castle Grande was riddled with insider 
transactions and land flips that bank examiners concluded lost 
money for McDougal's collapsing savings and loan. The Whitewater 
convictions of the McDougals and Tucker underscored the fraud at 
Castle Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's legal work -- none of which she says she remembers  
-- could prove an explosive issue if she decides to take on New York 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in a Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Lewinsky affair, Clinton's lawyer accused Starr's office  
of leaking grand jury material to the news media. Complaints about 
the conduct of Starr's prosecutors in the Lewinsky investigation 
poured into the Justice Department from Democrats on Capitol Hill 
as impeachment loomed late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Whitewater portion of Starr's probe, Susan McDougal said  
Starr's investigators tried to get her to tell lies that falsely 
implicated the Clintons in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The constant attacks took their toll. Public opposition to Starr  
soared. The prosecutor said the campaign against him infected the 
judicial process, leading to deadlocked juries that refused to 
convict. Starr gave up on prosecuting Susan McDougal, whose 
cooperation he never was able to get. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's impeachment by the House in the Lewinsky scandal was  
followed by acquittal in the Senate.

<HEADLINE>  Prosecutor Admits JonBenet Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Prosecutor Alex Hunter says the decision  
not to indict anyone in the murder of JonBenet Ramsey left him with 
``an aching heart,'' and he declared the search for her killer is 
not over. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the girl's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, have not  
been eliminated from the investigation. Police Chief Mark Beckner 
said the Ramseys remain ``under an umbrella of suspicion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two men spoke on Thursday, a day after Hunter announced that  
a 13-month grand jury investigation into the 1996 slaying did not 
find enough evidence to charge anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Hunter said the four prosecutors and their  
advisers working on the case unanimously agreed there was 
insufficient evidence to warrant charges in the death of the 
6-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to discuss the grand jury's investigation, including  
why JonBenet's parents were not called to testify. He also said the 
case is stronger as a result of the grand jury's work, though he 
acknowledged that ``mistakes were made'' in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have an aching heart about where we are with this case, but  
by no means do I or any of the men who you see at this table feel a 
sense of failure,'' said Hunter, flanked by other prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to follow the evidence in this case as long  
as there is work to be done. We find no reason to give up heart, we 
find no reason to quit and we plan to continue with diligence the 
effort we believe has been under way since the beginning of this 
case,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Gov. Bill Owens said a team of attorneys,  
including Attorney General Ken Salazar, will review the case and 
recommend whether a special prosecutor should be named. Owens said 
he would decide within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on Dec. 26, 1996, Mrs. Ramsey told police she found a  
ransom note demanding $118,000 for her daughter's safe return. 
Eight hours later, JonBenet's father said he found his daughter's 
body in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks later, Hunter assembled a dream team of prosecutors  
and advisers, but the investigation soon became bogged down with 
infighting between his office and police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were accused of mishandling the evidence and allowing too  
many people to have access to the crime scene; Hunter was accused 
of trying to protect JonBenet's wealthy and influential parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter turned the case over to the grand jury in September 1998.  
The grand jurors heard from investigators, the police, Ramsey 
friends and associates, JonBenet's brother Burke and her 
half-siblings. 
</P>
<P>
	After the decision not to charge anyone was announced, the  
Ramseys asked police to continue the investigation to find a 
``child killer'' still on the loose. 
</P>
<P>
	At his own news conference, Beckner said he agreed that ``there  
are things that we should have done differently and wish we would 
have done differently.'' But he added: ``To say that mistakes have 
made this an unsolvable case is not accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is not dead in the water,'' Beckner said. ``We still  
have things to do, still have evidence that is being processed and 
examined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During morning radio talk shows, angry callers lambasted Hunter,  
demanding to know why no one has been charged in the nearly three 
years since JonBenet was killed. Some defended Hunter and accused 
police of bungling the case and mishandling evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hunter got stuck with a bad case, and so did the grand  
jurors,'' said Emily Brown, who was playing with two children 
outside the Boulder County Justice Center, where the grand jury 
met. ``It upsets me.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Project Workers Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A review of work passes of employees at a  
Pentagon construction site alerted authorities to 33 illegal aliens 
who were later arrested, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers were arrested during a raid on the work site  
Thursday. Immigration rights groups said four of the workers had 
been released but a Pentagon spokesman could not confirm the 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon's Defense Protective Service notified officials at  
the Immigration and Naturalization Service ``after it was 
determined that several foreign nationals had presented fraudulent 
immigration documents to obtain building work passes,'' said Lt. 
Col. Mike Milord, a Pentagon spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Milord had no further details of the raid and an INS spokesman  
did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration rights group complained that witness accounts  
indicate Latino workers may have been separated from the crowd, 
leaving workers to wonder why they were being singled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Abel Nunez of CARECEN, a community-based immigration service  
group, said, it was seeking information ``from people that were 
present and from the different enforcement agencies to ensure that 
the civil rights of the workers were not violated.''

<HEADLINE> Suit Says Marines Jailed Wrong Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Arrested for jumping a commuter train turnstile,  
Martin L. King was shocked to find himself shackled and taken to 
the brig at Camp Lejeune, N.C., charged with deserting the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	King said he told authorities they had the wrong man; he'd never  
been in the military. Still, he was held for 40 days, during which 
he claims he was sexually assaulted by another inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a nightmare,'' King said Thursday. ``It basically felt  
like I was being terrorized by the government. That was very, very 
scary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, 33, is suing the Marines and the U.S. government for  
unspecified damages, alleging he was falsely imprisoned. The suit, 
filed in federal court in Atlanta, is awaiting a trial date. 
</P>
<P>
	According to King's suit, his ordeal began when someone stole  
his Social Security number and used it to enlist in the Marines. 
The unknown man finished basic training in 1992 at Parris Island, 
S.C., then disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in early 1996, King was fired on his first day as a YMCA  
counselor because a background check showed he was wanted for 
desertion. When he went to a Marines recruiting office in Atlanta 
to clear up the error, he said, he was laughed at and sent away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here was an innocent guy who told everybody he possibly could  
that he was innocent, that they had the wrong man,'' said Marc 
Bardack, one of King's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, King, a former college student, had a  
late-night janitor's job, no money and was living in a shelter. 
That's when he was arrested for jumping the turnstile and sent to 
Camp Lejeune.

<P>
	The Marines could have solved the problem quickly by looking at  
their own records, King's lawyers say. The impostor's file 
contained his medical and dental records, fingerprints, 
handwriting, and most importantly, his picture.

Aug. 23 to Sept. 13, 1996, and declined to comment further. He says 
even after he was let out of the brig, the Marines forced him to 
stay on the base for three more weeks, living with Marines and 
doing work around the base. He said he was finally freed when he 
talked to a television station.

	U.S. Fails To Win Pakistan Pledge  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today failed to win  
a commitment from Pakistan's military commander for a restoration 
of civilian rule, and the White House acknowledged it has very 
little leverage with the leaders of the coup that ousted the 
country's elected government. U.S. Ambassador William Milam met for 
two hours in Pakistan with Army Chief Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf to 
press for a return to democracy and civilian government. Musharraf 
today declared himself Pakistan's supreme leader, suspending the 
constitution, dissolving the legislature and declaring a state of 
emergency.

	Dow Falls 157; Nasdaq Down 55  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell today amid news of a spurt in  
inflation and a warning by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
against excessive optimism by investors. Just before noon EDT, the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 157.99 points at 10,128.63. 
Decliners on the New York Stock Exchange led advancers 2,151-631. 
The Nasdaq was down 55.99 at 2,750.85. The selloff followed a 
morning report revealing that prices at the wholesale level spiked 
1.1 percent in September, the largest increase in nine years.

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea threatened today to  
``square accounts'' with the United States for the alleged 
mass-killing of civilian refugees by U.S. soldiers during the 
Korean War. North Korea regularly churns out belligerent 
anti-American statements and experts say most of the rhetoric is 
mere propaganda. On Sept. 30, The Associated Press reported 
accounts by American veterans and South Korean villagers who said 
they saw U.S. soldiers kill up to 400 civilians at No Gun Ri, South 
Korea, early in the war. Both Washington and Seoul have promised 
inquiries.

President Clinton, say sources familiar with Starr's plans. Starr 
will formally step aside next week and be replaced by Robert Ray, 
an assistant U.S. attorney who worked in the probe of 
ex-Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, say the sources, who are allies 
of Starr. ``As far as Mr. Starr goes, I think Americans will be

Prize today. The group, officially called by its French name 
Medecins Sans Frontieres, has played a major role in Africa and

the storm cut power intermittently in this resort city as Irene's

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices fell today following a fresh  
warning from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan against 
excessive optimism by stock traders. The dollar tumbled against the 
Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 178.69  
points, or 1 percent, to close at 17,601.57. The index closed up 
25.77 points, or 0.15 percent, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 105.78 yen late today in Tokyo, down  
1.49 yen from late Thursday and also below its overnight New York 
level of 107.35 yen. During the day, it ranged from 105.73 yen to 
107.63 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to bankers Thursday night, after U.S. markets  
closed, Greenspan urged continued vigilance in managing risk at a 
time of prosperity, robust economic expansion and roaring stock 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan has warned for years against excessive economic  
optimism that can lead to risky business decisions and his comments 
Thursday followed recent warnings by federal regulators that signs 
of risk are spreading in the banking industry despite high earnings 
and hefty assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economists have been unable to anticipate sharp reversals in  
confidence,'' Greenspan told a Washington conference organized by 
the Office of the Comptroller. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a minimum, risk managers need to ... set aside somewhat  
higher contingency resources ... to cover the losses that will 
inevitably emerge from time to time when investors suffer a loss of 
confidence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also said that the decline in equity premiums that has  
kept U.S. stock prices rising in recent years could be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	The equity premium is the difference between the returns yielded  
by stocks and the returns yielded by U.S. Treasury bonds. It 
effectively reflects the reward investors demand in return for 
taking risks on stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the speech, Greenspan waded indirectly into a debate over how  
long U.S. stock prices can keep rising, although he offered no 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks are often sensitive to developments that could  
affect market sentiment in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market turned very cautious ahead of the opening of  
trading in New York, and the weekend,'' said Masatoshi Sato, 
manager at Kankaku Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices also got little support from a government report  
that slightly upgraded the assessment of Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The country is mounting a ``modest'' recovery from its worst  
downturn in decades, but weak corporate spending and high 
unemployment are still hindering the economy, Japan's Economic 
Planning Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 26.48 points, or 1.72 percent, to 1,510.26. The 
TOPIX closed up 9.78 points, or 0.64 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 757.23 million shares, down from 841.42 million shares 
Thursday. Retreaters overwhelmed advancing issues 746 to 453, while 
137 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
closed up 54.45 points, at 10,286.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's comments also sent the dollar lower.  
</P>
<P>
	``Greenspan's words have heightened concerns among traders that  
the Dow Jones Industrial Average could be on the verge of a 
significant fall and we saw the dollar losing ground to the yen, 
euro, Swiss franc and the pound today,'' said Shuji Takano, 
assistant foreign exchange manager at ABN-AMRO in Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Texas Man Accused of Aiding Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLEASANTON, Texas (AP) -- A housemate of the man who ambushed  
officers earlier this week, killing three before killing himself, 
was arrested today on charges he helped the man plan and carry out 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Vodochodsky, 19, was booked into the Atascosa County  
Jail early today, Department of Public Safety spokesman Tela Mange 
said. He was charged with three counts of capital murder and two of 
attempted capital murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Jeremiah Engleton, 21, who had been jailed early  
Tuesday for beating his wife, made a bogus 911 call later that day 
and then ambushed officers one by one as they arrived outside 
Vodochodsky's trailer home on the edge of Pleasanton. Three were 
killed and two others wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Engleton held 75 officers off for two more hours before shooting  
himself as they closed in, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found evidence that Vodochodsky took ``an active  
role in planning and carrying out the attack,'' Ms. Mange said. She 
had no detail on what officers think his precise role was. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodochodsky had told reporters Thursday that Engleton, his wife  
and two children had lived in Vodochodsky's trailer for the past 
six months with him and his family. He said he and Engleton worked 
together on a construction job. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodochodsky said Engleton had been upset because he believed his  
wife had had an affair, but ``I didn't think that he'd do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officers who were killed were Atascosa County sheriff's  
deputies Thomas Monse, 31, and Mark Stephenson, 31, and Department 
of Public Safety trooper Terry Miller, 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Tommy Williams had speculated Thursday that Engleton may  
have been angry at officers for jailing him after he beat his wife. 
When he got out of jail, she wasn't home because a family violence 
counselor had persuaded her to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found photographs of his wife in the trash.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Worries Shock Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The biggest jump in wholesale prices in nine  
years and new worries by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
about the sky-high stock market sent shock waves through U.S. and 
global markets on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors from Tokyo to Wall Street were unnerved, first by  
Greenspan's comments about the threat of a possible ``bursting 
bubble'' of stock prices and then by a government report showing a 
surge in inflation at the wholesale level. Prices for energy, food, 
tobacco and new cars all rose in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 266.90  
points, or 2.6 percent, at 10,019.71, its biggest point drop in 
more than a year. Friday's decline put the average down 1,306 
points from its Aug. 25 high, a drop of 11.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets were primed to react in a negative fashion to  
Greenspan's comments, given that investors are on heightened alert 
to possible future Fed interest rate increases. The central bank 
has already boosted its federal funds rate, the interest commercial 
banks charge each other, twice this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists said a third rate increase on Nov. 16, when Fed  
policy-makers next meet, is all but certain, especially if upcoming 
statistics show the economy still growing strongly with rising 
inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in Tokyo quickly noted Greenspan's cautionary words on  
the stock market Thursday night, with the Nikkei average falling 
178.69 points, a loss of 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The events Friday were reminiscent of the impact another late  
night Greenspan speech had in December 1996 when the Fed chief 
first worried that investors could be in the grips of ``irrational 
exuberance,'' a comment that sent stocks diving around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Dow average has soared by 57 percent since that time,  
Greenspan has returned with regularity to worries that American 
investors and the economy at large are vulnerable to a stock market 
``bubble,'' inflated prices that could plunge quickly and without 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``History tells us that sharp reversals occur abruptly, most  
often with little advance notice,'' Greenspan said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether Dutch tulip bulbs or Russian equities, the market  
price patterns remain much the same,'' Greenspan said. He was 
referring to last year's plunge in Russian markets that rocked 
investors worldwide and to the 17th century plunge in inflated 
tulip bulb prices, one of the most famous speculative market 
frenzies of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists said Greenspan is becoming increasingly  
worried that the long period of U.S. prosperity is lulling 
investors and the banks that lend them money into a false sense of 
security that will spell serious trouble during a major market 
correction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Greenspan is worried about the other side of the wealth  
mountain,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in 
Minneapolis. ``It has been fun climbing up the mountain, but a 
major correction could have a wrenching effect on the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co., said he  
believed the Fed will boost interest rates another quarter-point in 
November and then push rates up twice more in the first half of 
next year, pressing ever more firmly on the monetary brakes to slow 
economic activity and relieve rising inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration sought to reassure Americans that the  
1.1 percent jump in the Producer Price Index, which measures 
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was a temporary 
blip and not an indication of trouble down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still feel the overall, basic fundamentals in the economy  
are quite strong,'' said Gene Sperling, director of the National 
Economic Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said they do not believe that a string of Fed rate  
hikes will derail the current expansion, which is already the 
longest in peacetime history, unless inflation zooms higher than 
expected, forcing the Fed to slam even harder on the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said another reason for the timing of Greenspan's remarks  
on the markets may be his worries about overconfidence generated by 
investment books such as ``Dow 36,000'' which argues that 
fundamental changes in the economy can keep the Dow rising to even 
greater heights. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan in a speech Friday also voiced optimism that economic  
growth can continue, despite the potential threat of disruptions 
from the Year 2000 computer date changeover.

<HEADLINE> GM, Suzuki Plan Car for Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- American automaker General Motors Corp. will  
produce a small passenger vehicle it has developed with Suzuki 
Motor Corp. for sale in the Asian market starting in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The new model, called the YGM-1, is based on Suzuki's new small  
car platform and GM's design engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	Both GM and Suzuki, which is 10 percent owned by the U.S.  
automaker, said Friday they haven't decided where in Asia the YGM 
will be manufactured and refused to say how many vehicles they 
expect to produce a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still studying locations,'' said Rudolph A. Schlais  
Jr., president of GM Asia Pacific. But he added the automakers hope 
to make a decision soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshio Saito, chairman of Suzuki, said the company's Kosai plant  
southwest of Tokyo is ``one of the possible options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schlais said the car is likely to be sold in Japan and  
Australia, but that the companies are also looking into other 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The YGM will be GM's first passenger car to be manufactured in  
Asia for the Asian market. The car will be aimed at buyers between 
the ages of 30 and 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlais said the YGM reflects GM's commitment to the Asia  
region, which he estimates will become the second largest 
automotive market in the next 10 years, with sales approaching 20 
million vehicles a year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM aims to raise its market share in the region from 4 percent  
to 10 percent over the next five years.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Ban on Gun Show Sales Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge Friday blocked Los Angeles  
County from banning gun sales later this month at the world's 
biggest gun show. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by the operators of the  
Great Western Gun Show, which opens Oct. 29 at the county 
fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Great Western Shows Inc. challenged an ordinance that was  
enacted by the county Board of Supervisors in the aftermath of a 
shooting rampage at a Jewish community center last summer. Under 
the ordinance, vendors can display guns and offer them for sale but 
cannot actually complete sales transactions at the show. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Paez said the county is trying to  
pre-empt state law, which allows gun shows to operate with sales on 
the premises. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gun show has been taking place for 22 years and the  
ordinance will have a substantial hardship'' on the show's 
operators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 people attend the four Great Western shows  
each year at the county fairgrounds in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
	Great Western, based in Irvine, said in the lawsuit that it  
would seek more than $1 million in damages for violations of its 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Great Western said it had already signed a lease at the county  
fairgrounds, with 2,000 exhibitors planned, and cannot find another 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a backer of the ban on gun  
sales, said gun shows are a ``veritable swap meet for illegal 
weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the judge's point that the gun show has been held for 22  
years is irrelevant. ``You could ask why ban smoking in public 
buildings. We've been doing it for a hundred years,'' he said.

<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Five pedestrians were electrocuted by downed power  
lines in Florida Friday, as Hurricane Irene drenched the state with 
up to 18 inches of rain. Scores of streets in Miami were flooded 
and 1.4 million people had no power. In neighboring Broward County, 
where streets also had 2 to 6 inches of water, three teen-agers and 
a woman in her 50s were electrocuted in an intersection after a

subzero temperatures. The LC-130 Hercules from the New York Air 
National Guard's 109th Airlift Wing left McMurdo station on the 
Antarctic coast and took roughly three hours to reach the 
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Station. After a 22-minute stop

people dead. An attorney for Thomas and Susan Klebold served notice 
of their intent to sue the county's sheriff and two other sheriff's 
officials for negligence. The Klebolds say authorities never told 
them about the potentially violent tendencies of the other gunman, 
Eric Harris, 18, and his relationship with their 17-year-old son. 
The pair hurled bombs and scattered gunfire throughout the school, 
killing 12 students and a teacher before committing suicide.

campaign spending report shows. The Democrat has spent $14.6 
million and had $10.3 million in the bank through Sept. 30. He 
raised $24.9 million, but $534,293 came from his general election 
fund for legal and accounting expenses to pay a share of 
fund-raising costs. Bradley has raised less than Gore, $19.2 
million. But he has spent less as well, $8.5 million, giving him a 
larger bank account -- $10.7 million. Gore, for example, has spent 
twice as much on polling, $387,844 to $173,189.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A memorial service for basketball great Wilt  
Chamberlain was scheduled for 10 a.m. tomorrow at The City of 
Angels Church of Religious Science near Marina del Rey. A second 
memorial service will take place Thursday at Mount Carmel Baptist 
Church in Philadelphia, just blocks from the high school where 
Chamberlain first achieved fame on the basketball court. The 
7-foot-1 center, whose dominance changed the game, died Tuesday of 
heart failure at his Bel-Air home. He was 63.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Glavine quietly pitched the Atlanta Braves  
to the brink of another World Series. Glavine pitched seven 
innings, making an unearned run in the first stand up, and the 
Braves silenced boisterous Shea Stadium with a 1-0 victory over the 
Mets in Game 3 of the NL Championship Series on Friday night. 
Atlanta, which leads the best-of-7 series 3-0, can advance to its 
first World Series since 1996 when John Smoltz pitches against New 
York's Rick Reed on Saturday night, looking to finish off a Braves' 
sweep.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Turn Higher on Stock Selloff / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices rose sharply Friday, breaking a  
three session losing streak, as investors sought safety of 
government-backed debt amid a major selloff in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 27/32 point, or  
$8.43 3/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, fell to 6.26 percent from Thursday's 6.32 
percent, which was the highest for 30-year Treasurys since hitting 
6.42 percent on Oct. 22, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasurys initially fell Friday morning on a surprisingly sharp  
rise in prices at the wholesale level, but bonds later rallied as 
stocks plunged and investors sought a haven for their money. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were unsettled by comments Thursday night by Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who warned investors may be 
underestimating risks in the market. On top of those jitters, the 
government reported Friday morning that the Producer Price Index 
spiked 1.1 percent in September, the largest increase in nine 
years. The increase in the index that measures inflation pressures 
before they reach the consumer, was much worse than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of short-term Treasury securities were up 5/32 point to  
7/32 point while intermediate maturities rose 7/16 point to 23/32 
point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.04 percent as the  
discount rose 0.03 percentage point from Thursday to 4.91 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.15 percent, as the discount was unchanged 
at 4.95 percent. One-year yields were 5.40 percent as the discount 
fell 0.04 percentage point to 5.10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate rose to 5.31 percent from 5.25 percent  
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 109 15/32 from 110 19/32 late 
Thursday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 6.06 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Piazza Banged Up Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Piazza's sore left hand took a beating in  
Game 3 of the NL Championship Series on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, who missed the final two games of the first-round series  
with a swollen left thumb, was hit on the knuckle of his left 
pinkie by Gerald Williams' backswing. 
</P>
<P>
	He also sustained a slight concussion when Bret Boone collided  
with him trying to score in the first inning. Piazza held the ball, 
and Boone was out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still a little woozy,'' Piazza said. ``I've had worse. It  
was a good play, it was a clean play. He got me pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza remembered Williams hitting him before.  
</P>
<P>
	``He got me last year, too,'' Piazza said. ``Armando (Benitez)  
throws pretty hard. I think he was swinging with a little bit 
extra.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CHANGING ORDER:* Mets manager Bobby Valentine shook up his  
lineup, inserting rookie Melvin Mora, who had his first major 
league home run in Game 2, in center field and changing the batting 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman John Olerud and second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo  
swapped spots in the lineup, Olerud batting second and Alfonzo 
third, and slumping third baseman Robin Ventura was dropped to No. 
6, behind Benny Agbayani, who started in right field. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, Valentine said, was to space out the left-handed  
hitters with three right-handed bats between Olerud at No. 2 and 
Ventura at No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said he didn't plan to move Alfonzo back to No. 2 in  
Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any reason to,'' he said. ``Do you think that's  
why we didn't get any hits? Someone might be silly enough or dumb 
enough to think that, but not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JUST ANOTHER GAME:* Rick Reed, who starts Game 4 for the Mets  
on Saturday night says he won't be shaken by the significance of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't consider it a big game,'' Reed said. ``I'm going to  
approach it as an ordinary game. I can't go in with that kind of 
attitude and put more pressure on myself than there already is. So 
I think I'm going to try to approach it as an ordinary game and see 
what happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to get caught up in it being the big game.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TENSION TIME:* John Smoltz has always flourished in the  
postseason for Atlanta, and he believes it's because of how the 
games are viewed 
</P>
<P>
	``When a runner gets on base in the regular season, it's no big  
deal,'' he said. ``When a runner gets on first in the postseason, 
it's a rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is magnified.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WHO'S WHO:* Walt Weiss started at shortstop for Atlanta but in  
the pregame lineups distributed in the press box, he was identified 
as ``Al Weiss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al Weis, a utility infielder, was the MVP for the Mets when they  
won the World Series in 1969.

<HEADLINE> 'Rainbow Warrior' Executed in Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POINT OF THE MOUNTAIN, Utah (AP) -- A man whom prison officials  
said called himself ``The Rainbow Warrior'' -- a killer of 
homosexuals -- was executed by injection today for stabbing another 
man to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Held by thick leather straps and with intravenous lines running  
to his arms, Joseph Mitchell Parsons was relaxed as he spoke his 
last words. 
</P>
<P>
	``My love to my family and friends. And Woody, the Rainbow  
Warrior rules!'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison spokesman Jack Ford said Parsons referred to himself as  
``The Rainbow Warrior'' in a letter to family, and 'Woody' is the 
nickname for his fellow death row inmate and friend Doug Lovell. 
</P>
<P>
	The rainbow flag is a symbol for the gay community.  
</P>
<P>
	In Texas on Thursday, a man who nicknamed himself ``Animal'' was  
executed by injection for raping and killing an 18-year-old high 
school cheerleader, one of three people killed during a daylong 
murder spree in 1986. Jerry McFadden, 51, made no final statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Parsons, 35, was picked up by Richard Ernest while hitchhiking  
outside Barstow, Calif., in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ernest was killed and robbed hours later.  
Parsons said he stabbed Ernest in self-defense after the other man 
made a sexual advance, but prosecutors said the wounds appeared to 
have been inflicted while Ernest was sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Parsons was the sixth man executed in Utah since the Supreme  
Court reinstated capital punishment in 1972.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mental Patient Accused of Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- A former mental patient has been  
indicted on a charge of raping a 73-year-old woman 30 years after 
his acquittal by reason of insanity in the murder-rape of another 
victim of the same age. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawny Harden, 53, of Springfield, was being held Friday on  
$25,000 bail. A grand jury indicted him Wednesday on a charge of 
aggravated rape and breaking into a home. 
</P>
<P>
	Harden is accused of raping the woman at her apartment in  
August. After the assault, she escaped and found help from two 
passersby, according to state police. The victim gave a description 
of the attacker, and it fit Harden. No weapon was used, according 
to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1966, Harden was charged with raping and stabbing to death  
Julia Sullivan, also 73, in her apartment a few weeks after his 
release from a psychiatric hospital. Prosecutors said he used a 
kitchen knife. 
</P>
<P>
	He was acquitted by reason of insanity in 1969 and committed to  
Bridgewater State Hospital for psychiatric treatment. It is not 
clear how long he stayed there. Medical records are confidential, 
and there is no longer any public information on Harden at the 
state's Criminal History Systems Board. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1982, Harden was charged with threatening to kill his  
mother and other relatives. A judge committed him to Northampton 
State Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	He was accused of assault with a dangerous weapon in May 1993. A  
judge dropped that case without a finding, according to records of 
Springfield District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Gagnon, a public defender who represents Harden, said his  
client suffers from schizophrenia, a mental illness that can cause 
delusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gagnon had no details on Harden's hospitalizations. But he said  
Harden had been legally released from his last commitment and was 
receiving mental health treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	When someone is acquitted by reason of insanity, he is generally  
committed to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. Periodic reviews 
must be carried out, and the patient must be released when he is no 
longer considered a danger to himself or others. 
</P>
<P>
	John Perman, the jury foreman for the 1969 murder trial, said  
Friday the jurors believed they were, in effect, committing Harden 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of were given the impression ... that this would be  
for the rest of his life, because we didn't see how anyone in this 
condition could be turned around and released,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Worries Shock Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The biggest jump in wholesale prices in nine  
years and new worries by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
about the sky-high stock market sent shock waves through U.S. and 
global markets on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors from Tokyo to Wall Street were unnerved, first by  
Greenspan's comments about the threat of a possible ``bursting 
bubble'' of stock prices and then by a government report showing a 
surge in inflation at the wholesale level. Prices for energy, food, 
tobacco and new cars all rose in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 266.90  
points, or 2.6 percent, at 10,019.71, its biggest point drop in 
more than a year. Friday's decline put the average down 1,306 
points from its Aug. 25 high, a drop of 11.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets were primed to react in a negative fashion to  
Greenspan's comments, given that investors are on heightened alert 
to possible future Fed interest rate increases. The central bank 
has already boosted its federal funds rate, the interest commercial 
banks charge each other, twice this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists said a third rate increase on Nov. 16, when Fed  
policy-makers next meet, is all but certain, especially if upcoming 
statistics show the economy still growing strongly with rising 
inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in Tokyo quickly noted Greenspan's cautionary words on  
the stock market Thursday night, with the Nikkei average falling 
178.69 points, a loss of 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The events Friday were reminiscent of the impact another late  
night Greenspan speech had in December 1996 when the Fed chief 
first worried that investors could be in the grips of ``irrational 
exuberance,'' a comment that sent stocks diving around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Dow average has soared by 57 percent since that time,  
Greenspan has returned with regularity to worries that American 
investors and the economy at large are vulnerable to a stock market 
``bubble,'' inflated prices that could plunge quickly and without 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``History tells us that sharp reversals occur abruptly, most  
often with little advance notice,'' Greenspan said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether Dutch tulip bulbs or Russian equities, the market  
price patterns remain much the same,'' Greenspan said. He was 
referring to last year's plunge in Russian markets that rocked 
investors worldwide and to the 17th century plunge in inflated 
tulip bulb prices, one of the most famous speculative market 
frenzies of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists said Greenspan is becoming increasingly  
worried that the long period of U.S. prosperity is lulling 
investors and the banks that lend them money into a false sense of 
security that will spell serious trouble during a major market 
correction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Greenspan is worried about the other side of the wealth  
mountain,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in 
Minneapolis. ``It has been fun climbing up the mountain, but a 
major correction could have a wrenching effect on the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co., said he  
believed the Fed will boost interest rates another quarter-point in 
November and then push rates up twice more in the first half of 
next year, pressing ever more firmly on the monetary brakes to slow 
economic activity and relieve rising inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration sought to reassure Americans that the  
1.1 percent jump in the Producer Price Index, which measures 
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was a temporary 
blip and not an indication of trouble down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still feel the overall, basic fundamentals in the economy  
are quite strong,'' said Gene Sperling, director of the National 
Economic Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said they do not believe that a string of Fed rate  
hikes will derail the current expansion, which is already the 
longest in peacetime history, unless inflation zooms higher than 
expected, forcing the Fed to slam even harder on the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said another reason for the timing of Greenspan's remarks  
on the markets may be his worries about overconfidence generated by 
investment books such as ``Dow 36,000'' which argues that 
fundamental changes in the economy can keep the Dow rising to even 
greater heights. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan in a speech Friday also voiced optimism that economic  
growth can continue, despite the potential threat of disruptions 
from the Year 2000 computer date changeover.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Down; Gold, Natural Gas Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices fell Friday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, despite strong export sales. Uncertainty in the 
stock market and forecasts calling for weekend rains in dry areas 
of Brazil ahead of the planting season contributed to the slump. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, a weaker dollar and stock-market jitters  
pushed gold prices higher, and natural gas futures prices rebounded 
from Thursday's sharp loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters are calling for scattered showers this weekend in  
the Midwest, possibly causing temporary harvest delays. But 
analysts did not expect a significant slowdown in the soybean 
harvest. Corn futures prices also fell due to increased farmer 
selling, weak exports and stock-market jitters. Wheat and oats 
futures rose. 
</P>
<P>
	A slumping stock market took some of the optimism away from  
commodity markets, said Don Roose at U.S. Commodities Inc., in West 
Des Moines, Iowa. But Roose said most of the decline in soybean 
prices resulted from the improved prospects for planting the crop 
in Brazil coupled with the continued smooth harvest of a big U.S. 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1 cent to $2.56 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 3/4 cents to $1.99 1/4 a bushel; December oats rose 
1 1/4 cents to $1.10 a bushel; and November soybeans fell 4 3/4 cents to 
$4.92 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	December gold regained some of its losses from Thursday,  
settling up $2.20 at $316.40 per troy ounce on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. It had fallen Thursday to a 1 1/2-week low of 
$312 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly there are a lot of people out there who want to buy  
gold,'' said analyst Jeffrey Christian of the CPM Group. 
``Everytime the price falls below $320, you see some buying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And buyers are beginning to realize the price is more likely to  
rise than to fall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people have been watching gold for a long time,  
waiting for something to convince them (that they have) seen a 
long-term bottom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Energy futures strengthened on the New York Mercantile Exchange,  
after weakening Thursday. Natural gas futures shot up 14.1 cents at 
$2.975 per 1,000 cubic feet amid forecasts for cooler-than-normal 
weather. Prices had fallen Thursday as Hurricane Irene appeared 
headed on a path that wouldn't threaten the central and western 
Gulf of Mexico, center of most U.S. gas production. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for November delivery rose 37 cents to $22.82 a  
barrel; November heating oil rose 1.05 cents to 59.56 cents a 
gallon; November unleaded gasoline rose 1.13 cents to 63.55 cents a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef prices fell and pork futures were mixed in trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle fell 0.30 cent to 70.92 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle fell 0.45 cent to 80.65 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs fell 0.30 cent to 47.10 cents a pound; and 
February frozen pork bellies rose 1.10 cents to 65.40 cents a 
pound.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Court Strikes School Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A new property tax setup created to pay for  
New Hampshire's schools was ruled unconstitutional Friday, renewing 
the possibility that the Live Free or Die State will have to 
institute an income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court ruled that the way the tax was to be  
phased in amounted to an unfair break for richer communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeanne Shaheen said it was unfortunate the court didn't  
give the new system a chance to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``By striking down the statewide property tax, the court has  
endangered our ability to keep schools operating,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision creates a huge hole in the budget -- more than half  
of the $825 million promised for education this year was to come 
from the property tax. Schools had been getting money under the 
plan since July. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it obviously puts the income tax more back into  
play,'' said state Sen. Clifton Below, a Democrat who sponsored an 
income tax bill last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers were forced to come up with the new school-funding  
system after New Hampshire's high court ruled in 1997 that the 
state unfairly relied on local property taxes, which vary widely 
from town to town. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers considered an income tax to pay for schools, but the  
governor promised a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire and Alaska are the only two states with no general  
income tax or sales tax, and anti-tax sentiment in New Hampshire 
runs high. 
</P>
<P>
	So lawmakers came up with a careful compromise -- a new system  
that relied mainly on a uniform statewide property tax of $6.60 per 
$1,000 of property value. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 towns with lower tax rates -- mostly those with more  
expensive property -- had to raise the rates to the statewide level 
and send the extra money to the state, which was to have 
distributed it to poor towns. 
</P>
<P>
	To soften the blow, the Legislature phased in the increase over  
five years in these richer communities. The state said the phase-in 
would avoid economic disruption -- including bankruptcies and 
foreclosures -- that would occur with abrupt tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
	But some poorer communities went to court to challenge the plan,  
saying the phase-in was unconstitutional because it gave tax breaks 
to entire towns without regard to whether individual taxpayers 
needed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The court agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is neither reasonable nor fair to award automatic tax  
exemptions to a majority of taxpayers in affected `property rich' 
communities who do not need them in order to assist those who would 
surely qualify,'' the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court did not throw out the rest of the plan, including  
smaller taxes and tax increases. But it gutted the main source of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision allows the Legislature to re-enact the property tax  
without the phase-in. It also could renew a push for an income tax.

<HEADLINE> Tide Face Rebels in SEC Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- This game could be bigger than it already  
is for No. 11 Alabama and No. 22 Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider that both teams might be undefeated if not for  
unexpected losses on the same day about a month ago. Alabama and 
Ole Miss both blew leads in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Saturday's game could still go a long way in determining  
the Southeastern Conference Western Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this is the only game that will be definitive  
for us the rest of the season,'' Ole Miss coach David Cutcliffe 
said. ``Every game we play from here on out will be a big game. 
This game is obviously big because we already have a conference 
loss and they don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their 34-31 overtime loss to Vanderbilt on Sept. 18, the  
Rebels (5-1, 2-1 SEC) are off to their best start since 1990 and 
still have the opportunity to play the two teams that are sharing 
the SEC West lead.

	Alabama (4-1, 3-0) is tied for the SEC West lead with  
12th-ranked Mississippi State (6-0, 3-0), which has the weekend off 
and its best start in 55 years. The Rebels play their 
regular-season finale in Starkville on Thanksgiving night. 
</P>
<P>
	After a last-second loss to Louisiana Tech, Alabama's athletic  
director resigned. That left a cloud over coach Mike DuBose, who 
admitted he lied earlier in the year about an alleged affair with a 
department employee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crimson Tide have rebounded with victories over Arkansas and  
Florida. This will be Alabama's first game since a 40-39 overtime 
victory that snapped the Gators' 30-game home winning streak two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm anxious to see if we've put the Florida game behind us,''  
DuBose said. ``Our football team and our staff have done a good job 
handling the adversity. Now how do you handle success?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game in Oxford has been sold out since early in the  
summer, and the game will be televised nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama hasn't lost to Ole Miss on the field since 1988. A 19-14  
Crimson Tide victory in 1993 was ruled a forfeit victory for Ole 
Miss by the NCAA. The Crimson Tide has dominated the series 37-7-2 
</P>
<P>
	Ole Miss plans to put its defensive focus on stopping Alabama  
running back Shaun Alexander. Maybe the Rebels, who rank second 
nationally in rushing defense, can at least slow him. 
</P>
<P>
	In every game this season, Alexander has rushed for more than  
100 yards and has also scored 13 touchdowns -- 10 rushing and three 
receiving. In Alabama's only loss, he had a season-high 173 rushing 
yards and scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alexander continues to get better as the game goes on,''  
Cutcliffe said. ``He's good running the ball, he's good catching 
the ball. He is not easily tackled and not easily contained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ole Miss has allowed just 45 yards rushing a game. But the  
Rebels haven't faced any back as talented as Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to buckle down and key on him,'' Ole Miss linebacker  
Al Rice said. ``It will be their running game against our running 
defense ... just break it down and come to play.''

<HEADLINE> Senator Accuses HUD of Manipulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee chairman says the Housing  
and Urban Development Department hired high-priced lawyers in an 
attempt to slant an investigation against the agency's inspector 
general, who has questioned Secretary Andrew Cuomo's policies. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD officials said they acted appropriately in seeking the best  
counsel in a discrimination complaint filed by the most senior 
black member of the inspector general's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs  
Committee, on Thursday issued a General Accounting Office report 
concluding that HUD had violated normal contracting procedures in 
hiring outside attorneys to look into the discrimination case. He 
said the attorneys had billed the government approximately $300,000 
for an inquiry that typically costs $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said HUD had brought in lawyers more likely to be  
critical of Inspector General Susan Gaffney, who has clashed openly 
with Cuomo over HUD policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has clearly been an extraordinary effort to discredit  
this longtime public servant and to portray her as something she is 
not,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD spokesman David Egner disputed the $300,000 figure, saying  
it was ``flat out wrong to say HUD has paid or will pay anything 
more than the $100,000 specified in its contracts for this 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HUD's chief procurement officer, V. Stephen Carberry, also said  
it was appropriate to seek investigators with special expertise 
because ``charges of discrimination involving a high official are a 
serious matter that require a serious investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved a complaint filed by Deputy Assistant  
Inspector General Philip X. Newsome that Gaffney, in not selecting 
him for a promotion, discriminated against him because he is black. 
</P>
<P>
	The department initially contracted with a government-listed  
investigative firm to look into the complaint, at a cost of $2,700. 
</P>
<P>
	But GAO, looking into it at Thompson's request, found senior HUD  
officials stopped that inquiry in August 1998 and contracted with 
two outside law firms to investigate the specific charges and 
whether there was more systematic discrimination in the office. The 
firms were Day, Berry &AMP; Howard, LLP, and Williams &AMP; Connolly. 
</P>
<P>
	This decision ``was a significant deviation from HUD's standard  
Equal Employment Opportunity process,'' said GAO, the investigative 
arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsome has since taken his case to a federal court.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., head of the Congressional Black  
Caucus, defended HUD's decision to hire Deval Patrick -- a former 
Clinton administration assistant attorney general for civil rights 
-- to look into alleged racial problems in the inspector general's 
office. ``Anything less would have been a failure by HUD to meet 
its legal and moral obligations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney has been at odds with Cuomo's top aides over attempts to  
reorganize HUD operations and initiate new housing and empowerment 
programs. There were also disputes over her office's selection of 
three cities run by black mayors as sites for an effort to uncover 
housing program corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Senate hearing in March, Gaffney said Cuomo was a ``very  
ambitious man'' who ``looks at me as a threat, as a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary Saul Ramirez replied then that Gaffney had  
taken a ``destructive, attack approach'' to HUD.

<HEADLINE> Stern: NBA Not Global-Ready Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- The NBA will work to develop a minor league  
system in the United States before looking to establish an overseas 
presence, commissioner David Stern said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we now see the development of basketball around the  
world is encouraging,'' Stern said, ``but the NBA must develop a 
minor league in our country first, either expanding our 
relationship with the CBA or perhaps consider starting a league of 
our own in the next year to 18 months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He emphasized there is ``no specific program'' for expansion  
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no current plans to have an NBA league on any  
particular continent, though we have received expressions of 
interest from Asia, South America and, to a lesser extent, 
Europe,'' Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke at a news conference before the semifinals of the  
McDonald's Championship, which he billed as ``an unofficial global 
club championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stern said he would like to see NBA teams play more games  
outside North America, but ``unless we invent some new ideas, the 
calendar for our interaction is limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month in Vancouver, Stern told reporters the NBA might  
place a developmental league abroad within five years, apparently 
signaling a shift in the league's position on overseas expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the NBA insisted it preferred to support the  
development of foreign leagues and would not want to place its own 
product into those markets for fear of diminishing the home-grown 
commodity. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, deputy commissioner Russ Granik said the early  
returns from preseason games have been positive on the NBA's effort 
to open up the game by limiting physical play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game looks more fluid, there are more fastbreaks, more  
possessions, more shots,'' Granik said. ``We thought we would have 
a problem with a huge increase in the number of fouls. It's been 
about three or four (per game), which is not as bad as we feared 
might happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA is coming off the lowest-scoring season in its history,  
one in which only the Sacramento Kings averaged 100 points. The 
league-wide average of 91 points a game was the lowest since the 
shot clock was introduced in 1954-55.

<HEADLINE> Knight Ridder Earnings Jump 34 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Knight Ridder, the nation's  
second-largest newspaper publisher, reported Friday that higher ad 
revenues and lower newsprint costs drove profits up 34 percent in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder earned $76.2 million, or 78 cents a share, in the  
three-month period ending Sept. 26, up from $57 million, or 58 
cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Analysts 
surveyed by First Call/Thompson Financial had expected earnings of 
74 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The year-earlier earnings included $7 million in expenses  
associated with the company's move to San Jose, where its flagship 
newspaper, the San Jose Mercury News, is located. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 4.2 percent to $784.7 million from $752.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder cited a 19 percent drop in newsprint costs and a  
nearly 4 percent increase in advertising revenue across all its 
markets for the improved results. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Knight Ridder earned  
$225.7 million, or $2.31 a share, little changed from the $225.3 
million, or $2.29 a share, of a year earlier. The nine-month 
figures for both periods include several one-time gains and losses. 
Without those factors, per-share earnings rose almost 18 percent 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenue rose 4 percent to $2.37 billion from $2.28  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder publishes 31 daily newspapers with a readership of  
9.2 million daily and 13 million Sunday. It also operates 45 Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Knight Ridder fell $1.50 to $56.75 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Arnold Injures Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Green Bay Packers wide receiver Jahine  
Arnold is likely out for the season after slightly tearing the 
anterior cruciate ligament in his knee at practice Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold will have more tests before the Packers confirm his  
season is over. Arnold, who has not been active for a game this 
season, was one of the stars during the preseason for the Packers, 
catching five passes for 156 yards and two touchdowns. Both 
touchdown receptions were for 67 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	His preseason performance assured the Packers that if there was  
an injury to their top three wide receivers -- Antonio Freeman, Bill 
Schroeder or Corey Bradford -- Arnold could fill in. 
</P>
<P>
	But Arnold, who earned a reputation as a fragile player during  
three injury-filled seasons in Pittsburgh, confirmed the Packers' 
worst fears about him by getting injured during practice before 
ever suiting up in a game. He missed the 1997 season and most of 
1998 with a variety of ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold was widely expected to play Sunday, perhaps helping  
Desmond Howard return kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feeling from the coaching staff was that if we did have  
injury to another player, (Arnold) would step right in and you 
don't miss a beat,'' Packers coach Ray Rhodes said. ``In the 
preseason, he showed tremendous athletic ability and speed and made 
a lot of huge plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Arnold out, the Packers' receiving corps includes Freeman,  
Schroeder, Bradford, Howard and rookie Donald Driver, who also 
impressed during training camp and made the final roster. Green 
Bay, which usually activates four receivers for a game, also has 
rookie receiver Tyrone Goodson on the practice squad.

	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Italy's Mediaset company said Friday it had  
signed its deal with KirchMedia of Germany for a joint venture 
targeting TV viewers in Germany, Italy and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance will produce, acquire and distribute films and  
shows for a potential audience it estimates at 200 million. The 
venture would use Spanish TV station Telecino and Kirch's SAT1. 
</P>
<P>
	Mediaset said terms of the final deal mirrored those announced  
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms announced then said Mediaset's control group,  
Fininvest, would take a 3.19 percent stake in KirchMedia. 
</P>
<P>
	Fininvest, controlled by former Italian Premier Silvio  
Berlusconi, owns 48.4 percent of Mediaset.

<HEADLINE> Carnegie Jazz Band Plays Parker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band played ``The  
Music of Charlie Parker,'' it took a big leap -- and landed where it 
wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlie Parker was one of the creative giants of bebop, which  
still informs jazz improvisation, as it takes a known tune and 
creates a new melody from its chords. Parker's special innovation 
was to improvise a new melody line off the top rather than the 
middle of the informing chord. 
</P>
<P>
	The final three numbers on Thursday had the evening's best  
arrangements for band, all three by Frank Foster. ``Quasimado'' 
uses the harmonic structure of ``Embraceable You.'' The challenge 
for Parker, of course, was to create another attractive, upbeat, 
romantic tune. He did and guest alto saxophonist Charles McPherson, 
a Parker disciple, brought it out with beautiful tone. 
</P>
<P>
	This was followed by ``Parker's Mood,'' a Kansas City blues in  
bop, and ``KoKo,'' one of the masterpieces of the bebop revolution. 
Instrumental sounds swirled around each other and McPherson's solo 
was classic. ``KoKo'' made an exciting end to the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in that set, Slide Hampton's arrangement of ``Yardbird  
Suite,'' with tenor saxophonist Frank Wess soloing, provided the 
band with an opportunity to stretch out, from dissonance through 
rich melody. 
</P>
<P>
	The first half of the concert recreated part of a famous concert  
of May 1953 at Massey Hall in Toronto, by Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, 
Bud Powell, Charles Mingus and Max Roach. 
</P>
<P>
	Trumpeter Jon Faddis, music director of the Carnegie Hall Jazz  
Band, said he was 18 and joining Mingus' band when he first met 
Charles McPherson, who became like an older brother. Other 
musicians Thursday were pianist Renee Rosnes, bassist Todd Coolman 
and drummer Dana Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	They started strong with ``Perdido,'' with the tune in trumpet  
and piano and accents from saxophone. Gillespie's famous, saucy 
``Salt Peanuts'' came next, with fast instrumental bits flying all 
over the place. After ``Wee'' and ``Hot House,'' McPherson put an 
edge on his tone in Gillespie's ``A Night in Tunisia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faddis dedicated the evening to vibraphonist Milt Jackson, who  
died Oct. 9.

<HEADLINE> Retired Navy Chief Has Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., the retired Navy admiral  
who commanded American naval forces in the Vietnam War and later 
became the Navy's top officer, was in critical condition at Duke 
University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., after undergoing cancer 
surgery, a friend said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zumwalt, 78, was discovered on Sept. 24 to have a cancerous  
tumor in his chest cavity. He underwent eight hours of surgery on 
Wednesday at Duke and is in the intensive care unit there, retired 
Rear Adm. Bill Thompson said Friday in a telephone interview. One 
of Zumwalt's lungs was removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson is a longtime friend of Zumwalt, who is a native of  
Tulare, Calif., and was the Navy chief of operations from 1970 to 
1974 while Thompson headed the Navy information office at the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said doctors at Duke told him they are guardedly  
optimistic that Zumwalt will recover. Zumwalt's cancer is commonly 
associated with exposure to asbestos, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He continues his good spirits and humor,'' Thompson said,  
adding that President Clinton had called Zumwalt and that former 
President Bush had sent him a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Zumwalt, who headed American naval forces in Vietnam in 1968-69,  
is a renowned figure in the Navy and has remained active in a 
variety of pursuits since his retirement from the military. Last 
year, Clinton presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, 
the nation's highest civilian award, in part for his work on behalf 
of a foundation that seeks bone marrow donors for cancer victims. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Zumwalt's sons, Elmo R. Zumwalt III, died of cancer  
apparently linked to his exposure during the Vietnam War to the 
herbicide Agent Orange.

<HEADLINE> Arthur Miller Honored in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Playwright Arthur Miller has been awarded The  
Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize, honoring his 50 years of serving as 
a moral beacon for American literature. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess what I've been trying to do for half a century is to  
part the curtain on what we deny,'' Miller said Thursday during a 
small gathering at the Hudson Theater. ``To me, that is what the 
theater is about -- to discover what we are desperately trying to 
suppress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, whose work includes the Pulitzer-Prize winning ``Death  
of a Salesman'' and Tony-Award winning ``The Crucible,'' was given 
a silver medal and $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize was established in 1994 with a bequest from the estate  
of actress Lillian Gish, who said she wished to recognize artists 
who made an ``outstanding contribution to the beauty of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Author E.L. Doctorow noted Miller's plays always include a point  
at which a character faces their own weakness. Often, a thinly 
veiled setting harkens to the Holocaust, seemingly asserting that 
everyone has ``a Nazi within them,'' Doctorow said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can deny the courage of a writer who will say so,'' he  
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 83, said he is at work on a new play, and plans to  
distribute the prize money to arts groups in New York. He said he 
still writes daily. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lost all my hair doing it,'' Miller said. ``The good part  
of it is that it's enjoyable.''

<HEADLINE> Kansas Girl Still Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAIN VALLEY, Mo. (AP) -- The FBI offered little hope that a  
10-year-old girl was still alive more than two days after she was 
kidnapped in front of her sisters as she roller skated near home in 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of the fifth-grader, Pamela Butler, was unknown today.  
But FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza acknowledged Thursday that so much 
time had passed since she was taken that people should fear the 
worst. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 officers, some on horseback and a few carrying  
shovels, resumed searching for the girl late this morning in a 
field in Grain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith B. Nelson, the 24-year-old suspect, was hospitalized with  
knee and ankle injuries suffered after Tuesday's abduction, 
authorities said. He was captured Thursday, ending a manhunt that 
gripped the community for two days and included a high-speed chase 
through Kansas City, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI affidavit quotes a co-worker as saying that Nelson told  
him two weeks ago that he ``would like to kidnap a girl to rape, 
torture, electrocute, kill and bury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lanza said today Nelson has refused to say anything about the  
girl's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela was skating about 5:45 p.m. Tuesday when her 11-year-old  
sister, Penny, saw a man get out of a white pickup, grab Pamela 
around the waist and throw her into the cab. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started screaming, and so did she,'' said Penny, who was on  
the front porch of her home at the time. She yelled for an older 
sister to call police. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses reported a license number after they tried to chase  
the truck, but couldn't keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck was registered to a company formerly owned by David  
Cunningham, Nelson's boss. Cunningham said Nelson had been driving 
the truck for two weeks, the FBI affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The area being searched in Grain Valley, about 25 miles  
southeast of Kansas City, is near a church where the pickup was 
found a few hours after Pamela disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	The church's custodian, who spotted the truck, also had noticed  
an afghan spread across the front seat. Police on Wednesday found 
such an afghan at the Kansas City home of Nelson's mother, Nancy 
Nelson, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	She told officers her son had been at the house and she believed  
the afghan was his. Police also found shovels with cement and dirt 
on them in her yard, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson was captured after he was spotted Thursday lying near the  
Kansas River. Police said he tried to swim away as officers 
approached. 
</P>
<P>
	The abduction led to a search by more than 100 police officers.  
Classmates decorated her home with cards made out of construction 
paper and gave teddy bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela's mother, Cherri West, made emotional appeals for the  
kidnapper to give back her daughter, going sleepless since the 
abduction and finally losing her voice after numerous interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	When told of the affidavit's contents, the girl's father, Paul  
Butler, said, ``It just rips everything apart that I was hoping 
for. Maybe he didn't get it all done, God willing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mother's hope to find her child alive has dimmed.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's just a little girl,'' her mother said. ``I don't know if  
she's alive or dead. Hope is really starting to fade away.''

<HEADLINE> Unser Jr.'s Daughter Undergoes Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The 12-year-old daughter of former Indy  
500 winner Al Unser Jr. is to return home Saturday after tests this 
week at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody Unser has been battling transverse myelitis, a rare  
disorder that struck her in February and left her paralyzed from 
the chest down. The problem occurs when nerve impulse transmission 
up and down the spinal cord is blocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor said I'll walk again, but it will take time,'' Cody  
said in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The symptoms first appeared when Cody was playing basketball at  
her middle school and began to feel excessively tired and noticed 
her legs ``felt tingly.'' She was taken to a hospital and sent home 
after being evaluated. The next day, she could not walk, and 
returned to the hospital, paralyzed below her chest. 
</P>
<P>
	She then spent more than three weeks at the Barrow Neurological  
Institute in Phoenix before returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody remains paralyzed but is able to walk with the aid of  
braces and has learned to scuba dive, her family said in a news 
release. She is pursuing seventh grade studies at home.

<P>
	The tests at the Johns Hopkins Transverse Myelopathy Center  
began Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically she's just getting evaluated to confirm the  
diagnosis, to see what's functioning still,'' Marjorie Centofanti 
of Johns Hopkins media relations said Friday. ``She's had tests of

	In September, paperwork was filed on Cody's behalf establishing  
the Cody Unser First Step Foundation, a nonprofit group aimed at 
raising research funds and awareness of transverse myelitis and 
spinal cord injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors don't know what causes transverse myelitis. It develops  
rapidly over several hours to several weeks, but most patients show 
fair to good recovery, according to information from the Transverse 
Myelitis Association. It may develop after certain types of acute 
infections or other problems. It also can develop on its own, 
possibly as the result of abnormal activation of the immune system 
against the spinal cord.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Down After Fed Head Comments / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened sharply lower today  
following a warning from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
against excessive optimism by stock traders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 52 points just minutes  
after the opening bell. Losers on the New York Stock Exchange led 
decliners 5-2. The Nasdaq is also down, losing 63 points in early 
trading, while the S&AMP;P 500 is down seven points. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to bankers last night after markets closed,  
Greenspan urged continued vigilance in managing risk at a time of 
prosperity, robust economic expansion and roaring stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan has warned for years against excessive economic  
optimism that can lead to risky business decisions and his comments 
Thursday followed recent warnings by federal regulators that signs 
of risk are spreading in the banking industry despite high earnings 
and hefty assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Economists have been unable to anticipate sharp reversals in  
confidence,'' Greenspan told a Washington conference organized by 
the Office of the Comptroller. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a minimum, risk managers need to ... set aside somewhat  
higher contingency resources ... to cover the losses that will 
inevitably emerge from time to time when investors suffer a loss of 
confidence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also said that the decline in equity premiums that has  
kept U.S. stock prices rising in recent years could be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	There are several negative influences for Wall Street this final  
session of the week, beginning with Greenspan remarks about 
riskiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Then add today's wholesale inflation report, showing the biggest  
increase in the Producer Price Index in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas markets have added to their earlier losses, but bond  
prices have stemmed their initial slide. 
</P>
<P>
	Also keep in mind that today is a so-called ``double witching''  
expiration session on Wall Street, meaning we should see more than 
the usual volatility in the market.

<HEADLINE> Rocker, Chipper Hear It at Shea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                            *BY HAL BOCK   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chipper Jones, who beat up the New York Mets  
with his bat, and John Rocker, who started a verbal war with their 
fans, heard it at Shea Stadium before Game 3 of the National League 
Championship Series Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	During batting practice, Jones was razzed with chants of  
``Lar-ry, Lar-ry,'' by fans who hoped they would irritate him by 
using his given name instead of the nickname he prefers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker seemed to relish all the jeers his appearance generated.  
</P>
<P>
	Rocker emerged from the dugout knowing he would receive a rude  
reception from the early-arriving fans, one of whom held up a sign 
proclaiming, ``I Want To Fight John Rocker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pitcher walked slowly along the third-base stands, smiling,  
tipping his cap and waving to the fans. He even stopped to sign 
autographs for a couple of kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``It thrills me to no end that I can get in their heads like  
that,'' he said. ``If they were quiet, I would wonder what I was 
doing wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a pre-game interview on NBC, Rocker said the worst part of  
playing in New York was dealing with the fans who throw objects 
from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only place it happens out of 30 ballparks around  
country, people making derogatory comments, throwing batteries and 
change, trying to do bodily harm. I just think someone needs to 
speak out and say that we don't need to hear those things or fear 
for our safety at a simple baseball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CHANGING ORDER:* Mets manager Bobby Valentine shook up his  
lineup, inserting rookie Melvin Mora, who had his first major 
league home run in Game 2, in center field and changing the batting 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman John Olerud and second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo  
swapped spots in the lineup, Olerud batting second and Alfonzo 
third, and slumping third baseman Robin Ventura was dropped to No. 
6, behind Benny Agbayani, who started in right field. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, Valentine said, was to space out the left-handed  
hitters with three right-handed bats between Olerud at No. 2 and 
Ventura at No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JUST ANOTHER GAME:* Rick Reed, who starts Gamne 4 for the Mets  
Saturday night says he won't be shaken by the significance of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't consider it a big game,'' Reed said.''I'm going to  
approach it as an ordinary game. I can't go in with that kind of 
attitude and put more pressure on myself than there already is. So 
I think I'm going to try to approach it as an ordinary game and see 
what happens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to get caught up in it being the big game.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TENSION TIME:* John Smoltz has always flourished in the  
postseason for Atlanta, and he believes it's because of how the 
games are viewed 
</P>
<P>
	``When a runner gets on base in the regular season, it's no big  
deal,'' he said. ``When a runner gets on first in the postseason, 
it's a rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is magnified.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WHO'S WHO:* Walt Weiss started at shortstop for Atlanta but in  
the pregame lineups distributed in the press box, he was identified 
as ``Al Weiss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al Weis, a utility infielder, was the MVP for the Mets when they  
won the World Series in 1969.

<HEADLINE> Ray Vying for IRL Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Greg Ray has taken the long road to the  
top of the IRL standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into Sunday's season finale, the Mall.com 500 at Texas  
Motor Speedway, Ray has three first-place finishes, a second -- and 
five of 21st or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	His front-or-back-but-not-in-between approach has left him with  
a slim lead over defending champion Kenny Brack and four others. 
All are hunting for the title and the accompanying $500,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question has been asked all year long: What's the  
difference between your good weekend and your bad weekends?'' Ray 
said. ``We don't prepare any different. And we haven't made any 
wholesale changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, a native of nearby Plano, is very familiar with the 1 1/2-mile  
trioval. He finished second here in June 1998 and was second again 
this June, when he led a race-best 56 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	That performance kickstarted his season. He won three of the  
next four events to take over the points lead. His lead peaked at 
44 points over Brack with two races to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Ray done well in the previous event, the Vegas.com 500, this  
homecoming could've been a coronation. Instead, he banged wheels 
with Mark Dismore and finished 21st. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray has a 255-242 lead over Brack, the Indy 500 winner. They're  
followed by Vegas winner Sam Schmidt (225), Scott Sharp (209), 
Scott Goodyear (207) and Buddy Lazier (204). 
</P>
<P>
	There are 55 points up for grabs this weekend -- 50 for first and  
five bonus points, three for the top qualifier and two for the most 
laps led. 
</P>
<P>
	The tight points battle will turn up the intensity for  
Saturday's qualifying. In addition to the pole-sitter getting three 
points, the second-fastest car gets two and third-best gets one. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the top two practice laps came from Goodyear (214.778  
mph) and Schmidt (214.444). Schmidt also had the sixth-best lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing everything we possibly can to win the pole,'' said  
Schmidt, whose pit crew will wear T-shirts that read ``Nothing to 
Lose'' during qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Goodyear, who took over the points lead after winning the  
June race in Texas: ``I think it's great for the series for six 
guys to try winning this championship. Although we are a longer 
shot than we'd like to be, we still have a shot at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six cars to watch will be easy to spot thanks to some  
generously applied fluorescent orange paint. Splashes will be on 
the engine cover, the end plate of the wings and around the car 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers will be the biggest giveaways. Instead of the league  
standard black numbers in a white box, the finalists will have 
white numbers outlined in black inside a fluorescent-orange box. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they'll be harder to spot, four drivers are in close  
contention for the rookie of the year award and a $50,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Robby McGehee leads Scott Harrington 138-137 with Jaques Lazier  
(118) and John Hollansworth Jr. (116) also in the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone to keep an eye on for that award next year is  
18-year-old Sarah Fisher, who will make her IRL debut Sunday. She's 
planning to become the first female regular on the circuit next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher is driving for car owner Dale Pelfrey, who also has  
supported former Indy 500 driver Lyn St. James. Fisher is a 
graduate of St. James' driving school. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, who passed her rookie test in Vegas, had the 10th-best  
practice time Friday, turning a lap in 24.572 seconds and 213.169 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty fun,'' Fisher said. ``It was my first time to  
get to run with other cars and I feel comfortable. I feel more 
comfortable each time I go out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She's already impressed former Indy 500 winner Eddie Cheever.  
</P>
<P>
	``That girl is good,'' he said. ``There's a few guys around here  
who could take lessons from her.''

<HEADLINE> Companies Vie for College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- College students who might have been  
scrambling for job interviews just a few years ago are being wooed 
by company recruiters with pizza parties, picnics and expense-paid 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a job seeker's market now,'' said Linda Bates  
Parker, director of the Career Development Center at the University 
of Cincinnati. ``Even four years ago, the students would have had 
to hold the parties and hope the companies would come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the economy strong and the job market tight, other colleges  
and universities around the nation are seeing a similar boom in 
recruitment -- and not just for students with engineering majors, 
high-tech skills or top grades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employers are engaging students more directly with parties and  
sponsoring prize giveaways and contests,'' said Cynthia Applin, 
director of Career Planning and Placement at Case Western Reserve 
University in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Ajay Kachwaha, a senior majoring in finance at the University of  
Cincinnati, said he hasn't started his job search yet but already 
has been invited to several recruiting events. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult not to become a little complacent,'' he said.  
``I'm grateful to be graduating now, because even five years ago, I 
would have had to work a lot harder to find a job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enterprise Rent-A-Car, based in St. Louis, held a remote-control  
car race to attract students. The company gave T-shirts to the 
winners and raffled off the cars after a recent race at UC. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Chalker, who directs recruiting efforts for the Troy,  
Mich.-based Delphi Automotive Systems, said his company sponsors 
international career symposiums to create name recognition and get 
information about the company out to students. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started 10 years ago, companies were in control of the  
recruiting process,'' he said. ``Students sent out resumes and had 
to sell themselves to a company. Now companies are trying to sell 
themselves to students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norita Rehrig, assistant executive director of the National  
Association of Colleges and Employers in Bethlehem, Pa., said 
internships and co-ops are being used more and more as feeder 
programs for entry-level hiring with many interns being urged to 
return after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know of at least one company that flew its interns to Disney  
World,'' she said. ``But while a lot of companies are coming up 
with more creative ways to attract students, those that also 
maintain a long-term presence on campus will be the most 
successful.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Communities Overrun With Mice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Richard Hummel hung in there when the mice  
pillaged his home. He resisted for weeks with poison and sticky 
strips as the rodents overran his neighborhood and nearby 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60-year-old waiter was catching 20 of them each day at his  
place. But finding two of the furry critters in his shower was more 
than he could stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I give up. I'm moving,'' Hummel groaned as he packed his  
trailer home in Apopka. ``I've had to put everything I own -- even 
my socks -- in plastic containers. I'm not battling them anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, lightning-quick mice have invaded thousands of homes  
and businesses in a 50-square-mile area north of Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	They sneak into buildings through openings smaller than a dime  
and eat holes in clothes, packages and paneling. They crawl up 
curtains, scurry across bare feet, unsuspecting sleepers, 
computers, hallways and roads. They gnaw through paper and wood, 
and feast on seeds at plant nurseries. They contaminate food. 
Droppings are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Battle-weary residents in Zellwood, Plymouth and Apopka are sick  
of playing cat and mouse. They've been loading spring traps with 
peanut butter, putting down sticky glue strips, mouse bait and rat 
poison. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the cats aren't interested anymore, bored and fat by too  
much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a healthy cat around here -- but it's tired of  
eating,'' said Lt. Marvin Barrett of the Orange County Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The infestation is in the shadows of the home of Walt Disney  
World. So far, only Mickey and Minnie have been spotted at the 
sprawling resort. The mouse problem is about 25 miles north of 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials said they tested a sampling and found the  
creatures are not bearing disease. Exterminators have been 
overwhelmed with calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Angry residents said government agencies have been slow to  
control a state-made menace they blame on the restoration of Lake 
Apopka about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. John's Water Management District bought 14,000 acres of  
peat-rich soil for growing vegetables on the north side of the lake 
and flooded fields, creating wetlands to improve water quality. 
</P>
<P>
	When birds began dying at the lake, the fields were drained amid  
fears that chemical residue from the farms might be to blame. Once 
the farms were abandoned, vegetable packing houses were no longer 
needed and were bulldozed. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the mice.  
</P>
<P>
	``We not sure of the origin of the problem, but suspect it has  
something to do with the buyout of the farms -- which the state 
did,'' said Mel Martinez, chairman of the Orange County Commission. 
He said farmers managed to control the mouse population and once 
they were gone, the population flourished. 
</P>
<P>
	The county and state have committed $600,000 to help residents  
rid their homes of rodents. The money will pay for traps and poison 
to be handed out starting next week in the affected area that's 
home to 40,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The mice breed every 23 or 24 days and have litters of six or  
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two mice become 15,000 mice in 12 months,'' said Tom Stutzman,  
site production manager at Twyford Plant Laboratories in Apopka, 
who said he has been disposing of 130 mice a day. ``I see little 
dead bodies all over the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Plymouth, Tim Landers is battling vermin at his nursery,  
Benchmark Foliage Inc. Some days he's found only a handful of mice 
-- only to return days later and find 60. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're in light fixtures. Open a door and they're standing in  
the aisleways; they're on the desks, under cardboard. They're into 
seed,'' Landers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Kloster said she spent $77 to buy a Wal-Mart's entire  
stock of sticky strips. Mice shorted out the electricity in her 
mobile home at Orange Blossom RV Park in Apopka. 
</P>
<P>
	``They shouldn't be getting in a new, $50,000 sealed unit, and I  
caught 21 mice inside in one day,'' she said. ``First thing when I 
get up in the morning and last thing before bed, I empty traps. 
It's disgusting.''

<HEADLINE> Ogunleye, Dayne Facing Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Adelwale Ogunleye and Ron Dayne both passed  
on the riches of the NFL to return to school for their senior 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Although neither's season has gone according to expectations,  
both still claim they made the right choice. Others might see it 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana lost Ogunleye, a defensive end and the school's career  
leader in sacks and tackles for losses, for the season when he 
sustained severe knee ligament damage in the 34-17 victory over 
Northwestern last week. Ogunleye's draft stock will almost 
certainly fall, though it's too early to say how much. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could come back from this injury as good as ever,'' Indiana  
coach Cam Cameron said. ``There's no way to know right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne returned to Wisconsin for a chance at a national  
championship and to take a shot at the NCAA major college rushing 
record. Two losses have squashed any title hopes, and a string of 
good-but-not-great rushing performances have put Dayne's quest for 
Ricky Williams' record in jeopardy as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I get it, that would be great,'' Dayne said of the record.  
``If not, it won't be the end of the world. I still got a lot of 
great things out of coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayne needs 864 yards over Wisconsin's final five games to break  
Williams' record. That computes to an average of 172.8 yards per 
game, a number he has reached only once this season against 
defenses designed to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
	The tailback, who has endured a number of minor injuries and two  
poor performances this season, would have entered last spring's 
draft on the strength of a dominating performance in Wisconsin's 
win over UCLA in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Dayne is averaging only slightly better than 4.0  
yards per carry during the Badgers' first three Big Ten games. But 
a surge in productivity could put Wisconsin in the running for a 
New Year's Day bowl game and Dayne back in the Heisman Trophy race. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana (3-3, 2-1 Big Ten) will be gunning for Dayne on Saturday  
at Camp Randall Stadium. But the loss of Ogunleye, who was having 
another exceptional season, will hurt the Hoosiers' chances of 
beating the 17th-ranked Badgers (4-2, 2-1) for the first time since 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said that if it happens, no matter what, I won't  
regret the decision,'' Ogunleye said. ``Life is not just football. 
I think this injury proves it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Ogunleye, Indiana's pass rushers will be hard-pressed to  
generate any problems for quarterback Brooks Bollinger behind 
Wisconsin's mammoth, experienced offensive line. Senior Chris 
McIntosh said the line has taken Saturday's game as a personal 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really need to get our job done this week, both on passing  
and running downs,'' said McIntosh, himself a sure NFL draft pick. 
``We always feel like we can be doing a better job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Indiana's run defense has been depleted, its pass defense  
is still the best in the Big Ten, allowing just 162.7 yards per 
game. That's not good news for the Badgers, who have struggled to 
throw the ball under the best of circumstances this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we'll be able to get some throwing of the ball done  
and open it up for Ron,'' offensive coordinator Brian White said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez, who had knee surgery two weeks  
ago and is unable to walk, will watch the game from the press box, 
the school announced late Friday. Alvarez monitored the Badgers' 
20-17 overtime win over Minnesota last week from his hospital bed 
at the Mayo Clinic.

<HEADLINE> Indian Accounts Suit To Be Mediated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday ordered a mediator  
to step in to help with settlement talks in a multibillion-dollar 
lawsuit over the government's handling of accounts for individual 
American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials and lawyers for the Indians have acknowledged  
they began discussions weeks ago to try to settle the lawsuit, 
which is seeking court-enforced changes to the way the Interior 
Department handles more than 300,000 Indian accounts now worth more 
than $500 million. Both sides agree the accounts have been 
mismanaged for decades, suffering from inconsistent or nonexistent 
record-keeping, poor investment choices and lax oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth appointed George Washington  
University law professor Stephen Saltzburg as a mediator to oversee 
the settlement talks. Thursday's order from Lamberth requires both 
sides to report their progress on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamberth's order requires that the talks be kept confidential.  
</P>
<P>
	The settlement talks represent a thawing in relations between  
both sides since this spring, when Lamberth held Interior Secretary 
Bruce Babbitt, Bureau of Indian Affairs head Kevin Gover and 
then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in contempt of court for 
failing to turn over documents to the Indians. Babbitt has since 
said that fixing the problems with the accounts is a top priority.

<HEADLINE> Charges Filed in W.Va. Bank Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Two officers of a failed West Virginia  
bank have been charged with interfering with federal regulators, 
including burying three truckloads of bank documents in a 100-foot 
trench. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Church, senior vice president of the First National Bank  
of Keystone and president of Keystone Mortgage Co., and Michael 
Graham, executive vice president of the mortgage company, were 
charged Friday with conspiracy to obstruct the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency in its investigation of bank activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The mortgage company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Attorney's Office filed a motion to arrest Church and  
Graham but refused to say if they had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The OCC, which regulates nationally chartered banks, closed the  
bank in southern West Virginia on Sept. 1 after discovering 
``apparent fraud'' involving $515 million in loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keystone bank management was unable to explain or eliminate  
the discrepancies,'' said an affidavit of FBI Agent Robert Selbe 
released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges are based on Church's and Graham's actions between  
June 21, when the comptroller's investigation of the bank began, 
and Sept. 1, said U.S. Attorney Rebecca Betts. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing bank records, enough to fill 22 boxes, were found at  
Church's home on Sept. 2, Selbe said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, investigators found a trench on her ranch filled  
with bank records. It was 100 feet long, 10 feet deep and 30 feet 
wide, Selbe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two large truck loads of documents, plus a pickup load, were  
dumped into the trench, Selbe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Church, 46, and Graham, 49, each face up to five years in prison  
and a $250,000 fine if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Church did not return a phone call Friday. Graham's home number  
is unlisted.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Wider Hate Crime Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appealed on Friday for an  
expanded national hate crimes law that would offer specific 
protections to homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is important for America and important for our  
leadership at home and around the world,'' Clinton said in a speech 
launching a new anti-violence television commercial. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats managed in July to pass an expansion of federal  
civil rights law to cover gay people, but the House version of the 
spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State departments does 
not include the gay-rights provision. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Senate Republicans led by Majority Leader Trent Lott  
threatened to remove the provision from the Senate bill as well. 
Negotiations to reconcile the two versions is scheduled for next 
week, perhaps as early as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would add crimes motivated by sexual orientation,  
gender and disability to the list of hate crimes already covered by 
federal law. Inclusion in federal law means increased penalties and 
gives federal prosecutors the option of stepping in if local 
authorities decide against prosecuting. 
</P>
<P>
	Crimes motivated by race, religion, color or national origin  
already are covered by the federal hate crimes law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me very hard to make the case that America, for  
our own sanity and our own humanity and for what we owe to the rest 
of the world, should not pass strong hate crimes legislation and do 
it without delay this year,'' Clinton said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has not threatened to veto the spending bill  
over the hate crimes question, but White House spokeswoman Julia 
Payne said it is ``imperative that the bill sent to the president 
contain (the) coverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, continuing Friday a theme he has outlined in recent  
speeches, likened hate crimes to religious and ethnic violence both 
modern and ancient. He ticked off Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Kosovo, 
Bosnia ``and on and on and on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a deep thing in the human psyche that has been with us  
since the dawn of time,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed extension of the hate crimes law two years ago and  
has periodically pressed for it since. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said he is creating a new White House initiative to  
coordinate and improve a variety of programs intended to reduce 
youth violence, ``so that they will work together, not at 
cross-purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They will waste less money and make the money they have go  
further, and they will touch more children's lives,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was introduced by actress Epatha Merkerson, who plays a  
police lieutenant on the NBC drama ``Law and Order,'' and who 
appears in the new public service announcement.

<HEADLINE> Boeing May Face a Revamped Airbus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- For years, Boeing executives have groused that  
arch-competitor Airbus Industrie has had an unfair advantage 
because it doesn't have to answer to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Be careful what you wish for.  
</P>
<P>
	A merger of European aerospace companies has raised the odds  
that Airbus will be transformed into a publicly traded company, 
giving Boeing the even playing field it says it has always sought. 
But analysts warn it could also get an even fiercer competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's either good news or bad news,'' said Richard Aboulafia,  
aerospace analyst with The Teal Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Good news for Boeing, he said, if Airbus is subject to the same  
pressures from stockholders as Boeing: having to detail and justify 
business decisions and make its owners money. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad news, if Airbus is a lean, nimble company supporting its  
already strong product line. 
</P>
<P>
	With great fanfare and the blessings of the French and German  
heads of state, the German aerospace unit of DaimlerChrysler and 
France's Aerospatiale Matra announced Thursday they plan to merge 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new entity, to be called the European Aeronautic, Defense  
and Space Co., or EADS, would control up to 80 percent of Airbus, a 
four-nation European consortium. The remaining 20 percent is held 
by British Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
	EADS would be 60 percent owned by DaimlerChrysler, the French  
Lagardere Group and the French government. The remaining 40 percent 
would be sold on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The move improves the chances for transforming Airbus, the No. 2  
commercial jet maker behind Boeing, into its own corporate entity, 
though talks on revamping Airbus have recently bogged down. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus already is a tough competitor. It has outpaced Boeing in  
new aircraft orders so far this year, with 358 to Boeing's 166. 
Boeing, however, had delivered 455 airplanes as of Sept. 30, 
compared with 211 for Airbus. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger announcement came minutes before Boeing released its  
third-quarter financial results showing a healthy 37 percent rise 
in profits. In a teleconference, Phil Condit, Boeing's chairman and 
chief executive officer, said the change would have little 
immediate effect, and repeated the company line. 
</P>
<P>
	``As they move to a truly commercial basis, I think that's  
good,'' Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit cited an order by Denver-based Frontier Airlines for some  
20 new jets that Boeing lost because it would not match the lower 
prices Airbus offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been very careful to say we're in this business to  
make money, and if (pricing) gets too intense, we don't go there. 
That's what happened at Frontier,'' Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus and Frontier officials declined to comment on the pending  
order. 
</P>
<P>
	The pricing argument can cut both ways. Airbus complained this  
summer when Boeing, to get Singapore Airlines to order new 777s, 
agreed to buy 17 Airbus A340 jetliners from Singapore and resell 
them. Boeing claims the deal was profitable -- some analysts have 
doubts -- but it was a strategic coup, placing Boeing jets with a 
key Asian carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has long argued that European government subsidies to  
Airbus give it an unfair advantage. Europeans counter that Boeing 
uses U.S. defense contracts to develop commercial airplane 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	When Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas two years ago, Airbus  
and its supporters howled that the U.S. government was allowing the 
creation of a colossus that would stifle global competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing would welcome ``a normal corporate entity'' as a  
competitor, said Paul Nisbet, analyst with JSA Research Inc., 
``rather than having to do battle with the European governments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With shareholders, Airbus ``will have to generate a reasonable  
return on investment, which they are not doing now, and is not part 
of their thinking right now,'' said Robert Toomey, analyst with 
Dain Rauscher-PCG in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus ``is not acting rationally because it is subsidized by  
government,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit knows from experience that he has to please shareholders.  
Boeing was pummeled in 1997 by production foul-ups, delayed 
aircraft deliveries and the Asian financial crisis. The company 
lost billions of dollars, its stock sank and many stockholders 
screamed for Condit's head. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Boeing emphasizes profits, efficiency, cost-cutting  
and axing programs that don't pull their weight -- moves that Wall 
Street has rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
	If Airbus does likewise, Aboulafia and others say it would be an  
even more formidable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	A well-run corporation would greatly increase Airbus' ability to  
raise money for new projects. EADS itself, if done right, ``gives 
an excellent shell within which to shuffle assets and create 
efficient organizations to address market needs,'' Aboulafia said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the transformation leads to a privatized Airbus and a race to  
cut costs, a casualty might be Airbus' long-planned A3XX, a 
600-passenger ``superjumbo'' jet. 
</P>
<P>
	With shareholders in the picture, ``If you're going to launch a  
huge new project ... you had better be able to prove that you're 
going to provide an excellent return on investment,'' Aboulafia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it very difficult for Airbus to go ahead with  
ego-driven projects.''

<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Irene Nears Fla. Keys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- The leading edge of Hurricane Irene  
brought rain and high wind to the Florida Keys today after the 
storm drenched Cuba's tobacco fields and caused scattered building 
collapses around Havana. At least one person was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though barely a hurricane with 75 mph winds around its center,  
Irene brought torrential rains that threatened to flood the lower 
third of the Florida peninsula as the storm crawled across the 
straits separating Cuba from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Were experiencing some strong tropical storm conditions right  
now from Key West all the way up the Keys as far as Ocean Reef 
right now,'' Billy Wagner, Monroe County Emergency Management 
director, said this morning. Big Pine Key had a gust recorded at 
103 mph, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said areas as far north as Tampa could be flooded,  
and rainfall totals could top 15 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a well-organized hurricane, and there's a huge swath  
of storms and rain to the east'' of its center, said Richard Pasch, 
a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center outside 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 a.m. EDT, Irene was about 25 miles southwest of Key West.  
Irene had moved slowly and erratically late Thursday, but was 
moving north at about 8 mph today. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said the center of the storm was likely to hit land  
between Tampa and Fort Myers by Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Monroe County, which covers the Keys, ordered a  
mandatory evacuation of mobile homes and recreational vehicles. 
Schools were closed for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been raining throughout the night; we've been getting  
quite a few inches of rain and the wind has picked up enormously 
from when I came in at (midnight),'' said David Holliman, a 
security guard at the Lower Keys Medical Center in Key West. ``The 
trees are swaying quite a bit ... and it's getting worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four shelters were opened in the Keys: two in Key West and one  
each in Marathon and Key Largo. Fewer than 100 people were staying 
at the shelters Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked all day yesterday. By the time we finished, it was  
too late to go north,'' said Jose Guadarrama, a mobile home 
resident who arrived at the shelter this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm left Cuban territory after soaking Havana on Thursday  
evening. Early reports were that the island escaped relatively 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
	During a televised briefing, Havana authorities told President  
Fidel Castro that one person had been electrocuted and a second 
person was missing following the storm's march across the capital 
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Havana Mayor Conrado Martinez said that 149 buildings were  
damaged by the heavy rains, including 13 that collapsed, and power 
outages were scattered around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	About 130,000 people from western and central Cuba, many of them  
students in government boarding schools, were evacuated as the 
hurricane approached. Classes across the region were suspended. 
Stores, government offices and banks in Havana closed shortly after 
noon Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the western city of Pinar del Rio, laborers worked made sure  
water didn't leak into warehouses storing the tobacco leaves grown 
to make Cuba's famous cigars. Cattle and livestock in the rural 
region were moved to higher ground.

<HEADLINE> Albanians Clash With Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- French and Italian  
peacekeepers clashed with ethnic Albanians trying to push their way 
across a bridge today in this divided Kosovo city, injuring dozens 
of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeepers fired tear gas and stun grenades for more than an  
hour at ethnic Albanians trying to cross into the Serb-held half of 
the city. Cannons also were used to unleash a stream of tear gas 
into the crowd, which numbered several thousand. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 people poured into the city's small, Albanian-run  
hospital, seeking treatment. The most seriously hurt was a 
12-year-old boy, who was knocked unconscious and suffered a 4-inch 
head wound, according to hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 20 others were to undergo surgery, and dozens were  
suffering from the effects of tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear how many peacekeepers -- who wore helmets and  
bulletproof vests, and wielded plastic shields -- were injured in 
the clash. One French soldier was seen holding his eye, which 
likely was injured by stones or sticks hurled by Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash began after ethnic Albanians launched what is planned  
to be six months of daily protests. After peacefully marching to a 
local mosque and a Catholic church, more than 1,000 protesters 
attempted to cross to the Serb side of the city, as Serbs gathered 
on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
	French peacekeepers, along with some Italian carabinieri, first  
tried to use barbed wire to block their progress. They then rolled 
out eight tanks, and began firing tear gas and stun grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	A Serb woman who had been at the scene said ethnic Albanians  
made it halfway across the bridge spanning the Ibar River before 
being pushed back. 
</P>
<P>
	Armored vehicles were parked on the bridge, and French snipers  
took up positions on buildings overlooking the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of Serbs gathered on the other side and hoisted the  
Serbian flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``The French seem to be keeping the situation under control for  
now,'' said the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs on the other side of the bridge are ready to defend  
our part of Mitrovica,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	After the clashes, ethnic Albanians continued to pack a 700-yard  
stretch of road leading to the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in an attempt to restore a degree of normality in  
Kosovo, U.N. police began issuing license plates Friday to drivers 
across the province, where many cars are thought stolen either from 
Westen Europe or fleeing Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, drivers have until January to register their  
cars. After that, any vehicle without plates or proper papers will 
be seized, and U.N. police will use the registry to check for 
stolen vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Pristina's airport reopened to receive its first  
commercial flight today -- an Adria Airways jet from Slovenia 
carrying 155 passengers, most of them ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	That move comes a day after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's  
first visit to the province. Speaking Thursday, Annan rebuffed 
ethnic Albanian hopes of quick independence, saying Kosovo will 
remain a part of Yugoslavia as long as it is under U.N. 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not here to prepare the people for independence,'' he  
said. ``That is not my mandate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo Albanians, the province's overwhelming majority,  
fervently support independence from Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant 
republic.

<HEADLINE> Spirits Not Dampened by Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Sue Gallup was living proof that the party  
spirit in this laid-back resort city was drenched but not dampened 
Friday by Hurricane Irene. 
</P>
<P>
	At Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville Cafe, loud cheers greeted the  
return of electricity after the storm center passed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in a red tropical-print shirt and sipping a pink drink,  
Ms. Gallup, who is from Canterbury, N.H., was happy to be in town 
for the annual Jimmy Buffett convention, whether or not its 
namesake singer showed up. (He did last year.) 
</P>
<P>
	``This is fun. This is wonderful,'' said the loyal Parrothead,  
the nickname preferred by Buffett fans. ``It's actually more 
exciting than having it sunny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten inches of rain flooded the Duval Street tourist strip and  
most other streets on the island, but the high water couldn't keep 
visitors away, even though they were asked to leave the Florida 
Keys on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get busier when the power goes out,'' said Margaritaville  
bartender Doug Gober. ``There's nothing to do but drink.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While tourists homed in on the bars, business owners rushed to  
reopen by sweeping away floodwaters and leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we get electricity, we're going full speed ahead,''  
kitchen manager Gus Trippner said at Kelly's Caribbean Bar and 
Grill, owned by actress Kelly McGillis. ``We have generators hooked 
up to the freezer and iceboxes. The rest of it is praying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm intruded just before the start of the tourist season  
for this gay-friendly resort, which has long been an outpost for 
the offbeat and was the home of Ernest Hemingway. The Halloween 
week Fantasy Fest draws thousands of costumed revelers to masked 
balls, costume competitions, street fairs and other events. 
</P>
<P>
	Odile and Hans Von Gunten, tourists from Paris, spent their time  
people watching during the storm. ``We have never seen this,'' Ms. 
Von Gunter said. ``The people are interesting because they act like 
this is normal.''

<HEADLINE> Yanks-Sox Matchup Like a Chessmatch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP ) -- The final score was 3-2, but the real result  
was more like: Checkmate, in nine moves. 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth inning of Game 2 of the AL championship series was as  
much a chess match as a baseball game, as Red Sox manager Jimy 
Williams cleared his entire bench to avoid a loss that would put 
Boston down two games to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things were spinning,'' said Yankees manager Joe Torre, who  
was Bobby Fischer to Williams' Garry Kasparov as he deployed all 
available relief pitchers to protect New York's 3-2 victory on 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just make a decision that you are going to empty your  
bullpen and go for it, and that is the chess game,'' Torre said 
after taking a two games to none lead in the best-of-7 series. 
``The greatest part of managing is going back and forth with the 
other manager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre went through four pitchers, and Williams used three  
pinch-hitters and two pinch-runners in the pivotal inning. Williams 
also sacrificed his designated hitter like a pawn defending its 
king, meaning the pitcher would have had to hit if his spot in the 
order came up to bat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have more players, but we took a shot at it,''  
Williams said. ``We had the right people up. We had an opportunity. 
It just didn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York led 3-2 when Troy O'Leary doubled off Mike Stanton --  
missing a homer by about six inches -- to lead off eighth inning. 
Jeff Nelson relieved and hit Mike Stanley with a pitch. Damon 
Buford ran for Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Varitek sacrificed the runners to second and third. The  
Red Sox announced that lefty Scott Hatteberg would pinch hit for 
righty Darren Lewis and took one ball. Torre then brought in Allen 
Watson, and Lou Merloni pinch hit for Hatteberg with an 1-0 count; 
he drew an intentional walk to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Butch Huskey hit for Trot Nixon, Ramiro Mendoza relieved, and  
Donnie Sadler -- Boston's last position player -- ran for Merloni. 
Huskey struck out on a 1-2 pitch, then Offerman hit an easy fly 
ball to center field. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to play for that inning,'' said Merloni, who  
admitted being personally disappointed that he could only 
contribute an intentional walk -- and just three-fourths of one, at 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do everything you can to get that lead,'' he said.  
``Shifting people in and out, we're just trying to get the right 
matchup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Daubach, who had been the designated hitter, played first  
base in the bottom half, it meant that the pitcher would have to 
bat if Huskey's spot came up in the order. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was two good managers doing what they could to help their  
team win,'' said Paul O'Neill, who hit a go-ahead single in the 
seventh inning to set up the critical eighth. ``You watch the 
moves, and then you sit back and see what they are all about.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Releases Arab Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEITUNIYA, West Bank (AP) -- Israel freed 151 Arab security  
prisoners today, moving its peace agreement with the Palestinians 
back on track after minor delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheering relatives greeted convoys of buses at drop-off points  
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Prisoners leaned out of windows, 
flashing victory signs, their hands still tied with plastic cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mother, he's out,'' a teen-age boy shouted into a cellular  
phone when he saw his brother on one of the buses. 
</P>
<P>
	Prisoner releases are an emotional issue for both sides.  
Palestinians consider the inmates heroes in the struggle for 
independence, while a majority of Israelis still strongly oppose 
freeing those who killed Israelis in terror attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the latest interim peace agreement, Israel freed 199  
security prisoners in September and pledged to release another 
group of 151 on Oct. 8. The second release was delayed by 
last-minute disputes over who is eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those freed today were 109 Palestinians and 42 inmates  
from Arab countries. Seventy-five were serving life sentences, 
among them 44 who had killed fellow Arabs on suspicion of 
collaboration with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	One prisoner, Nasser Abu Hmeid, killed nine suspected  
collaborators. Israel radio said he was released at the personal 
request of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu Hmeid, 27, said he had mixed feelings. ``Thousands of my  
brothers are still in jail, living in very terrible conditions,'' 
he said. ``Israel is turning these releases into a big deal, but 
the important people are still behind bars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most prisoners belonged to Arafat's Fatah movement, while 10  
were members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, militant groups that 
oppose the peace agreements. Israel initially refused to free 
Islamic militants, but then softened its criteria. 
</P>
<P>
	At a dropoff point near the village of West Bank of Beituniya,  
relatives waited anxiously for a bus carrying prisoners, some 
studying lists of names in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Jewish extremists gathered nearby, chanting ``Death to  
terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the protesters, Noam Federman, said that Israel ``should  
take them (the prisoners) to the central square ... and hang them 
all.'' Israeli troops moved between the two groups to prevent 
friction. 
</P>
<P>
	Near the West Bank town of Hebron, teen-ager Mohammed Sakhouri  
waited for the prisoners with a cellular phone pressed to his ear, 
to share the moment with his mother waiting at home. ``Mother, he 
is out,'' Mohammed shouted when he spotted his brother, Shukri, 33, 
on a bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Shukri Sakhouri, who was sentenced to life for killing a  
suspected collaborator and wounding Israelis, hugged and kissed his 
7-year-old son, Ashraf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that President Arafat will make every effort to have  
the other prisoners released, because everyone one of us is looking 
to be free,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were disappointed. One woman, Hasiba Shehade, leaned  
against a car and cried when told that her son, Ahmed, serving a 
life term for killing a suspected collaborator, was not among those 
freed. Her son had switched his allegiance in jail from Fatah to 
the Islamic Jihad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand this,'' she said. ``The man who carried out  
the operation with him, from Fatah, was released in the first 
batch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian Authority official Hisham Abdel Razek, who has  
negotiated the releases with Israel, said the prisoners from 
Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq and Libya would be given a special 
reception at a camp for Arafat's bodyguard unit, Force 17, in Gaza 
City later today. Arrangements would then be made to return them 
home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next step of the peace agreement, Israel is to open a  
land route for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip on 
Sunday. The so-called safe passage, seen as a step toward 
Palestinian statehood, allows Palestinians for the first time to 
travel relatively freely.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Resort Plan May Be Scrapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALAT, Vietnam (AP) -- A $706 million plan to build Vietnam's  
biggest tourist resort may be dismantled after the Singapore 
consortium slated to finance it postponed its investment 
indefinitely, according to Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	The project's demise would be a serious blow to Lam Dong, the  
central highlands province for which it was planned. Provincial 
leaders had hoped money spent by an anticipated 300,000 additional 
tourists each year would triple local incomes after a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	An executive at LKN Management Service Co., a member of the  
project's Singapore-based consultancy team, said domestic financial 
constraints faced by consortium members mean ``there will be no 
further movement'' on the Dankia project in the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal to build the Dalat Dankia Resort was approved by Hanoi  
in January 1998 after nearly six years of talks. Work hasn't 
started on the 5,750-acre project, which would include two golf 
courses, a theater, a botanical garden and a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Singapore investors are NatSteel Resorts International, a  
unit of NatSteel Ltd.; Singapore Leisure Industries; and LKN 
Construction, a unit of Lim Kah Ngam Ltd.

<HEADLINE> OSU Basketball Coach Gets New Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State extended the contract of men's  
basketball coach Jim O'Brien through the 2007 season today and will 
pay him over $833,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in his third year with the Buckeyes, O'Brien broke a string  
of five losing seasons at Ohio State with a 27-9 campaign in 
1998-99. Ohio State made it to the Final Four in one of the biggest 
turnarounds on record. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agreement pays O'Brien a base salary of $175,000 a year.  
Additional income from radio and television work, endorsements and 
camps raises the compensation to $833,275. 
</P>
<P>
	His contract could be extended by one year each season for  
accomplishments such as winning the Big Ten championship or 
reaching the regional semifinals of the NCAA Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's climb to the Final Four last year gave O'Brien an  
additional $62,100, and another year added to his original six-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien, who came to Ohio State from Boston College, has a  
record of 270-248 in 17 seasons as a head coach, including 35-31 at 
Ohio State.

<HEADLINE> ZCMI Sold to May Department Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- May Department Stores Co. added to its  
nationwide collection of department stores on Friday, agreeing to 
buy a 14-store chain founded by the Mormon church 132 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The $52 million stock deal with ZCMI -- formerly Zion's  
Cooperative Mercantile Institution -- gives May a foothold in Utah 
and Idaho, two states where it had little presence. 
</P>
<P>
	ZCMI will keep its name during a transitional period but  
eventually will change its name to Meier &AMP; Frank, a May property 
with eight stores in Oregon and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the agreement, ZCMI's downtown Salt Lake City  
store will remain closed on Sundays in accordance with Mormon 
tenets. ZCMI's 13 other stores, 11 in Utah and two in Idaho, also 
will remain closed on Sundays until they become Meier &AMP; Frank 
stores. That's expected to occur in the next two years, ZCMI said. 
</P>
<P>
	ZCMI has struggled in recent years, losing $8.5 million for the  
year that ended Jan. 30. It lost an additional $3.5 million for 
this year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The department store's management had hoped to turn the company  
around with a cost-cutting plan that would have limited some 
specialty departments and curbed new hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Layoffs and store closings will be needed to turn ZCMI around,  
said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report. 
</P>
<P>
	``ZCMI is a good company but it hasn't had good management,''  
Barnard said. 
</P>
<P>
	ZCMI, with about 4,000 employees, calls itself the nation's  
first department store. It was founded in 1868 at the suggestion of 
Mormon leader Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
	May reported sales of $13.1 billion last year. It operates 402  
department stores in 33 stores, including Filene's in New England, 
Hecht's in the mid-Atlantic states and The Jones Store in the 
Kansas City area.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Ban on Gun Show Sales Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge has blocked Los Angeles  
County from banning gun sales later this month at the world's 
biggest gun show, saying officials are trying to get around state 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by the operators of the  
Great Western Gun Show, which opens Oct. 29 at the county 
fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Great Western Shows Inc. challenged an ordinance that was  
enacted by the county Board of Supervisors after a shooting rampage 
at a Jewish community center. Under the ordinance, vendors can 
display guns and offer them for sale but cannot actually complete 
sales transactions at the show. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Paez said the county is trying to  
pre-empt state law, which allows gun shows to operate with sales on 
the premises. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gun show has been taking place for 22 years and the  
ordinance will have a substantial hardship'' on the show's 
operators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100,000 people attend the four Great Western shows  
each year at the county fairgrounds in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
	Great Western said in the lawsuit that it would seek more than  
$1 million in damages for violations of its rights. It said it had 
already signed a lease at the county fairgrounds, with 2,000 
exhibitors planned, and cannot find another site. 
</P>
<P>
	County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a backer of the ban on gun  
sales, said gun shows are a ``veritable swap meet for illegal 
weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the judge's point that the gun show has been held for 22  
years is irrelevant. ``You could ask why ban smoking in public 
buildings. We've been doing it for a hundred years,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Accuses GOP of Sharp Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is accusing congressional  
Republicans of planning ``unconscionable'' cuts in education and 
other programs as the two sides sharpen their positions in the 
ongoing budget fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 93-5 today to give final congressional approval  
to a $99 billion measure financing veterans, housing and science 
programs. On Thursday, the Senate sent Clinton a $268 billion 
defense bill. 
</P>
<P>
	But two weeks into fiscal 2000, just five of the 13 annual  
spending bills have become law, and five others face veto threats. 
And as the White House and lawmakers focus on the remaining, most 
politically charged measures, both sides' rhetoric is sharpening. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used a White House news conference Thursday to say he  
would veto a bill financing labor, health and education programs, 
since it provides little of the $1.4 billion he wants to continue 
hiring new elementary school teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be unconscionable to think that America at its moment  
of greatest prosperity, when we got our first surplus in 30 years, 
is out there cutting education and several other areas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., rejected that,  
noting that overall the Senate version of the bill contains more 
for education than Clinton proposed. He also said Clinton has done 
nothing in months to help Congress complete its budget work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hadn't had a single call from him, not any contact, no  
suggestions, other than a few missiles fired over from the White 
House,'' Lott told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye toward the Oct. 21 expiration of a bill that has  
kept federal agencies open since the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal 
year, House and Senate leaders ordered the authors of the 
labor-education bill -- which surpasses $310 billion -- to try 
crafting a compromise that Congress could pass next week. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems certain that Congress will need at least one more  
stopgap spending bill extension while lawmakers and administration 
officials complete the final bills. Members of both parties said 
they expected Clinton would sign one, even though White House 
spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ``The president has made no such 
commitment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said across-the-board cuts Republicans were considering  
in all 13 bills ``could deny tens of thousands of children Head 
Start opportunities, drastically reduce medical research, sacrifice 
military readiness, jeopardize the safety of air traffic control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders played down the impact of the cuts, which they said  
would be 1 percent or less, and insisted they would honor their 
pledge not to use Social Security surpluses to pay for spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rather than cut Social Security, I'd cut any program, every  
program across the board,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate gave the defense bill final approval by 87-11 after  
it cleared the House on Wednesday. To gain leverage, Clinton was 
expected to delay signing the measure until Congress completed the 
other spending bills. The Pentagon bill would provide the 
military's biggest pay raise in nearly two decades, slow the Air 
Force's F-22 ``stealth'' fighter program and seek to halt a 
Pentagon decline in readiness. It was also home to gimmicks such as 
declaring $7 billion in military operations and maintenance 
programs an ``emergency,'' meaning the money would not count 
against spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House approved the veterans-housing bill, 406-18. Senate  
approval was planned today, and Clinton was expected to sign it. 
The measure would give Clinton even more than he requested for 
environmental, veterans health and space programs. It is also 
included hundreds of projects for members' districts, including 
$150,000 for a hands-on children's' museum in Florence, Ala., and 
$2 million to buttress a building against earthquakes at California 
State University in San Bernadino. 
</P>
<P>
	--House-Senate bargainers neared agreement on a $38 billion  
measure for the departments of Commerce, Justice and State. White 
House support seemed uncertain. One participant said the bill would 
provide $570 million for Clinton's proposal to help communities 
hire thousands of police officers, less than half of what he 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House approved a District of Columbia spending measure,  
217-202. Clinton vetoed an earlier version because he said it 
intruded on local decision-making, and White House officials warned 
that the new bill would be vetoed too.

<HEADLINE> Providence Mayoral Ratings Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Another corruption scandal has hit City  
Hall, and yet the mayor's approval ratings are going up, up, up. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact is, people in Providence are feeling mighty good about  
their city, and many give credit for its renaissance to Mayor 
Vincent A. ``Buddy'' Cianci Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest city in the smallest state has gone from an urban  
eyesore, once known for its mobsters and strip joints, into a 
welcoming destination for tourists and conventioneers. Newspaper 
travel sections run features on the city, and the TV series 
``Providence'' opens with a romantic view of the skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a doubt, the 58-year-old Cianci has some rough edges. A  
decade ago he got in trouble for an assault. He is known to use 
foul language to upbraid city employees. And political opponents 
have accused him of not always playing fair. 
</P>
<P>
	But he is also adored as the man who made Providence a media  
star -- the Seattle of the East. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone loves Buddy,'' said Jeanne Dupuis, who lives in  
Scituate but wants to move to Providence, largely because of the 
city's rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has breathed life back into the city. Ten years ago it was  
like a ghost town,'' she said as she was leaving The Arcade 
shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
	This city of 160,000 started to die in the 1940s and '50s with  
the closing of textile and jewelry factories. Later on, suburban 
shopping malls bled retail life out of much of downtown. But 
Providence has undergone an astonishing metamorphosis under Cianci. 
</P>
<P>
	He was behind the creation of Waterplace Park, a system of  
canals and brick walkways formed by rerouting two rivers. Iron 
pedestrian bridges and gondola rides give the area a Venice-like 
atmosphere. The city also has an arts and entertainment district 
where artists who live and work in new loft studios get tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	A $460 million, 160-store shopping mall opened last summer on  
edge of downtown, a block from the $350 million convention center 
and hotel that were completed in 1994. Other projects include a new 
skating rink and $300 million in transportation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the city's revival has been funded by federal dollars,  
which Cianci has proved a master at landing. The city's new look 
is, in turn, bringing in lots of dollars from tourists and 
conventioneers, 4 million of whom visited Providence last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm at the top of my game,'' said Cianci, a chain  
smoker with a gap-tooth smile. ``I love the city and I love my 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new statewide poll gives the mayor a 75 percent approval  
rating -- higher than that of any other Rhode Island politician. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a remarkable feat for Cianci, who was first elected in  
1974 as a Republican but is now an independent. During his first 
administration, 30 city employees and contractors were indicted on 
charges including extortion and fraud. Twenty-two were convicted 
and 17 went to jail. Cianci himself denied any knowledge of 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, he pleaded no contest to beating up a man he suspected  
of having an affair with his estranged wife. He got no jail time 
but had to resign under a city ordinance. He ran again in 1990 and 
won by a narrow margin. He has been re-elected twice since and 
plans to run again in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	And again, investigators are sniffing around City Hall.  
</P>
<P>
	Four city tax officials have been indicted this year on  
corruption charges, and more arrests are expected. Although Cianci 
has not been accused of any wrongdoing, a grand jury has subpoenaed 
his campaign finance records and other documents. 
</P>
<P>
	But few people in Providence seem disturbed by the federal  
investigation. In fact, there's a joke going around that every 
indictment is worth another five points for Cianci in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Cianci seems unfazed by the investigation and the stream of  
stories it has spawned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more they whack at me, the more my ratings go up,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Art's Virtue Wins at N.J. Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Art's Virtue set a stakes and track  
record Friday night with a 3 1/4-length victory over Love You Forty in 
the $394,100 Three Diamonds Stakes for 2-year-old fillies at Garden 
State Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Art's Virtue covered the mile in 1:52.4, besting the 1:53.1 set  
by Mybrowneyedgirl in this race in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Driven by John Campbell for his brother, trainer Jim Campbell,  
and owners Jules and Arlene Siegel of New Hope, Pa., Art's Virtue, 
took command in the stretch in her third career start and was an 
easy winner in a career-best time. 
</P>
<P>
	Love You Forty, the favorite, was driven by Luc Ouellette and  
finished three-quarters of a length in front of Shady Desire, 
driven by Jay Randall. 
</P>
<P>
	``She felt real good and she finished strong,'' said John  
Campbell, who was driving the filly for the first time. ``Jim told 
me if I didn't use her too hard early, she'd finish well. He was 
right about that. The stiff fractions up front (set by My Baby and 
Me) helped us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell has won the Three Diamonds five times -- Miss Easy  
(1990), Immortality (1992), Freedom's Friend (1993) and Glendale 
Kim (1994). 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought my filly raced giant,'' said Ouellette, who was  
third on the rail for much of the race. ``She made the best of bad 
situation. I'm very happy with her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Art's Virtue, who paid $5.80, $3.40 and $3.20, will next race in  
the Breeders Crown eliminations at Mohawk Raceway near Toronto on 
Oct. 22.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Paper Wins APME's FOI Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The News-Sentinel, Knoxville, Tenn., won  
the top award in the Freedom of Information competition of the 
Associated Press Managing Editors association Friday for leading a 
two-year battle to open records detailing public costs to defend a 
person accused of being a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29th annual award was presented at the APME conference by  
E.J. Mitchell, executive editor of the Statesman Journal in Salem, 
Ore., and chairman of the FOI Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Other newspapers cited for extraordinary effort toward a  
better-informed citizenry were: 
</P>
<P>
	--Asheville (N.C.) Citizen-Times, for its efforts to open records  
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Advocate, Baton Rouge, La., for its watchdog efforts on the  
state's Open Meetings Law. 
</P>
<P>
	--Courier-Post, Cherry Hill, N.J., for its examination of  
mismanagement and abuse within the Camden Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Day, New London, Conn., for its battle to force a  
quasi-public agency to comply with FOI laws. 
</P>
<P>
	--Omaha (Neb.) World-Herald, for its eight-year effort to obtain  
crime statistics from the city. 
</P>
<P>
	--Star Tribune, Minneapolis, for exposing a company's attempt to  
conceal details of a $6.9 million settlement in an environmental 
case and fighting in court the company's claim that withholding 
information was intended to protect the whistleblowers involved. 
</P>
<P>
	--Waco (Texas) Tribune-Herald, for forcing a charter school to  
release records showing financial problems during a period in which 
board members met in secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Two finalists were recognized for similar projects conducted by  
separate alliances of newspapers in two states. 
</P>
<P>
	--Seven New Jersey newspapers owned by Gannett Co. tested open  
records laws in that state by asking 601 public agencies to respond 
to requests. Patterns of resistance and misapplication of the law

<HEADLINE>  Hurricane Irene Takes Aim at Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene took aim at the Florida  
Keys today after drenching Cuba's tobacco fields and causing 
scattered building collapses and power outages around Havana. At 
least one person was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though barely a hurricane with 75 mph winds, Irene's torrential  
rains threatened to flood the lower third of the Florida peninsula 
as the storm crawled across the straits separating Cuba from the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said areas as far north as Tampa could be flooded.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a well organized hurricane, and there's a huge swath  
of storms and rain to the east'' of its center, said Richard Pasch, 
a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center outside 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m. EDT, Irene was about 45 miles southwest of Key West.  
Irene had moved slowly and erratically late Thursday, but was 
moving north at about 9 mph early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said the storm was likely to hit land between Tampa  
and Ft. Myers by Saturday morning. Its effects were already being 
felt in the Keys, where tourists fled late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Monroe County, which covers the Keys, ordered a  
mandatory evacuation of mobile homes and recreational vehicles. 
Schools were closed for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was on my way to work all of the stop lights were out.  
The power came back on, but I think there was an incident where a 
sailboat hit a power line,'' said David Holliman, a security guard 
at the Lower Keys Medical Center in Key West. ``It's so bad outside 
I can't make outside rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four shelters were opened in the Keys: two in Key West and one  
each in Marathon and Key Largo. Fewer than 100 people were staying 
at the shelters Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm left Cuban territory after soaking Havana on Thursday  
evening. Early reports were that the island escaped relatively 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
	During a televised briefing, Havana authorities told President  
Fidel Castro that one person had been electrocuted and a second 
person was missing following the storm's march across the capital 
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Havana Mayor Conrado Martinez said that 149 buildings were  
damaged by the heavy rains, including 13 which collapsed, and power 
outages were scattered around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	About 130,000 people from western and central Cuba, many of them  
students in government boarding schools, were evacuated as the 
hurricane approached. Classes across the region were suspended. 
Stores, government offices and banks in Havana closed shortly after 
noon. 
</P>
<P>
	In the western city of Pinar del Rio, laborers worked made sure  
water didn't leak into warehouses storing the tobacco leaves grown 
to make Cuba's famous cigars. Cattle and livestock in the rural 
region were moved to higher ground.

<HEADLINE> Gore May Say 'No' To Clinton's Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore says he may tell  
President Clinton that he doesn't want his help on the quest for 
the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who defended Clinton during the impeachment trial and now  
faces a stronger-than-expected challenge for the Democratic 
nomination from former Sen. Bill Bradley, said running for the 
White House is a ``very personal quest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Friday with reporters and editors at The  
Washington Post, Gore said he has yet to decide if he's going to 
tell Clinton not to help his campaign effort. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he told the Post, ``I may do that.''  
</P>
<P>
	To be successful, ``I have to have a very personal connection  
and line of communication with the American people,'' said Gore, 
comparing the campaign to his first race for the House in 1976, 
when he asked his late father, a senator, not to speak on his 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore criticized Bradley's suggestion that he was waging a ``left  
of center, insurgent'' bid for the White House. Gore said a more 
accurate description of Bradley's 18-year record as a senator from 
New Jersey would be ``cautious moderate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his professed desire to be his own man on the campaign  
trail, Gore acknowledged that Clinton already is injecting himself 
into the race by wooing major donors and talking up his vice 
president whenever and wherever possible. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Clinton praised Gore as ``by far the best vice  
president in history'' and said he did the right thing by moving 
his campaign operation out from Washington to Nashville, Tenn. 
``And I expect him to win,'' Clinton said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said Clinton has done a ``superb'' job but added that he  
understood the American people's anger and disappointment with the 
president over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Gore said, his campaign is more about tomorrow, than  
yesterday. ``In this campaign, the American people want to look at 
who can best lead them in the future. I don't think they want to 
look at the past,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Lindros Tone Speaks Volumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The anxiety index is rising for the  
Philadelphia Flyers, who have begun a season of great expectations 
with the worst five-game start in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't walk away from this thinking that there isn't a high  
level of anxiety in here,'' captain Eric Lindros warned Friday. 
``There certainly is. There's a lot going on here. A lot is at 
stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those are ominous words from the Flyers' franchise player, who  
has labeled this season as pivotal to his future and that of the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see the direction that the team goes,'' Lindros said  
before the season, referring to his status as a potential free 
agent next summer. ``I want to see what happens this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dismal 0-4-1 start can't help.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's urgency to win a game,'' left wing John LeClair said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, who have lost key forwards Rod Brind'Amour and Keith  
Jones for up to two months with injuries, lost 5-4 in overtime to 
the Montreal Canadiens on Thursday night. It is the first winless 
five-game start in 32 years of the franchise's existence. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss also came one day after team chairman Ed Snider met for  
nearly six hours with general manager Bob Clarke, coach Roger 
Neilson and the front office staff at the team's New Jersey 
training facility. Neilson, who replaced Wayne Cashman at the end 
of the 1997-98 season, is fielding questions about job security 
after only five games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be worried about that,'' Neilson said. ``We've played  
five games in an 82-game schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players know about the meetings, so it's impossible to keep  
the speculation from trickling down to the locker room. Lindros, 
who has spoken publicly in support of Neilson, said he wouldn't 
make the case to Clarke or anyone in the front office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go upstairs,'' Lindros said. ``I don't get involved in  
that. I talk to you guys. I haven't been upstairs in years. And 
never once when I went upstairs was it about something like that. 
That's not my responsibility. We're given a game plan and as 
players, we've got to perform it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They have done a poor job of it so far.  
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers were shut out in their first two losses. Lindros and  
LeClair have regained their scoring touch, but defensive lapses and 
shaky goaltending have become the new culprit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough situation. Everybody knows it,'' said defenseman  
Eric Desjardins, who is minus-6 in two games and looks sluggish 
after offseason knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers blew a 4-2 second-period lead Thursday night to the  
Canadiens, who were missing eight regulars due to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have them,'' Lindros said, referring to Brind'Amour  
and Jones. ``So get over it. Other teams are missing players, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson scolded his team Friday for the third time in five days  
for its lack of communication and inability to move the puck out of 
its own zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't happy this morning when we talked to the team,''  
Neilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there have been no tantrums yet. At this point, the anger in  
the locker room hasn't boiled over into finger-pointing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think anybody here likes what's going on?'' LeClair  
said. ``You can't get mad, you've got to do something about it. The 
embarrassment factor alone should be motivation enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke met with his scouting staff again Friday and worked the  
phones, perhaps trying to find a way to plug the holes with a 
trade. He turned over nearly half the roster with trades last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what to expect,'' Lindros said. ``I don't know  
what he's going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Vanbiesbrouck, who is nursing a strained hip, will be back  
in goal on Saturday in Detroit. Neilson's decision to start rookie 
Brian Boucher backfired Thursday night. Boucher was shaky, allowing 
three goals between his legs in his NHL debut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, desperately needing a victory, haven't won in  
Detroit since Nov. 1988 (0-8-2). 
</P>
<P>
	``It just gets better, doesn't it?'' Lindros said. ``You turn it  
around, break that string and turn over a new leaf. It's got to 
start some time.''

<HEADLINE> EU Coordinates To Fight Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPERE, Finland (AP) -- Abandoning decades of go-it-alone  
policies, leaders of the 15 European Union nations debated steps 
today to coordinate their fight against illegal immigration and 
organized crime across Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU leaders gathered for the start of a two-day meeting in  
this once-flourishing industrial town of 190,000 in southern 
Finland. Participants said they were taking a first step toward 
better legal cooperation between the EU nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are centuries of difference in criminal laws. You cannot  
pull up legal systems by the root,'' British Home Secretary Jack 
Straw told reporters. ``You have to improve cooperation and joint 
recognition'' of legal systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU nations have long been hesitant to deploy a single system  
of law enforcement, but the idea of international coordination has 
recently been taking on increasing significance. 
</P>
<P>
	The calls for cooperation are driven in part by the rise of  
extreme right-wing parties, which have in some EU countries made 
gains on mainstream parties by playing on public complaints about 
crime and immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	Closer EU unity in recent years is behind many of the problems.  
Open borders make movement easier for criminals and illegal 
immigrants. But governments have been slow to improve police 
cooperation or create a legal framework to deal with crimes like 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	To get around varying legal systems from country to country, new  
emphasis will be on mutual recognition of court systems, equal 
access to courts for any EU national and measures to ensure 
comparable sentencing from country to country. 
</P>
<P>
	During the summit, leaders will discuss several reform  
blueprints by EU Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Antonio 
Vitorino. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposals include ideas to streamline family and child  
custody laws -- issues that affect partners of different 
nationalities who must often deal with two sets of laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders also will take up the problem of refugees, thousands  
of whom have flooded EU countries to escape upheaval in places like 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, they discussed a plan for a special fund to help those  
nations that take most immigrants, notably Germany. The aim is to 
prevent so-called ``asylum shopping'' -- newcomers choosing a 
country of residence, then moving on to the next if they fail to 
meet requirements to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm strengthened in the belief we will reach concrete  
results,'' Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen, whose country now 
holds the EU presidency, said before the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	At a dinner later today, the leaders were scheduled to debate a  
proposal that the EU open membership talks with six more nations -- 
Bulgaria, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Malta. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU Executive Commission proposed this week that the union  
begin talks with those countries. They had been rejected in 1997 
while talks with Cyprus, Estonia, Slovenia, Poland, Hungary and the 
Czech Republic got the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	A final decision about whether to open the additional talks is  
expected at a mid-December summit in Helsinki.

<HEADLINE> IBM Unveils High-Capacity Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- IBM Corp. today introduced a 73-gigabyte  
hard drive, the largest ever, aimed at high-end markets, such as 
the professional audio industry, credit card transaction processing 
and digital documentation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ultrastar 72ZX will ship in the first quarter of 2000,  
according to the statement issued by IBM's San Jose-based Storage 
System Division. It also unveiled two other hard drives in the 
Ultrastar series -- both 36-gigabyte drives, which will be available 
in limited quantities this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the larger storage space, IBM's new series is  
designed to perform more reliably while keeping power usage in 
check. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement validates IBM's leadership in hard drives for  
the high-end server market, where it maintains a 40 percent market 
share, according to Salomon Smith Barney computer analyst John B. 
Jones Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The 73-gigabyte model can store 7.04 billion data bits per  
square inch. It is roughly the size of a paperback novel and can 
hold as much information as a floor of books at the New York Public 
Library ``with room to spare,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., invented the first hard drive in  
1956.

<HEADLINE> Leiter Could Have Used Some Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Leiter couldn't do it all by himself.  
</P>
<P>
	Just like he has all year, he performed well in a big game, this  
time desperately trying to get the New York Mets back into the NL 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	He held the Atlanta Braves to just three hits and no earned runs  
in seven inning Friday night, but the Mets lost meekly 1-0 and 
trail 3-0 in the best-of-7 series, undone by sloppy fielding, 
including his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter actually outpitched Tom Glavine, who allowed at least one  
runner in each of his seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mets trailed by a run when Shawon Dunston hit for Leiter  
in the seventh, finishing his night and probably his season. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitcher put on his warmup jacket, sat on the bench in the  
Mets dugout and spit at the ground, looking like had run through 
the streets of New York in a marathon. It seemed he had left every 
drop of his energy out on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Leiter turned cheerleader, clapping hands and trying to  
shout his teammates to a run after Dunston reached on a passed 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Mets didn't score then, didn't score all night long. If  
you don't get any runs, the best pitching in the world won't win a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Truth be told, the Braves' heralded pitching staff has been the  
difference in this series, holding New York to five runs in three 
games while the Braves batters have pushed just nine runners 
across. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets pitchers have been good, but the Braves' staff of Greg  
Maddux, Kevin Millwood and Glavine has been great. 
</P>
<P>
	John Olerud is 2-for-11 with no RBIs in the three games, Mike  
Piazza 2-for-11 with one RBI. Robin Ventura is 0-for-9 with no 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	During the regular season, the trio combined to drive in 340  
runs, an average of more than two a game. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean much to Leiter now. He gave up the unearned  
run, mainly because he walked Gerald Williams leading off the game 
and then threw away Bret Boone's comebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be the hardest thing to live with. He had no problems  
with throws to the plate, just to first base.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Test Votes Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate set a pair of test votes on  
campaign finance legislation for early next week as a bipartisan 
coalition behind the effort to overhaul the current system showed 
signs of strain Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to President Clinton, Arizona Republican Sen. John  
McCain, a GOP presidential hopeful, requested ``immediate 
assistance'' in discouraging Senate Democrats from pressing for a 
more comprehensive measure than is now on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``If offered, Republican senators who oppose our efforts to  
enact meaningful campaign finance reforms may support the 
amendment, ... then revert to their strident opposition,'' McCain 
wrote to the president. The result would be to kill ``any prospect 
of meaningful reform this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, written Thursday, was released Friday, as Democrats  
defied McCain's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Senate will vote Tuesday on the broader measure  
-- which McCain and his legislative partner, Sen. Russell Feingold, 
D-Wis., supported last year -- and then on the slimmed-down bill 
they are backing this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A 60-vote majority will be required to advance either proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	Democratic aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
decision to seek a vote on the broader measure is an attempt to 
place senators on record. If it falls short of 60, they said, the 
debate will resume on McCain and Feingold's current measure. 
</P>
<P>
	That bill would ban soft money from federal campaigns, large  
donations that political parties and some politicians seek from 
corporations, labor and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would give nonunion members the right to stop unions  
from using their mandatory dues money for political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was stripped of other provisions that campaign  
finance legislation contained in past years. These include 
restrictions on so-called issue ads, which generally attack 
candidates without advocating their election or defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain disclosed his distress with Democratic tactics one day  
after he was pummeled in Senate debate by fellow Republicans who 
complained he had made broadly worded allegations of corruption 
without providing specifics.

<HEADLINE> Caterpillar Earnings Down 35 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar Inc. reported that a continued  
slump in heavy machinery sales lowered its third-quarter earnings 
by 35 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy equipment manufacturer said today that it earned $219  
million, or 61 cents a share, compared to $336 million, or 92 cents 
a share during the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were a penny over the expectations of Wall Street  
analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Caterpillar 
stock was down 38 cents to $55.25 a share in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter sales were $4.72 billion, down 8.9 percent from  
$5.17 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar reported a drop in heavy machinery sales in North  
America and Asia during the quarter. As a result, the company 
lowered its overall estimated sales and revenue for 1999, saying it 
now expects a decline of about 5 percent, Caterpillar Chairman and 
CEO Glen Barton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barton said he expects higher sales in 2000. Analysts also  
have predicted that global economic recovery will result in higher 
earnings next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``While sales of large machines remained weak, truck engine  
sales continued at historic high levels,'' and demand for large 
engines is improving, Barton said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Caterpillar earned $707  
million, or $1.97 per share, down 42 percent from $1.21 billion, or 
$3.28 per share, in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue came to $14.68 billion, down 5.7 percent from $15.57  
billion.

	Dow Down 244.74 at 10,041.87  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials briefly plunged below 10,000  
today as stocks tumbled amid news of a spurt in inflation and 
another warning about market exuberance by Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan. Just before the close, the Dow was down 244.74 at 
10,041.87. Moments later, the barometer of 30 major companies 
dipped below 10,000 for the first time since April, slipping to 
9,998.18. The drop yanked the Dow's gain for the year below 10 
percent and put the average about 1,300 points below its Aug. 25 
closing high of 11,326.04, when the Dow was up more than 23

	Hurricane Irene Lashes Florida Keys  
</P>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- A slow and soggy Hurricane Irene lashed  
the Florida Keys with 75 mph winds and 10 inches of rain today, 
then headed up the state's Gulf Coast on a course that could mean 
more misery for flood-stricken North Carolina. The weak hurricane 
is expected to come ashore late tonight between Naples and Fort

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's coup leader drew up plans  
today for imposing order on the country's political chaos, raising 
Pakistanis' hopes the military takeover can sweep away years of 
corrupt government and economic decline. Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, 
whose troops brought down the elected government three days ago, 
also met with an envoy from President Clinton in a bid to win at 
least tolerance of his military regime, despite U.S. calls for him

	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Riot police used tear gas and batons  
to disperse thousands of anti-government demonstrators Friday as 
harsh criticism mounted of President B.J. Habibie, eroding his 
chances of retaining his post in a vote next week. About 30 
protesters were hospitalized and 10 policeman were injured Friday 
in clashes that closed Jakarta's business district for hours. The 
turmoil raised the prospect of further instability in Indonesia,

in decades.

than 100 people were injured in the melee, the most violent clash 
here in a month, NATO said. Mitrovica's Albanians say NATO forces 
are keeping them from their homes, schools and a mine in the Serb 
part of town. But allowing them to cross would spark far greater 
violence because of ethnic hatred.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just a year after the government approved it,  
the world's only vaccine against the leading cause of childhood 
diarrhea was pulled off the market today because of fears it may 
increase infants' risk of a dangerous bowel obstruction. The

<HEADLINE> Texas Man Accused of Aiding Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLEASANTON, Texas (AP) -- A housemate of the man who ambushed  
officers earlier this week, killing three before killing himself, 
was arrested today on charges he helped the man plan the attack and 
buy ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Vodochodsky, 19, was booked into the Atascosa County  
Jail early today, Department of Public Safety spokesman Tela Mange 
said. He was charged with three counts of capital murder and two of 
attempted capital murder and held on $5 million bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Jeremiah Engleton, 21, who had been jailed early  
Tuesday for beating his wife, made a bogus 911 call later that day 
and then ambushed officers one by one as they arrived outside 
Vodochodsky's trailer home on the edge of Pleasanton. Three were 
killed and two others wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Engleton held 75 officers off for two more hours before shooting  
himself as they closed in, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an affidavit released today, Texas Ranger Tony Leal said  
Vodochodsky knew Engleton wanted to kill lawmen and bailed his 
friend out of jail the day of the attack. They went directly to a 
gun shop, the affidavit said, and bought $200 worth of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodochodsky then went with Engleton to the mobile home where the  
attack occurred and stayed until just after Engleton called 911, 
Leal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after the attack, Vodochodsky told a neighbor of his  
role, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I bailed him out to do this,'' he allegedly said.  
``Yeah, he was going to do it the other night when they came to 
arrest him, but I told him 'No, not now.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Vodochodsky had told reporters Thursday that Engleton, his wife  
and two children had lived in Vodochodsky's trailer for the past 
six months with him and his family. He said he and Engleton worked 
together on a construction job. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodochodsky said Engleton had been upset because he believed his  
wife had had an affair, but ``I didn't think that he'd do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officers who were killed were Atascosa County sheriff's  
deputies Thomas Monse, 31, and Mark Stephenson, 31, and Department 
of Public Safety trooper Terry Miller, 37. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Tommy Williams had speculated Thursday that Engleton may  
have been angry at officers for jailing him after he beat his wife. 
When he got out of jail, she wasn't home because a family violence 
counselor had persuaded her to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found photographs of his wife in the trash.

<HEADLINE> Asarco Accepts Grupo Mexico Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Asarco Inc. today accepted a $1.24 billion cash  
takeover offer from Grupo Mexico SA de CV, following a seven-week 
bidding contest for the nation's third-largest copper producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Grupo Mexico increased its proposal by 25 cents to $29.75 a  
share, topping an offer by rival Phelps Dodge Corp. Grupo Mexico 
also will assume Asarco's $1.02 billion in debt. Phelps had 
previously said it would not raise its bid. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of Asarco's 1 billion pounds of annual copper  
production, Grupo Mexico will be the world's third-largest copper 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The jousting for control of Asarco underscores the pressure  
copper companies face to cut costs by consolidating. The price of 
copper has fallen by almost one-third over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of New York-based Asarco were up 12 1/2 cents at $29.43 3/4 in  
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The losing bidder, Phoenix, Ariz.-based Phelps Dodge will have  
to content itself with its $1.8 billion acquisition of Cyprus Amax 
Minerals Co. of Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge shares were up 37 1/2 cents at $57.62 1/2, also on the  
NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Father: Body of Kansas Girl Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAIN VALLEY, Mo. (AP) -- A 10-year-old girl who was abducted  
while roller skating with her sister was found dead today, three 
days after she disappeared, her father said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found her, that's all I can say,'' Paul Butler tearfully  
told reporters outside Pamela Butler's home in Kansas City, Kan. 
``Please leave her mother alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Special Agent Monte Strait confirmed a body matching the  
fifth-grader's description had been found early this afternoon. 
Items of clothing also were found that matched the description of 
Pamela's clothing, he said. The clothes were found in a separate 
area; the body was nude, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI affidavit had quoted a co-worker as saying that the  
suspect, Keith B. Nelson, told him two weeks ago that he ``would 
like to kidnap a girl to rape, torture, electrocute, kill and 
bury.'' The body was not buried but was covered with sticks, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 officers had searched a field and woods in Grain  
Valley, about 25 miles from her home. The body was found north of a 
church where a pickup truck believed to have been used in the 
kidnapping was spotted a few hours after Pamela disappeared 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked what the cause of death was, Strait said, ``I don't  
want to go into any details. We still have a lot of investigating 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, the 24-year-old suspect, was captured Thursday, ending a  
manhunt that gripped the community for two days and included a 
high-speed chase through Kansas City, Kan. He was hospitalized with 
knee and ankle injuries suffered after Tuesday's abduction, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson was operated on this morning and was recovering, FBI  
spokesman Jeff Lanza said. He could be released from the hospital 
as early as this afternoon, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had said earlier today that Nelson refused to say  
anything about the girl's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela was skating about 5:45 p.m. Tuesday when her 11-year-old  
sister, Penny, saw a man get out of a white pickup, grab Pamela 
around the waist and throw her into the cab. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started screaming, and so did she,'' said Penny, who was on  
the front porch of her home at the time. She yelled for an older 
sister to call police. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses reported a license number after they tried to chase  
the truck, but couldn't keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck was registered to a company formerly owned by David  
Cunningham, Nelson's boss. Cunningham said Nelson had been driving 
the truck for two weeks, the FBI affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson was captured after he was spotted Thursday lying near the  
Kansas River. Police said he tried to swim away as officers 
approached. 
</P>
<P>
	While authorities had searched for Pamela, classmates decorated  
her home with cards made out of construction paper and gave teddy 
bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela's mother, Cherri West, had made emotional appeals for the  
kidnapper to give back her daughter, going sleepless since the 
abduction and finally losing her voice after numerous interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	She described her daughter as ``a funny girl (who) likes to play  
jokes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a tomboy. She's outgoing, she likes to Rollerblade, she  
plays basketball. She sings, she dances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's just a little girl,'' her mother said. ``I don't know if  
she's alive or dead. Hope is really starting to fade away.''

<HEADLINE> New Guidelines on Inmate Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A panel of experts drafted preliminary  
guidelines Friday for medical experiments on prison inmates across 
the country, promising not to repeat the mistakes of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Anne S. De Groot said prisoners who have AIDS must be given  
access to cutting-edge clinical tests, but also be protected from 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee believes that research trials should be made  
accessible to inmates under certain conditions,'' said De Groot, 
co-chair of the HIV/Prison Project at the Brown University AIDS 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those conditions may set a higher standard for trials  
conducted in correctional settings than is currently set for trials 
outside corrections, due to the special vulnerability of 
prisoners,'' she said in an interview after a closed session. 
</P>
<P>
	De Groot said clinical tests are currently being done in some  
prisons and jails across the country, and are regulated under 
federal guidelines. But, she said, the current guidelines say very 
little about prisoner participation in research, and there is 
little oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's meeting concluded a three-day conference convened by  
the Brown University AIDS Program and the HIV in Prisons Program of 
Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s, American inmates were intentionally infected with  
live cancer cells, herpes, ringworm, hepatitis, and syphilis, all 
in the name of medical research. 
</P>
<P>
	When those, and other experiments were brought to light in the  
1970s, they were stopped and research in prisons was banned in some 
states and severely curtailed in others. 
</P>
<P>
	With the advent of AIDS and hepatitis C, however, prisoners are  
asking to be allowed to participate in medical research again. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the preliminary guidelines, De Groot said the team of  
16 AIDS researchers, medical ethicists, lawyers, and prisoner 
advocates decided prisons where research is conducted must have 
high quality medical care already available, so inmates do not feel 
coerced into research programs simply to get proper treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	And, De Groot said, former inmates should be used as impartial  
observers to oversee research projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outside corrections, community members participate in the  
review of clinical trials, so that should also be the standard 
inside,'' De Groot said. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines will take at least two months to be finalized  
because several experts crucial to their development were not able 
to attend Friday's session, De Groot said. 
</P>
<P>
	They will then be submitted to medical and governmental  
organizations for approval and adoption.

<HEADLINE> Russian Stocks Regulator Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The chief regulator of Russia's stock market  
resigned Friday following a series of court rulings that undermined 
foreign shareholder rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Dmitry Vasiliev said his resignation as chairman of the Federal  
Securities Commission was for personal reasons, but didn't 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his appointment in 1996, Vasiliev had been seen as a  
champion of Western investors, who have purchased Russian shares 
only to discover in some cases that their legal rights to the 
assets were shaky. 
</P>
<P>
	In one instance, a court in St. Petersburg ruled this week that  
foreign investors must return to the state millions of dollars 
worth of shares in the Lomonosov porcelain factory. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasiliev protested that ruling, saying it weakened the rights of  
foreign shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in the western city of Vyborg, near the border with  
Finland, some 400 paper mill workers rallied Friday to protest a 
court ruling that upheld foreign shareholders' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Mill workers have been blocking representatives of Britain's  
ALCEM company, which holds a controlling stake in the factory, from 
entering the premises. The protests led to clashes with police 
during which 11 workers were injured, the Interfax news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	ALCEM bought the controlling stake last June from another  
British company, Nimonor Investment Ltd. ALCEM then appealed to a 
St. Petersburg court to help it take control of the factory. The 
court ruled in favor of the foreign owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers oppose the new ownership because of reports that up  
to 2,000 employees will be laid off.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Drug Boss: Operation Snagged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House's anti-drug policy director  
denies his office hasn't been responsive to a congressional request 
for details on a $185 million media campaign directed at teen-agers 
and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey said a recent request from the House Government  
Reform Committee's panel on criminal justice, drug policy and human 
resources cost his office $10,000 and brought its operations to a 
near-standstill for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have provided your office with more 12,000 documents,''  
McCaffrey, President Clinton's chief adviser on drug control 
policy, told the subcommittee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommittee Chairman John Mica, R-Fla., said McCaffrey's office  
had done good work but it had delayed turning over requested 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based upon available information, there are signs of progress  
and there are also signs that raise doubts as to the media 
campaign's effectiveness and efficiency,'' Mica said. ``I now see a 
very tangled web of (media) contracts that appears overly 
complicated, expensive and untested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans have long criticized the Clinton  
administration for what they believe would be a lax policy 
anti-drug policy without their influence. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said the campaign's anti-drug messages on television,  
radio, print and on the Internet are reaching 95 percent of 12- to 
17-year-olds an average of 8.3 messages a week, some of them made 
by celebrities who have donated their time. 
</P>
<P>
	The messages have been translated into 11 languages, he said,  
and many are tailored to appeal to various ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are reaching nearly every single American child on a  
regular basis with anti-drug information,'' McCaffrey said. ``This 
campaign is working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He asked the subcommittee to submit more focused requests for  
information and offered to meet personally with Mica to nail down 
precisely what information the subcommittee is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just fishing -- looking for something,'' McCaffrey told  
reporters after testifying before the subcommittee. ``There is no 
lack of careful scientific evaluation of what we're doing.''

<HEADLINE> Plane To Attempt South Pole Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- A U.S. military plane left the  
Antarctic coast Saturday after temperatures rose enough for a 
mission to rescue an American doctor with breast cancer symptoms 
from the South Pole, a U.S. Air Force spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flight took off at 9:27 a.m. (4:27 p.m. EDT Friday),''  
said Capt. Victor Hines. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, an LC-130 Hercules from the New York Air National  
Guard's 109th Airlift Wing, was expected to take three hours to 
reach the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Research Station, a dimpled 
dome in the polar snow and ice that houses 41 researchers from the 
U.S. National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Hercules arrives -- landing on skis on a strip carved  
out of the polar ice -- its four propeller engines will be kept 
turning to prevent them cooling down and freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	The pickup of Dr. Jerri Nielsen, 47, was expected to take 20  
minutes. During that time, the crew will also drop off a 
replacement doctor to the station. 
</P>
<P>
	The rescue was launched from McMurdo station on Antarctica's  
coast after temperatures at the South Pole rose high enough for the 
Hercules to fly there. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,600-mile roundtrip to the pole and back to McMurdo was  
expected to take 6 1/2 hours. When Nielsen, from Youngstown, Ohio, 
returns to McMurdo she will likely be flown to New Zealand and then 
to the United States for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	She has reportedly been treating herself with chemotherapy since  
medical supplies were dropped to her in July, after she discovered 
the lump during the polar winter. No landings are possible at the 
pole during that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Science Foundation, at Nielsen's request, has  
refused to disclose details of her condition or her travel plans. 
</P>
<P>
	As well as its usual crew of six, the Hercules also was carrying  
a senior mission commander, a two-member Medivac team and two 
maintenance personnel as well as a replacement doctor to take 
Nielsen's place at the polar station. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission was finally launched after days of frustration  
caused by unpredictable polar weather. The type of plane involved 
becomes difficult to handle in extremely low temperatures as 
hydraulic systems operate sluggishly below minus 58 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Hercules planes had to wait for an extra day after arriving  
in southern New Zealand this week before flying to the Antarctic 
coast and were forced to postpone planned rescue attempts on 
Thursday and Friday after temperatures plunged as low as minus 76. 
</P>
<P>
	As one flew to the South Pole, the second remained on standby at  
McMurdo as a backup. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amundsen-Scott station cannot be reached by plane during the  
polar winter because of the extremely low temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Science Foundation has -- at Nielsen's request --  
released no information about her condition or travel plans after 
rescue.

<HEADLINE> Apple Computer Rescinds Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bowing to a surge of customer complaints, Apple  
Computer Inc. backed off Friday from a decision to retroactively 
raise prices on some computers that customers already had ordered 
and paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy had threatened to blemish Apple's public image,  
which has greatly improved over the past year as the company 
delivered a string of popular new computers and strong financial 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will probably go down in the record books as the most  
customer-unfriendly act this year, if not the last few years,'' 
said Rob Enderle, an analyst at the Giga Information Group, a 
consulting firm in San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be No. 1 on the list of how to send people to other  
companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time Apple has faced criticism for its  
selling practices. On two occasions in the past two years, the 
computer company has reached settlements with the Federal Trade 
Commission over charges that it misled customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over computer pricing erupted on Wednesday when  
the company said it would delay the launch of its fastest G4 model, 
which sports a 500 megahertz microprocessor, until early next year 
due to a shortage of the computer chips from Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also said it would cancel orders from customers who prior  
to Wednesday had ordered slower models of the G4, but hadn't yet 
received their machines. 
</P>
<P>
	When customers tried to reorder the machines, they learned that  
the same units would cost up to $350 more. And those who had 
ordered 500 megahertz machines were offered slower units for the 
same price. 
</P>
<P>
	Web sites quickly filled up with protests from angry customers,  
and Apple fielded complaints as well. 
</P>
<P>
	One customer, Jon-Paul Kelly, a video editor and graphic  
animator based in San Francisco, had ordered a 500-megahertz 
machine for $4,750, and was told he could get a 450-megahertz 
machine instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a bit disappointed to find out I had to pay the same  
price for basically a lesser machine,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday morning, Apple formally reversed its decision. A memo  
from The Apple Store, Apple's Web site for online sales, informed 
customers Apple decided to honor the original price ``after a good 
night's sleep and digesting emails from many upset customers.'' 
Apple also said it would offer discounts on slower machines to 
people who had ordered the top model. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you ordered a Power Mac G4 configured with a 400 MHz or 450  
MHz processor prior to October 13, we will honor the original price 
quoted for your order,'' the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused you,''  
it added. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhona Hamilton, a spokeswoman with Cupertino, Calif.-based  
Apple, said the pricing reversal also affected retail stores and 
other online distributors of Apple products. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple tried to downplay the impact of the tiff. Mitch Mandich,  
head of worldwide sales for Apple, said that only a ``very small 
percentage of customers'' were demanding the same price. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers ``are not really pleased with the decision but for the  
most part they understand,'' Mandich said. ``We're trying to do the 
best job we can do under the best circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident isn't Apple's first brush with controversial  
selling behavior. Early this year, Apple, in a settlement with the 
Federal Trade Commission, agreed to reimburse customers for a $35 
fee it charged them for a technical support package that it had 
said would be free. And in 1997, Apple settled FTC allegations that 
it overcharged for upgrading some computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Peeler, the FTC's associate director for advertising  
practices, would not comment on whether the FTC was taking a look 
at this week's incident. Mandich of Apple declined to comment on 
legal matters. 
</P>
<P>
	While many customers were upset by Apple's move to raise prices,  
some Apple loyalists were not overly fazed by the turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they charged $300 more, I would have absolutely no problems  
paying that,'' said Sanjay Sakhuja, president of Digital Pre-Press 
International. a printing company based in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	His company ordered 10 G4s prior to Wednesday, and looked  
forward to the speedier performance of the new machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The machines we are replacing with these new machines are 2-3  
years old,'' he added. ``To pay 10 percent or 15 percent more, for 
us it's worth it.''

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Thinks He'll Reform IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch thinks he can  
push through reforms that will satisfy congressional critics 
threatening to impose sanctions against the Olympic body. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am doing my best to make sure these recommendations will be  
approved,'' Samaranch told The Associated Press on Friday. ``I am 
very confident that the most important recommendations will pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch spoke a day after he and the International Olympic  
Committee came under renewed pressure in Washington to stamp out 
the abuses that have tainted the bidding and selection process for 
the host city. 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawmakers expressed skepticism about the IOC's reform  
efforts during a hearing of the House Commerce subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing was called to address the lavish gift-giving and  
other excesses surrounding the successful bids by Atlanta and Salt 
Lake City for the 1996 Summer Olympics and 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to testify at Thursday's hearing. However, he  
has agreed to appear before the House panel on Dec. 15, three days 
after a special IOC session in which the reforms will be put to a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a good hearing,'' Samaranch said by telephone  
from Lausanne, Switzerland. ``The most important thing is that all 
the people are waiting to see what happens in December and whether 
we can present to the world some important changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the hearing, U.S. Olympic Committee President Bill Hybl, a  
member of the IOC's special reform panel, said there is a ``a 
little better than a 50 percent chance'' of all the recommendations 
being adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch thinks the chances are much higher. He expects 40  
reform proposals to be put before the 100-plus IOC members at 
December's session in Lausanne. A two-thirds vote is required for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform commission is meeting at the end of this month to  
complete its recommendations. They include term limits for IOC 
members, an age limit of 70 for new delegates, the appointment of 
15 athletes to the IOC and new restrictions on Olympic bidding. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch reiterated that the IOC has already taken considerable  
steps toward reform in the wake of the Salt Lake City scandal -- 
purging 10 members, setting up reform and ethics commissions, 
opening its financial accounts and banning member visits to cities 
bidding for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of IOC members have expressed resentment at what they  
view as political interference by Congress. Samaranch has said the 
IOC must reform on its own terms and not under pressure from 
critics, but he maintained a diplomatic stance Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like to enter into what the Congress are thinking,''  
he said. ``I have to take care only of the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who chairs the House  
panel, said Congress will push through legislation to punish the 
IOC if the reforms are not enacted in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Waxman, a senior Democrat from California, has  
introduced legislation to cut off American corporate support of the 
Olympics unless the IOC moves to clean up the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced that if the IOC does not adopt those reforms in  
December, the Congress is not going to have the patience any longer 
to leave the IOC to reform itself,'' Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch received endorsements during the hearing from former  
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, an outside member of the IOC 
reform panel, and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, a key figure 
in the city's '96 bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch noted on Friday that 12 cities have expressed interest  
in bidding for the 2008 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is the most important thing,'' he said. ``The games are  
still very important, maybe the most important sporting event in 
the world.''

<HEADLINE> Relics of Iraqi Queen On Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some experts doubt the authenticity of the  
house in the ancient ruined city of Ur, sometimes called the 
birthplace of the patriarch Abraham, that Pope John Paul II wants 
to see next year on a pilgrimage to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's not much question about little Queen Puabi, who died  
there some 600 years before Abraham's time. Her great gold 
headdress goes on view Sunday at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of 
the Smithsonian Institution. The spray of seven gold flowers on the 
comb in the headdress must have added almost a foot to her height, 
which was just under five feet. 
</P>
<P>
	A personal seal with her name and title were found near her  
remains, along with those of 21 attendants -- including 10 women 
with musical instruments -- who were killed or who killed themselves 
to accompany her. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the sound of my sacred song they are ready to die,'' said a  
hymn of the period composed by a high priestess of Nanna, the chief 
god of Ur. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the tradition about Abraham and the story of Queen Puabi  
owe much to one British archaeologist, C. Leonard Woolley, who 
worked the site for 13 years through 1934. Little has been explored 
since then at Ur, one of antiquity's great cities, which draws just 
about 30 tourists a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``While he was speaking I felt in my mind no doubt whatever that  
the house on the corner had been Abraham's,'' mystery novelist 
Agatha Christie wrote in her autobiography. ``It was his 
reconstruction of the past and he believed in it, and anyone who 
listened to him believed in it also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She married one of Woolley's assistants.  
</P>
<P>
	Woolley maintained that Abram -- Abraham's name before he  
emigrated from what is now Iraq to what is now Israel -- came from 
the city he was excavating. 
</P>
<P>
	Erle Leichty is professor of Assyriology at the University of  
Pennsylvania, where the museum owns the treasures of the present 
show. He doubts that Woolley ever found a clay tablet engraved 
``Abram,'' as is widely believed, and thinks Abraham originated in 
a different city -- there were several called Ur. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say that even such a tablet would have little meaning.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is not enough proof,'' said Behnan Abu al-Soof, Iraq's  
leading archaeologist. ``Abram was a common name in the context of 
the Near East in those days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley found Puabi's tomb, considered one of archaeology's  
greatest triumphs, rivaling the discovery of King Tutankhamen's in 
Egypt. Unlike many royal tombs, neither had been plundered and both 
contained a wealth of jewels, gold, vessels, statuary and musical 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Pope John Paul II wants to include Ur on a pilgrimage he is  
planning for next year. That has raised doubts of another kind 
among diplomats in Washington and London. They fear a papal visit 
would strengthen Saddam Hussein, whose government has been pleased 
by the pope's criticism of sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made clear to the Vatican our views on Saddam Hussein  
and his regime and its likely efforts to manipulate the pope for 
their political aims,'' said Philip Reeker, a State Department 
spokesman, ``and we hope this view will be taken into account in 
planning for any pilgrimage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabi al-Qeisi, head of Iraq's Antiquities Department, says  
Saddam has allocated $500,000 to spruce up the area. The house is 
now a pile of mud and rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	There are military installations around the area, including one  
of Saddam's biggest air bases. Visitors are sometimes barred from 
climbing the 86-foot ziggurat, the remains of the ancient temple 
tower that is Ur's most prominent feature. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the ziggurat, but like Puabi's tomb, the Sackler Gallery  
is mostly underground, air conditioned and well lighted. Admission 
is free. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	After ``Treasures from the Royal Tombs of Ur'' closes at the  
Sackler Gallery Jan. 17, it travels to the Cleveland Museum of Art, 
Feb. 22-April 23; the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, 
May-September; the Oriental Museum, Chicago, October 2000-January 
2001 and the Detroit Institute of Arts, February-May 2001.

<HEADLINE> Two Close Calls For Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Call it the Curse of the Bambino's Wall.  
</P>
<P>
	Twice, the Boston Red Sox hit long drives to right field that  
looked like they might be home runs. Twice, the balls hit the very 
top of the fence and bounced back into play. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than solo home runs, Jason Varitek and Troy O'Leary both  
wound up stranded on third base Thursday night in Boston's 3-2 loss 
to the New York Yankees in Game 2 of the AL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a big break for us,'' Yankees right fielder Paul  
O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill patrols the same position that Babe Ruth once played on  
the same Yankee Stadium field. If the Red Sox, now trailing 2-0 in 
the best-of-7 series, didn't believe in the Ruthian jinx, surely 
they do now. 
</P>
<P>
	It was as if Ruth, whose sale from the Red Sox to the Yankees  
after the 1919 season seemingly sent Boston into an eight-decade 
slide without a World Series title, reached out and swatted away 
the two potential home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Told that it appeared the two balls missed going out by less  
than a foot combined, Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said, ``That's 
about right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Varitek's ball went up in the air and one that  
O'Leary hit was close, too,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was scoreless in the second inning when Varitek hit a drive  
over O'Neill's outstretched glove. O'Neill looked up in the stands, 
thinking the ball was gone, before seeing it on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Varitek got a triple, but David Cone retired the next two  
batters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox trailed 3-2 in the eighth when O'Leary led off with  
a drive that also barely missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sure that was a home run,'' Cone said. ``But when it hit  
the wall, I thought we had a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few more inches, and the Red Sox might be heading back to  
Fenway Park with a 1-1 split. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think on not so cool a night, those balls are home runs,''  
Varitek said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MARIANO THE MAGNIFICENT:* Nearly three months ago, Mariano  
Rivera allowed a run. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's been all zeros after that.  
</P>
<P>
	Since that game against Tampa Bay on July 21, the Yankees closer  
has pitched 36 2-3 innings in 32 games without letting an opponent 
cross the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera worked around two hits to pitch a scoreless ninth  
Thursday night, getting a save in the Yankees' 3-2 victory. He 
struck out Damon Buford with runners on first and third to end it. 
</P>
<P>
	``To tell you the truth, nothing is going through my mind,''  
Rivera said. ``I've got to get an out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't worry in that situation,'' he said. ``If you worry,  
you'll lose the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Buford: ``He's a great pitcher and a great closer.''  
</P>
<P>
	The previous night, he pitched two shutout innings and earned  
the victory in a 4-3, 10-inning win in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera has pitched six scoreless innings during the playoffs  
against Texas and Boston. Overall, he has allowed only two earned 
runs in 41 innings in postseason play -- that's an 0.44 ERA, the 
best in major league history among pitchers with at least 30 
innings in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a number of successful closers who have pitched for  
me'' including John Wetteland, Lee Smith and Tom Henke, New York 
manager Joe Torre said. ``He has been consistent as any closer I've 
ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not seen anything like it and hope I continue to say  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre was concerned about his other relievers who have gotten  
little work in the playoffs because of the success of the starters. 
In the first four games, Orlando Hernandez went eight innings 
twice, Andy Pettitte pitched 7 1-3 innings and Roger Clemens went 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Ramiro Mendoza, Mike Stanton, Hideki Irabu and  
Allen Watson didn't pitch in the three-game sweep over Texas or in 
Game 1 against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a problem because you don't know how sharp they're  
going to be,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HUSH UP:* The up close sounds of the game turned into the  
sounds of silence for Boston Red Sox manager Jimy Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was wired for sound by Fox Television during Wednesday  
night's first game of the AL championship series, won by the New 
York Yankees 4-3 in 10 innings. He said he wouldn't do it again 
after a discussion on strategy was broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do it anymore,'' Williams said before Thursday night's  
second game. ``I just don't feel right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he understands the value of bringing baseball closer to  
fans by broadcasting discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just trying to put people who have never been in the  
dugout, will never be in a dugout, give them an opportunity to see 
maybe what happens a little bit,'' he said. ``I have a respect for 
them for that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't necessarily like to do that and I won't do that  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Rivera entered Game 1 to start the ninth inning, Williams  
asked coach Dave Jauss the prospects of stealing a base on the 
reliever. The agreement with Fox, he said, precludes broadcasting 
conversations about strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Weisman, Fox's executive producer for baseball, said  
Williams and Jauss discussed that strategy if leadoff hitter Jason 
Varitek reached base. After Varitek grounded out, the conversation 
was broadcast, Weisman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know when they played it,'' Williams said. ``I wasn't  
watching TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I spoke to Jimy about it and he has no problem,'' Weisman  
said. ``The information about Rivera's move to the plate, anybody 
in the stands can time it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Williams had an on-off switch ``and, believe me, he  
turned it off throughout the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, it seems, until further notice.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AROUND THE BASES:* New York's Game 3 pitcher Roger Clemens left  
for Boston before Game 2. He's scheduled to pitch Saturday at 
Fenway Park against Pedro Martinez. ... The National Anthem for 
Game 4 will be sung by Lynn Saberhagen. Her husband, Bret 
Saberhagen, is scheduled to start that game for Boston. ... Yankees 
second baseman Chuck Knoblauch was back in the starting lineup for 
Game 2 after X-rays on his right foot were negative. He fouled a 
ball of his foot in the ninth inning of the opener.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Floods Streets of Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Hurricane Irene unloaded up to 16 inches of rain on  
Florida, flooding the streets of Miami, stalling cars and knocking 
out power Friday to hundreds of thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
	With winds of 80 mph, Irene was a relatively weak hurricane, but  
its heavy rain and sluggish pace made it a menace. And forecasters 
warned it was on a path that could bring more misery to 
flood-ravaged North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered flooding was reported in a 200-mile area from Key West  
to West Palm Beach. In Miami, police listed at least 65 streets, 
including major intersections, with floodwaters at least 6 inches 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas urged employers to let  
workers go home early to ease traffic. ``It's like a permanent high 
tide,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The floodwaters left cars stalled in the streets and thwarted  
drivers' attempts to get home. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael LaCombe, 21, was trying to drive from his job in Miami  
to his home 12 miles north in Aventura when his car conked out. 
``This is ridiculous,'' a soaked LaCombe said after pushing his car 
out of shin-deep water. ``I should have called in sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm moved through the Florida Keys and rolled ashore  
Friday afternoon near Cape Sable, 75 miles southwest of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 p.m., it was over the Everglades, about 60 miles southwest  
of West Palm Beach, moving north-northeast around 13 mph. It was 
expected to maintain that motion before leaving the state on the 
state's east coast near Cape Canaveral sometime Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before striking Florida, Irene drenched Cuba's tobacco fields  
and collapsed buildings in Havana, where at least two people were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, 800,000 people lost power with no hope of getting it  
restored until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Hurricane Center in Miami had to switch over to  
backup generators when the power went out for about 30 seconds and 
blacked out computer screens. It took about 90 minutes to reboot 
all the computers, during which forecasters were able to get the 
data they needed from Kansas City, Mo., and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Area airports remained open, but Miami International Airport  
shut down at 6 p.m. Most airlines suspended service to South 
Florida until at least Saturday. The University of Miami closed its 
campus. High school football games were postponed, as were two 
$400,000 thoroughbred races scheduled for Saturday at Calder Race 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Clevelander Hotel on trendy South Beach, only four of 58  
rooms were occupied. ``It's just nasty, windy and awful,'' manager 
Chris Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton declared a state of emergency in 28 counties  
from Key West to central Florida, making federal money available 
for cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said they expected Irene to push into the Atlantic  
Ocean and then head inland again near the Georgia-South Carolina 
line. Heavy rain was a possibility across North Carolina, still 
recovering from Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly it's too early to panic,'' said Tom Hegele of the  
North Carolina emergency management agency. ``If we need to change 
our focus from recovery to preparation and response for another 
event, that's what we'll do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd dumped 20 inches of rain on eastern North  
Carolina last month, killing at least 49 people and causing 
billions in damage in the state's costliest natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The eye of the hurricane passed near Key West, where the  
floodwaters in the streets didn't stop the beer from flowing. At 
Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville Cafe, loud cheers erupted when the 
lights came back on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get busier when the power goes out,'' bartender Doug Gober  
said. ``There's nothing to do but drink.''

<HEADLINE> 3M Buying Out Dyneon Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAPLEWOOD, Minn. (AP) -- 3M Co. announced plans to pay Hoechst AG  
$300 million for its share in the companies' Oakdale-based Dyneon 
joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Thursday and expected to close by the end of  
the year, calls for the transfer of Hoechst's 46 percent of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Formed by 3M and Hoechst in August 1996, Dyneon is a leader in  
the production of special plastics used as coatings in automotive, 
aerospace and electronics markets. It had 1998 sales of about $350 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	No jobs are expected to be lost or gained from the move. Dyneon  
employs 120 people in Minnesota and 700 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	3M had 1998 sales of $15 billion. The German company Hoechst had  
sales last year of nearly $25 billion.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- An obscenity barrier has been broken on network  
television, with the use of an epithet for excrement on CBS's 
``Chicago Hope.''

<P>
	Actor Mark Harmon, playing Dr. Jack McNeil on the medical drama,

	Neither a CBS spokesman nor Henry Bromell, executive producer of  
the series, could remember a time when censors had allowed the word 
to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nothing I haven't tried a couple of times before, except  
this time, I won,'' Bromell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since producers felt strongly that the word was important for  
artistic truthfulness, CBS chose to support them, spokesman Chris 
Ender said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly this is not something happening on a weekly basis,''  
he said. ``This is an isolated incident. It's not a sign or a 
signal that CBS is loosening its standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS took special steps to respond to any of its more than 200  
affiliates who may have been concerned about offending viewers, he 
said. The network planned to feed the video to affiliates Thursday 
afternoon, instead of live Thursday night, to give the local 
stations the option of masking the word. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of stations expressed concern upon hearing about the  
expletive, Ender said.

<HEADLINE> Smoltz Shows He Can Do It All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Smoltz has already been though enough  
changes this season. For now, let's hold off on a switch to the 
Atlanta Braves' bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz, who always thought he would make a pretty good closer,  
gave a tantalizing glimpse of his potential in Game 2 of the NL 
championship series. Making the first relief appearance of his 
major league career, he blew away the New York Mets in the ninth 
inning to preserve a 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	But the winningest pitcher in postseason history will be back in  
his familiar role Saturday, starting for the Braves in Game 4 at 
Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would make a great closer,'' manager Bobby Cox said ``But  
in my mind, he's one of the greatest starters that ever teed it up 
out there, too. I'd rather have John, if he's healthy, be a starter 
and go out there 33, 34 times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the playoffs, there's hardly any pitcher the Braves would  
prefer to have on the mound than Smoltz, who has a career record of 
12-3 and thrives on the idea of pitching in high-pressure games. 
</P>
<P>
	But this has been a trying season for the 32-year-old  
right-hander, whose tender elbow -- twice surgically repaired -- 
caused him to doubt just how many pitches he had left. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz went on the disabled list two times and seemed to shake  
the persistent pain only when he altered his pitching motion, 
throwing with more of a three-quarters delivery rather than 
straight over the top. He also experimented with new pitches, 
actually dabbling with a knuckleball that puts less pressure on his 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Smoltz is always up to the challenge,'' Chipper Jones  
said. ``It doesn't matter whether it's opening day or Game 7 of the 
World Series. Starting or relieving, it doesn't matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox was thinking along the same lines when he sent Smoltz to the  
bullpen for Game 2. After Rocker escaped an eighth-inning jam by 
striking out John Olerud and Robin Ventura, Smoltz jogged in to 
pitch a perfect ninth, getting Bobby Bonilla on a called third 
strike to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just knew what John could do,'' Cox said. ``And what a spot  
to come in, with that type of pressure. He's very able to do those 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four or five years ago, when the Braves were struggling to find  
a closer to follow their magnificent starting rotation, Smoltz 
volunteered to move to the bullpen. Cox rejected the offer and was 
glad he did when Smoltz won the Cy Young in 1996 with a 24-8 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning only 11 games this season, Smoltz knew he might  
start only once in any given series. So he brought up the bullpen 
idea again. 
</P>
<P>
	``After we clinched the (NL East) division, John came in and  
said he would do anything I wanted him to do,'' Cox recalled. ``He 
didn't know if he was going to be the No. 3 (starter) or 4 man. He 
said he would start and pitch two games. Or he would relieve in 
every ball game if I wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz explained his offer like this: ``When you pitch for this  
team, your ego has to disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few other top starters have carved highly successful careers  
in the bullpen, notably Dennis Eckersley, Rick Aguilera and Dave 
Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
	After nine seasons with double-figure wins, the Eck became a  
closer in 1987 and went on to record 390 saves, the third-highest 
total in major league history. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera was a solid starter for his first five seasons, but has  
spent nine of the last 10 years working out of the bullpen. He has 
289 saves, putting him 12th on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	Righetti pitched a no-hitter for the New York Yankees in 1983,  
switched the bullpen the following year and finished his career 
with 252 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of great starters became great closers,'' Cox said.  
``John could certainly do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not likely to happen anytime soon. The Braves already have  
Rocker, who has been downright dominating in the postseason, and 
former closer Kerry Ligtenberg could return in 2000 after missing 
this season with an elbow injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz, who made 380 career starts before his first relief  
appearance, is back in a starting frame of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've still got a job to do,'' Smoltz said. ``That's pitch Game  
4. Whatever I did the game before will be erased if they beat me in 
Game 4.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Told of U.S. Torture Instances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration informed a U.N.  
committee today there are instances of torture in the United 
States. ``Abuses occur despite the best precautions and the 
strictest prohibitions,'' said the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas of concern include instances of police abuse, excessive  
use of force, brutality and death of prisoners in custody, said the 
report to the U.N. Committee Against Torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are overcrowding in prisons, physical and sexual abuse of  
inmates and lack of adequate training and oversight for police and 
prison guards, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``No government can claim a perfect record,'' it said.  
</P>
<P>
	But, Assistant Secretary of State Harold Koh said, ``torture  
does not occur in the United States except in aberrational 
situations and never as a matter of policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The beating of motorist Rodney King by four Los Angeles police  
officers in 1991 and the harsh treatment recently of Abner Louima, 
a Haitian immigrant, by New York City police officers were among 
the incidents cited. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, concerns were raised about the excessive use of force by  
federal agents at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and in Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report, prepared principally by the State and Justice  
departments, assured the U.N. committee that torture is a criminal 
offense, perpetrators are prosecuted and victims are entitled to 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the federal government may take civil action against  
police misconduct under a 1994 law. As a result, the Justice 
Department's civil rights division filed lawsuits against the 
Philadelphia and Steubenville, Ohio, police departments. 
</P>
<P>
	This led to consent decrees requiring reforms in the  
supervising, training and disciplining of police officers, as well 
as in investigating complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was the first by the United States to the U.N.  
committee under an international convention against torture, which 
was ratified in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, meanwhile, has contributed more than $12.6  
million to the U.N. Fund for the Victims of Torture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every unit of government at every level within the United  
States is committed, by law as well as by policy, to the protection 
of the individual's life, liberty and physical integrity,'' the 
report said.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Killers' Parents To Sue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The parents of Columbine gunman Dylan Klebold  
alleged Friday that Jefferson County authorities are partly 
responsible for the school shooting rampage that left 15 people 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney representing Thomas and Susan Klebold served notice  
of their intent to sue Sheriff John Stone and two other sheriff's 
officials for negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	Families of 13 victims also have filed notices of plans to sue  
the county and the school district in the wake of the April 20 
rampage at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the lawyers who have filed these notices review the  
cases and realize that there is no legal liability on behalf of the 
county, sheriff or any other county employees that have been 
named,'' said Bill Tuthill, an assistant Jefferson County attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The Klebolds allege authorities failed to inform them about the  
potentially violent tendencies of the other Columbine gunman, Eric 
Harris, 18, and his relationship with their 17-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies were notified of certain actions taken by  
Harris, including threats made by the teen. Likewise, a Web site 
allegedly authored by Harris was brought to the attention of 
sheriff's officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Klebolds said if they had been notified of the  
investigators' findings, they probably would have demanded that 
their son ``be excluded from all contacts with Eric Harris.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The failure ``was so reckless, willful and wanton as to have  
caused the Klebolds to be subject to substantial damage claims, 
vilification, grief and loss of enjoyment of life,'' the notice 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold and Harris hurled bombs and scattered gunfire throughout  
Columbine, killing 12 students and a teacher before they committed 
suicide in the worst school shooting in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine families had 180 days to file notices of plans to sue.  
The deadline is Sunday, but court and school offices will be 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not suits. These are notices that are required as a  
prerequisite if one decides to file a suit,'' said Tuthill, who 
added that he was surprised the Klebolds submitted a notice. 
</P>
<P>
	In the notice, the Klebolds said they submitted the filing  
because they have been sued by the parents of slain student Isaiah 
Shoels, and believe that other victims' families may file claims 
against them.

<HEADLINE> Raptors' Brown Has Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Raptors guard Dee Brown, who led the NBA  
in 3-pointers last season, underwent arthroscopic surgery on his 
left knee Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he could be sidelined for as long as two months or as  
little as two weeks, depending on how rehab goes. He had the 
surgery to repair scar tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to push back the surgery for as long as I could, but I  
needed to get it done because it was affecting my game,'' Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who made 135 3-pointers last season, used medication last  
season to alleviate the pain. He averaged 11.2 points per game and 
shot 38.7 percent on 3s. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the injury, the Raptors won't be without a 3-point  
threat as they signed Dell Curry in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry shot a league-best 47.6 percent from beyond the 3-point  
line last season with the Milwaukee Bucks.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Payroll Beats Them All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As he runs for president, Al Gore has no  
shortage of people offering advice. He pays more for staff than any 
other candidate, an analysis of his latest campaign spending report 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's huge political machine has eaten up about a fourth of the  
money he'll be allowed to spend until next summer's national 
convention -- and the first delegates won't be picked for another 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Gore has spent as much on salaries -- $2.2 million --  
as Texas Gov. George W. Bush has spent to run his campaign 
headquarters, including rent, office equipment and taxes in 
addition to payroll. Gore's Democratic opponent, Bill Bradley, 
spent $1.5 million on salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to cut back his overhead,'' said Candice Nelson, an  
associate professor of political science at American University. 
``In any campaign, a candidate wants to spend the bulk of his money 
talking to voters and not on salaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has spent $14.6 million and had $10.3 million in the bank  
through Sept. 30. He raised $24.9 million, but $534,293 came from 
his general election fund for legal and accounting expenses to pay 
a share of fund-raising costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has raised less than Gore, $19.2 million. But he has  
spent less as well, $8.5 million, giving him a larger bank account 
-- $10.7 million. Gore, for example, has spent twice as much on 
polling, $387,844 to $173,189. 
</P>
<P>
	And between July 1 and Sept. 30, Bradley took in $7.3 million  
worth of contributions to $6.8 million for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates are accepting federal matching funds for their  
campaigns, which limits the amount of money they can spend to 
around $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, on the other hand, continues to set fund-raising records.  
He raised $20.2 million during the last three months, bringing his 
total to $57.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent $12.8 million over the period, more than doubling his  
campaign expenditures. Overall, Bush now has spent $19 million, 
including $7.1 million on fund raising and $2.9 million on travel. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still has $37.7 million in the bank. And since he is not  
taking federal funds, he can raise and spend as much as he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have to watch his money,'' Nelson said. ``He can  
spend as much as he needs to. Even doing that, he will have enough 
left over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush even has spent more money than Steve Forbes, who has pumped  
$16.3 million into his own campaign and raised another $4.5 
million. He spent almost $19 million, including $4 million on 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col said much of the money has  
gone to build campaign operations in 10 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to have grassroots organization,'' Dal Col said.  
``We're the only campaign that's organized in all the early 
states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, meanwhile, has moved his campaign headquarters from  
Washington, D.C., to Nashville, Tenn., a move seen as a way to cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without the move, spokeswoman Kiki Moore noted that the  
campaign's spending has leveled off; the vice president spent $6 
million between April 1 and June 30. Bradley, on the other hand, 
boosted his campaign spending from $2.8 million between April and 
June . 
</P>
<P>
	``Our investments have been made and our campaign is up and  
operational in key states around the country,'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the Gore campaign doesn't expect to run out of money.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is great belief and commitment that we will have the  
financial resources and the appropriate budget management for Al 
Gore to win the nomination and be a well-prepared general election 
candidate who wins the presidency,'' Moore said.

<HEADLINE> Retired Navy Chief Has Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., the retired Navy admiral  
who commanded American naval forces in the Vietnam War and later 
became the Navy's top officer, was in critical condition Friday at 
Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., after undergoing 
cancer surgery, a friend said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zumwalt, 78, was discovered on Sept. 24 to have a cancerous  
tumor in his chest cavity. He underwent eight hours of surgery on 
Wednesday at Duke and is in the intensive care unit there, retired 
Rear Adm. Bill Thompson said in a telephone interview. One of 
Zumwalt's lungs was removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson is a longtime friend of Zumwalt, who is a native of  
Tulare, Calif., and was the Navy chief of operations from 1970 to 
1974 while Thompson headed the Navy information office at the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said doctors at Duke told him they are guardedly  
optimistic that Zumwalt will recover. Zumwalt's cancer is commonly 
associated with exposure to asbestos, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He continues his good spirits and humor,'' Thompson said,  
adding that President Clinton had called Zumwalt and that former 
President Bush had sent him a letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Zumwalt, who headed American naval forces in Vietnam in 1968-69,  
is a renowned figure in the Navy and has remained active in a 
variety of pursuits since his retirement from the military. Last 
year, Clinton presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, 
the nation's highest civilian award, in part for his work on behalf 
of a foundation that seeks bone marrow donors for cancer victims. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Zumwalt's sons, Elmo R. Zumwalt III, died of cancer  
apparently linked to his exposure during the Vietnam War to the 
herbicide Agent Orange.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Urges Calm Y2K Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threats of massive computer failures from  
the Year 2000 date change have been eliminated but the economy 
could still be buffeted if businesses and consumers alter their 
spending patterns because of unwarranted fears, Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said that massive amounts of preparation in getting  
computers ready for the date change have left him confident that 
when Jan. 1, 2000 rolls around, American businesses will be ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``The probability of a cascading of computer failures in mission  
critical systems is now negligible,'' Greenspan said in remarks to 
the National Italian American Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that he was still concerned about potential economic  
impacts if businesses and consumers alter their buying patterns in 
significant ways. 
</P>
<P>
	For this reason, Greenspan said it was important for authorities  
to get out the most up-to-date reliable information so that 
business and consumers can make their economic judgments based on 
facts and not rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accurate, credible and timely information on the general state  
of readiness will be essential to reducing uncertainties in the 
months ahead,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In that way, businesses will be able to base their decisions on  
inventory stockpiling on accurate information and not overstock out 
of unfounded fears. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan in previous speeches has voiced concerns about  
production bottlenecks leading to inflation pressures if a large 
number of businesses feel the need to have sizable inventories on 
hand at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that consumer reactions will also be critical to  
determining whether the computer change will have a major impact on 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The potentially most important piece of the Y2k puzzle for the  
rest of the year is the uncertain response of the American consumer 
as year-end approaches,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only a ``small number of households, driven by fear of  
the unknown, tell pollsters that they are planning to build large 
stockpiles of food, water, fuel and cash as the millennium 
approaches,'' Greenspan said. But he expressed concern about a 
rising level of consumer worries as the news media focuses more 
attention on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is too compelling a story for audiences that thrive on  
countdowns to the unknown,'' Greenspan said. ``As attention 
heightens and rumors inevitably mushroom, it is important that what 
is known and what is not known be clearly articulated by those of 
us in both public and private leadership positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said in the final analysis, ``facts are the only  
antidote for rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said if the authorities dealing with the computer switchover  
do their job properly, the economy will be able to make the 
transition smoothly with a minimum amount of economic disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we avoid fear-induced, significant economic responses in  
the months ahead, the century date change will hopefully replicate 
the saga of the 'dog that did not bark,' '' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan in his prepared remarks made no specific mention about  
how the economy is performing at present or the sizable 1.1 percent 
jump in wholesale prices that had been reported earlier in the day.

<HEADLINE> Disney's Imagineering Head Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kenneth Wong, head of Walt Disney's famous  
Imagineering division, is leaving the company to pursue 
``independent'' opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale-based Walt Disney Imagineering is, among other things,  
the arm of the Walt Disney Co. that creates all Disney resorts, 
theme parks and real estate developments. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to pursue his personal interests, and we at Disney  
wish him well,'' Paul Pressler, president of Walt Disney 
Attractions, said in a statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time is right for me to explore independent, creative  
endeavors,'' Wong said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Wong joined Disney in 1991 as senior vice-president for Disney  
Development Company and became head of Imagineering when the 
divisions merged in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He will remain available as an advisor, Disney said.  
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Sotto, one of Imagineering's top designers, and Jake  
Winebaum, head of Disney's Internet operations, recently left the 
company for Internet ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Wong, 44, told the Los Angeles Times that he also is interested  
in the Internet, in combination with ``art, design, technology and 
real estate'' but declined to be specific. He also said he is 
leaving on friendly terms with Pressler. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Wong, the ``Imagineers'' developed Animal Kingdom,  
DisneyQuest, The New Amsterdam Theatre, Times Square Studios, and 
two Disney cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, however, Wong scolded the division for embarrassing  
delays in three high-profile projects. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to 2,000 employees, Wong said the division set  
unrealistic schedules because it underestimated the risk of 
problems with the Disney Magic cruise ship, Disneyland's Rocket 
Rods and the Test Track thrill ride at Florida's Walt Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney also announced several other personnel moves Thursday.

<HEADLINE> NFL Fines Broncos $25,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The NFL announced Friday it has fined the Denver  
Broncos $25,000 for failing to make a ``timely and full 
disclosure'' last week of the hip injury quarterback Bubby Brister 
suffered in practice two days before last Sunday's game against the 
Oakland Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred Oct. 9 after the Broncos submitted their  
official personnel reports on Wednesday and Thursday. The team was 
obliged under NFL policy to announce it as soon as possible to the 
media as well as the league and the Raiders, the NFL said in a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of notifying the media on Friday or Saturday, the  
Broncos ``simply left messages for the league office and the 
Raiders on Saturday about Brister's injury,'' the league quoted NFL 
executive vice president Jeffrey Pash, who imposed the fine, as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL said its policy directs clubs to pay particular  
attention to key players such as quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos spokesman Jim Saccomano said the team would appeal the  
fine and declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Brister didn't play against Oakland, and Broncos coach Mike  
Shanahan said Friday that he would be unable to play Sunday against 
the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, the NFL fined the Broncos $15,000 for not  
disclosing a rib injury that limited starting quarterback John 
Elway to five plays off the bench in a game against the San Diego 
Chargers. Elway had practiced all week but did not come out of the 
locker room for kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan did not appeal that fine, and the day after it was  
issued the Broncos released an injury report that listed 22 players 
-- almost half the roster.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Drop to 5-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Banks led the slide Friday as European stocks  
closed at a five-month low. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, Lloyds TSB was one of the worst blue-chip performers,  
followed by NatWest Bank. In Frankfurt, shares in both Deutsche 
Bank and Dresdner Bank fell and in Paris, BNP and Societe Generale 
also declined. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts blamed stronger-than-expected U.S. producer price data,  
which resulted in an opening drop of 240 points in the Dow Jones 
industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	European stocks were also affected by remarks from Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan Thursday that U.S. stocks might be 
overvalued. U.S. banks were hard hit, with the Fed expected to 
raise interest rates at its November meeting. The European Central 
Bank is expected to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Other European decliners included BP Amoco and other oil stocks,  
following fresh decreases in crude prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 614 European companies fell 5.30  
points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 298.48. The Dow Jones Euro 
Stoxx Index -- which includes 310 companies in countries that joined 
the single currency -- closed 4.54 points lower at 314.86. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 56.95 points to 3638.82,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 72.50 points at 3592.55. 
</P>
<P>
	In European markets, the worst performers were Zurich, with the  
SMI index losing 2.4 percent, and London with a drop of 132.1 
points, or 2.2 percent, to 5,907.3 in the blue-chip Financial 
Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share index. 
</P>
<P>
	The plunge in the FTSE 100-Share index was its steepest in  
percentage terms since Sept. 3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The German market was buoyed by auto stocks, and Frankfurt's  
Xetra DAX index closed with a loss of 0.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, the Paris CAC-40 index fell 1.3 percent;  
Milan's MIBtel index fell 1.7 percent; and Amsterdam's AEX Index 
closed down 1.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predicted further losses as concern about the outlook  
for global interest rates persists. Highly valued technology stocks 
are expected to be knocked back, and cyclicals, which had begun to 
recover earlier in the year, may relapse as investors fear declines 
in the global economy.

<HEADLINE> Boeing May Face a Revamped Airbus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- For years, Boeing executives have groused that  
arch-competitor Airbus Industrie has had an unfair advantage 
because it doesn't have to answer to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Be careful what you wish for.  
</P>
<P>
	A merger of European aerospace companies has raised the odds  
that Airbus will be transformed into a publicly traded company, 
giving Boeing the even playing field it says it has always sought. 
But analysts warn it could also get an even fiercer competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's either good news or bad news,'' said Richard Aboulafia,  
aerospace analyst with The Teal Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Good news for Boeing, he said, if Airbus is subject to the same  
pressures from stockholders as Boeing: having to detail and justify 
business decisions and make its owners money. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad news, if Airbus is a lean, nimble company supporting its  
already strong product line. 
</P>
<P>
	With great fanfare and the blessings of the French and German  
heads of state, the German aerospace unit of DaimlerChrysler and 
France's Aerospatiale Matra announced Thursday they plan to merge 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The new entity, to be called the European Aeronautic, Defense  
and Space Co., or EADS, would control up to 80 percent of Airbus, a 
four-nation European consortium. The remaining 20 percent is held 
by British Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
	EADS would be 60 percent owned by DaimlerChrysler, the French  
Lagardere Group and the French government. The remaining 40 percent 
would be sold on the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	The move improves the chances for transforming Airbus, the No. 2  
commercial jet maker behind Boeing, into its own corporate entity, 
though talks on revamping Airbus have recently bogged down. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus already is a tough competitor. It has outpaced Boeing in  
new aircraft orders so far this year, with 358 to Boeing's 166. 
Boeing, however, had delivered 455 airplanes as of Sept. 30, 
compared with 211 for Airbus. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger announcement came minutes before Boeing released its  
third-quarter financial results showing a healthy 37 percent rise 
in profits. In a teleconference, Phil Condit, Boeing's chairman and 
chief executive officer, said the change would have little 
immediate effect, and repeated the company line. 
</P>
<P>
	``As they move to a truly commercial basis, I think that's  
good,'' Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit cited an order by Denver-based Frontier Airlines for some  
20 new jets that Boeing lost because it would not match the lower 
prices Airbus offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been very careful to say we're in this business to  
make money, and if (pricing) gets too intense, we don't go there. 
That's what happened at Frontier,'' Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus and Frontier officials declined to comment on the pending  
order. 
</P>
<P>
	The pricing argument can cut both ways. Airbus complained this  
summer when Boeing, to get Singapore Airlines to order new 777s, 
agreed to buy 17 Airbus A340 jetliners from Singapore and resell 
them. Boeing claims the deal was profitable -- some analysts have 
doubts -- but it was a strategic coup, placing Boeing jets with a 
key Asian carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has long argued that European government subsidies to  
Airbus give it an unfair advantage. Europeans counter that Boeing 
uses U.S. defense contracts to develop commercial airplane 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	When Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas two years ago, Airbus  
and its supporters howled that the U.S. government was allowing the 
creation of a colossus that would stifle global competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing would welcome ``a normal corporate entity'' as a  
competitor, said Paul Nisbet, analyst with JSA Research Inc., 
``rather than having to do battle with the European governments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With shareholders, Airbus ``will have to generate a reasonable  
return on investment, which they are not doing now, and is not part 
of their thinking right now,'' said Robert Toomey, analyst with 
Dain Rauscher-PCG in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus ``is not acting rationally because it is subsidized by  
government,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit knows from experience that he has to please shareholders.  
Boeing was pummeled in 1997 by production foul-ups, delayed 
aircraft deliveries and the Asian financial crisis. The company 
lost billions of dollars, its stock sank and many stockholders 
screamed for Condit's head. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Boeing emphasizes profits, efficiency, cost-cutting  
and axing programs that don't pull their weight -- moves that Wall 
Street has rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
	If Airbus does likewise, Aboulafia and others say it would be an  
even more formidable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	A well-run corporation would greatly increase Airbus' ability to  
raise money for new projects. EADS itself, if done right, ``gives 
an excellent shell within which to shuffle assets and create 
efficient organizations to address market needs,'' Aboulafia said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the transformation leads to a privatized Airbus and a race to  
cut costs, a casualty might be Airbus' long-planned A3XX, a 
600-passenger ``superjumbo'' jet. 
</P>
<P>
	With shareholders in the picture, ``If you're going to launch a  
huge new project ... you had better be able to prove that you're 
going to provide an excellent return on investment,'' Aboulafia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it very difficult for Airbus to go ahead with  
ego-driven projects.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 168.44; Nasdaq Down 52.99 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled today, nearly sending the Dow  
Jones industrial average below 10,000, amid news of a spurt in 
inflation and a warning by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
against excessive optimism by investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow was off 168.44 at  
10,118.18. An early 241-point plunge pushed the Dow to the lowest 
level since April and about 1,200 points below the Aug. 25 closing 
record of 11,326.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also bounced from their morning lows,  
but continued to hold sharp losses for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index was down 52.99  
at 2,753.85 after halving an early 102-point plunge. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500-stock index was down 22.09 at 1,261.33. 
</P>
<P>
	The selloff followed a morning report that revealed prices at  
the wholesale level spiked 1.1 percent in September, the largest 
increase in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the Producer Price Index, which measures  
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was much worse 
than expected. Many analysts were anticipating that prices would 
rise 0.5 percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in a speech to bankers Thursday night, Greenspan  
issued his latest call for investor sobriety at a time of robust 
economic expansion and roaring stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Both developments aggravated market fears that the Federal  
Reserve will raise interest rates for the third time this year in a 
bid to fight inflation by slowing the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	This afternoon, in a prepared speech on the Year 2000 date  
change, Greenspan made no mention of today's inflation report or 
the overall financial backdrop. Fed policy makers hold their next 
meeting Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, which could see demand for loans hurt by  
rising interest rates, led today's decline. Among the Dow's 30 
components, American Express was down 5 15/16 at 136 1/16, and J.P. 
Morgan was down 3 3/4 at 107 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the day's downward trend, Sun Microsystems surged 5  
11/32 to 94 3/4 in active Nasdaq trading after the maker of powerful 
business computers posted better than expected profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumber advancers by more than a 3-to-1  
margin overall. Trading slowed from the morning's hectic pace, with 
586.03 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock 
Exchange, down from 608.94 million at the same point on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 5.00 at  
414.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas markets also took a big hit today. In Europe, Britain's  
FT-SE 100 fell 2.2 percent, Germany's DAX index fell 0.7 percent 
percent and France's CAC-40 fell 1.3 percent. Japan's Nikkei stock 
average fell 1.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Canucks' Snow Fractures Finger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Garth Snow, the Vancouver  
Canucks' top goaltender, is out indefinitely with a fractured index 
finger on his blocking hand, the team announced prior to Friday's 
game against the Carolina Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow was injured during Wednesday's 4-3 overtime loss to the  
Calgary Flames. Snow finished the game, stopping 22 shots. It was 
only his second appearance of the season after missing the first 
two games with a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup goalie Kevin Weekes started against the Hurricanes, while  
the Canucks called up Alfie Michaud from their American Hockey 
League affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch. Michaud, last spring's Final 
Four MVP after leading Maine to the NCAA championship, has a 1-2 
record and 2.36 goals-against average with the Crunch.

<HEADLINE> W.Va. Board May Lift Creationism Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- A county school board is considering a  
proposal to lift a ban on teaching the biblical story of creation, 
the latest step in a growing national debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal, introduced by Kanawha County board member Betty  
Jarvis, was submitted for comment this week to principals and 
teachers of the 87 schools in the state's largest county. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to present all theories,'' Jarvis told The Charleston  
Gazette. ``Creationism is a theory. A lot of science books deal 
only with evolution. Teachers are afraid to stray from the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarvis did not return telephone calls from The Associated Press.  
The county board will vote on the proposal in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Creationism is the belief that a divine power created the  
universe in six days, while the theory of evolution holds that 
humans evolved from more primitive species. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court ruled more than a decade ago that states  
cannot teach creationism. Since then, some creationists have turned 
to attacking evolution's validity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas State Board of Education sparked a national debate  
two months ago by approving science standards that de-emphasize 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said the Kanawha County proposal was simply a bid to  
bring religion into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The part that really disturbs me is the argument that `this is  
the other theory,''' said Hilary Chiz, director of the West 
Virginia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``Creationism is not a scientific theory. It is a religious idea  
about human development, and this is simply a transparent scheme to 
teach religion in our schools,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Cecil Underwood, a former teacher, said he does not oppose  
teaching creationism in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think education is search for the truth. We need to look at  
all theories to decide what is the truth,'' Underwood said 
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Puts Off Hurricanes' Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- For the second year in a row, a game involving the  
Miami Hurricanes was postponed Friday because of a hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game between No. 24 Miami and Temple was postponed  
until Dec. 4 because Hurricane Irene prevented the Owls from 
arriving for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tremendous disappointment for us not to be able to  
have a home game this weekend,'' Hurricanes athletic director Paul 
Dee said. ``But our first concern is for the safety of our players, 
fans and opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Temple planned to fly from Philadelphia to Miami on Friday  
afternoon, but most airlines suspended service to South Florida 
after Irene hit the area with strong winds and more than 16 inches 
of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Miami's past four home games have been threatened by  
hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's Miami-UCLA was postponed from Sept. 26 to Dec. 5  
because of Hurricanes Georges. Miami won 49-45. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd threatened Miami's showdown last month against  
Penn State, but the game was played as scheduled at the Orange 
Bowl. A week later, the Hurricanes' game against East Carolina was 
moved from Greenville, N.C., to Raleigh because of floodwaters 
resulting from Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's postponement means the Hurricanes (2-3) will delay  
their Big East Conference opener until next Saturday, when they 
travel to Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple (1-5, 1-1 Big East) will play at West Virginia next  
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Ukraine To Step Up Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- An International Monetary Fund official on  
Friday urged Ukraine to step up its sluggish reform efforts after 
the presidential elections this month, a news report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammed Shadman-Valavi met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery  
Pustovoitenko to discuss resuming the fund's $2.6 billion aid 
program for the former Soviet republic, the Interfax news agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has held off on releasing $90 million, saying the  
government needed to abolish some state subsidies and revoke a tax 
on sunflower seed exports, the fund's mission in Kiev said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has repeatedly delayed aid to Ukraine in previous years,  
accusing the government of not doing enough on reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine has received more than $900 million since the three-year  
aid package was approved last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukrainian officials have repeatedly stressed the need for IMF  
loans. They say that that without assistance from the IMF and the 
World Bank, Ukraine will have trouble meeting next year's foreign 
debt obligations of more than $3 billion.

<HEADLINE> Two Original One-Person Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The subject matter of one-person shows sure has  
changed from the days when biographical portraits of such greats as 
Mark Twain, Emily Dickinson and Clarence Darrow were the norm. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider ``Fully Committed,'' a cheeky, slightly caustic  
commentary by Becky Mode about a peculiar aspect of New York life. 
The play, now at off-Broadway's Vineyard Theater, chronicles the 
harried life of a young man who takes reservations at the hottest 
restaurant in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	It's only a job, you might say, but what a job! The high-stress  
factor rises every time the phone rings at this unnamed but trendy 
establishment. The caller might be flunky for supermodel Naomi 
Campbell, demanding a reservation for 16, or the coked-out, 
complaining maitre'd, who fails to recognize celebrities, or a 
steely sweet socialite requiring a specific table -- one that 
already has been taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Mode hilariously depicts the pressures that frazzle Sam, a  
would-be actor, played by Mark Setlock, who also portrays all the 
persistent callers by shifting his voice and his body language. 
</P>
<P>
	As victim and abuser, Setlock gets the Jekyll and Hyde aspects  
of the evening down perfectly. He is an ingratiating, versatile 
actor, building a natural sympathy for eager-to-please Sam and a 
dislike for the poor guy's tormentors. 
</P>
<P>
	At 75 minutes, ``Fully Committed'' -- the phrase Sam is  
instructed to use when explaining the restaurant is entirely booked 
-- is just the right length. Anything longer would jangle the 
audience, particularly with that reservation phone line going off 
every other minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimming is in order at ``Chesapeake,'' particularly in Act 1 of  
Lee Blessing's inventive, if overly talky saga of one man's quest 
for revenge. The play, at Second Stage, is original and timely, 
considering the fuss made by New York's mayor over the Brooklyn 
Museum's latest art exhibition. It also is quite funny. 
</P>
<P>
	The plot concerns a performance artist and his desire to get  
back at a politician who threatens to cut off government funds for 
the arts. The artist's instrument for poetic justice: a dog, the 
politician's Chesapeake Bay retriever named Lucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Things don't go according to plan, but half the fun of  
``Chesapeake'' is its surprising second act, so details will not be 
revealed here. What can be confirmed is the virtuosity of actor 
Mark Linn-Baker, a terrific comedian. The man can play just about 
anything, a statement confirmed by what occurs in Blessing's 
astonishing entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hedwig and the Angry Inch'' is not a one-person show, but it  
might as well be, considering the demands made on the title 
character. The long-running musical has just taken a leap, a 
dangerous one, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
	Ally Sheedy, one of filmdom's most unconventional and  
interesting actresses, has joined the cast as Hedwig, the 
transsexual rock diva who changes gender -- from male to female -- on 
the rocky road to a questionable pop career. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are mixed, with Sheedy not up to the considerable  
demands of Stephen Trask's tough score. Her singing voice is modest 
and gives out about two-thirds of the way through the evening. Yet 
Sheedy is a game performer, quirky and determined, who brings a 
vulnerability to the role originally played by its creator, John 
Cameron Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	The character begins life as a boy in Communist East Berlin,  
before the fall of the Wall, and after a botched sex-change 
operation ends up a woman in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is no doubt that Sheedy is a woman, a fact which  
lessens the bizarre quality of Hedwig's tale. In the end, despite 
Sheedy's valiant efforts, this cast change is a provocative idea 
that never quite lives up to its anticipation.

<HEADLINE> 'Rainbow Warrior' Executed in Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POINT OF THE MOUNTAIN, Utah (AP) -- A man whom prison officials  
said called himself ``The Rainbow Warrior'' -- a killer of 
homosexuals -- was executed by injection today for stabbing another 
man to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Held by thick leather straps and with intravenous lines running  
to his arms, Joseph Mitchell Parsons was relaxed as he spoke his 
last words. 
</P>
<P>
	``My love to my family and friends. And Woody, the Rainbow  
Warrior rules!'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prison spokesman Jack Ford said Parsons referred to himself as  
``The Rainbow Warrior'' in a letter to family, and 'Woody' is the 
nickname for his fellow death row inmate and friend Doug Lovell. 
</P>
<P>
	The rainbow flag is a symbol for the gay community.  
</P>
<P>
	In Texas on Thursday, a man who nicknamed himself ``Animal'' was  
executed by injection for raping and killing an 18-year-old high 
school cheerleader, one of three people killed during a daylong 
murder spree in 1986. Jerry McFadden, 51, made no final statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Parsons, 35, was picked up by Richard Ernest while hitchhiking  
outside Barstow, Calif., in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ernest was killed and robbed hours later.  
Parsons said he stabbed Ernest in self-defense after the other man 
made a sexual advance, but prosecutors said the wounds appeared to 
have been inflicted while Ernest was sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Parsons was the sixth man executed in Utah since the Supreme  
Court reinstated capital punishment in 1972.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Water Districts Reach Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- After years of negotiations, Southern  
California water districts agreed on a tentative deal Friday to 
divide their allotment of water from the Colorado River to ensure 
that California no longer takes more than its fair share. 
</P>
<P>
	The six other Western states that draw from the river put  
pressure on Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to do something about 
California continually taking more than its share. In response, he 
set a Friday deadline for the districts to agree on a way to stay 
within their allotment or risk immediate loss of their surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the Metropolitan Water District, the Imperial  
Irrigation District and the Coachella Valley Water District 
wouldn't discuss the specific terms of the agreement, but confirmed 
that an accord should be signed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All sides appear to be happy,'' Coachella spokesman Dennis  
Mahr said. ``Hopefully, there's a settlement, but the lawyers are 
still going over the language'' in the more than 50-page document. 
</P>
<P>
	The districts, along with the San Diego County Water Authority,  
spent the past three days in marathon sessions to reach an 
agreement rather than face intervention from Gov. Gray Davis or 
Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations were held at Metropolitan's headquarters in Los  
Angeles and led by David Hayes, acting deputy secretary of the 
Department of the Interior, and Tom Hannigan, director of 
California's Department of Water Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes declined to comment. Hannigan did not return several phone  
messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1922 agreement, California is assured 4.4 million  
acre-feet of water a year from the Colorado River. However, only 
550,000 acre-feet is budgeted for the heavily populated coastal 
strip and inland regions. 
</P>
<P>
	An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, or enough water for a  
family of four for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past few years, Metropolitan, which owns the aqueduct  
that supplies water to 16 million people in Southern California, 
has been taking as much 5.2 million acre-feet to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
	To reduce the region's reliance on the surpluses, the districts  
had to agree on how to share the allotment, meaning some districts 
had to give water to others; who would retain the rights; how much 
each district would pay for the water and conservation programs; 
and how the districts would share costs of an environmental impact 
review for the Imperial-San Diego water transfer.

<HEADLINE> Nemechek Turns 198 mph Lap for Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) -- Joe Nemechek, running the fastest  
qualifying lap at Talladega Superspeedway in 10 years, was nearly 
breathless after his pole-winning effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning his third pole of the season and fifth of his career,  
``Front Row Joe'' turned a lap of 198.331 mph in qualifying Friday 
for the Winston 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Nemechek, who completed his fast lap on the high-banked,  
2.66-mile oval with about 15 drivers still waiting to qualify, 
said, ``I'll tell you what, if they can beat that, they can have 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pole-winning lap couldn't approach the track record of  
212.809, set by Bill Elliott with an unrestricted engine in the 
spring of 1987. By the following year, NASCAR had begun requiring 
carburetor restrictor plates to slow the cars at Talladega and 
Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
	Each time the speeds began to inch too close to 200, the  
sanctioning body cut horsepower by making bigger holes in the 
restrictor plate. But the engine-builders continue to make inroads, 
as illustrated by recent results at Talladega. 
</P>
<P>
	Nemechek's lap is the fastest since Elliott's 199.388 in 1990.  
Since then, the top qualifying speeds have been mostly under 195 
until last fall when Bobby Labonte bumped it to 196.153. Ken 
Schrader upped the ante in the spring to 197.765. 
</P>
<P>
	Nemechek, who will replace Schrader next season, said, ``We've  
just worked really hard on our speedway program this year. We 
qualified fourth here in the spring and we won the pole at Daytona 
(in July) with this same car. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got into a wreck in Daytona with two laps to go and had to  
put on a new front end, so we didn't know how fast it was going to 
go. But the car was great and the motor shop obviously found us 
some more power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for his breathless fast lap, Nemechek said, ``It got a little  
rough because the cars are running so close to the ground. But that 
was all we had. If somebody else could run faster, well, so be 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Rudd's 198.265 made it the same front row for Sunday as in  
July at Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why the speeds have climbed so high, Rudd said, ``The guys  
working on the cars are real creative and the guys in the engine 
shop are finding more horsepower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kenny Wallace, Schrader's teammate, was close behind Rudd at  
198.105, taking a ride as rough as Nemechek's. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some reason, and I don't know why, the cars seems to  
riding a lot rougher,'' Wallace said. ``Maybe because I ran a 198 
lap. But I'll tell you, it was not enjoyable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, younger brother of Winston Cup star Rusty Wallace, said  
an expected rule change will probably bring the speeds down for the 
restrictor-plate races next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I hear, they're going to make us use stiffer  
springs,'' Wallace said. ``That'll keep the rear end of the car 
maybe 5 inches higher in the air in qualifying and that will 
probably allow NASCAR to slow us down by 5 mph without having to 
deal with the motors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudd smiled when asked about the rough ride, saying, ``I've been  
here before and rattled my teeth. I couldn't even see because of 
the vibration. It was a real violent ride. But today it wasn't so 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of hate to see the rules change now that we've finally  
been able to figure it out. The majority of the guys in the garage 
area will tell you it rattles your teeth, but some are riding 
comfortably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schrader was fourth at 197.358, followed by rookie Tony Stewart  
(197.114), Sterling Marlin (197.001), Wally Dallenbach (196.822), 
Terry Labonte (196.427) and Mark Martin and Rusty Wallace (both 
196.262). 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon, heading into Sunday with a two-race winning string,  
was 14th (195.724) and series points leader Dale Jarrett was 17th 
(195.397). Bobby Labonte, who is second in the driver standings, 
222 points behind Jarrett with five races remaining, qualified 11th 
(196.242).

<HEADLINE> Irish, Trojans a Huge Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Southern Cal-Notre Dame is usually  
billed as the nation's top intersectional rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	But Notre Dame hasn't been holding up its end of the deal  
lately. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish have lost three straight to the Trojans, each in a  
heartbreaking fashion. Two of those losses have kept the Irish out 
of the Bowl Championship Series, and now the seniors are faced with 
the prospect of leaving Notre Dame without ever beating USC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they all realize what those losses have done. You're  
talking about maybe having the opportunity to go to a bowl game in 
both those occurrences (in '96 and '98). Those were devastating 
losses for us,'' said Notre Dame coach Bob Davie, who's 0-2 against 
the Trojans. ``This is a great rivalry if we hold up our end of the 
bargain and come out and play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Irish (3-3) lost to USC (3-2), they did it  
without quarterback Jarious Jackson. The Irish quarterback had to 
sit out the 10-0 loss -- which snapped Notre Dame's eight-game 
winning streak -- because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our opportunity to definitely go to a BCS bowl and to  
be injured the last play of the game before was heartbreaking,'' 
Jackson said. ``But now I get my chance to play against these 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last thing USC wants to see is a motivated Jackson.  
</P>
<P>
	After the offense struggled during a 1-3 start, the Irish have  
come together the last few weeks, mostly because of Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago, he wasn't even rated nationally for passing  
efficiency, but he climbed to No. 3 this week with 155.88 rating 
points. His 281 yards of offense per game ranks 16th in the 
country, and he just finished the second-best five-game streak of 
any quarterback in Notre Dame history with 1,313 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	His 233.7 yards passing a game ranks second in school history  
behind Joe Theismann's 242.9 in 1970, and his 61.8 completion 
percentage is ahead of Kevin McDougal's Irish record 61.6, set in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've had confidence since Day One, but everybody is  
starting to click,'' wide receiver Joey Getherall said. ``Jarious 
is playing out of his mind right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things aren't going quite as well for the Trojans after losing  
to Arizona 31-24 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their running game, led by Chad Morton with 401 yards, was  
held to minus-20 yards in the loss, while Arizona gained 550 yards 
against one of the Pac-10's best defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a very, very proud team that is frustrated now,'' said  
USC coach Paul Hackett. ``We're disappointed. What we've seen all 
along is an excellent football team that hasn't happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Trojans might not need much of a running game to play  
Notre Dame tough, especially if they can get it done through the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish secondary has been solid, though unspectacular, and  
has had problems covering explosive receivers like USC's Jay 
Soward. While the Trojans will be without quarterback Carson 
Palmer, who broke his collarbone against Oregon three weeks ago and 
won't return until at least November, Mike Van Raaphorst has 
completed 55 percent of his passes for just less than 200 yards a 
game this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Soward) is a definite first-round draft pick, and I remember  
last year you felt him every time he was on the field,'' Davie 
said. ``He's not a big tall guy like (Michigan's David) Terrell or 
(Michigan State's Plaxico) Burress, but he's the difference-maker. 
You wanted to know where No. 18 was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore tackle Jordan Black, who will get his first taste of  
the rivalry Saturday, said it's disgusting to think about the Irish 
losing three straight to the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time a team has beaten Notre Dame three straight games,  
we've just got to be offended by that,'' he said. ``You've got to 
just have a nasty attitude about it.''

<HEADLINE> Chimpanzee in Custody Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST COVINA, Calif. (AP) -- He's been described as ``a good  
citizen'' and ``a political prisoner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moe the chimpanzee, the subject of an emotional custody dispute,  
is having his day in court and it's creating a local sensation. 
</P>
<P>
	An army of lawyers is fighting over whether Moe, who has bitten  
a couple of people, should remain in quarantine or be allowed to 
return to his surrogate parents, St. James and LaDonna Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Davises rescued him from the wilds of Africa 30 years ago  
when his mother was killed by poachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want our family back together,'' a weeping St. James Davis  
told reporters outside the local courthouse on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Picketers -- mostly neighbors who have lived on the same street  
as Moe for years -- marched with signs saying, ``Bring Moe Home,'' 
``West Covina Loves Moe'' and ``Moe is a political prisoner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He causes a lot less problems than the kids in the  
neighborhood,'' said Susan Stewart, calling Moe ``a good citizen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had tried to evict Moe from West Covina in the 1960s  
but a judge let him stay, saying the chimp ``doesn't have the 
traits of a wild animal and was somewhat better behaved than some 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moe went on to become a local celebrity, appearing at ribbon  
cuttings, helping sell cookies for the Girl Scouts, even appearing 
in a movie or two. 
</P>
<P>
	His troubles began in August 1998 when a worker fixing something  
in Moe's cage accidentally caused an electrical shock to the chimp. 
Moe panicked, escaped and ran through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal control officers tried to calm him, neighbors said, but  
police roared up with flashing lights and sirens and Moe became 
more agitated. He bit a police officer and an animal control 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a community relations officer asked to visit Moe.  
Sheryl Ortiz was told not to go too close, according to the 
Davises, but she stuck her finger into Moe's cage. At first he 
sucked on the finger, then he bit off the tip. 
</P>
<P>
	They explained that because he likes red licorice, he thought he  
was biting into a piece of the candy when he saw her red nail 
polish. 
</P>
<P>
	Moe has been taken to the Wildlife Way Station to be  
quarantined. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Court Judge Carol Williams Elswick postponed all  
action until Nov. 19, expressing hope that the parties will reach 
an out-of-court settlement.

<HEADLINE> Two Close Calls For Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Call it the Curse of the Bambino's Wall.  
</P>
<P>
	Twice, the Boston Red Sox hit long drives to right field that  
looked like they might be home runs. Twice, the balls hit the very 
top of the fence and bounced back into play. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than solo home runs, Jason Varitek and Troy O'Leary both  
wound up stranded on third base Thursday night in Boston's 3-2 loss 
to the New York Yankees in Game 2 of the AL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a big break for us,'' Yankees right fielder Paul  
O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill patrols the same position that Babe Ruth once played on  
the same Yankee Stadium field. If the Red Sox, now trailing 2-0 in 
the best-of-7 series, didn't believe in the Ruthian jinx, surely 
they do now. 
</P>
<P>
	It was as if Ruth, whose sale from the Red Sox to the Yankees  
after the 1919 season seemingly sent Boston into an eight-decade 
slide without a World Series title, reached out and swatted away 
the two potential home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Told that it appeared the two balls missed going out by less  
than a foot combined, Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said, ``That's 
about right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Varitek's ball went up in the air and one that  
O'Leary hit was close, too,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was scoreless in the second inning when Varitek hit a drive  
over O'Neill's outstretched glove. O'Neill looked up in the stands, 
thinking the ball was gone, before seeing it on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Varitek got a triple, but David Cone retired the next two  
batters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox trailed 3-2 in the eighth when O'Leary led off with  
a drive that also barely missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sure that was a home run,'' Cone said. ``But when it hit  
the wall, I thought we had a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few more inches, and the Red Sox might be heading back to  
Fenway Park with a 1-1 split. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think on not so cool a night, those balls are home runs,''  
Varitek said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MARIANO THE MAGNIFICENT:* Nearly three months ago, Mariano  
Rivera allowed a run. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's been all zeros after that.  
</P>
<P>
	Since that game against Tampa Bay on July 21, the Yankees closer  
has pitched 36 2-3 innings in 32 games without letting an opponent 
cross the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera worked around two hits to pitch a scoreless ninth  
Thursday night, getting a save in the Yankees' 3-2 victory. He 
struck out Damon Buford with runners on first and third to end it. 
</P>
<P>
	``To tell you the truth, nothing is going through my mind,''  
Rivera said. ``I've got to get an out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't worry in that situation,'' he said. ``If you worry,  
you'll lose the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Buford: ``He's a great pitcher and a great closer.''  
</P>
<P>
	The previous night, he pitched two shutout innings and earned  
the victory in a 4-3, 10-inning win in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera has pitched six scoreless innings during the playoffs  
against Texas and Boston. Overall, he has allowed only two earned 
runs in 41 innings in postseason play -- that's an 0.44 ERA, the 
best in major league history among pitchers with at least 30 
innings in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a number of successful closers who have pitched for  
me'' including John Wetteland, Lee Smith and Tom Henke, New York 
manager Joe Torre said. ``He has been consistent as any closer I've 
ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not seen anything like it and hope I continue to say  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre was concerned about his other relievers who have gotten  
little work in the playoffs because of the success of the starters. 
In the first four games, Orlando Hernandez went eight innings 
twice, Andy Pettitte pitched 7 1-3 innings and Roger Clemens went 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Ramiro Mendoza, Mike Stanton, Hideki Irabu and  
Allen Watson didn't pitch in the three-game sweep over Texas or in 
Game 1 against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a problem because you don't know how sharp they're  
going to be,'' Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HUSH UP:* The up close sounds of the game turned into the  
sounds of silence for Boston Red Sox manager Jimy Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was wired for sound by Fox Television during Wednesday  
night's first game of the AL championship series, won by the New 
York Yankees 4-3 in 10 innings. He said he wouldn't do it again 
after a discussion on strategy was broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do it anymore,'' Williams said before Thursday night's  
second game. ``I just don't feel right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he understands the value of bringing baseball closer to  
fans by broadcasting discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just trying to put people who have never been in the  
dugout, will never be in a dugout, give them an opportunity to see 
maybe what happens a little bit,'' he said. ``I have a respect for 
them for that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't necessarily like to do that and I won't do that  
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Rivera entered Game 1 to start the ninth inning, Williams  
asked coach Dave Jauss the prospects of stealing a base on the 
reliever. The agreement with Fox, he said, precludes broadcasting 
conversations about strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Weisman, Fox's executive producer for baseball, said  
Williams and Jauss discussed that strategy if leadoff hitter Jason 
Varitek reached base. After Varitek grounded out, the conversation 
was broadcast, Weisman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know when they played it,'' Williams said. ``I wasn't  
watching TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I spoke to Jimy about it and he has no problem,'' Weisman  
said. ``The information about Rivera's move to the plate, anybody 
in the stands can time it.'' 
</P>

	YUTAN, Neb. (AP) -- A man accused of killing his wife and staging  
a fiery auto accident to cover up the crime pleaded no contest to 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Schnabel, who entered the plea Thursday, could get up to

<HEADLINE> Gators' Johnson's Shoulder Ailing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida quarterback Doug Johnson missed  
passing drills for the second straight day Friday because of a sore 
right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Steve Spurrier said he will make a game-time decision on  
whether Johnson or backup Jesse Palmer will start Saturday at 
Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier said Johnson's shoulder had been sore since last  
Sunday, following No. 7 Florida's 31-10 victory over LSU. Johnson 
missed throwing Monday, but worked the next two days. The soreness 
didn't abate, however, so Spurrier kept him out of drills again to 
close the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting Jesse extra prepared,'' Spurrier said. ``Doug  
has thrown two days this week, so I don't know how sharp he'll be. 
He needed to get a lot of work in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer has played sparingly this season. Spurrier had held out  
hope that Palmer would be eligible for a medical redshirt due to 
lingering soreness after breaking a collarbone last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer played a mop-up role in Florida's first two games this  
season, going 14-of-23 for 158 yards with one touchdown and one 
interception. He hasn't played since. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, a junior, made the first start of his career two years  
ago this week at Auburn, when Johnson was suspended for a curfew 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer went 8-of-14 with two interceptions in that game. But  
last year, his stock rose, and he earned the starting job for a 
time, before the injury gave it back to Johnson.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Anti-Turkey Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A prominent Armenian-American activist has been  
charged with helping lead a group that plotted bomb attacks against 
Turkish targets in the United States over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourad Topalian, 56, chairman of the Armenian National Committee  
of America, was arrested Thursday on conspiracy, weapons and 
explosives charges. He could face 31 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment accuses him of directing a different group, whose  
members called their efforts ``the Cause,'' which stole weapons and 
explosives used in a 1980 car bombing outside the Turkish mission 
to the United Nations in New York City where three people were 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also mentions two 1981 California bombings -- at  
the Orange County Convention Center in Anaheim and the Turkish 
consulate in Beverly Hills -- in which no one was hurt, but it does 
not specify whether Topalian was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded innocent and was freed on $100,000 bond. Topalian  
returned to U.S. District Court on Friday to surrender his 
passport, and declined to comment after a brief hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment said the attacks were aimed at drawing attention  
to Armenian claims that 1.5 million people were slaughtered in 1915 
as part of a campaign of genocide aimed at forcing the Armenian 
population from the eastern Ottoman Empire. Turkey says there was 
no systematic campaign of slaughter and that many Armenians fled 
during World War I and the civil unrest that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Topalian allegedly sent people to Massachusetts and Beirut,  
Lebanon, for weapons and bomb training. The indictment said he 
demonstrated how to use submachine guns at a camp in Franklin, 
Mass., in 1976 and 1977. He also allegedly showed others in his 
group how to use dynamite and blasting caps. 
</P>
<P>
	Aram Hamparian, executive director of the Washington-based  
Armenian National Committee of America, declined to comment Friday 
on the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just learning the facts of the case,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The investigation of Topalian began with the 1996 discovery of  
weapons and explosives in a suburban storage garage that was opened 
after the rent went unpaid for six months. Police found more than 
100 pounds of high explosives in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
	Before becoming vice president for development at Cuyahoga  
Community College this year, Topalian worked as a consultant to the 
president of Citibank Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	He attended a March 1996 White House coffee session with other  
political and community leaders to discuss issues with President 
Clinton, the White House confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Duke Forced To Retool Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Trajan Langdon, Elton Brand, William Avery  
and Corey Maggette have disappeared from the Duke program. Those 
100-point games may not be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Krzyzewski said Friday the integration of a host of  
youngsters into his lineup will likely stunt Duke's offensive 
output in November and December, especially against a tough early 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils hit the century mark nine times last season as  
they went 37-2, losing to Connecticut in the NCAA championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still going to try to score a lot of points and run the  
ball, but when you teach motion offense it is at times difficult to 
teach a young group, to read everybody,'' Krzyzewski said as he 
starts his 20th season with the Blue Devils. ``There might be a 
little bit of more defined movement early on in an (offensive 
exchange).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even this year's fast break may have a new twist.  
</P>
<P>
	``Last year we didn't do anything with our break except get it  
down the court and try to score and attack the hoop. This year, we 
might do a secondary break or something like that,'' Krzyzewski 
said. ``We're trying to alter our system to fit this group, which 
is always kind of exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke will suit up seven freshmen following the early NBA  
departures of Brand, Avery and Maggette. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, coming off offseason hip replacement surgery, said  
he's 100 percent healthy and will be more active this season on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see myself getting up more because this team will need it  
for direction,'' he said. ``I'll have to give them more 
instructions than last year. I have had not one second of pain and 
not one limp since my operation. I am excited about coaching my 
team this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans Chris Carrawell and Shane Battier, the only returning  
starters, might need to score a combined 40 points a game for Duke, 
Krzyzewski said. They combined for 19 a game as secondary offensive 
weapons last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are 21 or 22 and the people they are playing with are 17,  
18 and 19,'' Krzyzewski said when asked about offensive chemistry 
between the veterans and newcomers. ``Six of them have been on a 
college campus for a month now. It's a different world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives (Carrawell and Battier) a chance to get outside of  
themselves and concentrate on making the team go. As a result, 
their individual stuff will flow better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski said he wouldn't have had a Midnight Madness practice  
to open workouts if most of his team returned. However, he said his 
youngsters would benefit from the experience in Cameron Indoor 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important reason is to get our kids out in front of a  
group of people,'' Krzyzewski said of the late-night setting. ``All 
of the sudden some kid might do something really good, or 
bone-headed, or I might try to talk to a kid on the court and he 
can't hear you. It's a great opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> Questions About Kennewick Man Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- Kennewick Man, one of the oldest and most  
complete human skeletons ever found in North America, may have had 
Asian or Polynesian roots, but a scientist said Friday there are 
still a lot of questions to be answered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's similar to what we're seeing with other ancient skeletons  
in both North and South America -- there's some difference between 
them and any modern people anywhere in the world,'' said Joseph 
Powell, a professor of anthropology at the University of New 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In a newly released report for the U.S. Department of the  
Interior, Powell and scientist Jerome Rose, part of a federal team 
appointed to examine the bones, wrote that Kennewick Man ``appears 
to have the strongest ... affinities with populations from 
Polynesia and southern Asia, and not with American Indians or 
Europeans in the reference samples.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But to say that Kennewick Man might be most closely linked to  
the people of Polynesia or even the ancient Ainu of Japan, 
``doesn't totally convey what we found,'' Powell said. The older 
the bones, the more difficult it can be to neatly link them to 
specific populations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that ancient skeletons found in Europe or Asia,  
for example, don't necessarily look like modern-day Europeans or 
Asians. Any number of factors could have influenced the degree of 
variation among humans then and now. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Northwest Indian tribes have claimed Kennewick man as an  
ancestor, as has the Asatru Folk Assembly, an old Norse pagan 
group. Representatives of the tribes and of the Asatru did not 
immediately return calls seeking comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennewick Man, found in the shallows of the Columbia River in  
1996, is believed to be more than 9,000 years old. Results of new 
carbon dating tests are expected to be available next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also notes that Kennewick Man probably died of old  
age, when he was between 45 and 50. He had a spear-point lodged in 
his hip, but it is believed to have been an old wound.

<HEADLINE> Gore Outlines Anti-Hunger Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An aproned Al Gore, trying to get ahead of his  
Democratic rival on child hunger, dropped in on a local soup 
kitchen Friday to promise a healthy school breakfast for every 
child and food stamps for legal immigrants if he is elected 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen million children are among the 36 million Americans who  
go hungry each day. ``That should gnaw at our conscience because we 
have the food, we have the resources, we have the means to do 
something about it,'' the vice president said, speaking on World 
Hunger Day. 
</P>
<P>
	His hunger-fighting platform was rushed out ahead of a  
long-scheduled address on child poverty next week by rival Bill 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who often silences audiences with the anecdote in his  
stump speech about a little girl who didn't eat breakfast on the 
day it was her sibling's turn to eat, has promised a comprehensive 
plan to eradicate child poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore similarly tried to preempt Bradley last month, when he  
scrambled to assemble a plan for guaranteeing health care to every 
child in advance of Bradley's own, much broader health reform 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	In his half-hour stop Friday at Martha's Table, where he, his  
wife and children have volunteered in the past, Gore tied an apron 
over his crisp dress shirt and necktie to chop peppers for a giant 
vat of vegetable soup. He joined regular volunteers in layering 
bologna and cheese on wheat bread. 
</P>
<P>
	Without detailing how he would reach his goals, Gore said that  
as president he would: 
</P>
<P>
	--Give communities unspecified resources to design innovative  
strategies, such as expanding the number of schools that provide 
free meals or making sure parents know that breakfast is available 
at school for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow working families to own ``a reliable'' car of unspecified  
value without jeopardizing their food stamp eligibility. Under 
current policy, families getting food stamps cannot own a car worth 
more than $4,650. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Push for full food-stamp eligibility for legal immigrants.  
Last year, Congress restored food stamps for elderly, disabled and 
minor non-citizens, covering 250,000 of the 935,000 legal 
immigrants who had lost those benefits under 1996 welfare reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Reward states that do a ``good job'' signing up families for  
food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Support anti-hunger partnerships among local, state, national  
and religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
	An Agriculture Department study released Thursday found that at  
least 10 percent of households in 18 states and the District of 
Columbia don't have enough food.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team To Probe E. Timor Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United Nations' top human rights official  
named a five-member team Friday that will travel to East Timor and 
investigate allegations of atrocities following the territory's 
vote for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Robinson, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights,  
pledged a ``spirit of cooperation'' toward Indonesia, which has 
rejected the international inquiry and says its own national rights 
commission should investigate abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We owe it to the people of East Timor to investigate seriously  
and objectively the terrible reports of human rights violations and 
establish responsibility for any crimes committed,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will start by examining the existing evidence in Geneva  
this month, she added, but will not go to the region before next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will be led by Sonia Picado of Costa Rica, a member of  
the country's legislative assembly. The other members are A.M. 
Ahmadi, a former Indian chief justice; Mari Kapa, deputy chief 
justice of Papua New Guinea; German lawmaker Sabine 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger and Judith Sefi-Attah of Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	An emergency session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission last  
month voted 32-12 for the international inquiry, calling for an 
``adequate representation of Asian experts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team will report its conclusions to U.N. Secretary-General  
Kofi Annan by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor was engulfed in violence and anarchy after its people  
voted overwhelmingly Aug. 30 to separate from Indonesia. 
Pro-Indonesian militias, backed by the army, went on a looting and 
killing spree, burning down villages and driving tens of thousands 
of people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson has said the scale of atrocities could warrant the  
creation of an international tribunal, similar to those established 
to prosecute war crimes from the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be certainly within the power of the commission of  
inquiry to make recommendations for a tribunal or any other 
appropriate response,'' she said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Indonesia refusing to cooperate, there are fears that the  
U.N. inquiry will only be able to gather evidence on the ground and 
collect testimony from eyewitnesses in East Timor, but won't be 
able to corroborate the testimony with Jakarta's military files and 
personnel to establish a chain of command.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Irene Nears Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Hurricane Irene brought rain and high wind  
to the Florida Keys today after drenching Cuba's tobacco fields and 
causing scattered building collapses in Havana, where at least two 
people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Though barely a hurricane with winds of 75 mph, the storm cut  
power intermittently in this resort city as Irene's center passed 
nearby during the morning. Up to 10 inches of rain flooded some 
main streets and most secondary roads in Key West and two 
neighboring islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Torrential rains pounded the lower third of the Florida  
peninsula as the storm crawled across the straits separating Cuba 
from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're experiencing some strong tropical storm conditions right  
now from Key West all the way up the Keys as far as Ocean Reef 
right now,'' Billy Wagner, Monroe County Emergency Management 
director, said this morning. Big Pine Key had a gust recorded at 
103 mph, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	The weak hurricane was expected to come ashore on the mainland  
by early evening in the Everglades, sending a 5- to 7-foot storm 
surge into Key Largo, and pass over Lake Okeechobee before pushing 
into the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters had worried about Irene sending more rain to parts  
of North Carolina flooded by Hurricane Floyd, but said early this 
afternoon that a shift to the east in the may spare the Carolinas 
by keeping the storm off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm warning covered 280 miles of the Atlantic  
Coast, a storm warning or hurricane watch covered 235 miles along 
the Gulf Coast, and a tornado watch was in effect for South 
Florida. Street flooding, downed tree limbs and outages were 
reported across the state. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storm approached, Collier County, the southernmost Gulf  
Coast county on the Florida mainland, closed public schools and 
government offices today. MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa arranged 
to fly its six refueling tankers to safety in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said rainfall totals could top 15 inches.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a well-organized hurricane, and there's a huge swath  
of storms and rain to the east'' of its center, said Richard Pasch, 
a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center outside 
Miami. In the city, there was local flooding and authorities asked 
employers to send workers home early. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. EDT, Irene's center was located about 25 miles  
southwest of Flamingo on the southern tip of Florida's peninsula. 
It was moving northeast at 10 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Monroe County, which covers the Keys, ordered a  
mandatory evacuation of mobile homes and recreational vehicles. 
Schools were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been raining throughout the night; we've been getting  
quite a few inches of rain and the wind has picked up enormously 
from when I came in at (midnight),'' said David Holliman, a 
security guard at the Lower Keys Medical Center in Key West. ``The 
trees are swaying quite a bit ... and it's getting worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four shelters were opened in the Keys: two in Key West and one  
each in Marathon and Key Largo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked all day yesterday. By the time we finished, it was  
too late to go north,'' said Jose Guadarrama, a mobile home 
resident who arrived at the shelter this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	In Key West, the collapse of a concrete seawall at the  
oceanfront Key Ambassador Best Western allowed waves to wash over 
the road, pulling chairs, shoes and seaweed in their wake. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a treasure hunt out here,'' said hotel auditor  
Brandon Boyce. Driving rain seeped through the roof or shutters. 
``We've got trash cans everywhere trying to catch it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A possible path toward eastern North Carolina had been unwelcome  
news there, since rivers only recently receded below flood stage 
following Hurricane Floyd's 20-inch deluge last month, blamed for 
49 deaths and record damage. The state was also battered by 
Hurricane Dennis less than three weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Irene left Cuban territory after soaking Havana on Thursday  
evening. Early reports were that the island escaped relatively 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
	As of this morning, authorities were reporting two storm-related  
deaths and one other person missing in Havana. Another missing 
person was missing east of Havana on Cuba's northern coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Havana Mayor Conrado Martinez said that 149 buildings were  
damaged by the heavy rains, including 13 that collapsed, and power 
outages were scattered around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	About 130,000 people from western and central Cuba, many of them  
students in government boarding schools, were evacuated as the 
hurricane approached. Classes across the region were suspended. 
Stores, government offices and banks in Havana closed shortly after 
noon Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the western city of Pinar del Rio, laborers worked made sure  
water didn't leak into warehouses storing the tobacco leaves grown 
to make Cuba's famous cigars. Cattle and livestock in the rural 
region were moved to higher ground, and there was some damage 
reported to plantain, tobacco, rice and other crops in Pinar del 
Rio and the small Isle of Youth south of the main island.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Court Strikes School Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A new property tax structure created to pay  
for state schools has been ruled unconstitutional, raising the 
possibility that the Live Free or Die State will have to turn to an 
income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The way the tax was to be phased in amounted to an unfair break  
for richer communities, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeanne Shaheen said it was unfortunate the court didn't  
give the new system a chance to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``By striking down the statewide property tax, the court has  
endangered our ability to keep schools operating,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision creates a huge hole in the budget -- more than half  
of the $825 million promised for education this year was to come 
from the property tax. Schools had been getting money under the 
plan since July. 
</P>
<P>
	State Senate President Beverly Hollingworth said the decision  
puts pressure on the Legislature to act quickly, and that senators 
would revive an income tax proposal next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But because it would take at least until 2001 to implement an  
income tax, Hollingworth said the Legislature must find a 
short-term solution, likely a property tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers were forced to come up with the new school-funding  
system after New Hampshire's high court ruled in 1997 that the 
state unfairly relied on local property taxes, which vary widely 
from town to town. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers considered an income tax to pay for schools, but the  
governor promised a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire and Alaska are the only two states with no general  
income tax or sales tax, and anti-tax sentiment in New Hampshire 
runs high. 
</P>
<P>
	So lawmakers came up with a new system that relied mainly on a  
uniform statewide property tax of $6.60 per $1,000 of property 
value. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 towns with lower tax rates -- mostly those with more  
expensive property -- had to raise the rates to the statewide level 
and send the extra money to the state, which was to have 
distributed it to poor towns. 
</P>
<P>
	To soften the blow, the Legislature phased in the increase over  
five years in the richer communities. The state said the phase-in 
would avoid economic disruption -- including bankruptcies and 
foreclosures -- that would occur with abrupt tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
	But some poorer communities went to court to challenge the plan,  
saying the phase-in was unconstitutional because it gave tax breaks 
to entire towns without regard to whether individual taxpayers 
needed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The court agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is neither reasonable nor fair to award automatic tax  
exemptions to a majority of taxpayers in affected `property rich' 
communities who do not need them in order to assist those who would 
surely qualify,'' the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court did not throw out the rest of the plan, including  
smaller taxes and tax increases. But it gutted the main source of 
money.

<HEADLINE> Chimp Paternity Mystery Solved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The mystery in the monkey house has finally  
been solved: Three unexplained chimp births at the Los Angeles Zoo 
were blamed on a vasectomy that didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
	Keepers of the chimpanzee exhibit were shocked earlier this year  
when three females gave birth even though two of their male 
neighbors were too young, three had undergone vasectomies and the 
only other one was too old. 
</P>
<P>
	It turns out that an amorous 11-year-old Shaun got a bad  
vasectomy in 1996.	   ''So Shaun was having a real good time,'' laughed Lora LaMarca, 
the zoo's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
	The paternity mystery drew international media attention and  
helped boost zoo attendance by 10 percent. The DNA results were 
announced on ``The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' during a visit by 
the surviving chimp babies, Jean and Jake. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterinarians analyzed samples of blood and hair to prove beyond  
a reasonable doubt that Shaun was daddy to Jean, Jake and the late 
Toshi, who was killed in May when play in the pen got too rough. 
</P>
<P>
	The vasectomies were part of the zoo's attempt to stop the  
monkey business in the chimpanzee exhibit, which was on the verge 
of becoming more congested than the San Diego Freeway at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoo veterinarians handed out birth control pills, but the  
females passed them around and everyone chomped them down, 
including males and babies. Contraceptive implants weren't strong 
enough to stop the population boom. 
</P>
<P>
	So it was off to the operating room for the exhibit's three  
capable males to have their sperm-carrying vas deferens ducts 
snipped. It's a procedure that's virtually 100 percent effective in 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
	But apparently not in chimpanzees.  
</P>
<P>
	It's likely that the ducts weren't completely severed during the  
operation. Another possibility was that the severed tubes grew back 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We removed almost an inch of the cord and folded it over and  
tied it,'' said Charles Sedgwick, the zoo's chief veterinarian. 
``That's a pretty good challenge for Mother Nature to have that 
thing grow back after you do that.''

<HEADLINE> Football Delays Shepard Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- One of the state's most anticipated court  
cases -- the trial of a man accused of helping kill Matthew Shepard 
-- will have to wait: The University of Wyoming football team is 
playing its big rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans who plan to attend the Oct. 23 night game between Wyoming  
and Colorado State have grabbed up all available motel rooms for 
that weekend. That means there's no place to house a jury for Aaron 
McKinney's trial at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no place to sequester the jury before Oct. 25,'' court  
spokesman Allen Johnson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 22, is accused of first-degree murder, kidnapping and  
aggravated robbery in the death of Shepard, a gay college student. 
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Court officials had set aside up to two weeks for jury  
selection. The process is ahead of schedule, but the lack of 
available beds to sequester a jury means opening statements can't 
be moved up from the original date, Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen potential jurors were excused Thursday, leaving the  
court 11 shy of the 48 needed for the last phase of jury selection. 
Nineteen prospects were to be questioned today.

<HEADLINE> Rocker All Smiles for Mets Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BY RONALD BLUM   	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets fans gave John Rocker their best  
boos Friday night. The Atlanta reliever gave them autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their team's 2-0 deficit in the NL championship series,  
Mets fans were fired up, mostly because of the provocative remarks 
by the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	When Rocker walked out of the Atlanta dugout during batting  
practice, he was greeted by game-level booing. He walked down the 
third-base line toward left field, took off his cap and waved to 
the crowd a few times, then went to the front-row seats and started 
signing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It thrills me to no end that I can get in their heads like  
that,'' he said. ``If they were quiet, I would wonder what I was 
doing wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a pregame interview on NBC, Rocker said the worst part of  
playing in New York was dealing with the fans who throw objects 
from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only place it happens out of 30 ballparks around  
the country, people making derogatory comments, throwing batteries 
and change, trying to do bodily harm. I just think someone needs to 
speak out and say that we don't need to hear those things or fear 
for our safety at a simple baseball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, he hasn't gotten familiar with Yankee Stadium, where  
Wally Joyner was hit by a knife thrown out of the stands in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker became a target by saying Mets fans were ``stupid.''  
Chipper Jones enraged Mets fans last month when, after Atlanta 
dropped New York two games back with three to go, he said: ``This 
is the next-best thing to winning the World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Annoyed by taunts from the Shea Stadium fans, he responded in  
kind: ``I told them to go home and put their Yankees stuff on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mets fans greeted him Friday with slow chants of ``Lar-ry,  
Lar-ry,'' which is his given name. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans brought signs, among them:  
</P>
<P>
	``I Want To Fight John Rocker.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Hey Rocker -- You Reek.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Yo, Larry. Fuhget About It.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I Wanna Fight John Rocker.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Hey Chipper -- Heroes Don't Commit Adultery.''  
</P>
<P>
	The latter referred to an affair Jones admitted just before he  
and his wife began divorce proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker's latest remarks did not please Braves manager Bobby Cox.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it irritates me,'' Cox said before the game. ``I don't  
like it. I don't condone it. He was roughed up by the fans, I 
think, our first series here out in the outfield. And he's the type 
of guy that's going to give it right back to them. He's got to work 
on that. He's a great pitcher, a great competitor, but he needs to 
work on his player-fan relationships.''

<HEADLINE> Vt. Resort Installs Heated Sidewalk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STRATTON, Vt. (AP) -- If only it snowed on the mountain and never  
on village sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stratton Mountain ski resort hasn't quite arranged that, but  
it has worked out the next best thing: snowmaking on the mountain 
and heated sidewalks to melt whatever nature dumps in the wrong 
places. 
</P>
<P>
	The warm sidewalks are part of a $3 million project to spruce up  
the village and convert it from a Bavarian-style setting to a New 
England one. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers have torn up the walkways and are installing miles of  
plastic pipe that will carry antifreeze to keep the village 
snowless, slushless and ice-free. Stratton typically gets more than 
14 feet of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Waker, whose heating and plumbing crews are installing the  
system, said the $250,000 project will pay for itself in five or 
six years by reducing snow removal costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The store owners are happy about it too, because skiers won't  
be tracking in snow and dirt into their stores,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Diagnose Leukemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A device that measures the activity of genes  
in medical specimens has been used to identify two different types 
of leukemia, researchers report. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published today in the journal Science, researchers  
at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., say that a DNA 
array, a biological device that can detect compounds linked to 
genes, and a special computer program were used to correctly 
identify specimens from patients with two different types of 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNA array analyzed the activity of about 7,000 genes in bone  
marrow specimens from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A computer program was then used to 
analyze the gene activity and to find a pattern unique to the 
specific types of leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Lander of the Whitehead Institute, a co-author of the  
study, said the study suggests that the DNA array could be used to 
confirm the diagnosis of other types of cancer and to measure the 
response of patients to cancer drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, cancers are identified by visually analyzing cells  
under a microscope, or by tests that may require highly 
sophisticated laboratories. Some of the methods are prone to 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
	If the DNA array method for cancer diagnosis can be developed,  
then the various types and varieties of cancer could be identified 
by genetic activity, making diagnosis quicker and more accurately, 
the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a critical first step in improving treatments for  
cancer patients,'' said Dr. Todd Golub, a researcher with joint 
appointments at Whitehead, Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He is first author of the 
study in Science.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Blacks Favor Seat Belt Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a benchmark survey that will be used to  
track blacks' support of seat belt laws, lawmakers and safety 
advocates found that only a small minority of blacks oppose police 
stopping cars for seat belt violations, despite concerns about 
racial profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone who is going to break the law who happens to be  
wearing a uniform does not need (a seat belt) law as a reason to 
pull someone over,'' said New Jersey Assemblyman Herbert Conaway, a 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine out of 10 of blacks reported they had ``almost no problems  
at all'' with seat belt laws in their state, according to a survey 
commissioned by the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and 
the Air Bag &AMP; Seat Belt Safety Campaign. And 86 percent said seat 
belt laws are needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Every state but New Hampshire has some type of seat belt law.  
</P>
<P>
	In 16 ``primary belt law'' states and the District of Columbia,  
police may legally stop motorists if they suspect their only 
violation is not fastening a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	In those states, 74 percent of the blacks surveyed favored the  
law. However, 9 percent said they do have some problem with it, 
ranging from simple disagreement to believing the law contributes 
to race-related harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,100 black adults has a margin of error  
of 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, a July survey of 800 adults of all races showed  
69 percent of motorists in primary belt law states favor their 
laws. That survey, also commissioned by the Air Bag &AMP; Seat Belt 
Safety Campaign, had a margin of error of 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, 22 percent of those surveyed felt that race was a factor  
in being stopped for not wearing a seat belt. But 32 percent said 
they believed incidents of black motorists being unfairly stopped 
had increased in their state in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-three percent said they didn't believe race was a factor  
in being stopped, and 43 percent said there had been no change in
