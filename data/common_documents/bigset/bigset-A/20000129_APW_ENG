<HEADLINE> Etheridge Joins Battle Vs. Prop. 22  </HEADLINE>
    By CYNTHIA L. WEBB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Rock star Melissa Etheridge joined the battle
against a ballot measure aimed at banning state recognition of same-sex
marriages, saying on Friday that the proposal was fueled by hate and bigotry.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are hundreds and thousands of people that I represent that are just
like me that don't happen to have two Grammys that this affects. And this
affects me deeply," said Etheridge, who is gay.
</P>
<P>
	   Proposition 22, which appears on the March 7 ballot, would prohibit
California from granting legal recognition to same-sex marriages that are
legally performed in other states. State law currently recognizes only marriage
between a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining Etheridge at a news conference was Judy Shepard, whose son, Matthew,
was beaten, tied to a fence and left to die outside Laramie, Wyo., in October
1998. His attackers have since been sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Shepard said the initiative indirectly relates to the death of her
21-year-old son, who was killed because he was gay.
</P>
<P>
	   "What it does is create a climate where such actions are viewed as
acceptable," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Etheridge added that the measure is not about telling gay people they can't
be married because California law already prohibits such that.
</P>
<P>
	   "What Proposition 22 does is tell me, my partner, my children, that we are
less than my neighbor," said the musician, who is raising a 3-year-old daughter
and 1-year-old son with partner Julie Cypher, a filmmaker.

<HEADLINE> Pigeon sharpshooters called 'inhumane cowboys' by PETA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - A posse of pigeon rustlers or inhumane cowboys
loose in the neighborhood? How an armed animal control squad is viewed in
Buffalo depends on where you stand on animal rights, or where you sit.
<P>
	   "Everyday in the spring I'm hosing my driveway and scraping my windshield,"
said Ann Marie Cortese of north Buffalo. "Those birds make me have extra work."
</P>
<P>
	   The city's Animal Control squad and is armed daily with poison, traps, and
.22-caliber rifles to handle residents' complaints about unwanted wildlife.
</P>
<P>
	   The Common Council is now considering a request to hire two more officers to
the six-member pest control squad.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are a bunch of inhumane cowboys enjoying target practice on taxpayer
dollars," said Stephanie Boyles, wildlife biologist for People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals. "Residents who like pigeons or those who just don't want
bullets flying down their street shouldn't be paying for this."
</P>
<P>
	   Mayoral spokesperson Peter Cutler said that PETA's letter demanding the hunt
to be stopped and suggested options will be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're concerned for the health and safety of all residents, so we need to
watch out for disease, but on the same token we don't want anybody harmed while
these guys are out there," Cutler said. He said the rifles are used in the most
extreme circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll give serious review to other methods and take the most appropriate
action," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The group learned of the practice through a Buffalo News article. Officials
weren't sure how long the shooting has been going on. Shooting nuisance birds by
government officials has been practiced in other cities nationwide. Shooting
within city limits would be illegal in most municipalities if done by private
citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpshooters are ready each weekday to get rid of the unwanted birds. Frank
Poincelot, the city's head pest-control and wildlife officer, told the Buffalo
News that on "a good day, they (the pest-control officers) could go through 50
or 60 rounds of ammunition."
</P>
<P>
	   That means 50 to 60 dead birds, because officials insist the crew doesn't
miss its shots, which are often at birds perched on roof peaks of single- and
two-family houses. Although a .22-caliber bullet can travel a mile or more and
potentially through a bird, animal control officials said the shooting isn't a
threat to people. Most bird hunting is done with shotguns, not .22 caliber
rifles.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents complain about the droppings left by roosting pigeons. Some fear
the spread of disease, but most just don't like cleaning up the mess.
</P>
<P>
	   Pigeons have been accused of spreading everything from salmonella to
meningitis and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
	   PETA's website charges that pest control companies have spread the
misconception that urban pigeons spread disease. "The vast majority of people
are at little health risk from pigeons and have a better chance of getting
struck by lighting," the organization writes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Boyles concedes that the droppings can be a nuisance. "Sure, they are
annoying, but only effective methods will get rid of them," she said. "When you
kill a bird the only thing that'll happen is that another will take its place."
</P>
<P>
	   PETA suggests that homeowners and building managers should take measures to
make the roosting site less hospitable in the first place. Tying up wind chimes,
playing a radio, putting up effigies of predator birds or flying a balloon with
big eyes drawn on it have all proven effective, according to PETA.
</P>
<P>
	   "People feed the birds or leave their trash out attracting them," Ms. Boyles
said. "And then the birds are shot at, paying for our irresponsibility."

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton criticizes Austria's Haider  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton has written to a top Jewish
leader to express her opposition to Joerg Haider and his far-right Freedom Party
becoming part of a coalition government in Austria.
<P>
	   The move Friday served to call attention, once again, to the fact that her
expected Republican Senate opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, had
shared the dais with Haider at a Martin Luther King Day event earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider is a controversial figure who once praised Adolf Hitler's "orderly
employment practices" and later said veterans of Hitler's elite Waffen SS were
"decent people of good character."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani aides had said at the time that the mayor had not been aware that
Haider was at the event.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Edgar Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress, Mrs.
Clinton said "Haider's record of intolerance, extremism and anti-Semitism should
be of concern to all of us."
</P>
<P>
	   "Neither he nor his party should be seriously considered as a partner in an
Austrian government," the first lady added.
</P>
<P>
	   "Surely, the history of the past century tells us the danger of such a move.
I hope that people of good will, in Austria and around the world, will speak out
and express their concern at this important moment," Mrs. Clinton wrote. "I
certainly will."
</P>
<P>
	   There has been an international outcry, including sharp criticism from
Israeli leaders, in the wake of news that the center-right Austrian People's
Party was talking with the Freedom Party about forming a governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton camp left no doubt that the letter to Bronfman was meant to put
Giuliani on the spot, but campaign aides to the mayor refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been nearly two weeks since Rudy Giuliani shared a dais with Joerg
Haider. Why hasn't he spoken out?" Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton,
said. "Why didn't he throw Joerg Haider out of the room?"
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor created an international stir when he threw Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat out of a Lincoln Center concert celebrating the United Nations'
50th anniversary in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Giuliani blamed the Palestine Liberation Organization for the
murder of New Yorker Leon Klinghoffer during the hijacking of the Achille Lauro
cruise liner in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we're having a party and a celebration, I would rather not have
someone who was implicated in the murders of Americans there," Giuliani had
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton campaign's move also seemed designed to score points with the
state's politically important Jewish community. The first lady and the mayor
have been jockeying over that for months.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani had blasted Mrs. Clinton for her embrace of Arafat's wife last year
just moments after she had charged that Israel was using poison gas against
Palestinians. The first lady later condemned Mrs. Arafat's statements.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor's camp was also critical of Mrs. Clinton's appearance at a Martin
Luther King Day event this month hosted by Al Sharpton. During the event, a
Sharpton ally had made remarks considered anti-Semitic. Neither Mrs. Clinton nor
Sharpton were in the room at the time. The first lady subsequently criticized
the comments.

<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Someone is tarnishing Robert C. Smith's good name.
<P>
	   And in at least some instances, it's Smith's good friend, say police.
</P>
<P>
	   At least five times in the past two years, area police have wrongly filed
charges against the 20-year-old Syracuse man after catching someone who claimed
to be him.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the real Robert Smith have managed to get the charges
dismissed. But the mistakes resulted in New York suspending Smith's license,
warrants being issued for his arrest and Smith having to appear in court on
several occasions.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent episode occurred last weekend when police arrested five men
on felony drug charges after finding them in possession of 11 ounces of crack
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   It turned out, the person who gave Smith's name was Jeffrey Dowdell Jr., 21,
who has been friends with Smith since the attended elementary school together in
Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowdell did not have any identification when he was arrested but provided
deputies with Smith's correct date of birth and address, said John D'Eredita,
spokesman for the Onondaga County Sheriff's Department. At the jail, however, a
deputy recognized him as Dowdell, D'Eredita said.
</P>
<P>
	   The deception earned Dowdell an extra charge: criminal impersonation, a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith's mother, Celestine Smith, said she doubted her son will remain
friends with Dowdell.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's tired of being dragged through the mud and being in court all the
time. Being deaf is hard enough," said Mrs. Smith of her son who lost his
hearing three years ago after contracting meningitis.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were friends since the time they were 9 years old. But he can't be too
much of our friend if he's doing this to us," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith did not want to talk about the affair.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowdell, though, maintained that Smith was his friend, and said he was
sorry.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know my man, Robert. I know he's mad at me. But he'll get over it. That's
my man," Dowdell said in a jailhouse interview with The Post-Standard of
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Celestine Smith said Dowdell admitted to her this summer that he had
pretended to be her son on a previous occasion when he was stopped by police.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said he didn't think Robert would get in trouble because he can't hear,"
said Mrs. Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowdell admitted Monday that he told police he was Smith last fall when they
confiscated $1,000 from him because he was in a drug-infested neighborhood and
had no proof he had legally earned the money.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Dowdell said he never got any tickets in Smith's name.
</P>
<P>
	   But Syracuse police issued three separate appearance tickets in Smith's name
to an impersonator, said attorney December Haab, who represented Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   The appearance tickets noted that the suspect had a scar on his face and a
tattoo - which the real Smith does not have, Haab said. Neither does Dowdell.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrants were issued in 1999 for Smith's arrest for failing to appear in
court on a marijuana charge. The warrants and charges were dismissed after Haab
met with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspects occasionally deceive police as to their true identity but are
usually caught within hours after they are booked and fingerprinted, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's unusual," Haab said of Smith's predicament. "I hope it's
unusual."

<HEADLINE> Thruway board approves plan for possible annual toll hikes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Annual toll hikes could be possible along the New
York State Thruway under a plan approved by the toll road's board of directors.
<P>
	   The board voted to go forward with a previously unannounced plan to tie
future toll increases on the Thruway to the construction cost index, which is an
average of construction material and labor costs in 20 U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
	   The first-year hike would be 1.8 percent effective June 1, according to
Thruway Authority Executive Director John Platt.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls at the short-trip barriers around Buffalo and New York City would not
go up because they are rounded to the nearest quarter. But virtually all other
tolls on the ticketed part of the superhighway would go up by 1.8 percent,
rounded to the nearest nickel.
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway officials will hold four public hearings to gather comment on the
toll-increase plan and finalize the plan this spring, Thruway spokeswoman Anya
Frost said.
</P>
<P>
	   Platt insisted that no final decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not cast in stone at all," he said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The toll-hike plan, once it became known Friday, received immediate
criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority leader of the state Senate, Joseph Bruno, cited such a hike as
being in opposition to recent state efforts to cut taxes and other costs of
doing business in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now is not the time for the Thruway Authority to impose a hidden tax on
upstate businesses, residents and commuters in the form of multiyear toll
hikes," Bruno, R-Rensselaer, said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the Senate majority wants to make money available for capital projects
we'll be more than happy to discuss this alternative," Platt countered. But
otherwise, "We need to be able to have a hedge against the cost of
construction."
</P>
<P>
	   The state Motor Truck Association blasted the Authority for the secretive
manner in which it voted to raise tolls, and said it appeared there was nothing
to prevent tolls from going up 3 percent every year if increases in the
construction cost index allowed such hikes.
</P>
<P>
	   "As business people we would never increase our prices to our largest
customers without first consulting with them," grumbled the Motor Truck
Association's president, Bill Joyce.
</P>
<P>
	   It called on Pataki to ask the Thruway Authority to reexamine its projected
toll hike and to find other ways to fund improvements on the roadway.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon refused to take a stance on the plan. "At
this point it's just a proposal," he said. "There's going to be public hearings.
We'll let the process move forward."
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls were last raised on the Thruway, the nation's longest toll road, in
1988. In 1996, the Thruway board backed away from a toll hike at the insistence
of Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   There was little, if any, advance word that the board was contemplating a
toll hike before Thursday's meeting. The press release issued by the Authority
afterward spoke of the agency funding $275 million in capital improvements this
year. Not until the second page of the release did the Authority refer to the
adoption of a plan which could result in an annual toll hike - it called it an
"indexed toll adjustment plan" - beginning June 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the $275 million in projects to be put out for bid this year by the
Thruway was work on the Interstate 287 corridor around the Tappan Zee Bridge and
the Syracuse Inner Harbor.
</P>
<P>
	   Both projects are among the transportation facilities the Thruway has
assumed authority for in recent years. Critics say the drain of these other
endeavors have put additional financial burdens on the Authority past that of
maintaining the original toll highway between New York City and the Pennsylvania
border.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thruway Authority's Chairman Louis Tomson is a former deputy to Pataki
and was nominated by the governor to the Thruway position. It is unlikely that
the Thruway Authority board would proceed with a toll hike plan without the
prior knowledge of Pataki's office.

<HEADLINE> People cope at the coldest spot on the map  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SARANAC LAKE, N.Y. (AP) - It's duck season in the north country. Just
ask, "Is it cold enough for ya?" and watch everybody duck.
<P>
	   Such mild banter is offered at some risk when the weather turns drastically
un-mild like in this Adirondack mountain village. Here, mercury doesn't dip in
January, it disappears from the thermometer.
</P>
<P>
	   How cold is it?
</P>
<P>
	   It's so cold in Saranac Lake that gasoline in a car's tank can turn to
jelly. It's so cold that home heating pipes and toilet bowls are cracking open.
It's so cold that people mummify themselves in wool and fur before stepping
outside.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard to breathe," said Heather Tuttle, a supervisor at the Wawbeek
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Saranac Lake is a quaint village of about 5,000 people tucked in the High
Peaks of the Adirondacks. Not as celebrated or upscale as nearby Lake Placid,
the northern New York village still features a rustic charm accented by
clapboard homes, an old fashioned main street and a mountain lake.
</P>
<P>
	   And being so high up, temperatures far below zero are common. Temperatures
dipped to the -20 to -30 range recently - or -60 with the wind chill. Even with
cloud cover over the past few days, temperatures have been as low as -15.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's getting to be so if its zero you feel warm, and if it's 8 above, you
take off your jacket and leave it in the truck," said Bill Decker, owner of Big
D Fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   And when the temperatures nosedive, the locals just deal with it.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig Catalano, manager of Asplin Tree Farm, had to go out Friday to cut
down two balsam fir trees to be shipped to Glens Falls. How does he psyche
himself to go out in the cold?
</P>
<P>
	   He doesn't. He just puts on a herd's worth of wool and does it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully, it will be quick and simple," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Catalano noted a big problem with the cold was getting the diesel tractors
to start up. Even with electric heaters on the engine blocks, fuel will
sometimes coagulate in the line, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Andreas Mowka said he routinely will "plug in" his family's three cars
overnight. But when it gets really cold - as it has a few times recently - he
will get up at 3 a.m. to run the cars for a half hour so they don't freeze up.
</P>
<P>
	   While the cars are idling, he'll make sure the horse's water doesn't ice up
and stock his house's wood stove (15 face cords a winter). Then he goes back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're in a dreamlike state when you do this," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   People with weekend homes in the area have it tougher. Decker said that in
the 24-hours since one home was checked, the heating system sputtered out,
causing water in every pipe to freeze, cracking radiators and toilet bowls.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our technicians, our boiler repairmen aren't getting a lot of sleep," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Saranac Lake is not necessarily colder than other places in the Adirondacks,
but it gets more attention because it is the lone federally maintained weather
observation site in the area. It's also the largest year-round population center
within the 6-million-acre park.
</P>
<P>
	   "It sort of becomes representative of the Adirondacks," said National
Weather Service meteorologist Mike Cempa.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents here know their hometown has a frosty reputation, but they tend to
shrug it off as the price for living in such a beautiful setting.
</P>
<P>
	   Mowka said he has lived as far afield as Iran, Germany and Long Island, but
that Saranac Lake is the best and most beautiful.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary La Rose, a retiree who was looking out the window Friday morning to
watch chickadees flitting about her bird feeder, said it's important to keep in
mind the upsides of the area.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't have hurricanes and floods, so we have a little cold weather once
in while," she said. "That's not too bad."

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton criticizes Austria's Haider  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton has written to a top Jewish
leader to express her opposition to Joerg Haider and his far-right Freedom Party
becoming part of a coalition government in Austria.
<P>
	   The move Friday served to call attention, once again, to the fact that her
expected Republican Senate opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, had
shared the dais with Haider at a Martin Luther King Day event earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider is a controversial figure who once praised Adolf Hitler's "orderly
employment practices" and later said veterans of Hitler's elite Waffen SS were
"decent people of good character."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani aides had said at the time that the mayor had not been aware that
Haider was at the event.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Edgar Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress, Mrs.
Clinton said "Haider's record of intolerance, extremism and anti-Semitism should
be of concern to all of us."
</P>
<P>
	   "Neither he nor his party should be seriously considered as a partner in an
Austrian government," the first lady added.
</P>
<P>
	   "Surely, the history of the past century tells us the danger of such a move.
I hope that people of good will, in Austria and around the world, will speak out
and express their concern at this important moment," Mrs. Clinton wrote. "I
certainly will."
</P>
<P>
	   There has been an international outcry, including sharp criticism from
Israeli leaders, in the wake of news that the center-right Austrian People's
Party was talking with the Freedom Party about forming a governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton camp left no doubt that the letter to Bronfman was meant to put
Giuliani on the spot, but campaign aides to the mayor refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been nearly two weeks since Rudy Giuliani shared a dais with Joerg
Haider. Why hasn't he spoken out?" Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton,
said. "Why didn't he throw Joerg Haider out of the room?"
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor created an international stir when he threw Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat out of a Lincoln Center concert celebrating the United Nations'
50th anniversary in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Giuliani blamed the Palestine Liberation Organization for the
murder of New Yorker Leon Klinghoffer during the hijacking of the Achille Lauro
cruise liner in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we're having a party and a celebration, I would rather not have
someone who was implicated in the murders of Americans there," Giuliani had
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton campaign's move also seemed designed to score points with the
state's politically important Jewish community. The first lady and the mayor
have been jockeying over that for months.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani had blasted Mrs. Clinton for her embrace of Arafat's wife last year
just moments after she had charged that Israel was using poison gas against
Palestinians. The first lady later condemned Mrs. Arafat's statements.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor's camp was also critical of Mrs. Clinton's appearance at a Martin
Luther King Day event this month hosted by Al Sharpton. During the event, a
Sharpton ally had made remarks considered anti-Semitic. Neither Mrs. Clinton nor
Sharpton were in the room at the time. The first lady subsequently criticized
the comments.

<HEADLINE> Gene Talks Boil Down to Few Issues  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT CRENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- In the final hours of international talks Friday on trade
in genetically modified food and other products, negotiators found themselves
grappling over the same issues that doomed a similar agreement nearly a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates scurried from room to room of the Montreal hotel where the meeting
was being held, bearing proposals and counterproposals. The shuttling delayed
the start of a final plenary session for seven hours. When it finally began just
before midnight, key U.S. and European delegates were not present -- still
negotiating separately over their differences.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayr, who set a deadline of Friday night, has said that he will not leave
Montreal without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Somebody has to give in somewhere,'' said Ethiopian head delegate Towalde
Egziabher.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators were attempting to draft the Biosafety Protocol, a set of rules
that would protect the environment from damage by genetically modified plants,
animals and bacteria. Environmentalists and a few scientific studies have raised
concerns that genetically modified organisms could wipe out native species,
disrupt natural cycles and cause other ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's fish genes in fruit, poultry genes in fish, animal genes in
plants, growth hormones in milk, insect genes in vegetables, tree genes in grain
and in the case of pork, human genes in meat,'' said Steve Gilman, an organic
farmer in Stillwater, N.Y. ``Real and reasonable concerns about genetic
engineering have fallen upon deaf ears.''
</P>
<P>
	   The debate at the talks has revolved around how great the scientific
uncertainty is, and how it should be dealt with. The European Union and
developing nations have argued that countries should be allowed to decline
imports of a genetically modified product if little is known about its
environmental effect.
</P>
<P>
	   But the United States and its partners disagree, saying the proposed rules
in their current form would restrict trade. Those countries argued that any
nation's refusal to import a genetically modified product should be backed by
scientific evidence in the form of a risk assessment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We live in a world in which scientific certainty is not available,'' said
U.S. Undersecretary of State Frank Loy.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks last February in Cartagena, Colombia, ended in disarray when the
United States and five other countries -- Canada, Australia, Argentina, Chile
and Uruguay -- rejected a draft agreement favored by 125 other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation has changed since then, with major U.S. food producers such as
Archer Daniels Midland, Gerber and the Iams pet food company either demanding
that genetically modified products be segregated or refusing to use them
altogether. Protests at the World Trade Organization talks in Seattle last month
also suggest that the American public has concerns about genetically altered
food.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the year since Cartagena, it has become obvious that the position of
the (United States') group is increasingly isolated,'' said Philip Bereano, a
University of Washington professor who has been following the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as in Cartagena, the talks in Montreal have come down to a handful of
issues:
</P>
<P>
	   --The relationship of the proposed rules to the World Trade Organization.
The United States wants the agreement to have ``equal status'' with the free
trade pact. But other countries fear that any bans they impose will be
overturned by the World Trade Organization's dispute resolution panel.
</P>
<P>
	   --The amount of scientific evidence that is needed to justify banning a
genetically modified product.
</P>
<P>
	   --The amount of evidence that exporters must provide about their products.
</P>
<P>
	   Genetically modified crops are already widespread. About 70 million acres of
genetically engineered plants were cultivated worldwide in 1999. In the United
States, genetically engineered varieties account for about 25 percent of corn
and 40 percent of soybeans.

<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Someone is tarnishing Robert C. Smith's good name.
<P>
	   And in at least some instances, it's Smith's good friend, say police.
</P>
<P>
	   At least five times in the past two years, area police have wrongly filed
charges against the 20-year-old Syracuse man after catching someone who claimed
to be him.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the real Robert Smith have managed to get the charges
dismissed. But the mistakes resulted in New York suspending Smith's license,
warrants being issued for his arrest and Smith having to appear in court on
several occasions.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent episode occurred last weekend when police arrested five men
on felony drug charges after finding them in possession of 11 ounces of crack
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   It turned out, the person who gave Smith's name was Jeffrey Dowdell Jr., 21,
who has been friends with Smith since the attended elementary school together in
Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowdell did not have any identification when he was arrested but provided
deputies with Smith's correct date of birth and address, said John D'Eredita,
spokesman for the Onondaga County Sheriff's Department. At the jail, however, a
deputy recognized him as Dowdell, D'Eredita said.
</P>
<P>
	   The deception earned Dowdell an extra charge: criminal impersonation, a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith's mother, Celestine Smith, said she doubted her son will remain
friends with Dowdell.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's tired of being dragged through the mud and being in court all the
time. Being deaf is hard enough," said Mrs. Smith of her son who lost his
hearing three years ago after contracting meningitis.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were friends since the time they were 9 years old. But he can't be too
much of our friend if he's doing this to us," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith did not want to talk about the affair.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowdell, though, maintained that Smith was his friend, and said he was
sorry.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know my man, Robert. I know he's mad at me. But he'll get over it. That's
my man," Dowdell said in a jailhouse interview with The Post-Standard of
Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Celestine Smith said Dowdell admitted to her this summer that he had
pretended to be her son on a previous occasion when he was stopped by police.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said he didn't think Robert would get in trouble because he can't hear,"
said Mrs. Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowdell admitted Monday that he told police he was Smith last fall when they
confiscated $1,000 from him because he was in a drug-infested neighborhood and
had no proof he had legally earned the money.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Dowdell said he never got any tickets in Smith's name.
</P>
<P>
	   But Syracuse police issued three separate appearance tickets in Smith's name
to an impersonator, said attorney December Haab, who represented Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   The appearance tickets noted that the suspect had a scar on his face and a
tattoo - which the real Smith does not have, Haab said. Neither does Dowdell.
</P>
<P>
	   Warrants were issued in 1999 for Smith's arrest for failing to appear in
court on a marijuana charge. The warrants and charges were dismissed after Haab
met with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspects occasionally deceive police as to their true identity but are
usually caught within hours after they are booked and fingerprinted, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's unusual," Haab said of Smith's predicament. "I hope it's
unusual."

<HEADLINE> Thruway board approves plan for possible annual toll hikes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Annual toll hikes could be possible along the New
York State Thruway under a plan approved by the toll road's board of directors.
<P>
	   The board voted to go forward with a previously unannounced plan to tie
future toll increases on the Thruway to the construction cost index, which is an
average of construction material and labor costs in 20 U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
	   The first-year hike would be 1.8 percent effective June 1, according to
Thruway Authority Executive Director John Platt.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls at the short-trip barriers around Buffalo and New York City would not
go up because they are rounded to the nearest quarter. But virtually all other
tolls on the ticketed part of the superhighway would go up by 1.8 percent,
rounded to the nearest nickel.
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway officials will hold four public hearings to gather comment on the
toll-increase plan and finalize the plan this spring, Thruway spokeswoman Anya
Frost said.
</P>
<P>
	   Platt insisted that no final decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not cast in stone at all," he said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The toll-hike plan, once it became known Friday, received immediate
criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority leader of the state Senate, Joseph Bruno, cited such a hike as
being in opposition to recent state efforts to cut taxes and other costs of
doing business in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now is not the time for the Thruway Authority to impose a hidden tax on
upstate businesses, residents and commuters in the form of multiyear toll
hikes," Bruno, R-Rensselaer, said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the Senate majority wants to make money available for capital projects
we'll be more than happy to discuss this alternative," Platt countered. But
otherwise, "We need to be able to have a hedge against the cost of
construction."
</P>
<P>
	   The state Motor Truck Association blasted the Authority for the secretive
manner in which it voted to raise tolls, and said it appeared there was nothing
to prevent tolls from going up 3 percent every year if increases in the
construction cost index allowed such hikes.
</P>
<P>
	   "As business people we would never increase our prices to our largest
customers without first consulting with them," grumbled the Motor Truck
Association's president, Bill Joyce.
</P>
<P>
	   It called on Pataki to ask the Thruway Authority to reexamine its projected
toll hike and to find other ways to fund improvements on the roadway.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon refused to take a stance on the plan. "At
this point it's just a proposal," he said. "There's going to be public hearings.
We'll let the process move forward."
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls were last raised on the Thruway, the nation's longest toll road, in
1988. In 1996, the Thruway board backed away from a toll hike at the insistence
of Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   There was little, if any, advance word that the board was contemplating a
toll hike before Thursday's meeting. The press release issued by the Authority
afterward spoke of the agency funding $275 million in capital improvements this
year. Not until the second page of the release did the Authority refer to the
adoption of a plan which could result in an annual toll hike - it called it an
"indexed toll adjustment plan" - beginning June 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the $275 million in projects to be put out for bid this year by the
Thruway was work on the Interstate 287 corridor around the Tappan Zee Bridge and
the Syracuse Inner Harbor.
</P>
<P>
	   Both projects are among the transportation facilities the Thruway has
assumed authority for in recent years. Critics say the drain of these other
endeavors have put additional financial burdens on the Authority past that of
maintaining the original toll highway between New York City and the Pennsylvania
border.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thruway Authority's Chairman Louis Tomson is a former deputy to Pataki
and was nominated by the governor to the Thruway position. It is unlikely that
the Thruway Authority board would proceed with a toll hike plan without the
prior knowledge of Pataki's office.

<HEADLINE> People cope at the coldest spot on the map  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SARANAC LAKE, N.Y. (AP) - It's duck season in the north country. Just
ask, "Is it cold enough for ya?" and watch everybody duck.
<P>
	   Such mild banter is offered at some risk when the weather turns drastically
un-mild like in this Adirondack mountain village. Here, mercury doesn't dip in
January, it disappears from the thermometer.
</P>
<P>
	   How cold is it?
</P>
<P>
	   It's so cold in Saranac Lake that gasoline in a car's tank can turn to
jelly. It's so cold that home heating pipes and toilet bowls are cracking open.
It's so cold that people mummify themselves in wool and fur before stepping
outside.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard to breathe," said Heather Tuttle, a supervisor at the Wawbeek
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   Saranac Lake is a quaint village of about 5,000 people tucked in the High
Peaks of the Adirondacks. Not as celebrated or upscale as nearby Lake Placid,
the northern New York village still features a rustic charm accented by
clapboard homes, an old fashioned main street and a mountain lake.
</P>
<P>
	   And being so high up, temperatures far below zero are common. Temperatures
dipped to the -20 to -30 range recently - or -60 with the wind chill. Even with
cloud cover over the past few days, temperatures have been as low as -15.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's getting to be so if its zero you feel warm, and if it's 8 above, you
take off your jacket and leave it in the truck," said Bill Decker, owner of Big
D Fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   And when the temperatures nosedive, the locals just deal with it.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig Catalano, manager of Asplin Tree Farm, had to go out Friday to cut
down two balsam fir trees to be shipped to Glens Falls. How does he psyche
himself to go out in the cold?
</P>
<P>
	   He doesn't. He just puts on a herd's worth of wool and does it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully, it will be quick and simple," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Catalano noted a big problem with the cold was getting the diesel tractors
to start up. Even with electric heaters on the engine blocks, fuel will
sometimes coagulate in the line, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Andreas Mowka said he routinely will "plug in" his family's three cars
overnight. But when it gets really cold - as it has a few times recently - he
will get up at 3 a.m. to run the cars for a half hour so they don't freeze up.
</P>
<P>
	   While the cars are idling, he'll make sure the horse's water doesn't ice up
and stock his house's wood stove (15 face cords a winter). Then he goes back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're in a dreamlike state when you do this," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   People with weekend homes in the area have it tougher. Decker said that in
the 24-hours since one home was checked, the heating system sputtered out,
causing water in every pipe to freeze, cracking radiators and toilet bowls.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our technicians, our boiler repairmen aren't getting a lot of sleep," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Saranac Lake is not necessarily colder than other places in the Adirondacks,
but it gets more attention because it is the lone federally maintained weather
observation site in the area. It's also the largest year-round population center
within the 6-million-acre park.
</P>
<P>
	   "It sort of becomes representative of the Adirondacks," said National
Weather Service meteorologist Mike Cempa.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents here know their hometown has a frosty reputation, but they tend to
shrug it off as the price for living in such a beautiful setting.
</P>
<P>
	   Mowka said he has lived as far afield as Iran, Germany and Long Island, but
that Saranac Lake is the best and most beautiful.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary La Rose, a retiree who was looking out the window Friday morning to
watch chickadees flitting about her bird feeder, said it's important to keep in
mind the upsides of the area.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't have hurricanes and floods, so we have a little cold weather once
in while," she said. "That's not too bad."

<HEADLINE> Mexico City Cops Protest Salary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Hundreds of riot police blocked Mexico City streets
Friday to demand salary raises and other benefits, clogging key thoroughfares
and causing traffic jams that stretched for miles.
</P>
<P>
	   From before the morning rush hour until the evening, uniformed officers
parked buses at intersections and erected barricades to block main
thoroughfares, wreaking havoc for commuters.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers want 100 percent salary increases, better equipment and
benefits. They also called for the dismissal of their commander, the Televisa
network reported. The officers withdrew their roadblocks late Friday, but
continued to gather outside their headquarters demanding that officials
negotiate with them.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico City Mayor Rosario Robles said the protest was unjustified but
acknowledged that an accounting error had delayed paychecks for the officers,
the government news agency Notimex reported. She said the problem would be
resolved by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the afternoon, traffic was congested even further by another street
protest by administrative workers from the Autonomous University of Chapingo.
The demonstrators, who were demanding wage increases, walked onto the main
freeway that circles Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
	   For two hours, the university workers blocked traffic in both directions on
the Perifico Sur. Riot police who remained on duty during their colleagues'
protest were called in to dislodge the workers, Notimex reported.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Turns Up Heat on Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEBANON, N.H. (AP) -- Though supporters' views seemed decidedly mixed, Bill
Bradley kept up his aggressive criticism of Al Gore on Friday, questioning his
Democratic rival's truthfulness and portraying him as the kind of politician who
``uses words in a very tricky manner.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have to look at every word and every clause,'' Bradley said in a
comment echoing accusations that critics made about President Clinton during the
Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking the stage after Gore on Friday night, at a dinner benefiting the New
Hampshire Democratic Party, Bradley turned the heat on his opponent even hotter.
``We have to face up to the fund-raising scandals of 1996,'' Bradley said,
hoping to remind Democrats of Gore's central role in that controversy. ``If we
don't clean our house, the Republicans will clean it for us in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some Bradley supporters have said his new, more confrontational campaign
style has made them uncomfortable, and one questioned him about it face to face.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can you deal with the sleaze factor without yourself going through the
same type of tactic?'' asked Sonia Sheridan, who said she was troubled by the
new approach.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think you make a very good point,'' said Bradley. ``When someone
misrepresents your position as Al Gore has done consistently in this campaign,
you call them on it.''
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing Gore with an apparent lead just days before Tuesday's New
Hampshire primary, Bradley aides said he would continue his new tack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As voters make up their mind this weekend, we want to make sure they are
aware of the differences,'' said aide Anita Dunn.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheridan, the supporter who questioned Bradley, wasn't sure how the former
senator should respond to Gore's criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know what he should do so that's why I asked him,'' she said. As
for negative campaigning, she said, ``I certainly don't like that tactic but
Gore seems to be zooming because of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other Bradley supporters at campaign events Friday were less than
enthusiastic about his new approach.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It makes me uncomfortable,'' said Belinda Glennie. ``I'd rather see him be
the egghead he is.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've heard good reviews and I've heard bad reviews,'' said Nick Hanlon,
who attended a rally in Newport. ``I hope it doesn't turn people off.''
</P>
<P>
	   Unfazed, Bradley argued at rally after rally that Gore makes campaign
promises designed to be evasive or to mislead on issues ranging from gun control
to health care to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, Bradley said Gore talks about favoring licensing of handguns
but actually favors licensing of new handguns only.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem is not new handguns, the problem is all handguns,'' Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said little in response. ``I'm going to emphasize the positive,'' the
vice president said as he arrived in Portsmouth from his brief return to
Washington for Clinton's State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not going to get down to that level. I'm going to continue to
emphasize a positive agenda,'' he said later in an interview with WNDS-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Accompanied by former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Gore stuck to his
day's message -- that he is the only presidential candidate with the know-how to
keep the economy on track.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have just begun to prosper,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on a positive note, his campaign previewed for reporters a 30-minute ad
it will air on New Hampshire television Saturday. Besides commercials that have
already been running, it includes new scenes -- Gore playing Frisbee with his
wife and dancing with his daughter at her wedding -- showing him as a loving
husband and father.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the people at Gore's Portsmouth event, Bradley's recent criticism
seemed to have made an impact.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Northern Research and Engineering Corp., engineer Dave Glista, a
Democrat from Durham, said he was undecided but leaning toward Bradley, even
though his priority issues -- the economy and urban sprawl -- should put him in
Gore's camp.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone says Clinton is the king of smooth talking and political talking.
I'm sure Gore has picked up some of that, so I would be more leery of what he
says,'' Glista said.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Gore accuses Bradley of negative campaigning sparked by
desperation.
</P>
<P>
	   Undecided Democrat Amos Johnson had her own doubts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm more interested in the issues,'' Ms. Johnson said. ``This is a bit
abrasive. We're going to go see Al Gore tomorrow and we'll make up our mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Along the way Friday, Bradley collected the endorsement of Connecticut Gov.
Lowell Weicker. Weicker was a Republican senator before winning the governor's
office as an independent.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Bradley's strengths is his appeal to independent voters, and he was
hoping to use Weicker's backing to score points with independents on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Weicker aimed his pitch in their direction: ``The only independent thinker
and actor out there is Bill Bradley.''

   OSCEOLA, Iowa (AP) -- Four Mormon missionaries died Friday when their car
slammed into a pickup truck head-on. The driver of the truck also was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Iowa State Patrol, the men were headed westbound on U.S.
Highway 34, about eight miles west of Osceola, when the driver tried to pass
another vehicle and lost control.

Both vehicles burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
	   The four men were returning from a missionary conference in southern Iowa.
All four had been on missions in Des Moines for The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints for less than a year, said W. Craig Zwick, assistant executive
director of the church's missionary department.

<HEADLINE> Canucks 4, Sharks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Mark Messier scored two goals for the
first time in almost two years as the Vancouver Canucks snapped a six-game
winless streak with a 4-1 victory over the San Jose Sharks on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander Mogilny, back after missing seven games with an injury, and Donald
Brashear also scored for the Canucks, who ended an eight-game home winless slide
dating back to Dec. 22. The win was also Vancouver's first in eight meetings
against San Jose. They were 0-4-3 against the Sharks dating back to Feb. 7,
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sharks are 2-6-2 in their last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Messier, the NHL's leading active goal-scorer and points-producer -- scored
both of his goals on the power play, marking his first multiple-goal performance
since he scored twice in Vancouver's 6-4 loss to Ottawa on Feb. 28, 1998. With
nine goals on the season, Messier now has a career total of 619.
</P>
<P>
	   San Jose's Todd Harvey opened the scoring 28 seconds into the game.
Messier's first goal put the Canucks ahead for good, breaking a 1-1 tie with 14
seconds left in the first period.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattias Ohlund, who had two assists, set up the play. Going after his own
rebound, Ohlund kicked the puck free to Messier who, waiting alone just left of
the net, flipped it in the open side.
</P>
<P>
	   Brashear made it 3-1 when he beat San Jose goalie Steve Shields with a weak
40-footer with 2:51 left in the second period. The goal ended Shields night as
he was pulled in favor of backup Evgeni Nabokov.
</P>
<P>
	   Shields, who gave up three goals on 18 shots, has struggled, going 2-5-1 in
his last eight starts.
</P>
<P>
	   Messier then sealed the victory when he flipped in a rebound off Markus
Naslund's shot 5:48 into the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   The game's momentum turned in the opening minutes when the Sharks failed to
capitalize on a two-minute, two-man advantage. The Sharks managed just two shots
on net over the two-minute span and, to make matters worse, Mogilny wound up
tying the game 35 seconds after the penalties expired.
</P>
<P>
	   With Mogilny back in the lineup, the Canucks sent down rookie Steve Kariya
-- younger brother of Anaheim Mighty Ducks star Paul Kariya -- to the Syracuse
Crunch of the American Hockey League earlier in the day. After opening the
season with six goals and 11 points in 20 games, Kariya had been held without a
point in the last nine games he played.

half Friday night as the Los Angeles Lakers ended their only two-game losing
streak of the season with a 117-89 romp over the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>

quarter while the Bucks could not find the basket.
</P>
<P>

during a 14:25 span when they were outscored 35-9 and fell behind 108-77.

game, playing just 33 minutes. He went 13-of-18 from the floor.

<HEADLINE> Lehman Leads Phoenix Open  </HEADLINE>
    By MEL REISNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Tom Lehman cooled off just in time to put some
suspense back into the Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehman, who shot an 8-under-par 63 in the first round and shared a
three-stroke lead with Phil Mickelson going into the second, followed up with a
67 Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   He plateaued after birdies on three of the first five holes, allowing Frank
Lickliter to stay within one stroke. Lehman finished with four straight pars,
holing out in deep twilight on No. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   "My main objective on the 18th was just to make sure I finished strong,"
Lehman said. "Because it was dark, I didn't want to make a mistake. I was very
satisfied with a par there."
</P>
<P>
	   Lickliter carded a 64, reaching the midpoint at 11-under 131 and feeling
confident about his chances of picking up what would be his first PGA Tour
title.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I keep putting myself in this position, Rocco Mediate keeps telling me
I'll win by accident -- I'll birdie the last three holes or someone will bogey
the last three holes, or something," Lickliter said. "I feel like I keep getting
better every year."
</P>
<P>
	   Hal Sutton, Robert Allenby and Bradley Hughes were four shots off the pace
at 134, with Steve Flesch and Stewart Cink were one shot behind them.
</P>
<P>
	   Mickelson, who won the Phoenix Open four years ago, shot 73 and backed into
a five-way tie at 136 with Tom Pernice Jr., Kenny Perry, Paul Stankowski and
1993 champion Lee Janzen.
</P>
<P>
	   Frost delayed the start of play for 30 minutes in the morning, and darkness
forced the suspension of play with 21 players still on the course.
</P>
<P>
	   That kept the PGA from announcing the cut pending completion of the round
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   It was projected at 142, with 65 players who finished the round at par or
lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Mediate (137), the defending champion, 1998 winner Jesper Parnevik (138) and
1997 Phoenix medalist Steve Jones (139) easily qualified to play the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Azinger, the 1987 Phoenix winner and the winner two weeks ago in
Honolulu, was likely to miss the cut after rounds of 76 and 70.
</P>
<P>
	   Noted newcomers Sergio Garcia and Gary Nicklaus, son of Jack Nicklaus, also
were at 146.
</P>
<P>
	   Lehman's approach shots were uncanny. He had birdie putts of 8, 10 and 10
feet on Nos. 2, 3 and 5, birdied No. 10 from four feet and got his fifth birdie
on the 13th hole with an 8-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
	   At the 14th hole, he made his only bogey of the tournament after lofting an
8-iron to the back of the green, leaving the chip five feet short and missing
the par putt.
</P>
<P>
	   "I definitely feel like I'm in great position," said Lehman, who won $1
million in the Williams World Challenge on Jan. 2 and tied for sixth in
Honolulu, his only official PGA event before this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Lickliter, who shot a career-low 62 in a round at Honolulu, had five birdies
and an easy eagle-3 on the 501-yard 15th hole, where he dropped a 3-iron
approach within 3 1/2 feet.

Storm Spreads More Snow in South
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A storm spread still more snow across the Deep South on
Friday, giving children from Arkansas to Georgia a rare chance to build snowmen
but threatening travel to the Super Bowl. The storm, which dumped up to 17
inches of snow in Oklahoma earlier this week, dropped between an inch and a foot
in Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee before stalling near the
Alabama-Georgia line for most of the day Friday. As midnight approached,
however, the storm was moving through northern Georgia, National Weather Service
meteorologist Terry Murphy said. Areas in north Georgia and parts of central
Georgia got snow, sleet and freezing rain, he said.

Bradley Turns Up Heat on Gore
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LEBANON, N.H. (AP) -- Though supporters' views seemed decidedly mixed, Bill
Bradley kept up his aggressive criticism of Al Gore on Friday, questioning his
Democratic rival's truthfulness and portraying him as the kind of politician who
"uses words in a very tricky manner." "You have to look at every word and every
clause," Bradley said in a comment echoing accusations that critics made about
President Clinton during the Lewinsky investigation. Taking the stage after Gore
on Friday night, at a dinner benefiting the New Hampshire Democratic Party,
Bradley turned the heat on his opponent even hotter. "We have to face up to the
fund-raising scandals of 1996," Bradley said, hoping to remind Democrats of
Gore's central role in that controversy.

Bad Brakes Cited in Ark. Plane Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An American Airlines jet that crashed off the end
of a wet runway in a storm could have landed safely if all its braking systems
had worked properly, aviation experts testified Friday. Instead, Flight 1420
left the runway still going about 100 mph, then hit a metal lighting structure,
broke apart and caught fire. Eleven people died in the June 1 crash. The
McDonnell-Douglas MD-82 landed in heavy rain and 25 mph crosswinds, but that
alone was not enough to cause it to run off the runway, according to Boeing
Corp. tests. The plane's braking was hindered because it did not use its
spoilers -- wing panels that help deceleration by putting more weight on the
wheels, said Thomas Yager, a NASA research engineer who specializes in runway
braking.

<HEADLINE> Federal judge may ease GOP primary ballot rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal judge considering whether to restore Sen. John
McCain's name to state presidential primary ballots accused New York's GOP
leaders of trying to guarantee Texas Gov. George W. Bush an uncontested ride
through the March 7 primary.
<P>
	   "Isn't that the reality of what's happening here?" U.S. District Judge
Edward Korman asked Friday during a 3 1/2 hour conference with lawyers from the
state GOP and the campaigns of McCain, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes. "It's being
done to wall off the Republican primary."
</P>
<P>
	   Korman said it appeared top state Republicans had designed onerous ballot
access rules in an effort to save Bush, their chosen candidate, the trouble of
fending off primary challenges. The judge said he was considering cutting by 80
percent the number of signatures state GOP leaders can require candidates to
collect.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would issue a decision by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
	   A state judge threw McCain's name off ballots in eight New York
congressional districts on Thursday, leaving him unable to contest the March 7
primary in 14 of the state's 31 districts. The possibility that Republicans in
more than a third of the state may be unable to vote for a candidate who some
polls show leading in the crucial New Hampshire primary has prompted renewed
criticism of New York's notoriously tough ballot access rules.
</P>
<P>
	   "The cumulative effect of these rules makes it virtually impossible for
candidates to get on the ballot without spending a huge amount of money" or
having the support of the state party, McCain attorney Burt Neuborne said in
Brooklyn federal court. "It seriously burdens voters of the state of New York if
they cannot express their support for Sen. John McCain."
</P>
<P>
	   State party leaders say the requirements are a legitimate way of determining
whether candidates have statewide support and that McCain's campaign should have
done a better job of signature-gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   "The McCain campaign was not a reasonably diligent campaign, and that's the
standard," said Lawrence Mandelker, a lawyer for the state party.
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes campaign joined McCain's lawsuit and asked Korman to place the
millionaire publisher's name back on the ballot in three Long Island
congressional districts where his petitions were declared invalid. Forbes has so
far spent more than $650,000 trying to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, stumping in New Hampshire, said he welcomed Forbes' involvement in
the case. "I am glad he's joined us," McCain said. "It shows that other people
are deprived" ballot access too.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Keyes asked the judge to eliminate the requirement that
signatures be collected district by district, and instead allow candidates to
appear on the ballot if they gather 5,000 names statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes and Gary Bauer decided not to contest the New York primary because of
the complicated requirements, but Keyes' lawyers asked that both candidates be
allowed to try again under a lower standard.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal judge appeared to be considering a reduction in the number of
signatures Republican candidates must collect in each congressional district.
</P>
<P>
	   Candidates are now required to get signatures of .5 percent of each
district's registered Republicans, plus 5,000 more signatures statewide. Korman
discussed with lawyers the possibility of reducing the district requirement to
.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes sued successfully in federal court in 1996 to appear on the ballot
when state party leaders lined up behind eventual nominee Bob Dole. Korman ruled
then that the party must reduce its per-district signature requirement from 5
percent to .5 percent. Party leaders and the state legislature decided last year
to use the judge's requirement this time around.
</P>
<P>
	   But Korman on Friday criticized the GOP for imposing other burdensome rules
and said because so many signatures are challenged, the .5 percent "is not a
true .5 percent."
</P>
<P>
	   He questioned the requirement that volunteers only be allowed to gather
signatures in their own districts, the imposition of a 37-day limit on petition
drives, and the fact that the drives fall during the busy holiday season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why are there 37 days only?" the judge asked. "Why is it ... the hardest 37
days? Why are there restrictions on who can circulate petitions? ... There ought
to be some answers."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Forbes plans to challenge Bush's petitions in six districts where
campaign workers claim to have uncovered fraud, including lists of signatures
apparently written in the same handwriting.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeffrey Buley, general counsel to the state Republican committee, said that
although there might be isolated incidents of fraud, he was confident all of
Bush's petitions were valid.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Roundup  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- While baseball wondered whether Juan Gonzalez would get a
record-setting deal, some older players found new teams Friday and four in
arbitration settled on new contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   Talk of a possible $140 million, eight-year contract between Detroit and its
new outfielder buzzed through team offices. But there was no indication a deal
was done or even close.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the sides said they are talking.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have had ongoing negotiations for some time," Tigers general manager
Randy Smith said. "The talks have been very private and anything I say would
probably be detrimental."
</P>
<P>
	   If Gonzalez does get a $140 million, eight-year deal, the average salary of
$17.5 million would break the current mark of $15 million, set on Dec. 12, 1998,
when Kevin Brown and the Los Angeles Dodgers agreed to a $105 million,
seven-year contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortstop Derek Jeter and the New York Yankees have been talking about a
$118.5 million, seven-year contract, which would average $16,928,571.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, some veterans out on the market agreed to minor league contracts:
Bobby Bonilla with Atlanta, Danny Tartabull with San Diego and Mark Wohlers with
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonilla, cut loose by the New York Mets earlier this month, would get a
$200,000, one-year contract if he makes the roster of the Braves, who are

<HEADLINE> Lakers 117, Bucks 89  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN PETERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 26 of his 30 points in the first
half Friday night as the Los Angeles Lakers ended their only two-game losing
streak of the season with a 117-89 romp over the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
	   Kobe Bryant added 23 points for Los Angeles, which took control in the third
quarter while the Bucks could not find the basket.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting with 7:21 left in the third, the Bucks missed 19 consecutive shots
during a 14:25 span when they were outscored 35-9 and fell behind 108-77.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Cassell scored 18 for Milwaukee and Vinny Del Negro had 15 points off
the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   Glen Rice added 19 points for Los Angeles and Ron Harper had 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal also blocked four shots and had eight rebounds and got a rare restful
game, playing just 33 minutes. He went 13-of-18 from the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucks' most lopsided loss prior to the game was an 106-84 defeat at
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers had lost four of their last six, including a defeat at Indiana
that stopped their 16-game winning streak. Los Angeles' 34-9 record is still the
best in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers had gotten little time off so far this month, playing 20 games in
12 days before getting a three-day break heading in against the Bucks, and they
looked rested, especially O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
	   Coming into the game against the Bucks, the Lakers had lost 95-91 to
Portland in Los Angeles and 105-101 at Utah in double overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Their victory was their ninth straight over Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing 48-47 five minutes into the second quarter, the Lakers outscored
Milwaukee 20-8, including a 16-5 stretch, to lead 67-55 at halftime. O'Neal had
16 points in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   He missed just two of his 13 field goal attempts in the first half and also
had five rebounds and blocked three shots.

<HEADLINE> PETA: Pigeon Sharpshooters Inhumane  </HEADLINE>
   By HADLEY PAWLAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Animal rights activists say there are better ways city
officials can control nuisance pigeons, rather than having them shot at by
animal control sharpshooters.
</P>
<P>
	   Six Animal Control workers carry .22-caliber rifles when they are called to
handle residents' complaints about unwanted wildlife.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are a bunch of inhumane cowboys enjoying target practice on taxpayer
dollars,'' said Stephanie Boyles, wildlife biologist for People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals. ``Residents who like pigeons or those who just don't want
bullets flying down their street shouldn't be paying for this.''
</P>
<P>
	   PETA suggests making pigeon roosting site less hospitable by tying up wind
chimes, playing a radio, putting up effigies of predator birds or flying a
balloon with big eyes drawn on it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People feed the birds or leave their trash out attracting them,'' Ms.
Boyles said. ``And then the birds are shot at, paying for our
irresponsibility.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor's spokesman Peter Cutler said PETA's suggestions will be considered.
He said the city is concerned about shooting in residential areas -- which would
be illegal in most municipalities if done by private citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're concerned for the health and safety of all residents, so we need to
watch out for disease, but on the same token we don't want anybody harmed while
these guys are out there,'' Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the rifles are used only in the most extreme circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Poincelot, the city's head pest-control and wildlife officer, told the
Buffalo News that pest-control officers sometimes go through 50 or 60 rounds of
ammunition in one day.
</P>
<P>
	   Shooters often are called to clear away birds perched on roof peaks of
single- and two-family houses.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials insist the shooters don't miss. Although a .22-caliber bullet can
travel a mile or more and potentially through a bird, animal control officials
say people aren't in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   Buffalo officials said other communities have killed nuisance birds by
shooting them. Salem, Ore., stopped shooting pigeons in 1998 after animal
activists protested.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Mayor Arrested in Sweep  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER KERR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The mayor of neighboring Folsom was among eight
people arrested in a police sweep targeting drugs and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said Mayor Everett Reginald Drew, known as Reggie Drew, offered an
undercover female officer cash and cocaine for sex.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew, leaving jail Friday morning, waved his arms when asked about the
charges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until we're through the judicial process, I can't comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's police sweep was the second made under a new city law that allows
authorities to impound cars used in prostitution and drug crimes, Police Chief
Arturo Venegas said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drew, 57, was booked on five felony and misdemeanor prostitution and drug
counts, and released on $5,000 bond. The Sacramento County district attorney
will decide whether to file formal charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Ted Mandalla said Drew approached the undercover officer, who was
standing on a Sacramento street, and offered cash and a ``small quantity of rock
cocaine for the sex act they agreed upon.''
</P>
<P>
	   They went to a nearby motel the police were using for the sweep and arrested
Drew there, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Results of chemical tests taken to determine if Drew was under the influence
of drugs are not yet back, Mandalla said.
</P>
<P>
	   Folsom, a city of 48,000 in eastern Sacramento County, is known mainly for
its giant state prison complex. Drew also is a manager with the state Prison
Industry Authority.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Attend Economic Forum  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- President Clinton's whirlwind visit here today
raises to a new high the American profile at an annual gathering of economic and
political leaders, at a time when the forum is wresting with tensions between
haves and have-nots in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's acceptance of the invitation of the World Economic Forum was a
coup for the foundation that runs the meeting and the Swiss professor Klaus
Schwab, who started the annual meetings 30 years ago as an informal gathering of
economic elites.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the first time an American president has joined the gathering. Top
administration officials and leading members of Congress and state governments
have routinely attended the forums, but the Clinton entourage makes this the
biggest U.S. delegation yet, a forum spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	   One organizer quipped there will be more members of the U.S. Cabinet here
than there usually are in Washington, D.C. They include Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Commerce Secretary William Daley, Treasury Secretary
Lawrence H. Summers and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, as well as other top
Clinton administration officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was preceded to Davos by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in 1998,
when she appealed for more attention to the needs of women and children. Last
year Vice President Al Gore used the forum to propose ``broad and deep'' cuts in
barriers to farm trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Undaunted by threats of anti-free trade demonstrations, Clinton was expected
to return in his speech today to the same theme he addressed in Seattle last
month: the need to include worker rights and environmental safeguards in global
trade talks.
</P>
<P>
	   His audience in the Alpine resort -- nearly 2,000 leaders of world
corporations, governments and academia -- has already been urged by other top
speakers -- including British Prime Minister Tony Blair -- to take steps in
world trade that will allay the anxieties of people fearing a loss of jobs or
income because of shifting investments.
</P>
<P>
	   Groups that oppose the closed meetings of the six-day forum and the
megacorporations represented in Davos plan to defy a Swiss ban on demonstrations
today. They say the elite meeting has undue influence on the lives of people
around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Security in the narrow valley town has been tightened further, with checks
being made on people traveling into the resort by road or train. The Swiss army
has been dispatched for the first time to act as reinforcements to police
brought in from across Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   The session of the World Trade Organization in Seattle late last year saw
large demonstrations by opponents, and some protests turned into violent clashes
with police.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's views on trade coincide with those of many peaceful anti-WTO
protesters in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   The ideas clash, however, with those of many developing countries that
regard the attempt to impose labor standards in trade agreements as being unfair
interference in their affairs by rich nations. And a new trade round will fail
to go forward until it receives support from across the 135-member WTO.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's arrival Friday started shifting the attention of the gathering to
the search for solutions to regional tensions.
</P>
<P>
	   She met separately with the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey Friday,
encouraging the cautious steps the two NATO allies are taking to overcome
decades of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said Clinton and Albright would be meeting with other leaders
representing peoples involved in regional tensions or conflicts, including the
presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also is to join Clinton in a session with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Friday canceled his visit to
the forum, which ruled out a possible three-way meeting on Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone in Davos was thrilled by Clinton's appearance at the forum.
Bruno Gerber, the 13,000-population town's tourism director, said, ``We are not
ready and not big enough and not organized enough in such a small resort to have
such an army of people just trying to secure one man.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm quite glad that he's not going to stay here for a couple of days,''
Gerber told The Associated Press. ``That would not be good for the resort.''

<HEADLINE> $1M Bond for Accused Teen Mom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Bond has been set at $1 million for a teen-ager who
allegedly dumped her newborn baby into the garbage just seven hours after giving
birth.
</P>
<P>
	   Tanisha P. Montague, 19, is charged with attempted first-degree murder. If
convicted, she could be sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Montague gave birth alone late Tuesday. Montgomery County police said she
cared for the girl for about seven hours, then, frustrated, she put the child in
a plastic bag, tied the top and dumped her in a trash container at an apartment
complex.
</P>
<P>
	   A neighbor heard the child crying and rescued her minutes before the garbage
was to have been collected. She is recovering at a hospital and was expected to
go into foster care next week.
</P>
<P>
	   State's attorney Douglas Gansler had requested that Montague be held without
bond, but said he was satisfied with the $1 million figure.
</P>
<P>
	   Gansler said Montague is a flight risk because she is in the United States
illegally. He said she arrived from Jamaica on June 27, 1998, with a visitor's
visa that expired six months later, and never left.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A woman who prosecutors said made her daughter
so sick that the girl had her gall bladder, appendix and part of her intestines
removed has been sentenced to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Kathy Bush, who was convicted in October of child abuse and fraud, also
received five years' probation.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Bush, 42, had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a psychological
disorder in which a parent causes illnesses in the child to get attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never harmed my daughter -- physically, emotionally, psychologically or
medically,'' Bush told the judge. ``I love Jennifer with all my heart and all my
soul.''
</P>
<P>
	   By 1996, when the state started its investigation, Jennifer had been
hospitalized 200 times and had undergone about 40 operations. Doctors treated
her for seizures, infections and symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Bush gave her daughter excessive dosages of seizure
medication, tampered with her feeding machine and fabricated symptoms on her
medical charts.

<HEADLINE> Son of Civil Rights Leader Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
   By RUSS BYNUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A former state senator and son of a civil rights leader has
been sentenced to four years in prison for billing $5,700 in phony expenses to
the state and asking a witness to help him cover it up.
</P>
<P>
	   Ralph David Abernathy III, the son and namesake of one of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.'s top lieutenants, was indicted in 1998 on 35 counts accusing
him of stealing more than $13,000.
</P>
<P>
	   After one trial ended with a hung jury, he was convicted last month of 18
counts, for taking $5,700, committing forgery, violating his oath of office and
offering a witness $2,700.
</P>
<P>
	   Abernathy, 40, claimed the bogus expenses between 1994 and 1997 and said
much of the money went to pay aides for legislative services. He was convicted
of forging the aides' names on letters claiming they had received the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Abernathy also received six years of probation despite pleas for leniency
from his mother and the Rev. Hosea Williams, a civil rights leader and close
friend of Abernathy's late father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My son is not a criminal. He is not a crook. He has made some mistakes, as
all of us in this room have,'' Juanita Abernathy said of her son.
</P>
<P>
	   Abernathy served three terms in the state Senate but was barred from seeking
re-election in 1998 because his $400 qualifying check bounced.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate reprimanded Abernathy in 1998 after he was caught with a small
amount of marijuana in his underwear at the Atlanta airport after a flight from
Jamaica.

<HEADLINE> AP Names Editors to New Positions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press has named veteran editors Randolph
Picht and Darrell Christian to new positions in its business news and markets
information services.
</P>
<P>
	   Picht will become director of AP Market Information, directing a unit that
consolidates the news service's distribution of financial statistics. Christian
will succeed Picht as business editor, directing AP's reporting of worldwide
business, finance and technology news.
</P>
<P>
	   The appointments were announced Friday by William Ahearn, AP vice president
and executive editor, and John Reid, vice president and director of
communications.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization of two senior editor posts to oversee separate elements of
AP's financial coverage reflects the growth of both fields: business and
technology news coverage, and AP's expanding offerings of financial market
information for newspapers, broadcast and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian, a native of Henderson, Ky., is a former managing editor and
sports editor at AP. He began his newspaper career as a sports writer and sports
editor on the Henderson Gleaner in 1964.
</P>
<P>
	   He worked for the AP in Charleston, W.Va., before serving in the Navy in
1969-1972, then worked for AP in Indianapolis in 1972. He became Indianapolis
news editor in 1975 and moved to the Washington bureau in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian, 51, was named deputy sports editor in 1981, sports editor in 1985
and managing editor in 1992. Last year, he was named to head AP MegaSports, a
sports statistics service for Web sites.
</P>
<P>
	   Picht has been AP business news editor since 1997, overseeing both business
news coverage and markets information services.
</P>
<P>
	   He is a native of Deer Park, N.Y., and a University of Missouri graduate. He
began his journalism career at the Enterprise-Journal in McComb, Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   Picht, 40, joined the AP as a newsman in Albany in 1983 and was named
correspondent in Rochester, N.Y., two years later. In 1989, he was appointed
correspondent in charge of the St. Louis bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, he was named assistant business editor, consulting with AP member
newspapers on the content and technology of the AP's SelectStocks service.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Chicago Gangster Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEBOYGAN, Wis. (AP) -- Authorities here have arrested a man who allegedly
ran the drug trade for Chicago's largest street gang.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Marshals service said Johnny Jackson, 27, had gone into hiding and
had been living in Sheboygan for about five to six months before he was arrested
at his home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Since going into hiding, Jackson had worked menial jobs in Indiana,
Minnesota and Wisconsin, most recently at a Sheboygan cheese factory,
investigator John Ambrose said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson was ordered detained Friday by a U.S. magistrate judge, pending a
transfer to Chicago. He was the only high-ranking member of the Gangster
Disciples, a 5,000-member gang, who remained at large.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson is thought to have run day-to-day drug money collection for the
Gangster Disciples, the marshals service said.
</P>
<P>
	   He was named in a 50-count federal drug indictment in 1995, and the U.S.
Marshals Service called him one of its 15 most wanted fugitives.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson also is sought for questioning about a 1998 apartment fire that
killed his common-law wife, the service said.

   YARDLEY, Pa. (AP) -- The Charmin was unscathed, but not the cookies and
bread. Managers at three supermarkets said they kept finding shelves of crumbled
cookies and smashed loaves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was mutilated. You could actually see there was a hand there,'' said
Lou DeFranceseo, general manager of McCaffrey's market, where the culprit struck
dozens of times.
</P>
<P>
	   Now they may have found their masher -- a man charged this week with
disorderly conduct and criminal mischief for allegedly putting the squeeze on
$8,000 worth of baked goods over three years.
</P>
<P>
	   A cookie company finally installed a hidden camera trained on the cookie
aisle at a Giant supermarket. And that, police said, led to the arrest of Samuel
Feldman, 37.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Ellis Klein denied his client damaged any baked goods,
saying Feldman's presence near a shelf of mashed food was purely circumstantial.
As for squeezing the bread, Klein said, everyone does it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I squeeze bread when I go to the store, but I don't get arrested for it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Feldman was arraigned Wednesday and freed on $10,000 bail.

	   But the immigrants ignore the agents. They float past and vanish into the
night, holding the inner tube with one hand and gripping black plastic bags
containing their dry clothes with the other.
</P>
<P>
	   The immigrants have beaten the Border Patrol. That's because agents draw the
line at getting in the New River -- an oily, foul-smelling stew of raw sewage,
industrial waste, agricultural runoff and trash that flows from the border city
of Mexicali, Mexico, into the California desert.
</P>
<P>
	   Desperate to reach the United States and blocked by tighter security
elsewhere along the Southwestern border, illegal immigrants use the river as a
nearly guaranteed path into the region east of San Diego, one of the nation's
busiest corridors for illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   Some immigrants may not know the New River is badly polluted; others don't
care.
</P>
<P>
	   The river is posted with signs warning of drowning, rattlesnakes and the
treacherous terrain, but not pollution. Still, a glance and a sniff are all it
takes to know. Stiff clumps of foam glide along on the surface. Plastic jugs,
empty cans and blocks of wood bob in the water and line the banks. The stench of
sewage is overpowering.
</P>
<P>
	   What's not seen are the carcinogens, bacteria and viruses.
</P>
<P>
	   Anyone who swims in the river risks exposure to such things as salmonella,
typhoid, E. coli bacteria and parasites, said Yvonne Smith, public health
director for Imperial County.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like having a rattlesnake in your backyard,'' she said. ``You have no
idea when it's going to hit and make someone sick.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sometimes agents find dark-colored vomit from immigrants who swallowed river
water and got sick after reaching the river banks.
</P>
<P>
	   But if immigrants are falling ill from the water, they aren't reporting it,
said Vivian Perez, administrator of an Imperial Valley clinic for migrant
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They make jokes about it,'' Perez said. ``They say, `Go in the New River
and you come out glowing.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Border Patrol agent Matt Daly fell in while chasing a
group of immigrants. He immediately went back to the station for a shower, then
to a hospital for a hepatitis A vaccine and a polio booster shot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I got some in my mouth. It was a bad experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 11 immigrants floated through the gap in the 12-foot steel border
fence on Jan. 23. Wetjen said 75 made it the night before and 25 earlier that
week. January is a busy time because many Mexicans went home for the holidays
and are returning to jobs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Luis Angel, who monitors the river for the state Water Resources
Control Board, has photographed immigrants camouflaging themselves with the
foam, piling it on their heads as they float downstream. Border agents have seen
parents use the foam to hide their babies and older children.
</P>
<P>
	   The immigrants' goal is to float across the border less than a mile to
Calexico, where they slip into neighborhoods until someone picks them up.
</P>
<P>
	   About 20 minutes after the men passed Wetjen on the inner tube, he spotted
them walking down a Calexico street in dry clothes. He stopped his Chevy Tahoe,
but they scattered when he got out. Wetjen caught one.
</P>
<P>
	   The one caught, Francisco Campos, said he is from the state of Jalisco on
Mexico's Pacific coast. He had been headed for the San Fernando Valley in Los
Angeles to work. Campos, wearing a flannel work shirt, boots and a Denver
Broncos baseball cap, said he had never heard of the New River until he arrived
in Mexicali three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't know it was dangerous,'' he said. ``They said there's no current,
but the current is really strong. And it's cold.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campos was taken back to the station for fingerprinting and was promptly
returned to Mexico with a warning that he shower and change his clothes to avoid
getting sick.
</P>
<P>
	   The Environmental Protection Agency lists the river as one of the most
polluted in North America. It contains 15 million gallons of untreated or
partially treated sewage from the overwhelmed sewer system in Mexicali, a city
of more than 600,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Eugenia McNaughton, who monitors the river for the EPA, said Mexico and the
United States are working to reduce the pollution, spending $50 million to
expand Mexicali's sewer capacity.

<HEADLINE> Book Cites France Prison Horrors  </HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE GANLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- Its high stone walls cast an ominous shadow across the busy
tree-lined boulevard. Its name belies the jail within.
</P>
<P>
	   The maximum security Prison de la Sante -- meaning ``health'' -- is a
scourge on the heart of Paris, according to Veronique Vasseur, who has run the
penitentiary's medical department since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Her book, ``Chief Doctor at La Sante Prison,'' published this month in
France, reveals a hidden world of horrors just feet from a sidewalk lined with
chestnut trees in southern Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   In a universe where victims and violence steal headlines, Vasseur's graphic
account of cockroaches and rats, rapes and self-mutilations shocked authorities
and -- within a week after excerpts were published in the daily Le Monde -- drew
promises of major reforms in French prisons.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the nation's 187 prisons, 109 are more than 80 years old, Justice
Minister Elisabeth Guigou said last week. She conceded that La Sante -- built in
1867 -- is a ``dilapidated establishment which does not meet the norms that our
nation has a right to expect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, 124 prisoners committed suicide in French jails -- one of the
highest rates in Europe, according to the International Prison Observatory.
Three inmates took their lives at La Sante, where 1,202 people are currently
jailed.
</P>
<P>
	   Last weekend, Guigou announced the closure of three prisons she described as
``shameful ruins'' and plans to build seven new ones. The nation's five largest
facilities, including La Sante, will be renovated, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Vasseur's book, an account of her work -- often on the job alone in the
middle of the night -- breached the wall of silence surrounding the prison
system.
</P>
<P>
	   La Sante is not just any institution.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, other prisons may be worse than La Sante. But for many French, the
19th century prison where terrorists, spies, politicians and poets were jailed
epitomizes the very idea of incarceration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a place peopled with phantoms,'' Vasseur wrote, recalling that
writers Paul Verlaine and Guillaume Apollinaire spent time there, as did painter
Le Douanier Rousseau.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the man known as Carlos the Jackal, once considered the world's most
wanted terrorist, is serving a life sentence there.
</P>
<P>
	   Vasseur, who still works at La Sante, described the institution as a
wasteland with ``not a trace of grass, not a plant, not a flower, not a single
tree'' on the 10-acre sprawl.
</P>
<P>
	   And she painted a picture of a vermin-infested cells where orange peels are
used to hide the stench of toilets; skin diseases are the norm; sex, though
forbidden, is common among prisoners and staff; and the weak are victimized by
rackets and rapes.
</P>
<P>
	   Some prisoners turn to self-mutilation, the prison doctor said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's incredible what they can swallow: razor blades, keys, coins, nail
clippers, knives, forks, spoons, nuts, bolts, nails, spectacles,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   State Prosecutor Jean-Pierre Dintilhac denounced the ``excessive'' and
``voluntarily provocative'' account by Vasseur, and a prison employees' union
demanded she apologize for implicating prison guards in beatings and sexual
acts.
</P>
<P>
	   However, La Sante's director, Alain Jego, recently opened the prison doors
for a rare visit by several journalists whose grim description of overcrowding
and moldy showers reinforced Vasseur's account.
</P>
<P>
	   More than two dozen public figures who have been imprisoned, including a
former president of the oil giant Elf-Aquitaine, Loik Le Floch-Prigent,
published a petition denouncing prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The petition, addressed to the justice minister, notes a system by which
rich prisoners are allowed to use their money to buy a television set, a private
refrigerator and ``decent food'' while poor prisoners go without.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Prison is a world of humiliations, scandalous inequalities where the law
of the strongest and the privileges of money reign,'' the petition says.
``Prison is a school for crime.''
</P>
<P>
	   The petition says that about half of France's prisoners -- 40 percent at La
Sante -- are awaiting trial ``and therefore presumed innocent.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have tears in my eyes,'' Vasseur wrote. She had just learned that
prisoners are sent to La Sante in tiny cubicles in the back of trucks: ``Like
cattle.''

<HEADLINE> Castro: Elian's Mom Was 'Kidnapped'  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro says Elian Gonzalez' mother was
``practically kidnapped'' by her boyfriend and intimidated into leaving for the
United States, countering claims that she was on a flight to freedom with her
6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
	   Many who want Elian to remain in the United States say his mother, Elisabeth
Brotons, was trying to bring him to freedom in a voyage across the Straits of
Florida that ended with shipwreck. She and 10 others drowned and Elian was left
floating alone in an inner-tube.
</P>
<P>
	   But Castro, speaking to a conference of economists Friday, denounced that
idea. He blamed the tragedy on Brotons' boyfriend Lazaro Rafael Munero, who
apparently organized the ill-fated journey in late November which he also died.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mother was practically kidnapped along with the boy'' to make the
trip, Castro said. ``The mother was taken in conditions of intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Castro called Munero a ``ruffian'' on whom Cuban police had amassed ''100
pages of reports.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to sources quoted by the Miami Herald, Munero -- who reportedly
drove a taxi in the Cuban city of Cardenas -- had fled to Florida in June 1998
and returned to Cuba later that year, only to be jailed for several months.
</P>
<P>
	   Castro called Brotons ``an excellent girl'' who had suffered seven
miscarriages before delivering Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One who is born among eight pregnancies: How desired that child must be,''
Castro said. Brotons had separated from Elian's father several years ago, though
both continued to see the child regularly.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, tens of thousands of children took part in a
government-organized rally in Havana calling for the return of Cuba's ``boy
hero.'' The rally Friday also celebrated the birth of independence hero Jose
Marti and called both martyrs.
</P>
<P>
	   Castro said Cuba could carry on such protests -- which have continued daily
for two months -- ``for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers, meanwhile, were considering returning home to Cuba
after a week in the United States trying to win the boy's return, said the Rev.
Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches. The New York-based
group has facilitated their travel and supports the boy's repatriation.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's great-uncle and other relatives in Miami are fighting to keep him
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled Elian should return to
his father in Cuba. But its order has not been carried out because the federal
government agreed to hold off until the Miami relatives could challenge it in
court.
</P>
<P>
	   At a hearing Friday in Miami, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler moved up
to Feb. 22 from March 6 the date when he would hear arguments on whether the
relatives' lawsuit should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   While a move in Congress to grant the child U.S. citizenship seemed to be
faltering, the nun who hosted a meeting between the boy and his grandmothers
urged U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday to let the boy stay in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin told Reno in a meeting Friday that she has come to
believe separating Elian from his Florida relatives would be ``another traumatic
loss for him'' after the death of his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno, a longtime friend of O'Laughlin, said she continues to support the
INS's ruling for the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin conceded to reporters, ``I am no longer neutral'' in the Elian
question. Reno had chosen the nun as a disinterested party to host the
grandmothers' visit with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   In Havana on Friday, tens of thousands of children flooded the Plaza of the
Revolution to deliver a dual homage to Marti and Elian. Wearing red Communist
Pioneer neckerchiefs, children recited poems they wrote for Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   The Communist Party daily Granma called Elian a ``symbol of the crimes and
injustices imperialism is capable of committing against an innocent.''
</P>
<P>
	   It compared the boy's image, emblazoned on hundreds of thousands of T-shirts
here, with that of revolutionary icon Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, one that will
``spread across the world and remain forever in our mind and in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Old Havana, hundreds of children marched around the Parque Central
chanting ``We will save Elian!'' Some girls wore construction-paper handcuffs --
an apparent reference to the government's claim Elian has been kidnapped.

<HEADLINE> Doomsday Cult Seeks To Soften Image  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI KAGEYAMA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) -- Since his release from prison a month ago, Fumihiro
Joyu has presented a very different image from that of the strident spokesman he
once was for the doomsday cult accused in the 1995 nerve gas attack on Tokyo's
subways.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading his religious garb for a suit and tie, Joyu and other cult members
have embarked on a campaign of apologies, vows of reform and statements
distancing themselves from the guru they once worshipped as a living god.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, they are generating more fear than sympathy.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities see the cult's claims of contrition as an attempt to get around
laws passed last month that strengthen the government's hand in seizing cult
assets and monitoring its activities.
</P>
<P>
	   And as further evidence all is not well, police are still trying to unravel
the bizarre kidnapping earlier this month of Asahara's eldest son -- possibly
indicating a power struggle within the cult.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The public reaction to the cult has been utter rejection,'' said Makoto
Hogetsu, a crime expert and professor of sociology at Kyoto University. ``People
see their overtures as camouflage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Though the cult has never stopped functioning, Joyu's return has greatly
increased worries that it may enjoy a resurgence.
</P>
<P>
	   Eloquent and charismatic, Joyu, 37, was one of the cult's most high-profile
members at the time of the March 1995 subway attack. He was never charged in the
gassing, but served a three-year prison sentence for a cult-related forgery.
</P>
<P>
	   With the cult's other leaders still in prison or on trial, Joyu appears to
be filling the leadership vacuum. He has denied taking over the helm, but
shortly after his release, he announced a need for ``fundamental reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   That included removing Asahara as guru. While insisting that Asahara was
spiritually ``a genius,'' Joyu acknowledged the old leadership, including
Asahara, was responsible for the gassing.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Asahara ordered cult followers to poke holes in plastic bags
filled with lethal sarin gas, spreading the poison and sending commuters into
convulsions. A dozen people died and thousands were sickened.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack was intended to set off a chain of events leading to Armageddon,
and followers justified their actions by asserting that the cult had the right
to kill those it deemed unenlightened.
</P>
<P>
	   Though a shadow of its former self -- the cult now has about 2,000 members
in Japan, down from the 10,000 it claimed before the attack -- it has been
regaining strength.
</P>
<P>
	   Police say it also has a solid financial base, earning about $66 million a
year from a chain of discount computer shops.
</P>
<P>
	   That prompted parliament to pass legislation requiring the cult to report
its activities every three months and allowing police to inspect the group's
facilities without warrants.
</P>
<P>
	   A government panel is expected to decide in the next few weeks whether the
cult continues to pose enough of a danger to be subjected to such laws.
</P>
<P>
	   To prove it isn't a threat, the cult has promised to compensate victims of
the subway gas attack -- something it had long refused to do.
</P>
<P>
	   And to further bolster the argument it is now a different group than it was
five years ago, it has even changed its name -- from Aum Shinri Kyo to Aleph,
the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet.
</P>
<P>
	   But the cult's position has been seriously undermined by police reports that
some of its members are suspected in the Jan. 21 kidnapping of Asahara's
7-year-old son. The boy has since been found and is in government custody. His
mother has been convicted of murdering a cult member and is in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The cult has officially replaced Asahara with Tatsuko Muraoka, but she is
largely seen as a figurehead.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the cult's leadership is believed to center around Joyu, Asahara's
children and those senior officials closely linked with them. Asahara's
16-year-old daughter, who is revered as possessing spiritual powers, is being
sought as a suspect in the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
	   All of this has raised concern among people living near cult members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're fed up,'' says Kazuo Takahashi, 65, who runs a shoe repair shop near
the riot-police guarded apartment building where Joyu now lives. ``I want him
out. But I hate to say it because he's just going to mean big trouble to others
somewhere else.''

<HEADLINE> Painting that helped topple S&AMP;L is sold at Sotheby's  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Old Master painting had a turbulent past: It had
been purchased with the federally insured deposits of the mismanaged Miami
savings-and-loan for its high-living chairman, who is now behind bars.
<P>
	   Another page was added to its history Friday, when Peter Paul Rubens'
"Portrait of a Man as Mars" sold for $8.2 million at a Sotheby's auction.
</P>
<P>
	   A buyer, whose name was not released by Sotheby's, bought the Rubens and set
a new record at auction for the artist, said Sotheby's spokesman Matthew
Weigman. "It is the most important Rubens to come on the auction market in the
last generation," Weigman said.
</P>
<P>
	   It topped the $6 million paid for the artist's "Samson and Delilah,"
painting, which was sold at a 1980 auction in London.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989, Florida banking officials discovered that the 17th century painting
"Portrait of a Man as Mars" and two dozen other artworks worth a total of $29
million were purchased with funds from the strapped CenTrust Savings and Loan.
The buyer was David L. Paul, the S&AMP;L's art-collecting chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
	   He had paid $13.2 million for the Rubens, with Sotheby's acting as agent for
Rush Kress, widow of Samuel Kress, founder of the five-and-dime store, according
to The Wall Street Journal. Sotheby's would not confirm the figure, saying it
was a private sale.
</P>
<P>
	   But it also was a high-profile sale, and it helped bring down the thrift
CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul was in the spotlight: He had bought art for the S&AMP;L without first
seeking special permission. And the collection was the lesser expense; Paul had
charged up about $45 million in personal expenses with CenTrust money.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990, after CenTrust stopped paying dividends, it was taken over by the
federal government in one of the biggest American savings and loan failures. The
thrift was liquidated and sold to Great Western Bank in Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul was convicted of fraud, conspiracy and racketeering at a 1994 trial in
Miami and is currently serving an 11-year sentence in a federal prison in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The Florida Department of Banking and Finance ordered the paintings sold in
1989. "Portrait of a Man as Mars," the image of a man dressed as the god Mars,
was bought by a European art dealer, along with six less expensive paintings in
a private sale, again brokered by Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
	   The painting has spent the last decade shuttling from international art
fairs to museums in four different nations. It was displayed last year at
Manhattan's Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at Sotheby's did not expect it to reach anywhere near the $13.2
million Paul paid for it during the late 1980's and early 1990's cycle of
booming art prices, but had estimated it would sell for between $6 million and
$8 million.

<HEADLINE> Russians Bogged Down in Grozny  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis By BARRY RENFREW Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Despite weeks of bitter fighting, the Russian military is
bogged down in the ruins of Grozny, unable to capture the shattered Chechen
capital or defeat its outgunned rebel defenders.
</P>
<P>
	   Why has one of the world's largest armies been struggling for months to take
a single city? Why can't a military with 1.7 million troops defeat a few
thousand guerrillas who have no tanks, planes or heavy artillery?
</P>
<P>
	   After years of political and economic decline in Russia, the military is
more like an armed mob than a modern army. Most combat units are made up of
untrained teen-age conscripts who can barely use a weapon. Many officers are as
ill-trained and demoralized as their men.
</P>
<P>
	   Trained infantry is the backbone of any army. Combat training in Western
armies lasts up to a year, with even more for officers and noncommissioned
officers. Some of the Russian soldiers killed in Chechnya had been in the army
for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Most soldiers, drafted for two years' service, are desperate to get out of
the military. Life in the ranks is hard, with soldiers sometimes going hungry
and enduring brutal hazing by older soldiers. Morale, the psychological force
that gives soldiers the will to fight, has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
	   All these weaknesses have been exposed in the battle for Grozny. Reluctant
Russian soldiers are being hurled against experienced guerrillas fighting with
fanatical determination for their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Urban warfare is among the most difficult and dangerous kind of combat. The
defenders of a city have thousands of places to hide and every building can be
turned into a fortress. Attacking forces must clear a city house by house,
street by street. The defenders can slip around the attackers, striking them on
the flank or from behind at any time.
</P>
<P>
	   The untrained, demoralized Russian infantry is totally unprepared for this
kind of war. When their fumbling ground attacks meet resistance, the Russians
call in air and artillery strikes to clear the way.
</P>
<P>
	   But the airstrikes rarely cause casualties among the Chechen fighters, who
know the Russian tactics and pull back before the bombardment. The shelling
demolishes empty buildings, creating new hideouts for the Chechens in the rubble
and new obstacles for the Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
	   At night, the Russians often pull back to fortified bases, giving up
territory they have just taken. The guerrillas reoccupy the ground and the
Russians must seize it again, losing more men day after day.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Russian claims, the military's encirclement of Grozny has failed to
seal off the city. The rebels can move in and out with supplies, especially at
night when the Russians pull back.
</P>
<P>
	   Grozny will almost certainly fall, but not because the Russian military will
outfight the Chechens. The Chechens chose to fight in Grozny because it gave
them the best chance to inflict casualties on the Russians, which is their chief
aim. The guerrillas, who are taking some losses, will pull out before their own
casualties reach a point that threatens their ability to keep the war going.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian military has based its strategy on taking Grozny, gambling that
a high-profile victory will destroy the Chechens' will to fight. But the rebels
likely will shift the struggle into the countryside and fight on as they did
after they lost Grozny during the 1994-96 fighting -- a war they eventually won.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Conservatives Have 2 Sides  </HEADLINE>
   By HOLLY RAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- With its layer of snow, New Hampshire's landscape may
resemble Iowa's, but Republican candidates must dig a little deeper here if they
want to unearth conservative support.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes spent the week pointing to his second-place showing in the Iowa
caucus as proof that he is the conservative GOP alternative to George W. Bush
and John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   But the conservative base that boosted him there may melt away in New
Hampshire, where two key factors face him and the other candidates: There just
aren't as many conservative voters, and those who are may be hard to herd toward
one candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Donna Polychronis of Rochester, a rare find in New Hampshire, calls herself
``very, very conservative,'' and is leaning toward Gary Bauer. Her decision is
motivated by both money and morals, she said. She likes Bauer's 16 percent flat
tax plan and his unwavering stand on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He stands by his views,'' she said. ``I think that's why I'm shying away
from the other candidates. They just brush on the subject, but they don't like
to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa caucus exit polls from Monday night, 37 percent of Republicans said
they considered themselves ``part of the conservative Christian political
movement, also known as the religious right,'' compared to just 17 percent of
New Hampshire Republicans in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the Iowa caucus voter is primarily socially conservative. In New
Hampshire, I think it's a combination of social conservatism as well as fiscally
conservative,'' said Jayne Marcucci, executive director of the state Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are voters out there that specifically vote on their pro-life
stance, but I don't think that would make up the majority of the
conservatives,'' she said. ``I think that they're also concerned with their
taxes and the size of government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who ran mostly on a flat-tax platform in 1996, is counting this time
on drawing anti-abortion voters from the most conservative candidates -- Bauer
and Alan Keyes -- while swiping support from anti-tax voters from McCain and
Bush. He says he is well aware that New Hampshire conservatives represent two
sides of a coin, but he insists he can appeal to both.
</P>
<P>
	   His flat tax plan fits with the state's strong anti-tax ``Live Free or Die''
history, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're very independent minded. They don't like government telling them
what to do,'' he said Friday in an interview. ``So there is a very different,
definite characteristic of the state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although the state's GOP-controlled House has repeatedly rejected efforts to
further regulate abortion, Forbes thinks the strength of the state's
anti-abortion movement is underestimated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People may not like to talk about it, but they do have principles,'' he
said. ``I think they like the idea that a candidate -- even if they don't fully
agree with a candidate -- takes a stand. ... They appreciate someone who is
forthright on that and doesn't try to dance around the issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a campaign event Friday at Memorial High School in Manchester, a
17-year-old student asked Forbes what he would do if he had to choose between
imposing a flat tax and ending abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to do my tax thing, I want to do a lot of things,'' he said, but
then made it clear he wanted to end abortion first. ``If you don't protect
everyone ... everyone is vulnerable. First -- life.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the issue isn't as black and white as it seems for Republicans such as
Forbes, who believe there should be exceptions for abortion in cases of rape,
incest and when a woman's life is in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked by a reporter what he would do if his daughter wanted an abortion,
Forbes said that if she were a minor under the law she should ``absolutely''
have the baby. But he added that if she were over 18, it would be her decision,
although he would urge her to have the baby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are a loving family. We would provide comfort at a moment of
considerable worry and panic, and so we'd rally around her and assure her that
in bringing the baby to term, the baby would be brought up in a loving, caring
atmosphere,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, Forbes may have more luck by tapping into anti-tax
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
	   David Rapp, a flower shop owner from Littleton, says he disagrees entirely
with Forbes' stand on abortion, but plans to vote for him anyway because he
likes his 17 percent flat tax plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of people don't seem to understand that Bush's tax cuts don't go far
enough,'' said Rapp, who describes himself as fiscally conservative and socially
libertarian.
</P>
<P>
	   David Philbrick, a retired minister for the Pentacostal Church from Dover,
said he settled on supporting Baur after hearing him speak at a Christian
Coalition banquet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Alan (Keyes) spoke. He was quite good. I won't deny him that,'' said
Philbrick. ``But then Gary spoke. It brought tears to my eyes.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Has More Heart Trouble  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DUBLIN, N.H. (AP) -- Bill Bradley was again answering questions about his
health after experiencing another episode of irregular heartbeats in recent
days, the fifth in a month.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said the episode, which he said occurred last Sunday or Monday, did
not require a doctor's attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic presidential candidate sought to downplay the episode, and
hadn't told staff about it until Friday, when reporters inquired. The candidate
has a non-life threatening heart condition that periodically causes his heart to
go out of rhythm.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest episode lasted roughly two hours, which he said is shorter than
most.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley dismissed any idea that the timing was bad, just four days before
the New Hampshire primary, a state where he needs to win or do well to stay
competitive against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No it doesn't mean anything,'' he told The Associated Press. ``This is an
issue I haven't heard one real person talk about.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the incident didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It goes two hours and it's back in,'' Bradley said. ``I haven't talked to
one doctor yet who thinks this is an issue,'' he added, saying he didn't consult
a doctor this time.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley disclosed on Dec. 10 -- after he had to cancel a campaign event
because his heart wouldn't stop racing -- that he has had atrial fibrillation
since 1996. The former senator called the condition a minor irritation, and said
he hadn't felt the need to reveal his condition to the press and public.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Bradley reaffirmed his policy of voluntarily disclosing episodes
only if he needs medical attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I have to see a doctor for a medical procedure, I will disclose it
immediately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A week ago, just days before Monday's Iowa caucuses, Bradley acknowledged
suffering four more episodes between Christmas and Jan. 16 after a news
organization inquired.
</P>
<P>
	   Anita Dunn, the campaign's communications director, said Bradley had been
taking his medication regularly to control his heart condition. Bradley didn't
know why the incident happened, although Dunn insisted it wasn't stress related.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Turns Up the Heat on Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- Democratic activists squeezed elbow to elbow were
already fanning themselves in the stuffy banquet room when Bill Bradley grabbed
the microphone and turned up the heat on Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the Democratic Party fund-raising scandals of 1996 ``embarrassing''
and ``disgraceful,'' Bradley warned: ``If we don't clean our house, the
Republicans will clean it for us in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, with three days left to mount a comeback in the Tuesday primary
here, took the stage at a benefit for the New Hampshire Democratic party minutes
after Gore vacated the hall along with about 200 of his supporters, so that a
quarter of the seats were empty for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic presidential underdog did not spell out Gore's role in the
1996 controversy -- the fund-raiser at the Buddhist temple or the solicitations
over White House phones.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He didn't have to,'' said Coos county Democrat Bill Bradley (no relation).
``We know who he's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore was part of the problem,'' acknowledged Gore supporter Frank
Greaney of Bedford. ``This campaign is going to get tougher.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reflecting on President Clinton's State of the Union address the previous
night, Bradley questioned whether the good ideas of Clinton and Gore could be
realized under their leadership. ``I wondered, will we ever be able to achieve
those programs with politics as usual,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   In his own remarks, Gore sounded a different kind of warning.
</P>
<P>
	   His voice rising, Gore looked up from the prepared text he had stuck to for
much of his speech and argued that he is the just the fighter Democrats need to
beat back Republicans in the general election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Make no mistake about the passion that will be needed for the fight that
lies ahead,'' Gore said. ``Make no underestimate of the forces of resistance
that are out there hungry to take back the White House and bend the policies to
the wishes of their special-interest-group friends.''
</P>
<P>
	   The rivals' different arguments struck Coos County Democratic chairman Paul
Robitaille. ``Gore makes you want to go out and win. Bradley makes you think
about why you want to go out and win,'' Robitaille said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore made little mention in his speech of Bradley, except to say that he
``is a worthy opponent here in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, Bradley directly questioned Gore's truthfulness, portraying
him as the kind of politician who ``uses words in a very tricky manner.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have to look at every word and every clause,'' Bradley said in a
comment echoing accusations that critics made about Clinton during the Monica
Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   As polls show Gore with an apparent lead just days before Tuesday's New
Hampshire primary, Bradley aides said he would continue his more aggressive
tack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As voters make up their mind this weekend, we want to make sure they are
aware of the differences,'' said communications adviser Anita Dunn.
</P>
<P>
	   Robitaille, a Gore supporter, said he senses in his northern region of the
state a reservoir of public disgust with the Clinton scandals. As for Bradley
trying to stoke that to his advantage, Robitaille said: ``There is Clinton
fatigue. But whether this is going to be enough to turn the tide against Gore,
I'm not sure.''

<HEADLINE> City pulls the plug on psychic connection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - New York City officials could sense it: the bad
publicity, the worse jokes.
<P>
	   And so, predictably, they announced Friday that welfare recipients could no
longer apply for jobs with the Psychic Network through a city program. The
telephone pay service offered clairvoyance at $4.99 a minute.
</P>
<P>
	   "Though HRA believes people should have the freedom to choose their own
employment, HRA's Business Link has decided to not include the Psychic Network
as one of its participating employers," said a statement from HRA Commissioner
Jason A. Turner.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to pull the plug on the psychic connection came hours after the
hiring policy was made public. Since last April, network instructors had taught
15 welfare clients to read tarot cards and offer their callers a peek into the
future.
</P>
<P>
	   This leaves welfare workers applying for employment with a less interesting
selection of jobs from a variety of companies: Rite Aid, Madison Square Garden,
Macy's.
</P>
<P>
	   Not quite the psychic gig, eh?
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, HRA spokeswoman Ruth Reinecke said the jobs were odd-sounding but
not strange at all.
</P>
<P>
	   "The pay is rather good, and it's attractive to work out of the home for the
mothers who have young children," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The qualifications were a high school diploma and the ability to read, write
and speak English; the pay started at $10 an hour, plus bonuses. The ability to
see into the future was not a prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
	   The city refused to provide any information about the Psychic Network,
citing a confidentiality agreement with companies that participate in the
"workfare" program. The plan attempts to lower the welfare rolls by finding jobs
for recipients; city officials say they have done that for 538,000 people since
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The HRA offices received a large number of calls about the plan after The
New York Times first reported it. A Pittsburgh radio reporter trying to track
down an HRA spokeswoman said the report was the subject of "great mirth" in the
Steel City.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman in the HRA offices Friday was laughing when she answered another
reporter's call. "Is this about the psychics?" she intuitively inquired.
</P>
<P>
	   While the 900-number services are a quirky business, they are legitimate.
Their ads must run with a required disclaimer that the calls are strictly for
entertainment value.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to track down the owner of the Psychic Network could require the use
of tea leaves. The only phone listing under the name is a Florida bookstore that
has no connection to the telephone business.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, there was no listing for the Psychic Network. Attempts to reach
the company telepathically were also unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
	   The psychic phone lines, often advertised on late-night television or via
informercials, haven't drawn this much attention since the Psychic Friends
Network filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Psychic Friends - actually Inphomation Communication Inc. - were
best-known for the 30-minute informercials hosted by singer Dionne Warwick.

<HEADLINE> FCC Changes Course on Religion  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have undone a controversial decision
that had sparked a storm of protest from the nation's religious broadcasters and
Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Communications Commission reversed its determination that
certain religious programming could not count as educational.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC's original action, though affecting only a limited number of
religious broadcasters, had prompted complaints that regulators were trying to
control the content of religious TV. A lawmaker introduced legislation this week
that would have undone the FCC's order.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the commissioners, in a 4-1 vote, undid it themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Regrettably, it has become clear that our actions have created less
certainty rather than more, contrary to our intent,'' the commission said.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy stemmed from an FCC decision in December that offered
additional guidance for noncommercial broadcasters who seek licenses for
specially reserved educational TV channels. To qualify for such licenses, the
commission said that broadcasters must devote 50 percent of their regularly
scheduled air time to educational programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission determined that programming ``primarily devoted to religious
exhortation, proselytizing or statements of personally held religious views and
beliefs generally would not qualify as 'general educational' programming.'' In a
footnote, it said church services also normally would not qualify as ``general
educational'' programming.
</P>
<P>
	   That language drew fire from hundreds of religious broadcasters and a number
of Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, who had proposed the bill to repeal the FCC's
action, said he was ``thrilled'' by the reversal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Religious broadcasters and their listeners were a target for an FCC that
sought to limit their freedom to express religious faith,'' Oxley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bud Paxson, chairman of Paxson Communications Corp., one of the nation's
biggest owners of television stations, commended the FCC for its turnaround as
did the National Religious Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
	   FCC Chairman Bill Kennard had tried to calm the furor by stressing that the
ruling did not apply to the majority of religious broadcasters, who operate on
commercial channels. About 373 television stations hold educational reserve
licenses nationwide, but about only 20 of these are religious broadcasters,
according to FCC estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Even those who wanted special educational licenses would still only have to
meet the requirement that 50 percent of their programming be educational,
Kennard noted in letters to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   But the FCC acknowledged Friday the ``difficulty of minting clear
definitional parameters for 'educational, instructional or cultural'
programming.''
</P>
<P>
	   Commissioner Michael Powell, who had dissented from the original decision to
issue the guidance in December, said ``it has opened a Pandora's box of
problems.'' He supported the FCC's action to return the judgment back to
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
	   But Commissioner Gloria Tristani accused the FCC of caving in to ``an
organized campaign of distortion and demagoguery.'' She particularly took issue
with critics who suggested that the commission had an anti-religious bias.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I reject and resent this type of attack, reminiscent of a witch hunt,''
Tristani wrote in her dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Starr, co-chairman of the grassroots Save Pittsburgh Public TV
Campaign, said he was dismayed by the FCC's reversal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're stunned by the sudden and last-minute capitulation,'' said Starr,
who had organized an effort among groups that included the National Education
Association to defend the guidelines.

<HEADLINE> $3.1B in Farm Subsidies Proposed  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing new farm
subsidies that would take effect when commodity prices are low.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``supplemental income'' payments, estimated to cost taxpayers $3.1
billion this year, would vary in size according to fluctuations in crop revenue.
They are meant to substitute for emergency subsidies that Congress has made the
past two years to compensate growers for a collapse in exports and commodity
prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the program would ``strengthen the
farm safety net'' until Congress rewrites existing farm policy in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Payments will increase when times are the toughest and will taper off when
prices rebound,'' Glickman said in a conference call Friday with farm
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration's proposal, which is similar to an idea offered last year
by Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, is certain to run into opposition from many
producers and lawmakers because of the limits on the payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The payments would be pegged to the average gross income nationally over the
past five years for eight major crops -- corn, wheat, cotton, rice, soybeans,
sorghum, oats and barley -- and would be capped at $30,000 per operation. Most
farmers would get far less than that because their annual ``market-transition''
payments, the fixed subsidies they receive under the 1996 law, would count
toward the $30,000 limit.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 1.3 million farmers currently receive market transition payments, and
200,000 get at least $10,000 a year. Of those, 30,000 receive more than $30,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The size of an operation doesn't necessarily limit the difficulty that
anybody has financially,'' said Dick Newpher, chief lobbyist for the American
Farm Bureau Federation, the nation's largest farm group. ``We would like to help
all of agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
	   But John Schnittker Sr., a private consultant and former Agriculture
Department economist, said that capping the payments ``is the right thing to do,
both from the fiscal standpoint, to avoid runaway costs, and from the standpoint
of getting most of the money to relatively modest-size farmers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The program would fix what the Clinton administration and some producer
groups see as a major flaw in the 1996 farm law, which scaled back income-based
farm subsidies, ended controls on planting and gave farmers a series of fixed
annual payments. Critics say the fixed payments were insufficient when commodity
prices fell sharply in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The new subsidy program will be included in President Clinton's 2001 budget
along with $1.3 billion in farm conservation spending that Vice President Al
Gore announced earlier this month and an additional $640 million earmarked for
cutting premiums on federally subsidized crop insurance. The government has
offered similar insurance discounts in 1999 and again this year in order to
encourage more farmers to buy the coverage to protect against weather-related
losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Because commodity prices are only expected to rise slowly during the next
several years, support has been building in Congress and among farm
organizations to come up with a new way to subsidize growers when prices are
low.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration's new program was originally proposed by economists at
the Agriculture Department and Ohio State University in the early 1990s. Critics
have said the payments could worsen the worldwide grain glut by encouraging
farmers to plant crops in areas where they do not do well, something the 1996
farm law was intended to discourage.
</P>
<P>
	   Newpher, the Farm Bureau lobbyist, praised the administration for proposing
the program. Clinton had proposed improving the farm ``safety net'' in his State
of the Union message a year ago and again Thursday night, but the administration
never spelled out a proposal of its own until Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to get started on this discussion right away,'' Newpher said.

<HEADLINE> Dietary Guidelines Revision Debated  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nutrition experts who are revising the government's
dietary guidelines will be allowed to issue their recommendations despite a
lawsuit that contends they are biased because of ties to the meat and dairy
industries.
</P>
<P>
	   Groups representing vegetarians and racial minorities say that the 11-member
advisory committee working on the revision should have included at least one
representative of people who use federal nutrition programs.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. District Judge James Robertson on Friday declined their request to
block the recommendations from being released. He noted during a hearing that
the committee's proposed revision was unlikely to include any major changes from
the current version.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee's work, which must be approved by the departments of
Agriculture and Health and Human Services, is expected to be made public in the
next few weeks. The departments are expected to take public comment on the
proposed revision for 60 days before deciding whether to approve it.
</P>
<P>
	   First published in 1980, the guidelines are revised every five years to
reflect the latest developments in scientific research. The committee's revision
will put more emphasis on eating whole grains, fruits and vegetables while
urging reduced consumption of sweets and saturated fat. The guidelines, which
follow the government's food pyramid, will continue to recommend meat and dairy
products.
</P>
<P>
	   Federally funded nutrition programs, including school lunches and Meals on
Wheels, are required to adhere to the recommendations, and they are also widely
used by professionals and dietitians in advising consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit filed by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and
other groups contends the guidelines emphasize the consumption of meat, dairy
and egg products and ignore the special dietary needs of minority groups,
including blacks who are often lactose intolerant. At least six of the committee
members have ties to the meat and dairy industries through grants or seats on
advisory boards, the lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the groups said they had not decided whether to appeal the
judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The government is seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee members are ``very accomplished, distinguished individuals who
are at the top of their fields'' and include a black and Hispanic, said Meredith
Manning, a Justice Department lawyer. She told the judge that the plaintiffs
``are essentially trying to get a major change in food policy enacted through
the judicial branch when they can't get that enacted through the executive and
legislative branches.''

<HEADLINE> Mime Won't Speak on Stage, Just TV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- French mime Marcel Marceau told the National Press Club
on Friday that he never speaks on stage, but "on the talk shows, very much ..."
</P>
<P>
	   Marceau, 76, answered questions on subjects that ranged from education for
miming to his Jewish heritage and his admiration for Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
	   He will be performing silently at Ford's Theater until Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicki Miller, publicist for the theater where Abraham Lincoln was shot, said
Marceau had added to the program his one-man rendition of all the participants
in a murder trial. He did the number here, she explained, "because Washington is
the center of our judicial system."
</P>
<P>
	   If he had not been a mime, Marceau told a questioner, he would have liked to
be a painter. A book about him published in France includes reproductions of his
paintings, Ms. Miller said. His host at the National Press Club remarked that
Marceau's notes for his talk were covered with little sketches.
</P>
<P>
	   He had doubts about teaching his own art to children.
</P>
<P>
	   "Children can mime angels but they don't know social ... What is it? ...
consciousness," he said. "Sometimes they can bring emotion in films, because
films are a reality and they can play this reality. But the theater is full of
metaphors and you have to teach children about this life. ... It's very much to
ask of a young child."
</P>
<P>
	   He was asked about his Jewish heritage.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-Semitism had affected him when he was a child, he replied, though it
had not changed his life.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I loved Jesus Christ," Marceau went on. "He was the best of the Jews.
How can you be an anti-Semite when you're Christian? ... Our father died, he was
deported. ... Yes, I cried for him, but 85 million people were deported and
killed during the war. ... Among those kids was maybe an Einstein, a Mozart,
somebody who (would have) found ... a cancer drug. ... This is why we have a
great responsibility. Let us love one another."

<HEADLINE> Black History Month Founder Lauded  </HEADLINE>
   By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first Black History Month of the new millennium
begins Tuesday with a tribute to the originator of the idea, Carter G. Woodson,
half a century after his death.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacqueline Goggin, his biographer, will tell how he worked to popularize a
knowledge of the past, particularly the African-American past. For those who
still find history too dry, tap dancers Brother Black and 10-year-old Cartier
Anthony Williams will also appear on the program at the National Museum of
Natural History.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's the way we always do it,'' said Jo Ann Webb, ``we have a lecture
and then some entertainment too.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Webb was among the officials promoting Black History programs among the
16 museums and galleries of the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
	   Woodson, who died in 1950, founded what is now the Association for the Study
of Afro-American Life and History in 1915. He first proposed ``Negro History
Week,'' held in the month that includes the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and
Abraham Lincoln, for whom Douglass helped recruit black troops in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Gallery of Art displays the memorial sculpted by August
Saint-Gaudens to the first black unit in the war, the Massachusetts 54th
Regiment. An audio taped guide with an account of the memorial by Gen. Colin
Powell accompanies it.
</P>
<P>
	   By 1976 Negro History Week had evolved into Black History Month.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kennedy Center, which includes Washington's opera house, a concert hall,
large and small theaters and two stages for daily free performances, works hard
to bring in black audiences.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday and Friday it will put on a program that includes world
premieres of two South African works. ``At the Fountains of Mpindelela'' is a
multi-media tribute to Nelson Mandela. ``UShaka'' is a chamber version of an
oratorio by composer Mzilikazi Khumalo.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday will see the first of three performances by the Ballet d'Afrique
Noire of ``Mandinka Epic,'' which tells in dance, song and drumming the rise of
the Mandinka empire that reached from north central Africa to the Atlantic coast
hundreds of years ago. It explores the idea put forward by some scholars that
Africans crossed the Atlantic and founded the Olmec kingdom in Central America.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning Feb. 10 the Kennedy Center will put on an exhibit called ``Abomey:
History Told on Walls.'' It will show some of the earliest examples of
low-relief carving from the palaces of the kings of Dahomey in their West
African capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a society with no written language,'' the Kennedy Center said in
announcing the show, ``these visual stories have perpetuated the history and
myths of the Fon people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Between Feb. 14 and Feb. 18 Cyprien Tokoudagba, an artist from Benin, will
demonstrate how the carvings were produced.
</P>
<P>
	   The Philips Collection, which claims to be the first American museum of
modern art, will devote Thursday evening to a program on ``Migrations'' by Jacob
Lawrence. It's a series of paintings that describe the movement of African
Americans from the southern states to the North.
</P>
<P>
	   To bring history up to date, the National Building Museum will run a tour on
Feb. 19 of buildings and institutions in Washington built by and for African
Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Smithsonian has the most extensive program -- a series of exhibits,
films and live performances. It ends Feb. 29 with a lecture at the most-visited
of all U.S. galleries -- the Air and Space Museum -- on the role of African
Americans in flight.

<HEADLINE> Desperate Migrants Flee China  </HEADLINE>
   By JOE McDONALD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FUZHOU, China (AP) -- Three times, Mr. Liu has had himself smuggled out of
China to find work -- to Taiwan, Japan and then Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
	   Each time, he was caught and sent home.
</P>
<P>
	   Jobless and broke, the 26-year-old high school dropout wants to try again,
following a trail blazed by generations of men from China's poor southeastern
coast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of my friends have gone. My family thinks I should go,'' said Liu,
who asked not to be identified further.
</P>
<P>
	   As they try to stop an influx of smuggled workers, the United States and
other nations are facing growing numbers of determined and resourceful Chinese
job-hunters driven by the same desperate ambition.
</P>
<P>
	   Migrants pay up to $60,000 to endure weeks at sea in primitive conditions,
risking jail in China if caught.
</P>
<P>
	   If they succeed, the prize is grueling work in sweatshops or restaurants.
Some are held for ransom or forced into prostitution to pay off smugglers known
menacingly as ``snake heads.''
</P>
<P>
	   This commerce in humans -- risky, violent and profitable -- amounts to ``a
modern slave trade,'' according to a Hong Kong professor who has researched
migrant smuggling for a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For families, this still has appeal as an investment. You pull your money
together and send your son or best candidate abroad,'' said Ying Chan of Hong
Kong University.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimates of how many leave China every year run into the tens of thousands.
The United States sent home more than 1,000 last year. More are caught in
Australia, Japan and Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Many start out in Fuzhou and other coastal towns in Fujian province, where
people have for centuries sought their fortunes abroad. Descendants of earlier
migrants are the elite of modern Singapore and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
	   The effect on towns around Fuzhou is clearly visible.
</P>
<P>
	   In Lianjiang, 30 miles to the north, there are no groups of men idling on
street corners because of rising unemployment, a common sight in other Chinese
cities.
</P>
<P>
	   China has for centuries tried to control emigration. The last imperial
dynasty prohibited it, fearing that once abroad Chinese would plot to overthrow
the regime. Over the past 20 years, as China has opened its borders for trade,
Chinese have followed the outflow of goods.
</P>
<P>
	   Under foreign pressure, the communist government is cracking down. Last
year, it raised the penalty for intercepted migrants from 15 days in jail to as
much as one year. Smugglers can get life.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 9,129 migrants were intercepted leaving China last year and 925
smugglers arrested, according to the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Migrants are sent by freighter, by air with false visas or hidden in cargo
containers. Tactics change as authorities catch on, said a U.S. immigration
official in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Cargo boxes are becoming less popular since the recent seizure of 118
migrants at U.S. and Canadian ports, said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Smugglers reportedly have told migrants -- falsely, said the U.S. official
-- that the United States will grant amnesty after its November presidential
election. They have also enticed migrants to Australia with tales of work
preparing for the Olympics and an amnesty after the September games.
</P>
<P>
	   Frustrated at the growing migrant flow, foreign officials are going straight
Chinese towns to discourage them.
</P>
<P>
	   Australia's immigration minister, Paul Ruddock, visited Fujian last year and
distributed 5,000 posters warning against dealing with smugglers.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials plan to visit in February with videotapes showing migrant
arrests and conditions in cargo containers and aboard ships.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make people understand that this is dangerous, and if they do
it, they are risking exploitation and a lifetime of indentured servitude,'' said
Mark Canning, a spokesman for the U.S. Consulate in the southern city of
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the danger, migrants seem to regard even low-paid jobs abroad as
better than they can get at home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Fuzhou, I can make 300 yuan ($36) a month. In the United States, I can
make $1,000 to $2,000,'' said Liu.
</P>
<P>
	   Liu first went abroad seven years ago, paying $2,300 to get to Taiwan, where
he worked in a factory. He was deported after eight months, but came home with
$850.
</P>
<P>
	   A trip to Japan two years later ended when he was intercepted and sent home.
Liu was lucky: his deal with the smugglers said he didn't have to pay because
they failed to get him into the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The same condition applied in 1995, when Liu spent six weeks on a freighter
to Hawaii with 136 migrants. He had promised to pay $36,000, but the ship was
stopped at sea and, after six months in detention, he was back in China.
</P>
<P>
	   Liu said he had been promised a U.S. factory job at $1,800 a month and
figured he could pay off the smugglers within three years.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, Liu has lived with his parents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I still have no work. I want to try again to go to the United States,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Liu shrugged off questions about hardships abroad and the dangers of dealing
with smugglers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not afraid. They are giving us opportunity,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Kids Return to School  </HEADLINE>
   By HARMONIE TOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DUZCE, Turkey (AP) -- School may be just a cold tent, but 13-year-old Hacer
Oncer is happy to be in class for the first time since a massive earthquake
destroyed her city late last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We like being back,'' she said, warming her hands before the single gas
heater during recess.
</P>
<P>
	   Only three of the 87 schools in Duzce survived the quakes that devastated
northwestern Turkey in August and November and most classes are now in tents,
most without electricity and some with no access to water.
</P>
<P>
	   But returning to school has brought back something of normal life and given
the children -- and their parents -- a routine after months of idleness.
Psychologists say that can help the children recover from the traumatic
experience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are better since they went back to school,'' said Arife Atasoy,
looking over at her three children. ``They need it. Children can't waste a year
like this!''
</P>
<P>
	   Many children were happy to be reunited with their teachers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A little one was so happy to see me,'' said Gonca Ozel, a primary school
teacher. ``They had told her that I had died in the quake so she didn't want to
come. But when she saw I was alive, she stayed.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 18,000 people died in two temblors on Aug. 17 and Nov. 12. The
second earthquake was centered in Duzce, 120 miles west of Istanbul, and
destroyed or seriously damaged most buildings of the city of 80,000 people. Tens
of thousands of people still live in temporary housing -- prefabricated homes,
tents or makeshift huts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In war zones or in situations of natural disasters, when things are very
disrupted, the best thing we can do is to make sure that life is normalized,''
said Rune Sturland, a psychologist with the U.N. Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   UNICEF's $14 million plan for Turkey's quake recovery includes psychological
help for school children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When routines are re-established it gives children a sense of safety. It
is also very positive for the parents that their children have meaningful
activities, leaving the parents to deal with their own issues,'' said Sturland.
</P>
<P>
	   Tent schools are far from ideal and many parents worry about their
children's health in the poorly heated tents. And transportation is a problem,
since prefabricated homes and tent cities are far from the city center.
</P>
<P>
	   Life in the temporary shelters is difficult; in some areas hundreds of
people share one shower. Ozel, the primary teacher, said some children didn't
want to come to school ``because they can't wash.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like showers, teachers are in short supply; about 30 percent have left Duzce
since the quake. With grades now grouped together, parents are worrying about
the quality of their children's education.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at one high school class in Duzce said they come in the morning,
sit around the heater and wait for a teacher.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've lost a year,'' said 17-year-old Tugba Kilicaslan, who fears she has
little chance of getting into university next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the problems, students and teachers alike say it is time to move
forward. Teacher Serap Calik said his students have talked about the quake so
much, ``they're sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``So are we,'' Calik said. ``It's time to start, time to start classes.''

<HEADLINE> Korean War Remains Said Discovered  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea says it happened upon more than 400 remains
of people likely to be American servicemen killed in the Korean War -- 10 times
the number that U.S. officials have recovered during painstaking excavations in
the North Korean countryside over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
	   Li Gun, a deputy North Korean representative at his country's United Nations
mission in New York, said Friday his government has offered to return the
remains, without conditions. He said the U.S. government must act quickly
because the area where the remains were found is being converted to cropland.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Pentagon office in charge of POW-MIA affairs, spokesman Larry Greer
said North Korea notified the Pentagon of the discovery this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've asked for more details,'' Greer said. He said his office is leery of
unilateral returns of war remains, because in the past they have lacked the
anthropological detail needed for individual identifications.
</P>
<P>
	   In a telephone interview, Li said approximately 415 sets of human remains
were uncovered in December and January in an area of North Pyongan Province
where large areas of land are being cleared to create farmland. He said it is
likely that many more remains will be found before the land reclamation project
is completed.
</P>
<P>
	   About 8,200 U.S. servicemen are listed as missing from the 1950-53 Korean
War, and the Pentagon has said it believes a few thousand are potentially
recoverable from North Korea. In U.S. recovery operations over the past few
years, 42 sets of remains have been recovered. Negotiations on arranging joint
recovery operations for this year broke down in December after the North Koreans
demanded that the United States donate materials and equipment for children's
clothing factories.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Li's office sent letters to several U.S. veterans organizations
that said, ``Some remains of the U.S. troops killed in the Korean War are being
recovered by bulldozers.'' The letter did not mention the 415 figure. It said
that once the land-moving operation is finished, ``It will be difficult for us
to confirm the remains sites and unable to find the remains forever.''
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Metersky of the Chosin Few group of Korean War veterans said Friday he
doubts the North Koreans' sincerity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all agree this is a political ploy'' to get the Pentagon involved in
humanitarian assistance as a condition for the return of remains, he said. ``We
do not want our government to pay ransom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Metersky said Li had not mentioned the 415 figure to him in conversations
earlier this week. Metersky said he was astounded to hear that such a large
number of war remains could have been found.
</P>
<P>
	   Li said his government had ``suggested'' but not demanded that the United
States donate children's clothing factories as a means of compensating North
Korea for its cooperation in remains-recovery operations. He said the intent was
to show average North Korean citizens, whose help he said is vital to recovering
remains, that the United States is well intentioned and is no longer the enemy.

<HEADLINE> China Frees U.S. College Librarian  </HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES HUTZLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- A U.S.-based Chinese researcher was freed after being
detained nearly six months in China on charges of smuggling state secrets and
left today on a flight home to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Song Yongyi, a librarian at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and
an authority on China's Cultural Revolution, was detained on Aug. 7 and charged
on Dec. 24 under China's vague secrets law.
</P>
<P>
	   Song left China on a Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit this morning, a
U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Song's release came unexpectedly and removed an irritant from U.S.-Chinese
relations as they slowly recover from NATO's bombing of China's embassy in
Belgrade in May. This past week, the U.S. and Chinese militaries resumed a
formal dialogue that Beijing called off in anger over the bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Arlen Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said he believed China
was releasing Song to curry favor with the U.S. Congress. China would like
Congress to stop reviewing its low-tariff trading privileges annually and grant
the rights permanently as part of a deal to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese security officials on Friday took Song from the detention center
where he had been held and sent him to a government office, his wife Helen Yao
said in a telephone interview from their U.S. home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He called me and said he was free,'' said Yao, who was arrested with Song
in August but released in November. ``Today is a very exciting day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Song had planned to become a U.S. citizen in September, after returning from
his research trip to China.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador to China James Prueher said he hoped Song's release would be
``a harbinger of continued open academic research in China'' and of broader
discussions with the Chinese government on related issues. Prueher said in a
statement he was ``delighted for Song Yongyi and his family.''
</P>
<P>
	   Song, 50, has written articles and a book in Chinese about the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution, when Mao Tse-tung unleashed a wave of radical violence to
oust opponents in the Communist Party and ignite revolutionary zeal. A million
people died and millions more were persecuted. Song spent five years in prison,
accused of being a ``counter-revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Song's specialty has been collecting documents from the Cultural Revolution
period and making them accessible to other scholars.
</P>
<P>
	   Song was collecting old newspapers and other public documents from the
period, as he had done on past trips to China, when he and his wife were
detained on Aug. 7. On Dec. 24 he was charged with ``purchasing or illegally
supplying intelligence for people outside the territory of China.''
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as Tuesday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused Song of harming
China's national security by trying to smuggle 700 pounds of secret documents
out of the country. Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Song had
confessed. Zhu said Song had been purchasing such materials since 1996 using
funds from overseas institutions.
</P>
<P>
	   Song's detention shocked the American academic community. The U.S.
government and members of Congress lobbied China for his freedom. More than 100
China scholars in the United States petitioned Chinese President Jiang Zemin for
his release, saying Song was engaged in normal academic work, not espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   Song, who is from Shanghai, attended college in China when schools reopened
across the country after the Cultural Revolution ended. He went to the United
States in 1989 and earned master's degrees in Chinese literature and library
science, and has worked at Dickinson College since 1997.

<HEADLINE> Gene Talks Boil Down to Few Issues  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT CRENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- In the final hours of international talks Friday on trade
in genetically modified food and other products, negotiators found themselves
grappling over the same issues that doomed a similar agreement nearly a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates scurried from room to room of the Montreal hotel where the meeting
was being held, bearing proposals and counterproposals. The shuttling delayed
the start of a final plenary session for seven hours. When it finally began just
before midnight, key U.S. and European delegates were not present -- still
negotiating separately over their differences.
</P>
<P>
	   Conference president Juan Mayr, who set a deadline of Friday night, has said
that he will not leave Montreal without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Somebody has to give in somewhere,'' said Ethiopian head delegate Towalde
Egziabher.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators were attempting to draft the Biosafety Protocol, a set of rules
that would protect the environment from damage by genetically modified plants,
animals and bacteria. Environmentalists and a few scientific studies have raised
concerns that genetically modified organisms could wipe out native species,
disrupt natural cycles and cause other ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's fish genes in fruit, poultry genes in fish, animal genes in
plants, growth hormones in milk, insect genes in vegetables, tree genes in grain
and in the case of pork, human genes in meat,'' said Steve Gilman, an organic
farmer in Stillwater, N.Y. ``Real and reasonable concerns about genetic
engineering have fallen upon deaf ears.''
</P>
<P>
	   The debate at the talks has revolved around how great the scientific
uncertainty is, and how it should be dealt with. The European Union and
developing nations have argued that countries should be allowed to decline
imports of a genetically modified product if little is known about its
environmental effect.
</P>
<P>
	   But the United States and its partners disagree, saying the proposed rules
in their current form would restrict trade. Those countries argued that any
nation's refusal to import a genetically modified product should be backed by
scientific evidence in the form of a risk assessment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We live in a world in which scientific certainty is not available,'' said
U.S. Undersecretary of State Frank Loy.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks last February in Cartagena, Colombia, ended in disarray when the
United States and five other countries -- Canada, Australia, Argentina, Chile
and Uruguay -- rejected a draft agreement favored by 125 other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation has changed since then, with major U.S. food producers such as
Archer Daniels Midland, Gerber and the Iams pet food company either demanding
that genetically modified products be segregated or refusing to use them
altogether. Protests at the World Trade Organization talks in Seattle last month
also suggest that the American public has concerns about genetically altered
food.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the year since Cartagena, it has become obvious that the position of
the (United States') group is increasingly isolated,'' said Philip Bereano, a
University of Washington professor who has been following the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as in Cartagena, the talks in Montreal have come down to a handful of
issues:
</P>
<P>
	   --The relationship of the proposed rules to the World Trade Organization.
The United States wants the agreement to have ``equal status'' with the free
trade pact. But other countries fear that any bans they impose will be
overturned by the World Trade Organization's dispute resolution panel.
</P>
<P>
	   --The amount of scientific evidence that is needed to justify banning a
genetically modified product.
</P>
<P>
	   --The amount of evidence that exporters must provide about their products.
</P>
<P>
	   Genetically modified crops are already widespread. About 70 million acres of
genetically engineered plants were cultivated worldwide in 1999. In the United
States, genetically engineered varieties account for about 25 percent of corn
and 40 percent of soybeans.

<HEADLINE> Trash talk: Is domed dump stadium in plans for Jets?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Some say it's just trash talk, but a city councilman
says the Fresh Kills garbage dump on Staten Island is the perfect spot for the
New York Jets own field of dreams.
<P>
	   "Everything falls right into place," Councilman Jay O'Donovan said Friday.
"The dump closes in 2001. The Jets' lease (at the Meadowlands Complex) is up in
2008. We get a few years in between to build a state-of-the art stadium. It is
the right time and this is the right place."
</P>
<P>
	   The 3,000 acre landfill - the world's largest - is scheduled to close in
December 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had been pushing Manhattan's West Side as the
site of a new baseball stadium for the New York Yankees, recently said it would
make a great place for the Jets, too.
</P>
<P>
	   But O'Donovan said the dump idea is a lot more feasible. "This seems like it
could go a lot easier. The land is here, it's available. There's good highway
access, four bridges. On paper it looks very, very good."
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the mayor, Ed Skyler, says federal and state regulations
prohibits permanent structures to be built on the landfill for at least 20
years. And Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, who lobbied hard to get
a minor league stadium for the Staten Island Yankees, said a professional
football stadium that attracts 78,000 fans would create traffic chaos.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Donovan admitted that traffic congestion would be a problem but urged the
mayor and borough president not to immediately rule out his proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this mayor wanted it," the Democratic councilman said, "It could be
done."
</P>
<P>
	   Getting the Jets back from New Jersey where they have shared Giants Stadium
since 1984, "is something every New Yorker would like to see."
</P>
<P>
	   Offers to help Gang Green find a new home have been popping up since the
team was bought from the estate of the late Jet owner Leon Hess for $635 million
by pharmaceutical heir Robert Wood Johnson IV.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson made it clear he intends to get the Jets their own stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the domed dump suggestion, Jets spokesman Doug Miller said, "Mr.
Johnson has said the New York Jets will consider all proposals for a new stadium
in due time."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Donovan's proposal was first reported Friday by the Staten Island Advance
in a story that began, "If you build it, will they gag?"
</P>
<P>
	   As for the smell, O'Donovan said the Jets current home at the Meadowlands
Complex in East Rutherford, N.J. was built on wetlands, next to a landfill. "I
don't hear anyone complaining," O'Donovan says.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Desert Landmark Changes Hands  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT JABLON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAKER, Calif. (AP) -- It seems this wide spot in the road has always had
desert heat, but it also has the legendary Bun Boy restaurant and the world's
tallest thermometer.
</P>
<P>
	   They are familiar monuments to anyone who has ever made the hot, dusty
desert run along Interstate 15 to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the monuments have a new owner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This place has been here for decades and I can't imagine them changing
it,'' said Marti Schmidt, a retiree from Thousand Oaks who stops at the Bun Boy
on the way to and from Las Vegas with her husband, Al.
</P>
<P>
	   She needn't worry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The history will remain,'' said new owner Steve Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   After all, the Bun Boy Restaurant has been pulling people in for nearly
three-quarters of a century.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bun Boy, founded in 1926, and its 134-foot-tall thermometer were among
the core properties sold last week to Carter, who declined to disclose the sum
his company paid.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale marks the first time the restaurant has completely changed hands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm glad it's done,'' said seller Willis Herron, 75, a friend of Carter.
``My age and my health wouldn't let me do Baker justice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he'll do what I wanted to do, but I ran out of time.'' Herron, who
is facing triple-bypass heart surgery and suffers from emphysema, became a
partner with the original Bun Boy owner in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
	   He said none of his six children wanted to keep the restaurant, which draws
visitors from as far away as Germany and Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bun Boy is widely considered the cornerstone of a growing community.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker isn't even a city. It's an unincorporated community of San Bernardino
County with a population of about 600 people surrounded by scrub brush, dry
desert sand and hard brown mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   It's only 90 miles from Las Vegas, and it survives on traffic from adjacent
Interstate 15. In turn, the Bun Boy and a handful of other fast-food shops and
gas stations provide a welcome respite to travelers too tired to do another 90
miles on an oppressively hot summer day, of which there are plenty in these
parts.
</P>
<P>
	   The strip of about 30 businesses that line Baker Boulevard did $33 million
in sales last year, said Le Hayes, general manager of the Baker Community
Services District.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides buying stuff, gawkers come by to snap pictures of the thermometer
that was erected in 1991, and which can record temperatures exceeding 130
degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   As tourists stop for refreshments, gas and picture taking, a continual
parade of big-rig trucks rumbles down the town's main drag.
</P>
<P>
	   Traffic is so heavy that several restaurants have sprung up in recent years,
and more motels and fast-foods stops are planned. The community that bills
itself as ``The Gateway to Death Valley'' may be enlarged by a third in the next
year or so, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
	   And as the community grows, many residents who know Herron and have watched
him raise a family here are sad he won't be a part of the boom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the man who started it all,'' said Hayes. ``He started from the
old days and built himself a small empire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carter's company purchased about 100 acres of that small empire, including a
gas station, the old Country Store and two motels.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, 50, who owned several Burger King franchises until this year, said
he hopes to expand his new properties, but he won't change the Bun Boy or the
thermometer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bun Boy has great food,'' said retiree Schmidt. ``It's all homestyle kind
of food rather than fast food. ... Great strawberry pies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't imagine that they would change anything about it.''

Clinton To Attend Economic Forum
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- President Clinton's whirlwind visit here Saturday
raises to a new high the American profile at an annual gathering of economic and
political leaders, at a time when the forum is wresting with tensions between
haves and have-nots in the global economy. Clinton's acceptance of the
invitation of the World Economic Forum was a coup for the foundation that runs
the meeting and the Swiss professor Klaus Schwab, who started the annual
meetings 30 years ago as an informal gathering of economic elites. It is the
first time an American president has joined the gathering.

"practically kidnapped" by her boyfriend and intimidated into leaving for the
United States, countering claims that she was on a flight to freedom with her
6-year-old son. Many who want Elian to remain in the United States say his
mother, Elisabeth Brotons, was trying to bring him to freedom in a voyage across
the Straits of Florida that ended with shipwreck. She and 10 others drowned and
Elian was left floating alone in an inner-tube.

Storm Spreads More Snow in South

	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A storm spread still more snow across the Deep South on
Friday, giving children from Arkansas to Georgia a rare chance to build snowmen
but threatening travel to the Super Bowl. The storm, which dumped up to 17
inches of snow in Oklahoma earlier this week, dropped between an inch and a foot
in Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee before stalling near the
Alabama-Georgia line for most of the day Friday. As midnight approached,
however, the storm was moving through northern Georgia, National Weather Service
meteorologist Terry Murphy said. Areas in north Georgia and parts of central
Georgia got snow, sleet and freezing rain, he said.

Bradley warned: "If we don't clean our house, the Republicans will clean it for
us in the fall." Reflecting on President Clinton's State of the Union address
the previous night, Bradley questioned whether the good ideas of Clinton and
Gore could be realized under their leadership. "I wondered, will we ever be able

Bad Brakes Cited in Ark. Plane Crash

of a wet runway in a storm could have landed safely if all its braking systems

left the runway still going about 100 mph, then hit a metal lighting structure,
broke apart and caught fire. Eleven people died in the June 1 crash. The
McDonnell-Douglas MD-82 landed in heavy rain and 25 mph crosswinds, but that
alone was not enough to cause it to run off the runway, according to Boeing
Corp. tests.

<HEADLINE> Nightie Offer Spurned by Coalition  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN ESTRIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Like most lingerie companies, UndercoverWear offers a range
of underthings, from naughty to nice. When they decided to donate to the
homeless, they chose function over fashion -- thousands of flannel nightgowns.
</P>
<P>
	   A national homeless coalition spurned the offer, along with a gift of
$200,000. The bottom line: UndercoverWear exploits women, the coalition said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tewksbury-based business planned a February ``Nightie for the Needy''
campaign to donate 20,000 flannel nightgowns, plus $200,000, to homeless
shelters across the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Debbi Karpowicz, company spokeswoman, said the Washington-based National
Coalition for the Homeless seemed excited when the idea was first proposed
several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   But when UndercoverWear called back recently to go over details, the
coalition's executive director, Mary Ann Gleason, refused to participate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She basically said to me there was no way they were ever going to get
involved with us,'' Karpowicz said Friday. ``They felt UndercoverWear
exaggerated wealth and exploited women.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 23-year-old company sells its underwear through 1,500 sales agents who
host ``lingerie parties,'' similar to Tupperware parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Their motto is: ``We use supermoms, not supermodels,'' and products range
from plaid nightgowns to skimpy panties.
</P>
<P>
	   At its peak in the 1980s, the company had annual sales of $75 million. In
the mid-1990s, however, sales were in the $25 million to $30 million range, said
company president Tiffany James, who wouldn't disclose current figures, citing
ongoing litigation.
</P>
<P>
	   As a self-promotional gimmick to generate donations, James proposed having
women send in pictures of themselves wearing their ugliest nightgowns. For each
picture received, the company would donate a new nightgown -- worth about $40
retail -- plus $1 to a shelter. The company would make up any difference to
reach its goal of 20,000 nighties and $200,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Gleason said UndercoverWear didn't meet her criteria for accepting financial
support. She said she objected to the ugliest nightgown gimmick: ``It just felt
weird to me.''
</P>
<P>
	   She also took issue with the company's promotional materials, which boast of
the mansion and vacation homes owned by the company president. ``It was too big
a disconnect,'' Gleason said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gleason said she urged UndercoverWear to call individual shelters, in part
because her agency had no means to distribute the nightgowns and money.
</P>
<P>
	   Karpowicz, however, said Gleason's tone was anything but encouraging.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it was talking to another national homeless activist group
about helping out, but it wouldn't disclose the group's name.
</P>
<P>
	   Social service agencies can walk a fine line in deciding what donations are
acceptable, said Philip Mangano, executive director of the Massachusetts Housing
and Shelter Alliance, a coalition of 73 agencies across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Some shelters won't take money from liquor companies, for example, since
alcoholism is often a cause of homelessness.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mangano said scrutiny can go too far.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What gives an organization the right to say no to any donation that's
intended for homeless people?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   There are an estimated 700,000 homeless in America.
</P>
<P>
	   A 28-year-old woman, who asked that her name not be used, picked a new blue
hat, wool socks and thick gloves out of a donation box at a Boston homeless
shelter Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't matter to me where they come from,'' she said, when told of
UndercoverWear's offer.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she could use a warm nightgown. She also wouldn't mind a little
something else.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hey, we'd take fancy lingerie stuff too,'' the woman said. ``We want to
live like other women do.''

<HEADLINE> Turner Won't Be Nervous for Pregame  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Having performed in front of hundreds of millions of people
over her career, Tina Turner is not afraid of singing in front of that many in
one night.
</P>
<P>
	   At Friday's news conference held to introduce the pregame entertainers for
Sunday's Super Bowl, Turner said she treats singing in front of a huge audience
"as a chance to get reacquainted."
</P>
<P>
	   "I used to be nervous, but as the years have gone by, it has turned to
excitement and the feeling that it's a kind of reunion," said the 60-year-old
entertainer. "Besides, this is not about me, it's about the guys. I'm just
decoration, and just there to root them on."
</P>
<P>
	   The game, televised by ABC, is expected to draw a TV audience of 130 million
in the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner will perform a song from her new album, as well as her classic "Proud
Mary" during Sunday's pregame, billed as a tribute to 20th century music.
</P>
<P>
	   Before meeting the press, she chatted with some of the Tennessee Titans,
"giving them special wishes, a few kisses and hugs."
</P>
<P>
	   Because she was born in the Tennessee community of Nutbush, she said she
would be rooting for the Titans, even though she also spent a few years in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a great place to grow up," Turner said of her hometown, immortalized
in her hit "Nutbush City Limits."
</P>
<P>
	   Country star Faith Hill, on tap to sing the national anthem, had a little
different attitude about nerves when it comes to singing before an international
TV audience.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just trying to remember the first two words," said Hill, who is married
to fellow country star Tim McGraw. "If I can get past 'Oh say ...' then I'll be
OK."
</P>
<P>
	   Hill also will be rooting for the Titans, especially since the Mississippi
native now makes Nashville her home.
</P>
<P>
	   During the pregame, native Georgian and fellow country star Travis Tritt
will also perform along with several other acts, including Georgia Tech's
marching band.
</P>
<P>
	   "Country music has become worldwide," said Hill. "And the Super Bowl can
reach so many people. I was incredibly flattered when the NFL asked me to do
this."

<HEADLINE> Minn. Couple Returns After Fleeing  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVE KARNOWSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Prosecutors have worked out a deal with a couple who
surfaced this week after nine months on the run with their 18-month-old son, a
boy the parents say suffers from a rare ``brittle bone'' disease, not child
abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Wally Hines III, 31, and his wife, Debby, 32, returned to Minnesota with
their son, Wyatt, on Wednesday. They made a brief court appearance Friday, were
released without bail and allowed to keep their son.
</P>
<P>
	   The parents, who lived in suburban Rosemount, were never charged with child
abuse, but with depriving the county of its custodial rights and interstate
flight to avoid prosecution. The federal flight charges are being dropped.
</P>
<P>
	   The state charges will be dismissed Oct. 30 if the parents stay out of
trouble with the law, continue to cooperate with authorities on care for the
child, and if the boy remains in good health, Dakota County Attorney James
Backstrom said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're very happy. They wanted to come home,'' said John Whitehead,
president of The Rutherford Institute, a Charlottesville, Va.-based legal
advocacy group that helped negotiate their return.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hineses and their defenders always denied that Wyatt was the victim of
abuse and maintained that authorities overreacted to his injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   The family says Wyatt suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic
disease that affects some 20,000 to 50,000 Americans, or about 1 in 20,000. They
say that's what explains the broken leg and broken ribs that first brought Wyatt
to authorities' attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of a court-imposed gag order, it was unclear if prosecutors were
still disputing the diagnosis. Social workers have said they thought the
injuries were caused by the parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation in Gaithersburg, Md.,
say it's common for social workers to conclude that OI children are victims of
abuse. The group said the condition can be difficult to diagnose.
</P>
<P>
	   Wyatt's problems were noticed when he was 6 weeks old and his parents took
him to a doctor with a swollen leg. X-rays showed that his femur was broken in
two places. When child protection workers ordered more X-rays, doctors found six
broken ribs, and Wyatt was put in foster care for three months, where he
suffered more fractures.
</P>
<P>
	   Wyatt was returned to his mother after the father agreed to live away from
their home for four weeks. Shortly before a final hearing in May, Wyatt's femur
broke again. They fled April 27 after learning police were coming to take Wyatt
away because of the injury.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they feel that things have worked out about as well as could be
expected,'' said Wally Hines Jr., Wyatt's grandfather. ``I didn't think they
would have come back otherwise, to tell you the truth.''

<HEADLINE> Castro: Elian's Mom Was 'Kidnapped'  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro says Elian Gonzalez' mother was
``practically kidnapped'' by her boyfriend and intimidated into leaving for the
United States, countering claims that she was on a flight to freedom with her
6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
	   Many who want Elian to remain in the United States say his mother, Elisabeth
Brotons, was trying to bring him to freedom in a voyage across the Straits of
Florida that ended with shipwreck. She and 10 others drowned and Elian was left
floating alone in an inner-tube.
</P>
<P>
	   But Castro, speaking to a conference of economists Friday, denounced that
idea. He blamed the tragedy on Brotons' boyfriend Lazaro Rafael Munero, who
apparently organized the ill-fated journey in late November in which he also
died.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mother was practically kidnapped along with the boy'' to make the
trip, Castro said. ``The mother was taken in conditions of intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Castro called Munero a ``ruffian'' on whom Cuban police had amassed ''100
pages of reports.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to sources quoted by the Miami Herald, Munero -- who reportedly
drove a taxi in the Cuban city of Cardenas -- had fled to Florida in June 1998
and returned to Cuba later that year, only to be jailed for several months.
</P>
<P>
	   Castro called Brotons ``an excellent girl'' who had suffered seven
miscarriages before delivering Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One who is born among eight pregnancies: How desired that child must be,''
Castro said. Brotons had separated from Elian's father several years ago, though
both continued to see the child regularly.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, tens of thousands of children took part in a
government-organized rally in Havana calling for the return of Cuba's ``boy
hero.'' The rally Friday also celebrated the birth of independence hero Jose
Marti and called both martyrs.
</P>
<P>
	   Castro said Cuba could carry on such protests -- which have continued daily
for two months -- ``for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers, meanwhile, were considering returning home to Cuba
after a week in the United States trying to win the boy's return, said the Rev.
Joan Brown Campbell of the National Council of Churches. The New York-based
group has facilitated their travel and supports the boy's repatriation.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's great-uncle and other relatives in Miami are fighting to keep him
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled Elian should return to
his father in Cuba. But its order has not been carried out because the federal
government agreed to hold off until the Miami relatives could challenge it in
court.
</P>
<P>
	   At a hearing Friday in Miami, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler moved up
to Feb. 22 from March 6 the date when he would hear arguments on whether the
relatives' lawsuit should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   While a move in Congress to grant the child U.S. citizenship seemed to be
faltering, the nun who hosted a meeting between the boy and his grandmothers
urged U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday to let the boy stay in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin told Reno in a meeting Friday that she has come to
believe separating Elian from his Florida relatives would be ``another traumatic
loss for him'' after the death of his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno, a longtime friend of O'Laughlin, said she continues to support the
INS's ruling for the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin conceded to reporters, ``I am no longer neutral'' in the Elian
question. Reno had chosen the nun as a disinterested party to host the
grandmothers' visit with Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   In Havana on Friday, tens of thousands of children flooded the Plaza of the
Revolution to deliver a dual homage to Marti and Elian. Wearing red Communist
Pioneer neckerchiefs, children recited poems they wrote for Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   The Communist Party daily Granma called Elian a ``symbol of the crimes and
injustices imperialism is capable of committing against an innocent.''
</P>
<P>
	   It compared the boy's image, emblazoned on hundreds of thousands of T-shirts
here, with that of revolutionary icon Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, one that will
``spread across the world and remain forever in our mind and in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Old Havana, hundreds of children marched around the Parque Central
chanting ``We will save Elian!'' Some girls wore construction-paper handcuffs --
an apparent reference to the government's claim Elian has been kidnapped.

<HEADLINE> Doctors: Hand Transplant Patient OK  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES RITCHIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Matthew Scott has worked countless hours to be able
to do things most people hardly think about.
</P>
<P>
	   One year ago he became the first person in the United States to receive a
transplanted hand. He can now use it to write his name, pour a glass of water,
deal cards and tie his shoes.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott, who lives in Absecon, N.J., was in Louisville this week for a checkup
with the doctors who attached his new left hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott represents "the pinnacle of what can be achieved in hand transplant,"
said Dr. Warren Breidenbach, one of the surgeons.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference Friday, doctors showed a video of Scott performing
simple tasks. The natural left-hander has some feeling in his fingertips, can
feel temperatures and is beginning to gain function in the small muscles of the
hand, Breidenbach said.
</P>
<P>
	   The surgeons said Scott's determination to improve the hand's function
through therapy has contributed to his success.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott, 38, said Friday that the progress with his new hand has eased much of
his anger over losing the old one in a fireworks accident.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of those daily frustrations -- the kind that would send a pen flying
across the room -- are gone now," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott, who works as an administrator for an emergency medical center, lost
his left hand in 1985. He received the new hand last year in a 15-hour procedure
at Jewish Hospital in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott's doctors say his transplanted hand will never have the complete
function of a normal hand, but he may still see some improvement over the next
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Jon Jones, a transplant surgeon, said there's still about a 50 percent
chance that Scott's immune system will reject the hand over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Five people in the world are living with transplanted hands. Two of them had
the surgery in France, with the first receiving a hand in September 1998. Two
have had hands attached in China.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott "has the best hand function of any done," Breidenbach said.

<HEADLINE> Family Found Shot in Tenn. House  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A man with a history of domestic violence killed his
wife and two children before turning the gun on himself, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Christopher Clay Tillery Sr. was listed in critical condition Friday evening
at the University of Tennessee Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said he apparently used a 9 mm pistol to kill Diane Tillery, 27,
Christy Tillery, 8, and Christopher Clay Tillery Jr., 6. The children were shot
in their beds, and each victim was shot once, said police spokesman Foster
Arnett.
</P>
<P>
	   Police and Tillery's relatives said he was angered by rumors his wife was
having an affair.
</P>
<P>
	   The shootings happened at about 3 a.m., but Tillery's relatives found the
bodies hours later when they went to check on the family, police said. They had
been worried about the family because of previous domestic problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Tillery, 30 was arrested in 1998 for assaulting his wife, according to
police records. Authorities later conducted a follow-up check on Mrs. Tillery
but she refused help, Arnett said.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Newspaper Gets New Publisher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Los Angeles Times executive Roger Oglesby has been named

<HEADLINE> Minority Hiring Mulled at Super Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- There's never been a minority head coach in the Super Bowl.
Of course, the odds are stacked against it.
</P>
<P>
	   Only two blacks, Minnesota's Dennis Green and Tampa Bay's Tony Dungy, are
among the 31 NFL head coaches, so commissioner Paul Tagliabue found himself
addressing a familiar issue Friday as another title game approached.
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, Tagliabue was grilled on the recent trend of
coaches-turned-kingmakers designating a successor before even leaving their
post.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Parcells did that in New York, though Bill Belichick quit the Jets
after only one day. Dave Wannstedt was elevated to the top job in Miami as Jimmy
Johnson retired.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the St. Louis Rams, who meet the Tennessee Titans in Sunday's Super
Bowl, know who their coach will be after Dick Vermeil retires. Offensive
coordinator Mike Martz is next in line, though he probably won't get the job
until 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Belichick, who now coaches the New England Patriots, is white. So are
Wannstedt and Martz. Ditto for Dave Campo (Dallas), Al Groh (Jets) and Mike
Sherman (Green Bay), hired since the end of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
	   But Tagliabue, speaking at his annual Super Bowl news conference, defended
the league's minority hiring record.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reality is that one-third of our coaches are African-Americans," the
commissioner said, including assistants in his figures.
</P>
<P>
	   "The growing number of coordinators are African-Americans. And to the extent
that coaches are trying to designate an heir apparent, I think you are going to
see African-Americans in that pipeline."
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue pointed out that the Jets have just elevated Maurice Carthon to
assistant head coach and that Ted Cottrell, Buffalo's defensive coordinator, is
well respected around the league.
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioner doesn't believe minority candidates are denied a fair
opportunity when a successor in named in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   "It might be a positive thing if people are doing that kind of long-range
planning," he said. "They might start looking at younger coaches. ... I don't
see that as a negative in terms of minority hiring, frankly."
</P>
<P>
	   On another issue, Tagliabue acknowledged the NFL is concerned about
off-field crimes committed by its players, but he also suggested those crimes
are part of a deeper problem.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think our track record is better than society at large," Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
	   The league's well-polished image has been sullied this season by a number of
off-field arrests. The most serious involved former Carolina receiver Rae
Carruth, released by the Panthers after he was charged with first-degree murder
in the shooting death of his pregnant girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   "Can we separate ourselves from society? Of course not," Tagliabue said. "We
can't predict what NFL players will do any more than we can predict students
shooting other students of workers shooting fellow workers."
</P>
<P>
	   At this Super Bowl, the hottest topic has been the cold weather. Both teams
practiced in wintry conditions until Friday, when they moved to the Georgia Dome
because of an approaching storm that brought snow and ice to much of the Deep
South.
</P>
<P>
	   You certainly won't hear the Titans or Rams complaining about the lack of
headline material. They're here to play for a championship, not stir
controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher said his wild-card Titans (16-3) had an
excellent workout Friday, though receiver Derrick Mason and safety Blaine Bishop
came to blows in the final session.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishop was covering Mason on a pass in a two-minute drill when the ball fell
incomplete. Mason accused the safety of hitting him in the helmet.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterwards, Fisher spoke privately with Bishop and Mason for several
minutes. The players hugged before leaving the field.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's over with," the coach said. "They compete. They are highly
competitive. That happens over the course of the season. Did you see them walk
off the field together? Those two are about as competitive guys as I've got."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams (15-3) didn't let Jeff Wilkins didn't test his sore left knee at
practice, but he will be their kicker on Sunday. Nick Lowery, who tried out in
St. Louis before the NFC championship game, is in Atlanta just in case.
</P>
<P>
	   "We spoke to him a couple of times this week, and he was very close to
getting a call," coach Dick Vermeil said. "But Jeff kicked well yesterday and
his knee felt a lot better."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans are still hoping to have receiver Yancey Thigpen, who has a
hairline fracture in his right foot. He has not practiced all week, but was not
among the first group of players deactivated for the Super Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Tagliabue Worried About Violence  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue sees off-field crimes
committed by its players as part of a problem in society, not just in pro
football.
</P>
<P>
	   "Can we separate ourselves from society? Of course not," Tagliabue said
Friday at his annual Super Bowl news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't predict what NFL players will do any more than we can predict
students shooting other students or workers shooting fellow workers."
</P>
<P>
	   But he added:
</P>
<P>
	   "On the other hand, we don't tolerate violence. We don't condone it."
</P>
<P>
	   The NFL's well-polished image has been sullied this season by a number of
off-field arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   The most serious are the charges against Carolina wide receiver Rae Carruth
for conspiring the shooting death of Cherica Adams, who was pregnant with their
son. Carruth was released by the Panthers after the charges were lodged.
</P>
<P>
	   Another NFL player in trouble with the law is Cecil Collins, then of Miami,
who was charged in December with burglary. That led Louisiana to revoke his
probation on a similar charge there when he was in college, and he is now in a
Miami jail awaiting extradition.
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue noted that the NFL put in counseling programs under former
commissioner Pete Rozelle, and there is also counseling during a mandatory
rookie orientation program.
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue addressed a wide range of subjects, ranging from the hiring of
minorities as head coaches to the possibility that some late-season games could
be shifted to different times or dates to get teams that are unexpectedly
successful on national television. For example, neither the St. Louis Rams nor
Tennessee Titans, who will meet in Sunday's Super Bowl, were on Monday night
television this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're talking to the networks about it with mixed reaction," Tagliabue
said. "I'm not sure it will be used next year, but it's something to think about
for the future."
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue acknowledge that minorities have not been getting as many head
coaching positions as he would like. With the firing of Ray Rhodes in Green Bay,
there are only two black head coaches, Dennis Green in Minnesota and Tony Dungy
in Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioner pointed out that the New York Jets have just elevated
Maurice Carthon to assistant head coach, and that Ted Cottrell, Buffalo's
defensive coordinator, remains well respected around the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we have people in the pipeline, but in the long run, it's the
owner's decision on who to hire," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue said he was pleased with instant replay after a slow start.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that the call late in the NFC championship game, overruling a catch
by Tampa Bay's Bert Emmanuel, was what the system was reinstituted for --
crucial calls in major games.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Braces for Worst Weather  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Hype and anticipation mounted in Atlanta -- for the Super
Bowl, of course, and for a winter storm that took its time arriving.
</P>
<P>
	   Early today, a light coat of freezing rain was falling on the area. The
National Weather Service backed off on its predictions of snow, but said
freezing rain, followed by sleet and rain showers, would fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Given an entire week to prepare for the storm, the NFL all but guaranteed
the Super Bowl would be played.
</P>
<P>
	   "All the plans are the same," NFL vice president of special events Jim Steeg
said. "We just have to keep a sense of flexibility and be ready for whatever
happens."
</P>
<P>
	   The league took several precautions to make sure the game would go on,
including:
</P>
<P>
	   --Piling sand outside the Georgia Dome in case ramps and entryways become
slick.
</P>
<P>
	   --Rescheduling a rehearsal for the pregame show in the Georgia Dome so both
teams could hold their final full practices indoors Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   --Stationing workers on the Georgia Dome roof to brush off snow or excess
water should it accumulate.
</P>
<P>
	   --Making sure all the food and drinks arrive at the stadium early to prevent
delivery trucks from having to negotiate slick roads.
</P>
<P>
	   --Placing 16 power generators at the Georgia Dome to provide emergency
energy should ice and snow knock out power to the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
	   James Peters of Georgia Power says downtown Atlanta is networked for power
underground.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very, very rare that an outage occurs," Peters said. "If an outage
does occur, we do have contingency plans in place."
</P>
<P>
	   Those traveling to the game started making contingency plans, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Anticipating nasty weather, Delta Airlines canceled a handful of flights,
including four from Nashville to Atlanta, the most popular route for Titans
fans.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision left travel agencies in Tennessee scrambling.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me," said Suzette Bertuccelli,
manager of Embassy Travel in Nashville. "They usually don't cancel until
inclement weather hits. We've just gotten a couple of calls this morning from
people wanting to get protected on another flight."
</P>
<P>
	   Some who made it in from other cities felt fortunate.
</P>
<P>
	   "All the flights after ours were canceled," said Todd Benson, who was
traveling with friends from Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   Reservation managers at two large downtown hotels, the Hyatt and Marriott,
said the number of room cancellations through Friday were negligible.
</P>
<P>
	   The NFL has no plans to redistribute tickets that aren't picked up.
</P>
<P>
	   "The league isn't really in a position to do that," Steeg said. "Now, if
Coke learns that half its group isn't going to make it in, it's their decision."
</P>
<P>
	   But Steeg doesn't anticipate seeing a half-empty Georgia Dome come Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   He recalled the 1987 Super Bowl, when the Giants played the Broncos in
Pasadena, Calif., and a giant snowstorm closed airports in the New York area in
the days leading up to the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rose Bowl was brimming and hardly any Giants fans missed the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hotels and everyone else are good at adjusting to what needs to be done
with that," Steeg said. "People will adjust, too. They've got four days to get
here, and they'll find a way. That's what it amounts to."

<HEADLINE> Wandering QB Back at Super Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Uprooted, unwanted and unstable, Neil O'Donnell has survived
an odyssey that might sound familiar to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans' backup quarterback knows what it's like to go month to month,
never quite sure where he'll be playing next.
</P>
<P>
	   And just like his teammates, he was pleased and surprised this season when
he found himself wearing a funky new uniform, playing in a glimmering new
stadium and unexpectedly preparing for the franchise's first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the nature of the business these days," O'Donnell said. "It's a world
of free agency. People move around. It seems like every year was a different
year for me. Whether it was a salary-cap thing, or a team was going in another
direction, that's just how it's been for me."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans are O'Donnell's fourth team in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   He was the starter at Pittsburgh for the better part of five seasons and was
at the helm when the Steelers made the Super Bowl in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   In a familiar refrain for Steelers fans, O'Donnell became a free agent after
his most successful season in Pittsburgh. The Jets offered him $25 million, and
O'Donnell's whirlwind began.
</P>
<P>
	   His first season in New York was mired by bad luck and bad football. He
played in only six games, his season coming to an end when he suffered a leg
injury after slipping on the Jets logo in the end zone during pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
	   The next season, Bill Parcells replaced Rich Kotite as coach, and O'Donnell
started 14 games, but never won the demanding coach's trust.
</P>
<P>
	   A season in Cincinnati followed. O'Donnell started 11 games in place of the
injured Jeff Blake and recorded a 90.2 quarterback rating. But when the Bengals
drafted Akili Smith, it was obvious they were moving in another direction.
</P>
<P>
	   In stepped the Titans, looking for an insurance policy for Steve McNair.
When McNair ruptured a disc in his back before Week 2 this season, the policy
paid off.
</P>
<P>
	   "A big part of the success of this season was Neil's ability to come in and,
in a very short period of time, learn our offense and start," coach Jeff Fisher
said. "It says an awful lot about Neil O'Donnell, his ability and his
capabilities to play in this league."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Donnell went 4-1 as the starter, completed 59.5 percent of his passes and
helped the Titans get off to the start they had to have after opening the
previous seasons at 1-3 and 1-4.
</P>
<P>
	   While the media and some fans were clamoring for a quarterback controversy
upon McNair's return to health, O'Donnell played it cool and accepted his role.
</P>
<P>
	   The role this week has changed. A 10-year veteran, he's the voice of
experience for Tennessee, which has only three players besides himself who have
ever played in a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "Neil has stepped up like a true pro and won games for us," tight end Frank
Wycheck said. "Obviously, he's been successful in this league. He's been to a
few championship games. He's been to the Super Bowl. He knows what it takes to
win."
</P>
<P>
	   Who knows if the love affair will continue?
</P>
<P>
	   At the core, O'Donnell is a realist. He's been set aside before for
quarterbacks younger and more talented. He knows what a big role the bottom line
can play in this league.
</P>
<P>
	   He says he'd like to return to Tennessee next season. Undoubtedly, the
Titans would love to have him.
</P>
<P>
	   But he still has the urge to start in the NFL and, of course, to make as
much money as he can to close his wandering career.
</P>
<P>
	   "It gets harder after a while, especially when you have a family and kids in
school," O'Donnell said. "But when you look at the season we had -- I played a
lot earlier this year, learned the system real quick and contributed. We made it
to the Super Bowl. I think this was the right move."

<HEADLINE> 15 Finalists Await Hall of Fame Vote  </HEADLINE>
    By HAL BOCK AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Fifteen finalists, including Joe Montana and Ronnie Lott,
awaited the vote for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
	   Montana and Lott, longtime teammates and the offensive and defensive
cornerstones of four San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl championship teams, were the
only candidates to make the list of finalists in their first year of
eligibility.
</P>
<P>
	   Together, they led the 49ers to NFL championships in 1982, 1985, 1989 and
1990 before finishing their careers with other teams, Montana with Kansas City
and Lott with the Los Angeles Raiders and New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
	   Montana was a three-time Super Bowl MVP and never threw an interception in
122 attempts. He holds six Super Bowl passing records, including 11 career
touchdown passes, 357 yards passing against Cincinnati in 1989 and 1,142 career
yards passing.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott was an eight-time All-Pro at cornerback, strong safety and free safety
and holds the NFL postseason record with nine interceptions. He recorded
100-plus tackles five times in a 14-year career.
</P>
<P>
	   They were the top candidates being considered by the selection committee of
38 writers and broadcasters who will choose between four and seven new members
for the Canton, Ohio, shrine. Election requires support from 80 percent of the
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Other finalists included defensive end Howie Long and wide receiver Lynn
Swann, both among the top six in last year's balloting and automatically
returned for consideration. Long had 84 career sacks in 13 seasons with the
Raiders in Oakland and Los Angeles. Swann, a Super Bowl MVP, played on four
championship teams in six years with the Pittsburgh Steelers and held the Super
Bowl career receiving yards record of 364 yards when he retired.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining them on the list of modern players to be considered were linebacker
Harry Carson, tight end Dave Casper, defensive end Carl Eller, wide receiver
James Lofton, guard Mike Munchak, wide receiver John Stallworth, offensive
tackle Ron Yary and defensive end Jack Youngblood.
</P>
<P>
	   Carson reached nine Pro Bowls in 13 seasons with the New York Giants. Casper
spent 11 seasons with the Raiders, Houston Oilers and Minnesota Vikings and
caught 378 passes for 5,216 yards and 52 touchdowns. Eller and Yary were
teammates on four Minnesota Super Bowl teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Lofton was the first NFL player to score touchdowns in three decades and
caught 764 passes for 14,004 yards and 75 TDs in 16 seasons with five teams.
Stallworth was Swann's receiving partner on the Steelers' four Super Bowl teams
and caught 537 passes for 8,723 yards and 63 TDs.
</P>
<P>
	   Munchak, the offensive line coach of the Tennessee Titans, played in nine
Pro Bowls in 12 seasons with the franchise when it was in Houston. Youngblood
missed only one game in 14 years with the Los Angeles Rams and played 201
consecutive games, a Rams record.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on the ballot were coach Marv Levy, who took the Buffalo Bills to four
consecutive Super Bowls; Pittsburgh Steelers owner and administrator Dan Rooney;
and old-timer nominee Dave Wilcox, a linebacker with the 49ers from 1964-74, who
was selected for seven Pro Bowls.
</P>
<P>
	   Players must be retired five years to be eligible for the Hall of Fame.
Coaches become eligible as soon as they leave the sidelines, and administrators
can still be active. Old-timer nominees must have completed 70 percent of their
careers by 1975 and automatically advance to the final seven candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hall of Fame induction at Canton is scheduled for July 29.

<HEADLINE> Second Time a Charm for Rams, Martz  </HEADLINE>
    By R.B. FALLSTROM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- It's safe to say Mike Martz' second interview with the St.
Louis Rams went a lot better than the first.
</P>
<P>
	   When Dick Vermeil was hired in 1997, he talked to the displaced staff as a
courtesy. Then he swept them out, including Martz, the silver-haired former
quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Fast forward to the eve of the Super Bowl. Martz is next in line for the job
when Vermeil retires, probably after the 2001 season, and thinking what a funny
business he's in.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't know him well enough to know he'd be able to do the job he's
done," Vermeil said. "You don't get better without taking risks. He has exceeded
my expectations."
</P>
<P>
	   Martz, 48, transformed the Rams (15-3) from a 27th-rated, humdrum offense
into the third-highest scoring team in NFL history. He dazzled defenses with a
bewildering variety of formations that provide freedom for MVP quarterback Kurt
Warner and Marshall Faulk, the league's offensive player of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Martz has been inventive, bold, decisive.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've heard the mad scientist term," guard Adam Timmerman said. "He's kind
of got the image of that. On the offensive line, you can sense they (opponents)
are a little off-balance. They don't know what you're going to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Every week, Martz tries to come up with something new, like bunching four
wideouts on the left side of the field and then throwing to the right. Or going
for it all on the first play, as the Rams did with Warner's 77-yard touchdown
strike to Isaac Bruce against the Minnesota Vikings in their first playoff game.
</P>
<P>
	   "He puts together a brilliant package," wide receiver Az-Zahir Hakim said.
"He knows personnel and what to do with the style of people we have on the
team."
</P>
<P>
	   He's also off the market, removing perhaps the team's biggest distraction in
the playoffs. As speculation swirled about Martz's future, the team made a
surprise announcement that tied their most marketable assistant to the team a
few days before the Rams routed the Vikings 49-37.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a huge relief," Martz said. "It was a distraction that just wasn't
good for anybody. It wasn't good for the team, it certainly wasn't good for me,
and I'm just happy to have it over with."
</P>
<P>
	   The well ran dry last week in the Rams' 11-6, grind-it-out victory over the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk was stuck in the starting blocks, held to 49 total yards. Warner
wasn't sharp, and a lot of his quick outs were floaters, exposing the Rams'
smallish receivers to big hits from the Bucs' defense. Rookie Torry Holt left in
the first quarter with bruised ribs, then again in the third quarter with a
shoulder injury, and Az-Zahir Hakim missed time due to dehydration.
</P>
<P>
	   The plays began to come in late because Martz was missing some key weapons.
The genius was scrambling out of the pocket, and the Rams had to burn three
timeouts.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't quite sure who was in the huddle," Martz said. "We were trying to
get a guy in and out, and it threw me off."
</P>
<P>
	   Not permanently, of course. Warner caught the Bucs in a safety blitz, and
his 30-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl, throughout his career a possession
receiver, put the Rams in their first Super Bowl in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, Martz admitted to a case of nerves.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we all had jitters," he said. "I had the jitters, I can tell you
that."
</P>
<P>
	   In the Super Bowl, Martz promises it'll be back to high-flying.
</P>
<P>
	   "We like to be as aggressive as we can, and sometimes a great defense won't
let you do that," Martz said. "We're not going to change how we run things."

	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Tennessee Titans coach Jeff Fisher, who beat the
Jacksonville Jaguars three times this season, isn't above zinging his AFC
Central foes.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked Friday about playing in four stadiums in three cities the past four
seasons, Fisher took aim at the team he beat in the AFC championship game, the
Titans' third victory over the Jaguars this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some would say we've had five home stadiums in four years if you include
Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   His Titans are 5-1 in Jacksonville.

	   SUPER CHIEFS AND VIKINGS: The pregame coin toss at the Super Bowl will
feature seven Hall of Famers who participated in the fourth Super Bowl 30 years
ago between Minnesota and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
	   Representing the Chiefs will be founder Lamar Hunt, linebackers Bobby Bell
and Willie Lanier and kicker Jan Stenerud, while former coach Bud Grant,
defensive end Alan Page and safety Paul Krause will represent the Vikings.
Kansas City won the game 23-7.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to practice this coin toss over and over to make sure there are
no slipups," Grant said with a laugh. "We're each going to carry our own coin so
we won't wind up like that referee in the commercial."
</P>

	   CYBERCASTING: Superbowl.com is bringing a new term to football vernacular:
the cybercast.
</P>
<P>
	   Evan Kamer, NFL director of business development and overseer of
Superbowl.com, said more than a million hits are expected on the Internet site
on Sunday. Web surfers are attracted by interactive chats, polls, video clips
and electronic games.
</P>
<P>
	   While its game day capabilities are limited by not being able to have live
feeds during the game, Superbowl.com was especially active on media day this
week. Live video of all team press conferences were webcast.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the most popular features was a 360-degree video camera that allowed
on-line users to personally manipulate what they could see during media day.
</P>
<P>
	   "It brings you here without really being here," Kamer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Users also had access this week to daily diaries by London Fletcher and
D'Marco Farr of the St. Louis Rams. Another new element this year was
Superbowl.com radio, a live daily Internet show featuring ESPN's Ron Jaworski,
Merrill Hoge and NFL "cybercaster" Gil Brandt.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, the game will be cybercast with still photos and delayed videos,
with Brandt and Joe Theismann providing commentary and interviewing guests.

	   PREGAME DATING: A Houston man bitter over the Oilers' move to Tennessee
four years ago was willing to go to absurd lengths to get some revenge.
</P>
<P>
	   Hefty 34-year-old Ronald Salazar donned makeup, women's clothing and a huge
false chest Friday to become a contestant in a "dating game" at Houston's
Gallery Furniture warehouse. The prize was a trip with a furniture salesman to
see the St. Louis Rams and Tennessee Titans in the Super Bowl, one of six
tickets the store gave away.
</P>
<P>
	   "Man, we could have had a good time," the disappointed Salazar shouted at
the salesman after being passed over for real women.
</P>
<P>
	   Consoled by door prizes, Salazar later laughed about his stunt.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told them, 'Hey, the Super Bowl is better for a guy,"' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The former Oilers fan had strong personal reasons for wanting to go to the
big game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to see the Rams whip the Titans," he said. "It was hard for me when
the Oilers moved to Tennessee. Now I'm just glad they're gone."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   SAGE ADVICE: A member of the St. Louis media said the Rams stopped losing
when he started burning sage as a good-luck charm.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Balzer of Pro Football Weekly and all-sports station KFNS said he got
the idea from a psychic who told him before the season that the team was
surrounded by "negative energy" brought from somewhere else. The Rams moved from
Anaheim, Calif., in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   He's been burning the herb before kickoff since the final preseason game,
and the Rams are 15-3 after going 4-12 last season.
</P>
<P>
	   "It works," Balzer said. "I don't know why, but it works."
</P>
<P>
	   Balzer's practice almost got him into trouble earlier this week at the NFL
media center, which has a no-smoking rule. Security personnel smelled the odor
and suspected someone was smoking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
	   Balzer said he escaped detection by quickly extinguishing the sage and
shoving it under a table.

<HEADLINE> Cris Carter Wins Man of Year Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Cris Carter of the Minnesota Vikings is the first recipient
of the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, honoring the memory of the
league's all-time rushing leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, a seven-time Pro Bowl choice, was cited Friday for his work with
inner-city school children and other community activities
</P>
<P>
	   With Payton's widow, Connie, and brother, Eddie, beside him, Carter called
the award "a tremendously humbling experience.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was arguably the greatest player and the greatest competitor in the
league," Carter said, referring to Payton, who died Nov. 1 at age 45. "To
receive an award named after him is tremendous."
</P>
<P>
	   Payton was the 1977 winner of the award.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter said Payton had an impact on the players who followed him into the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   "I watched Randy Moss put No. 34 on his shoes every game and the NFL fined
him $5,000 every game," Carter said. "He did what he wanted to do. Walter
Payton's spirit lives on forever."
</P>
<P>
	   League spokesman Greg Aiello said Moss had been fined $5,000 once, for
waving a towel with 34 on it during a Monday night game. "There was a
league-wide moment of silence and the clubs were advised that no team other than
the Bears should independently wear a decal or a patch," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter has been a mentor to many younger Vikings players including Moss and
Robert Griffith. He said he was at risk at one time in his career, struggling
with chemical dependency and marriage problems, when he was claimed on waivers
by the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I came into this league, I was a little boy," he said. "Now I am a
man. "The Vikings gave me a new life."
</P>
<P>
	   He said he embraces the chance to change lives.
</P>
<P>
	   "Young people are looking for role models," he said. "We can make an impact.
We can make a difference in people's lives. It's time to stand up, make our
stand that we can be different and make good choices."
</P>
<P>
	   Carter, second in NFL history with 101 touchdown receptions and fourth in
career receptions with 834, said there were 15 or 20 players in the league who
could have won the award.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot were deserving," he said. "I'm ever so thankful they selected me. I
wish I could be playing in the Super Bowl but nothing replaces this award. Fewer
people win this."

<HEADLINE> Vermeil's Weepiness May Be Catching  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Dick Vermeil's weepiness might be getting contagious.
</P>
<P>
	   Stan Kroenke, who owns a third of the St. Louis Rams, warned players after
practice Friday that he might choke up -- the way their coach often does.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told them, 'Bear with me, because I've been around Dick for three years
and I get a little emotional. But I know from being around Dick, it's OK,"'
Kroenke said.
</P>
<P>
	   That drew a laugh from Rams players, who then gave Kroenke a sendoff with
their team chant: "Stan ... Gotta Go to Work!"
</P>
<P>
	   The team practiced for 90 minutes in the Georgia Dome, a workout delayed at
the start for 15 minutes while the Tennessee Titans finished. The Titans began
their workout late so the dome could be checked for spies.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't in a hurry," Vermeil said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kicker Jeff Wilkins didn't test his sore left knee, but will be the Rams'
kicker on Sunday. Nick Lowery, who tried out in St. Louis before the NFC
championship game, is in Atlanta and brought his kicking shoes just in case.
</P>
<P>
	   "We spoke to him a couple of times this week and he was very close to
getting a call," Vermeil said. "But Jeff kicked well yesterday and his knee felt
a lot better."
</P>
<P>
	   Center Mike Gruttadauria was back at practice after skipping the previous
day with the flu.
</P>
<P>
	   Inactives were defensive end Lionel Barnes, linebacker Troy Pelshak, running
back Justin Watson and offensive tackle Matt Willig. Wide receiver Chris Thomas,
who was on the early list last week, was left active for now in case Torry Holt
can't go. Holt suffered rib and shoulder injuries in the NFC championship game
and was probable.
</P>
<P>
	   As he has often done in the past, Vermeil railed against the NFL policy that
requires a team to sit down eight players, especially for a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's absolutely ridiculous," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams will have a brief walkthrough at the dome on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Adams, Frontiere Reach Promised Land  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- One is a grizzled oil man, shuffling toward sunset with
long, gray hair dangling over his ears and memories uncluttered by political
correctness.
</P>
<P>
	   The other is a blonde, ex-Vegas showgirl in a good ol' boys world, married
seven times and at ease walking the sideline in slingback pumps.
</P>
<P>
	   Bud Adams.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia Frontiere.
</P>
<P>
	   Two carpetbaggers who reached the Super Bowl promised land together this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew we were going to get there some day, but I wasn't sure when it would
be," said Adams, owner of the Tennessee Titans and their previous incarnation,
the Houston Oilers, for 40 years. "I didn't want to get there in a wheelchair. I
wanted to be standing up on both feet."
</P>
<P>
	   Frontiere assumed control of the Los Angeles Rams in 1979 after one of her
husbands, Carroll Rosenbloom, drowned in a riptide off the coast of Florida. She
was the NFL's only female owner then; two decades and a new city later, she's
still a loner in that regard.
</P>
<P>
	   While she seems to have taken a hands-off approach in recent years, the Rams
insist Frontiere has remained active in running the team since it moved to St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   "Her role has been the same since I've been here," Rams president John Shaw
said. "She's consulted, advised and participates in all major decisions."
</P>
<P>
	   Some of her methods have made Frontiere an easy target for ridicule from the
media. Astrology, holistic healing, numerology and Cabbage Patch dolls are just
a few of her quirky tools.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps that is why she slipped quietly into Atlanta, while Adams marked his
arrival Thursday with a rambling, drawling, laugh-filled news conference.
Frontiere declined to take phone calls at the team hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's not doing interviews this week," team spokesman Rick Smith said.
"She'll probably talk after the game."
</P>
<P>
	   Both owners are reticent about discussing their age. Adams is at least 77,
while Frontiere is more likely in the mid-to-late 60s.
</P>
<P>
	   Rams coach Dick Vermeil, who met Frontiere and Rosenbloom in 1972, has
gotten along well with her since taking the job three years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "My experience with her said the ownership never interfered with the
progress of the football team," Vermeil said. "I had no concern about not being
supported."
</P>
<P>
	   For both Adams and Frontiere, the unlikely Super Bowl pairing is more than
just a triumph.
</P>
<P>
	   It's vindication.
</P>
<P>
	   After the 1994 season, Frontiere abandoned the nation's No. 2 television
market and moved the franchise to her hometown, St. Louis, which promised a new
domed stadium and almost $20 million in annual profit.
</P>
<P>
	   The other owners, angered with the idea of losing Los Angeles, punished the
Rams by taking away their share of the expansion fees when Cleveland and Houston
joined the league.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston lost its original team after a nasty feud between Adams and the
mayor. When efforts to build a new stadium in Texas fell through, he packed up
his venerable franchise in 1997 and took a sweetheart deal in the capital of
country music.
</P>
<P>
	   Clearly not a student of relocation, Adams made one public-relations blunder
after another. His team had to spend its final year in Houston as a lame duck,
then planned to play a couple of seasons in Memphis while a new stadium was
under construction in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   But attendance in Memphis was awful and the people of Nashville felt
betrayed. Adams bumped up his timetable and took the team to Vanderbilt's
cramped stadium last season. But he insisted on keeping the Oilers name, which
didn't go over well in a state where the only drilling was done by Jed Clampett.
</P>
<P>
	   The team didn't gain full acceptance until Adelphia Coliseum opened this
season and Adams surrendered his beloved Oilers moniker in favor of Titans. Or
course, he also got the NFL to retire the original nickname so it couldn't be
used by another city, such as Houston.
</P>
<P>
	   Adams has no bad feelings against his team's former home. In fact, he still
lives there and plans to purchase tickets when the new Houston franchise begins
play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have a lot of friends in Houston," said Adams, who supposedly settled
there in 1946 after his plane made a forced landing because of fog. "I'm not
afraid to walk around anywhere in town. People come up to me all the time and
say, 'Hi, Bud."'
</P>
<P>
	   Adams is not afraid to speak his mind, either. An original owner in the old
AFL, he talks openly about doing whatever is necessary to sign a player, whether
it was lining up dates or promising a herd of cattle as a bonus.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had more fun in the old days," Adams said. "Now, you've got to have
everything on the contract."
</P>
<P>
	   While Vermeil's rallying cry this season was taking "Georgia to Georgia,"
the Titans felt a sense of urgency to get Adams to the Super Bowl. The Oilers
were an early power in the AFL, winning the first two titles, but they went the
next 37 years without a championship.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was my No. 1 goal," coach Jeff Fisher said. "Not many people have come
to know him very well. He's misinterpreted. I know he was misunderstood in
Houston. The most important thing to him in life, other than his family, is
getting a chance to play in this ballgame."
</P>
<P>
	   After a lifetime of eccentricity, Frontiere finally seems at peace in her
birthplace. There are only scant memories of the time she fired her stepson,
Steve Rosenbloom, as the Rams executive vice president. Hardly anyone remembers
the embarrassment of having her seventh husband, Dominic Frontiere, go to prison
for income tax evasion after scalping Super Bowl tickets in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   When the Rams defeated Tampa Bay in the NFC championship game, Frontiere
circled the field blowing kisses to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   "St. Louis feels right," Frontiere told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch last
week. "I feel I belong here. I'm part of something really special this season."

<HEADLINE> Titans Practice Heats Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Practice heated up for the Tennessee Titans, and not just
because they moved inside to the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   Receiver Derrick Mason and safety Blaine Bishop came to blows in the final
session of the 1-hour, 40-minute practice Friday. Bishop had been covering Mason
on a pass in a two-minute drill when the ball fell incomplete, and Mason accused
the safety of hitting him in the helmet.
</P>
<P>
	   The two started fighting and had to be separated by teammates. Mason and
Bishop didn't want to stop and were ordered off the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Following practice, Fisher pulled his players and coaches together for a
talk. Then he spoke privately with Bishop and Mason for several minutes. The
players hugged and then left.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's over with," Fisher said. "They compete. They are highly competitive.
That happens over the course of the season. Did you see them walk off the field
together? Those two are about as competitive guys as I've got."
</P>
<P>
	   Practice was moved from Georgia Tech to the Dome in anticipation of a winter
storm hitting the city, and the change allowed the Titans to get used to the
artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
	   Quarterback Steve McNair didn't take as many snaps as Thursday, when he
handled about 80 percent of the drills. But at least McNair practiced, something
he didn't do a week ago before the AFC championship due to a sore toe.
</P>
<P>
	   Receiver Yancey Thigpen, who has a hairline fracture in his right foot, did
not practice for a third straight day, but he was not listed among the first
group of players deactivated for Sunday's Super Bowl. Those players were guard
Zach Piller, linebacker Phil Glover, center Craig Page and safety Marcus
Robertson, who broke his leg last week.

	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro says Elian Gonzalez' mother was
"practically kidnapped" by her boyfriend and intimidated into leaving for the
United States, countering claims that she was on a flight to freedom with her
6-year-old son. Many who want Elian to remain in the United States say his
mother, Elisabeth Brotons, was trying to bring him to freedom in a voyage across
the Straits of Florida that ended with shipwreck. She and 10 others drowned and
Elian was left floating alone in an inner-tube.

Clinton To Attend Economic Forum

raises to a new high the American profile at an annual gathering of economic and
political leaders, at a time when the forum is wresting with tensions between
haves and have-nots in the global economy. Clinton's acceptance of the
invitation of the World Economic Forum was a coup for the foundation that runs
the meeting and the Swiss professor Klaus Schwab, who started the annual
meetings 30 years ago as an informal gathering of economic elites. It is the
first time an American president has joined the gathering.

the number that U.S. officials have recovered during painstaking excavations in
the North Korean countryside over the past three years. Li Gun, a deputy North
Korean representative at his country's United Nations mission in New York, said
Friday his government has offered to return the remains, without conditions. He
said the U.S. government must act quickly because the area where the remains
were found is being converted to cropland.

Storm Spreads More Snow in South

	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A storm spread still more snow across the Deep South on
Friday, giving children from Arkansas to Georgia a rare chance to build snowmen
but threatening travel to the Super Bowl. The storm, which dumped up to 17
inches of snow in Oklahoma earlier this week, dropped between an inch and a foot
in Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee before stalling near the
Alabama-Georgia line for most of the day Friday. As midnight approached,
however, the storm was moving through northern Georgia, National Weather Service
meteorologist Terry Murphy said. Areas in north Georgia and parts of central
Georgia got snow, sleet and freezing rain, he said.

Bradley Turns Up the Heat on Gore
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- Democratic activists squeezed elbow to elbow were
already fanning themselves in the stuffy banquet room when Bill Bradley grabbed
the microphone and turned up the heat on Vice President Al Gore. Calling the
Democratic Party fund-raising scandals of 1996 "embarrassing" and "disgraceful,"
Bradley warned: "If we don't clean our house, the Republicans will clean it for
us in the fall." Reflecting on President Clinton's State of the Union address
the previous night, Bradley questioned whether the good ideas of Clinton and
Gore could be realized under their leadership. "I wondered, will we ever be able
to achieve those programs with politics as usual," Bradley said.

Amazon.com Stock Falls Amid Layoffs
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Internet retailing giant Amazon.com, a trend setter since it
went online in 1995, has announced another first -- layoffs. The company, which
added more than 5,000 workers to its payroll last year, said it will layoff
about 150 workers. News of the layoffs helped send the company's shares down
$5.25 to $61.68 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market on Friday. Those shares are now
down 42 percent from their mid-December peak of more than $106. Cuts were
announced at a company meeting Thursday night. The move is an internal
reorganization and represents 2 percent of Amazon's total work force of about
7,500, Amazon.com spokesman Bill Curry said.

Castro Says Elian's Mother Was 'Kidnapped'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro says Elian Gonzalez' mother was
"practically kidnapped" by her boyfriend and intimidated into leaving for the
United States, countering claims that she was on a flight to freedom with her
6-year-old son. Many who want Elian to remain in the United States say his
mother, Elisabeth Brotons, was trying to bring him to freedom in a voyage across
the Straits of Florida that ended with shipwreck. She and 10 others drowned and
Elian was left floating alone in an inner-tube.

Clinton To Attend Economic Forum
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- President Clinton's whirlwind visit here Saturday
raises to a new high the American profile at an annual gathering of economic and
political leaders, at a time when the forum is wresting with tensions between
haves and have-nots in the global economy. Clinton's acceptance of the
invitation of the World Economic Forum was a coup for the foundation that runs
the meeting and the Swiss professor Klaus Schwab, who started the annual
meetings 30 years ago as an informal gathering of economic elites. It is the
first time an American president has joined the gathering.

Korean War Remains Said Discovered

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea says it happened upon more than 400 remains
of people likely to be American servicemen killed in the Korean War -- 10 times
the number that U.S. officials have recovered during painstaking excavations in
the North Korean countryside over the past three years. Li Gun, a deputy North
Korean representative at his country's United Nations mission in New York, said
Friday his government has offered to return the remains, without conditions. He
said the U.S. government must act quickly because the area where the remains
were found is being converted to cropland.

Storm Spreads More Snow in South

	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A storm spread still more snow across the Deep South on
Friday, giving children from Arkansas to Georgia a rare chance to build snowmen
but threatening travel to the Super Bowl. The storm, which dumped up to 17
inches of snow in Oklahoma earlier this week, dropped between an inch and a foot
in Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee before stalling near the
Alabama-Georgia line for most of the day Friday. As midnight approached,
however, the storm was moving through northern Georgia, National Weather Service
meteorologist Terry Murphy said. Areas in north Georgia and parts of central
Georgia got snow, sleet and freezing rain, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Arrives for Economic Forum  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- President Clinton joined an annual economic forum
here today in a whirlwind visit to urge world business and political leaders to
heed labor and environmental concerns in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the first time an American president has attended the World Economic
Forum, bringing to a new high the U.S. profile at what began 30 years ago as an
informal gathering of economic elites in this Alpine resort.
</P>
<P>
	   Top administration officials and leading members of Congress and state
governments have routinely attended the forums, but the Clinton entourage makes
this the biggest U.S. delegation yet, a forum spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	   One organizer quipped there will be more members of the U.S. Cabinet here
than there usually are in Washington. They include Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Commerce Secretary William Daley, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H.
Summers and Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, as well as other top Clinton
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plane touched down at Zurich airport shortly after 2 a.m. EST,
airport officials said. He planned to stay only a few hours in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   Undaunted by threats of anti-free trade demonstrations, Clinton was expected
to return in his speech today to the same theme he addressed in Seattle last
month: the need to include worker rights and environmental safeguards in global
trade talks.
</P>
<P>
	   His audience in the Alpine resort -- nearly 2,000 leaders of world
corporations, governments and academia -- has already been urged by other top
speakers -- including British Prime Minister Tony Blair -- to take steps in
world trade that will allay the anxieties of people fearing a loss of jobs or
income because of shifting investments.
</P>
<P>
	   Groups that oppose the closed meetings of the six-day forum and the
megacorporations represented in Davos plan to defy a Swiss ban on demonstrations
today. They say the elite meeting has undue influence on the lives of people
around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Security in the narrow valley town has been tightened further, with checks
being made on people traveling into the resort by road or train. The Swiss army
has been dispatched for the first time to act as reinforcements to police
brought in from across Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   The session of the World Trade Organization in Seattle late last year saw
large demonstrations by opponents, and some protests turned into violent clashes
with police.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's views on trade coincide with those of many peaceful anti-WTO
protesters in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   The ideas clash, however, with those of many developing countries that
regard the attempt to impose labor standards in trade agreements as being unfair
interference in their affairs by rich nations. And a new trade round will fail
to go forward until it receives support from across the 135-member WTO.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's arrival Friday started shifting the attention of the gathering to
the search for solutions to regional tensions.
</P>
<P>
	   She met separately with the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey Friday,
encouraging the cautious steps the two NATO allies are taking to overcome
decades of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said Clinton and Albright would be meeting with other leaders
representing peoples involved in regional tensions or conflicts, including the
presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also is to join Clinton in a session with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Friday canceled his visit to
the forum, which ruled out a possible three-way meeting on Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone in Davos was thrilled by Clinton's appearance at the forum.
Bruno Gerber, the 13,000-population town's tourism director, said, ``We are not
ready and not big enough and not organized enough in such a small resort to have
such an army of people just trying to secure one man.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm quite glad that he's not going to stay here for a couple of days,''
Gerber told The Associated Press. ``That would not be good for the resort.''

	   Sleet and freezing rain fell in Tennessee and northern Georgia today, while
rain showers dotted parts of the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Sections of the South were under winter storm watches, warnings and
advisories, presaging a possible day of freezing rain, sleet and snow in many
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Such harsh conditions were expected from eastern Iowa and Missouri, south
into Mississippi and east into Florida and South Carolina, with anywhere from 3
inches to 6 inches of snow and locally heavy rain possible.
</P>
<P>
	   In the East, another day of bitter cold is expected as wintry conditions
continue. Some lake effect snow showers were forecast for the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   A few lake effect snow showers were forecast for the Northeast, and skies
were expected to be cloudy and dry across the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the central United States is expected to have a day of partly to
mostly cloudy skies, and 1 inch to 3 inches of snow could fall in Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Iowa. Light snow or flurries will be
possible northward through the Dakotas, but little accumulation is expected.
</P>
<P>
	   A day of pleasant weather is forecast for the West before a storm system is
expected to move in from the Pacific and spread rain and snow throughout the
region on Sunday. Partly cloudy skies are expected in most areas, though light
rain and snow showers are expected to develop across western and central
California late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Highs today were forecast in the teens and 20s in the Northeast, the Great
Lakes and the northern and central Plains; in the 30s and 40s in the
mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and southern Plains; 40s and 50s in the Northwest
and much of the West; and 60s and 70s in the Southwest and southern Florida.

<HEADLINE> McCain Faces Must-win Test in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EXETER, N.H. (AP) -- Even if Sen. John McCain wins the first-in-the-nation
presidential primary, Gov. George Bush says his campaign for the White House
remains strong.
</P>
<P>
	   Win or lose in New Hampshire, ``I will survive,'' says Bush, the Republican
front-runner nationally.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain will be battling this weekend to hold back Bush and gain the victory
his underdog presidential campaign needs. The five-man Republican field heads
into the final days of campaigning before the voting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, in a two-front fight against staunch conservative candidates on one
side and the more moderate McCain on the other, believed he was narrowing the
gap, aides said. But they also said the Texas governor might run out of time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There would have to be a sea change in voter attitudes'' for McCain to
lose, said Ken Khachigian, one of the Arizona senator's advisers.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority of public polls Friday gave McCain the lead, but they also
offered Bush reason to hope. Conservative Steve Forbes was running a distant
third, still taking aim at Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Four days before the balloting, the GOP campaigns launched their
get-out-the-vote drives and made final decisions on weekend TV ads. Unlike past
years, when negative ads were part of the closing-weekend dynamic, the top-tier
campaigns decided to keep their attack spots off the air unless a rival went
first.
</P>
<P>
	   Though eleventh-hour attacks could still hit Monday, the reluctance to go
negative suggested that McCain, Bush and Forbes were focusing on turning out
their supporters rather than trying to peel away their rivals' backers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Absent any earth-shattering events this weekend, it's all going to come
down to turnout,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor said he had ``a very good chance'' of winning Tuesday.
But whatever happens, Bush told reporters, ``I'm in it for the long pull,'' with
a campaign well organized in primary states beyond New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, however, can't afford to lose here, his aides said. With a fraction
of Bush's money and little support from the party establishment, McCain's
longshot strategy is to hobble Bush in New Hampshire and ride the momentum into
later primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Duprey, New Hampshire's Republican Party chairman, said McCain was the
man to beat, but he sensed Bush gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has been leading in most polls, using his strength among
independents, while a couple of polls have shown the race very close. Tracking
polls, which are sometimes unreliable, showed Bush gaining ground on McCain
after Wednesday's debate by getting increasing support from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, meanwhile, was being squeezed from the right and left. While McCain
kept him occupied, conservative voters were flirting with Forbes, Alan Keyes and
Gary Bauer.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Concedes Radiation Exposure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- The government has conceded for the first time that workers who
helped make nuclear weapons were exposed to cancer-causing radiation and
chemicals, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings that radiation exposure led to higher-than-normal and
wide-ranging cancers in workers is detailed in a draft report prepared by the
Energy Department and the White House, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the first time that the government is acknowledging that people
got cancer from radiation exposure in the plants,'' Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson told the Times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the past, the role of the government was to take a hike,'' Richardson
said, ``and I think that was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   The admission raises the possibility that the government may eventually be
forced to compensate families and survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said 22 different kinds of cancers, including leukemia, Hodgkin's
lymphoma, prostate, kidney and lung cancer, were found among 600,000 people who
worked at 14 nuclear weapons plants since World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the Manhattan Project in 1957, when workers began handling radioactive
material to produce atomic bombs, the government has minimized workers' risks
and spent millions defending itself in lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   The Energy Department, along with various agencies, have been compiling data
since July after Richardson's agency concluded that some workers at weapons
plants supplying beryllium developed beryllium disease, an incurable lung
ailment.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton ordered a broad study that would also look at the effects
of radiation and chemical hazards from uranium, plutonium and other substances.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniel J. Guttman, an attorney for the Paper, Allied-Industrial Chemical and
Energy Workers Union, called the draft conclusions stunning. Guttman's firm
represents employees at 11 weapons factories.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The prior story line is, 'What's the big deal, the risks were marginal,'''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings come from epidemiological studies performed from as far back as
the mid-1960s, including many dismissed by the government when they were

<HEADLINE> Shovels Are Part of Forest Activism  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT SONNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELKO, Nev. (AP) -- More than 10,000 shovels from around the country are
being hauled into this northeast Nevada town today as part of a protest against
the U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
	   The shovels are a sign of support from loggers, ranchers and miners across
the country for local activists taking on the federal government in their fight
to rebuild a road in the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.
</P>
<P>
	   The fight over rebuilding the road has become a rallying cry for people in
these parts fed up with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they start to shut one road down, then it will be another, then
another,'' State Assemblyman John Carpenter said Friday, as pickup trucks full
of shovels began to show up at his real estate office in Elko.
</P>
<P>
	   South Canyon Road was washed out in a flood in 1995. Local residents had
planned to rebuild it, but a federal judge issued a restraining order last fall,
after Forest Service biologists said doing so would create silt and pollution
runoff into the Jarbidge River, jeopardizing survival of the southernmost
population of bull trout in the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Elko County Commission claims the Forest Service has no jurisdiction
over the road because it was there before the national forest was established in
the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
	   Resentment over federal control runs deep in rural Nevada, where the
government owns 87 percent of the land, the largest percentage in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn is among those who support the ``Jarbidge Shovel
Brigade Parade'' protest, planned down Elko's main street today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes the only way to get their attention is to stand up for our
rights,'' he said in a letter Friday to Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Hurst, a Montana saw mill owner, came up with the idea of collecting the
shovels for the Elko activists, who want to reconstruct the road by hand this
summer.
</P>
<P>
	   A caravan of trucks picked up shovels along the way on an 800-mile trek from
Montana and Idaho to Nevada on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   A fire truck and a half-dozen emergency vehicles with their lights flashing
escorted the caravan into Wells about 6 p.m. Friday. A dozen pickup trucks were
loaded down with shovels along with a dump truck carrying an estimated 1,200
shovels and a semi-trailer with 7,000 to 8,000. They'll head the last 50 miles
west on Interstate 80 to Elko early today in time for the parade.
</P>
<P>
	   The parade will end at the courthouse, where a 30-foot shovel has been
erected with 4,000 names engraved in support of the Jarbidge Shovel Brigade.

<HEADLINE> Slain Woman's Ex-Husband Arrested  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN KELLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DECATUR, Ill. (AP) -- Authorities have arrested a man and his parents in the
1996 slaying of his ex-wife whose dismembered body was found floating in a lake
by fishermen.
</P>
<P>
	   Grand jury documents allege the three shot and killed 23-year-old Karyn
Hearn Slover and that the two men tried to conceal the crime by ``cutting,
burning and destroying'' her body.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael K. Slover Jr., 29, and his parents, Michael K. Slover Sr., 53, and
Jeanette Slover, 52, were arrested without incident, Illinois State Police Sgt.
Rory Steidl said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   They were arrested Thursday just hours after the third grand jury to
consider the case returned indictments against all three for first-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Macon County State's Attorney Lawrence Fichter would not discuss a possible
motive or who he thinks fired the fatal shots. Karyn Slover was shot five times
in the head.
</P>
<P>
	   Fichter said he would ask the judge to deny bond for all three until trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Sam Cahnman, who represented the younger Slover during the grand
jury proceedings, said Friday, ``To the best of my knowledge my client is not
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Calls to the office of the attorney representing the parents were not
answered.
</P>
<P>
	   Karyn Slover vanished Sept. 27, 1996. She was last seen by co-workers at the
Decatur Herald &AMP; Review, where she worked in the newspaper's advertising
department. She left the newspaper that day to pick up her 3-year-old son at her
in-laws' home. She was never heard from again.
</P>
<P>
	   The car she was driving was found that night, abandoned with the engine
running 29 miles northeast of Decatur on Interstate 72. Two days later,
fishermen found parts of her dismembered body in plastic bags in Lake
Shelbyville -- 41 miles away from where the car was left.

<HEADLINE> Illnesses From Recalled Dip Increase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The number of confirmed cases of shigellosis
linked to varieties of bean dip has risen to 30 in California, health officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Health Director Diana Bonta on Friday reiterated her warning against
eating the dips sold under the brand names: Senor Felix's Five-Layered Party
Dip, Delicioso 5-Layer Dip, Trader Joe's Five-Layered Fiesta Dip, or The
Carryout Cafe Mexican Fiesta Party Dip 5 Layer.
</P>
<P>
	   The manufacturer recalled the contaminated dip last week.
</P>
<P>
	   They may be contaminated with shigella, a serious -- and highly contagious
-- type of bacteria that causes bloody diarrhea, cramps, fever, nausea and
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the California illnesses, as least 22 cases have been
reported in Washington, nine in Oregon and one in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
	   The dips were manufactured by Senor Felix's Gourmet Mexican Foods in Los
Angeles and distributed nationwide, primarily through Costco and Trader Joe's,
the health department said.

<HEADLINE> NYC Ends Welfare Psychics Program  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY McSHANE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City officials could sense it: the bad publicity,
the worse jokes.
</P>
<P>
	   And so, predictably, officials with the city's Human Resources
Administration announced Friday that welfare recipients could no longer apply
for jobs with the Psychic Network through a city program.
</P>
<P>
	   The telephone pay service offered clairvoyance at $4.99 a minute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Though HRA believes people should have the freedom to choose their own
employment, HRA's Business Link has decided to not include the Psychic Network
as one of its participating employers,'' said a statement from Jason A. Turner,
the agency's commissioner.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to pull the plug on the psychic connection came hours after the
hiring policy was made public. Since last April, network instructors had taught
15 welfare clients to read tarot cards and offer their callers a peek into the
future.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, agency spokeswoman Ruth Reinecke said the jobs were odd-sounding
but not strange at all.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The pay is rather good, and it's attractive to work out of the home for
the mothers who have young children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The qualifications were a high school diploma and the ability to read, write
and speak English; the pay started at $10 an hour, plus bonuses. The ability to
see into the future was not a prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
	   The city refused to provide any information about the Psychic Network,
citing a confidentiality agreement with companies that participate in the
``workfare'' program. The plan attempts to lower the welfare rolls by finding
jobs for recipients; city officials say they have done that for 538,000 people
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The Human Resources offices received a large number of calls about the plan
after The New York Times first reported it. A Pittsburgh radio reporter trying
to track down an agency spokeswoman said the report was the subject of ``great
mirth'' in the Steel City.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman in the administration's offices Friday was laughing when she
answered another reporter's call. ``Is this about the psychics?'' she
intuitively inquired.
</P>
<P>
	   The 900-number services are legal but are required to run a disclaimer that
the calls are strictly for entertainment value.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to track down the owner of the Psychic Network could require the use
of tea leaves. The only listing under the name is a Florida bookstore that has
no connection to the telephone business.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no listing for the Psychic Network in New York.

<HEADLINE> McCain Faces Must-Win Test in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EXETER, N.H. (AP) -- Even if Sen. John McCain wins the first-in-the-nation
presidential primary, Gov. George Bush says his campaign for the White House
remains strong.
</P>
<P>
	   Win or lose in New Hampshire, ``I will survive,'' says Bush, the Republican
front-runner nationally.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's effort is to receive a boost today when former President Bush travels
to the state to endorse his son's presidential bid, campaign aides said. The
former president has appeared in advance of his son in Iowa, New Hampshire and
South Carolina but today will be the first time they've appeared together on the
stump.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, the Bush camp picked up the endorsements of former
housing secretary and vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp and of John Sununu,
the former New Hampshire governor and President Bush's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain will be battling this weekend to hold back Bush and gain the victory
his underdog presidential campaign needs. The five-man Republican field heads
into the final days of campaigning before the voting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, in a two-front fight against staunch conservative candidates on one
side and the more moderate McCain on the other, believed he was narrowing the
gap, aides said. But they also said the Texas governor might run out of time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There would have to be a sea change in voter attitudes'' for McCain to
lose, said Ken Khachigian, one of the Arizona senator's advisers.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority of public polls Friday gave McCain the lead, but they also
offered Bush reason to hope. Conservative Steve Forbes was running a distant
third, still taking aim at Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Four days before the balloting, the GOP campaigns launched their
get-out-the-vote drives and made final decisions on weekend TV ads. Unlike past
years, when negative ads were part of the closing-weekend dynamic, the top-tier
campaigns decided to keep their attack spots off the air unless a rival went
first.
</P>
<P>
	   Though eleventh-hour attacks could still hit Monday, the reluctance to go
negative suggested that McCain, Bush and Forbes were focusing on turning out
their supporters rather than trying to peel away their rivals' backers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Absent any earth-shattering events this weekend, it's all going to come
down to turnout,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor said he had ``a very good chance'' of winning Tuesday.
But whatever happens, Bush told reporters, ``I'm in it for the long pull,'' with
a campaign well organized in primary states beyond New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, however, can't afford to lose here, his aides said. With a fraction
of Bush's money and little support from the party establishment, McCain's
longshot strategy is to hobble Bush in New Hampshire and ride the momentum into
later primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Duprey, New Hampshire's Republican Party chairman, said McCain was the
man to beat, but he sensed Bush gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has been leading in most polls, using his strength among
independents, while a couple of polls have shown the race very close. Tracking
polls, which are sometimes unreliable, showed Bush gaining ground on McCain
after Wednesday's debate by getting increasing support from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, meanwhile, was being squeezed from the right and left. While McCain
kept him occupied, conservative voters were flirting with Forbes, Alan Keyes and
Gary Bauer.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Concedes Radiation Exposure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- A draft U.S. government report says elevated
cancer rates have been found among 600,000 workers in the nation's atomic
weapons plants since World War II, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, requested by President Clinton after the government concluded
that workers at some of the plants may have suffered beryllium poisoning, is the
first acknowledgment by the government of a possible cancer link at the plants.
</P>
<P>
	   It also increases the possibility that those exposed or their survivors
might someday receive compensation from the government, Richardson indicated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It does appear that in the DOE complex, there is a direct link between
exposure and the possibility of contamination,'' Richardson told The Associated
Press. ``And if that is the case, the honorable thing for the government to do
is to protect its workers, past and present.''
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson, who accompanied Clinton to Davos for an address to the World
Economic Forum, cautioned that the report is preliminary and said the final
version won't be ready until March.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said elevated cancer rates were found among workers at 14 plants
in the department's atomic weapons complex, including leukemia, Hodgkin's
lymphoma and prostate, kidney salivary gland and lung cancers, The New York
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the beginning of the Manhattan Project in 1943 that developed the
first atomic bombs, the government has minimized the risks to workers handling
radioactive material at the plants.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniel J. Guttman, an attorney for the Paper, Allied-Industrial Chemical and
Energy Workers Union, told the Times that the draft conclusions were stunning.
Guttman's firm represents employees at 11 weapons factories.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The prior story line is, 'What's the big deal, the risks were marginal,'''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings come from epidemiological studies performed from as far back as
the mid-1960s, including many dismissed by the government when they were
published.
</P>
<P>
	   Other information was gathered from the Energy Department, which now owns
the nuclear plants, the Atomic Energy Commission, or their contractors. The
Times said none of the research was specifically done for this study.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the sites noted in the report were several operations at Oak Ridge,
Tenn.; Savannah River in South Carolina; Hanford, in Washington state; Rocky
Flats near Denver; the Fernald Feed Materials Center near Cincinnati; and at the
Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos national laboratories.

<HEADLINE> Ice Storm Hits Atlanta Area  </HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA M. LaHAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A fresh layer of ice caused hundreds of traffic accidents
around northern Georgia today as the region was slammed by a storm that had
swept across the South with more than a foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   One pileup early today involved 47 cars at the junctions of Interstates 20,
75 and 85 in Atlanta, where an ice storm a week earlier caused huge power
outages.
</P>
<P>
	   This latest storm had dumped up to 17 inches of snow in Oklahoma earlier in
the week, with as much as a foot in Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and
Tennessee. In Arkansas, the weather was blamed for three deaths, and one man was
killed today on an ice-covered Atlanta highway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It could be a very, very serious time for us,'' said Phil Badgett, a
forecaster at the National Weather Service in Raleigh, N.C., which got a record
2-foot snowfall a week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Sleet and freezing rain fell early today in parts of Alabama, Georgia and
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm was expected to move out of Georgia and into the Carolinas in time
for Super Bowl Sunday. That would be good news for Atlanta, with more than
100,000 fans expected in town for the big game.
</P>
<P>
	   All runways were open today at Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport,
officials said. Delta Air Lines spokeswoman Alesia Watson said 35 percent of the
day's flights have been canceled, but ``we still have plenty of seats from St.
Louis or Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police around the Atlanta metropolitan area shut down many of the
interchanges to interstate highways this morning because the pavement was so icy
officers couldn't even walk on them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone needs to slow down,'' said DeKalb County police spokeswoman Mikki
Jones. ``We've had (vehicles) slide into 10 of our officer's cars.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, President Clinton approved a disaster declaration for 30 Georgia
counties because of the ice storm last week, which left 500,000 customers
without electricity and caused an estimated $55 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
	   In North Carolina, Gov. Jim Hunt asked Clinton to declare 26 counties
disaster areas. Rough 25,000 utility customers throughout the state remained
without power late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Winter storm advisories were in effect across South and North Carolina. Up
to 4 inches of snow was expected today over the mountains, and sleet and
freezing were expected to last through Sunday in parts of North Carolina. An ice
storm warning was in effect for northeastern Alabama today.
</P>
<P>
	   While people prepared for the latest blast of winter, evidence of Monday
night's 20-inch snowfall in Raleigh, N.C., remained everywhere. A week of low
temperatures kept the snow from melting and hampered road crews' efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   John and Karen Bianchino loaded their pickup truck outside a Raleigh
supermarket with groceries for themselves and neighbors who couldn't get out.
They said the trip to the store took two hours because of slick roads.
</P>
<P>
	   Gery Sandling emerged from a hardware store with what he could find on the
depleted shelves -- a bag of sand, a flashlight, spare batteries and a 2-by-4 to
brace his carport roof.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It worries us about the weekend,'' Sandling said. ``We've already spent a
lot of time digging out. I've never seen anything like this.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Congress Leaders To Meet  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says congressional leaders from both
parties will come to the White House to discuss his State of the Union
proposals, including a plan to pay off the $3.6 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First and foremost, I hope we can agree on my plan to pay down the debt
entirely over the next 13 years and make America debt-free for the first time
since Andrew Jackson was president in 1835,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio
address.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said he wants to reserve a third of the projected federal
surplus for debt reduction, and a lower debt would free up interest payments
that should be used to preserve Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will keep it strong and sound for 50 years and take in the life span
of the baby boom generation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two days after delivering his 89-minute speech to Congress, Clinton offered
an abridged version of his final year's agenda, a long wish list of projects
ranging from passing a patients bill of rights to raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton would create a new Medicare prescription drug benefit and spend more
on education, scientific research and military pay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must ensure that every child begins school ready to learn and graduates
ready to succeed. We must help every family succeed at home and at work,''
Clinton said. ``We must do all of this while maintaining the fiscal discipline
that brought us to this rare and promising moment we enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also wants Congress to pass campaign finance reform and legislation
dealing with gun-safety and hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Giving the Republican radio response, Rep. Jim Nussle of Iowa said the
strong economy has left the government more money than it needs to save Social
Security, pay down the national debt and deal with other priorities. He said the
rest of the money should be returned to Americans in the form of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``President Clinton has already figured out how to spend most of that money
for new government spending programs,'' Nussle said. ``And that's before the ink
was even dry on his big spending State of the Union speech.''

<HEADLINE> Mom Who Made Daughter Sick Jailed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A woman who once lobbied the White House for
improved health insurance has been sentenced to prison for making her daughter
so sick that the girl's gall bladder, appendix and part of her intestines had to
be removed.
</P>
<P>
	   Kathy Bush, who was convicted in October of child abuse and fraud, was
sentenced Friday to five years in prison, and another five years on probation.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennifer's illnesses and mounting medical bills garnered national attention
when the girl and her mother went to the White House in 1994 to help lobby for
health insurance improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennifer sat beside first lady Hillary Clinton at the White House, and both
she and her mother testified at Congressional hearings on health care costs.
</P>
<P>
	   By 1996, when the state started its investigation, Jennifer had been
hospitalized 200 times and had undergone about 40 operations. Doctors treated
her for seizures, infections and symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Bush, 42, had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a psychological
disorder in which a parent causes illnesses in the child to get attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never harmed my daughter -- physically, emotionally, psychologically or
medically,'' Bush told the judge. ``I love Jennifer with all my heart and all my
soul.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Bush gave her daughter excessive dosages of seizure
medication, tampered with her feeding machine and fabricated symptoms on her
medical charts.

   SEATTLE (AP) -- A Moroccan man detained after entering the United States from
Canada was being held as a material witness for the case against an Algerian
arrested with a car full of explosives, The Seattle Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a man suspected of plotting a bomb attack against the United
States, and who reportedly has links to the millionaire Saudi Arabian fugitive
Osama bin Laden, was arrested in the West African nation of Mauritania, security
officials there said.
</P>
<P>
	   Youssef Karroum was detained Thursday at the border in northern Washington
state, said Harold Malkin, a U.S. Attorney's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. magistrate judge on Friday ordered that Karroum be held as a material
witness. Another court date for him was set for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials treated the case with an unusual level of secrecy and
would not say what alerted them to Karroum, or in which case he would be a
material witness.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Justice Department sources told The Seattle Times that the case
involves an investigation related to Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian arrested Dec. 14
in Port Angeles with a car full of explosives.
</P>
<P>
	   Karroum was arrested by agents from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and the Customs Service who became suspicious about his documentation,
the Times reported. In addition, a computer check showed that his name was
``red-flagged'' by the FBI, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   During a search of Karroum's vehicle, bomb-sniffing dogs reacted to traces
of a chemical officials think may be the explosive nitroglycerin, the Times
said. However, no bomb was found and law-enforcement sources said the dogs can
be wrong and that further tests are required.
</P>
<P>
	   Law-enforcement officials told the Times that they are unsure about where
Karroum fits in the investigation but said his arrest is part of a dragnet
thrown over four continents.
</P>
<P>
	   Karroum's lawyer, Gene Grantham, said his client was not being held as a
suspect. ``He's being held to determine if he knows anything about other ongoing
investigations,'' Grantham said.
</P>
<P>
	   Customs spokeswoman Cherise Miles referred calls to the U.S. Attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam has pleaded innocent to charges that he had been planning a terrorist
bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   In Mauritania, Mohambedou Ould Slahi was arrested after leaving neighboring
Senegal on Wednesday, said security officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Slahi, a Mauritanian who had been living in Canada, left there in part
because of the investigation into Ressam, the Canadian Security Intelligence
Service said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Lambert, a spokesman for Canadian intelligence, said Slahi left Canada
sometime after authorities uncovered the alleged plot on Dec. 14, the same day
Ressam was detained.
</P>
<P>
	   According to The New York Times, Slahi's brother-in-law is one of bin
Laden's top lieutenants. However, a U.S. law enforcement official said Thursday
on condition of anonymity that U.S. investigators are unsure of this.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators also are not sure if Slahi was a major figure in the bombing
plot, or just a minor messenger, the official in Washington said.
</P>
<P>
	   No specific evidence has been released linking bin Laden to the newly
alleged bombing plot. Authorities have not said what the targets of that plot
might have been.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials accuse bin Laden, a Saudi believed to be living in
Afghanistan, of masterminding the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. Those attacks killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.

<HEADLINE> Candidates' Futures Depend on N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EXETER, N.H. (AP) -- With 800 people packed into a school gymnasium to hear
him speak, and a handful more braving subfreezing weather to shake his hand,
John McCain soaked up the scene and said: ``This is the highlight of my
political life.''
</P>
<P>
	   These are dreamy days for the men who want to be president. But there is
anxiety, too. For some, the verdict of the notoriously fickle New Hampshire
voters will spell the end of their candidacies -- or signal the beginning of the
end.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's outcome is critical. Unlike national front-runner George W. Bush,
McCain cannot afford to lose Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   If Bush puts McCain away in New Hampshire, the Arizona senator may look back
at Friday's jam-packed town hall meeting and realize, sadly, that it was indeed
the highlight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The stakes are highest for McCain,'' said state GOP chairman Steve Duprey.
``But every candidate has something to accomplish before leaving New
Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   The front-runners must avoid lengthy nomination fights. The top challengers
must strike quickly. The also-rans must catapult themselves into the first tier.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, the millionaire conservative paying for his own campaign,
finished a solid second in Iowa's caucuses, where McCain did not compete. After
billing New Hampshire as a three-way race, Forbes needs to finish second or a
close third for a decent return on his steep investment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only poll that counts is on Tuesday,'' Forbes said Saturday at a
Manchester diner as McCain and Bush led in voter surveys. ``I would think that
given what has happened so far this year, you would look at polls with a bit of
a skeptical eye.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dreaming big, he added, ``I'm in through November, and then I'll be taking
the oath of office.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore rocked rival Bill Bradley in
Iowa's caucuses and could virtually end his threat with another big victory
Tuesday. Party leaders might start calling for Bradley to step aside, allowing
Gore to save his resources for the general election fight.
</P>
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator, however, shows no sign of quitting: tracking
polls suggest he may have stopped his slide in New Hampshire; he has enough
money to compete beyond the state; and he already has scratched out a travel
schedule through March 7, when a series of primaries are scheduled from New York
to California.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You go into a different kind of campaign. It's a national campaign at that
point,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats have no delegate-awarding contests between New Hampshire and March
7, giving Tuesday's winner five weeks to build momentum and a sense of
inevitability.
</P>
<P>
	   Inevitability has been Bush's greatest political asset on the Republican
side, with many of his supporters backing him because he seems the most likely
to succeed in November. Losing New Hampshire would suddenly make him vulnerable,
especially if he lost by more than a few percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Bush would still be the best-financed and best-organized candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm in it for the long pull,'' Bush said Friday. Win or lose, ``I will
survive.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain can't say the same thing.
</P>
<P>
	   A significant defeat would strangle his candidacy in New Hampshire. A narrow
loss would give him a moral victory, and he would likely compete in the Feb. 19
South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But that state favors Bush, as does follow-up contests in Michigan and
Virginia. Even in his home state of Arizona, it's a close McCain-Bush race.
Those hurdles would be all but insurmountable unless New Hampshire weakens Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have to win a primary to win the nomination,'' McCain strategist Mike
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
	   For lower-tier Republicans, staying in the race is a victory of sorts.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes finished a distant third in Iowa, but did well enough to chase
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah from the race. That may have been Keyes' high point.
Social conservatives are not much of a force in New Hampshire, and he doesn't
have the money to compete in coast-to-coast primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative activist Gary Bauer nearly dropped out after losing to Keyes,
but decided to give it another week. The prospect of failure was hard to shake.
</P>
<P>
	   Chatting with a voter Friday, Bauer explained that it costs $25,000 a day to
run a campaign. ``We've got to do well next week,'' he said, ``because after a
while you ....''
</P>
<P>
	   He shrugged, not finishing the thought: After a while you ... must stop
dreaming.

<HEADLINE> Questions About Paying Down the Debt  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unthinkable until recently, retiring the $3.6 trillion
publicly held part of the national debt has become the crux of an election-year
competition between President Clinton and Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Eliminating the debt would further strengthen the economy, but it may not be
politically possible.
</P>
<P>
	   Questions about the issue:
</P>
<P>
	   Q: What is the national debt, and how big is it?
</P>
<P>
	   A: The national debt stands at $5.7 trillion.
</P>
<P>
	   Of that, $3.6 trillion is the publicly held debt. That is what the United
States owes individuals, pension funds, foreign countries and others who lent it
money over many decades and received Treasury bills in return.
</P>
<P>
	   Most economists say this portion of the debt is most important because it
drains funds that could otherwise flow to private companies. Reducing this debt
unleashes more money for entrepreneurs, which should mean lower interest rates,
higher productivity and a wealthier society.
</P>
<P>
	   The remaining $2.1 trillion debt is money the government owes Social
Security and other trust funds. The Social Security Administration, the Medicare
system and other trust funds hold $2.1 trillion worth of Treasury bills, which
the government owes itself so it can pay future benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: Why do the politicians want to pay off the publicly held debt?
</P>
<P>
	   A: Polls show the public prefers debt reduction to tax cuts and higher
spending, and Clinton and congressional Republicans are competing to be seen as
champions of the idea. Debt reduction is not only popular, it is now possible --
arithmetically, at least. Vast, growing annual budget surpluses replaced
deficits in 1998 and have been projected into the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: What about paying off debt the government owes Social Security and other
federal trust funds?
</P>
<P>
	   A: No one is seriously talking about that. It would have less of an economic
impact than erasing the publicly held debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, paying it off would mean selling the Treasury bills the trust funds
hold and putting that cash into other investments like the stock market or
corporate bonds. There is not yet a political consensus to do that.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: Is eliminating the publicly held debt a good idea?
</P>
<P>
	   A: Economists agree that reducing that debt makes enormous sense. But some
worry that erasing it completely might cause problems because the government
would no longer be selling Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve often buys those bills back from investors when it wants
to flush cash into the economy to spur it. In addition, because the government
has never defaulted on them, Treasury bills are considered the safest investment
on Earth. It is unclear what investors would turn to as a replacement.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: How would politicians pay off the publicly held debt?
</P>
<P>
	   A: Details are scarce, but Clinton says he will eliminate the publicly held
debt by 2013 by buying it down with surpluses. House Republicans say they are
working on a plan to do the same thing by at least 2015.
</P>
<P>
	   The closest the United States has come to eliminating the publicly held debt
was in 1835 under President Andrew Jackson, when it dipped to $37,513.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: How quickly can the debt be eliminated?
</P>
<P>
	   A: It depends on assumptions about future federal spending, how politicians
decide to use future budget surpluses, and how willing holders of Treasury bills
are to sell them back to the government. But the nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office said last week that the earliest possible date is 2009.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: Is that likely to occur?
</P>
<P>
	   A: No. For that to happen, politicians have to agree to cut federal spending
for the next two years, and then limit its growth to the level of inflation for
the seven years after that. In addition, they must agree to use every penny of
projected surpluses through 2009 to reduce the debt. All of that is unlikely to
happen.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: How realistic, then, is retiring the publicly held debt by 2015?	   A:
Somewhat more so, but still questionable.
</P>
<P>
	   Both parties are reluctant to use Social Security surpluses for anything but
debt reduction. The pension program's surpluses are projected to total $2.3
trillion through 2010, with more accumulating after that. There could be just
enough Social Security surpluses between now and 2015 to erase the publicly held
debt.
</P>
<P>
	   But with unforeseen expenditures always looming, there are no guarantees
that Social Security surpluses will be left intact for debt reduction. Besides,
as baby boomers begin retiring, Social Security surpluses could dwindle to
nothing by right around 2015 -- meaning that debt could start building up
immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: What about using the rest of the budget surplus?
</P>
<P>
	   A: CBO expects the budget's non-Social Security surpluses to total as much
as $1.9 trillion through 2010. Both parties are eyeing that money, however, for
tax cuts and higher spending, and it is unlikely much of it will be left for
debt reduction.

<HEADLINE> Now lawmakers will begin their machinations on auto emissions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - While Whitman administration officials hope their
latest attempts to reduce chronically long waiting times at centralized car
inspection centers begin to bear fruit on Monday, lawmakers will drive for more
change to a system that has outraged motorists.
<P>
	   Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, who is eyeing a run for governor next
year, will testify before two committees to pitch his bill calling for the
suspension of enhanced emissions inspections at all state operated centers. The
state revamped the inspection process last month in an attempt to meet clean air
goals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate President's appearance before the upper house's transportation
and budget committees on Monday will set up a full Senate vote on his bill a
week later. It also keeps alive an embarrassing story Gov. Christie Whitman
wishes would just go away.
</P>
<P>
	   "That isn't going to happen," said Assemblyman Neil Cohen, D-Union, a
longtime critic of the governor's auto emission policies. "It reminds me of the
third Godfather movie, where Al Pacino kept saying, 'Every time I try to get out
of it, they just keep dragging me in!"'
</P>
<P>
	   The 10-year-old auto inspection controversy hit full throttle when Whitman
was forced to concede there were memos filled with early warnings foretelling
many of the woes the system eventually faced. The governor said she and
Transportation Commissioner James Weinstein knew nothing of the memos until a
newspaper requested them.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor has ordered Attorney General John Farmer to form a panel to
probe why the warnings weren't heeded. DiFrancesco and the State Commission of
Investigation also plan to look into the circumstances surrounding the Whitman
administration's decision to grant a seven-year, $400 million contract for
Parsons Infrastructure and Technology to set up and operate the centralized
inspection stations. The firm, which hired politically connected lobbyists and
made campaign donations to Republican committees, was the only bidder for the
job in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman last week suspended, beginning Monday, the tougher auto emissions
test and a computer system designed to monitor the process at the 15 centralized
stations with the longest waiting times. The new system will remain in effect at
17 other centralized inspection stations operated by Parsons, and at private
garages.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also said the state will spend up to $12 million to cut the
average $75 price tag for inspections at private garages by $25. Inspections are
free at the centralized stations.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco, however, believes these steps don't go far enough. His bill,
reworked on Friday, would suspend the tougher emissions test at all centralized
stations. Motorists going to these stations would have their cars go through the
old emissions test, which does not look for asthma-causing smog compounds. These
motorists, however, would have to get another inspection after one year. The
inspection process is now once every two years.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco's bill would allow motorists to get the tougher emissions test
at private garages. But he wants the state to reimburse the private garages by
$50 a car.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe this is in the best interests of New Jersey motorists, and in the
best interests of our state as it seeks to make a good faith effort to meet the
environmental goals and mandates that precipitated the change in inspections,"
DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats, however, are calling for more change. Cohen said Whitman's plans
for private garages fall short, hurting many who made big investments in the
tougher emissions equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every time the governor says she's making it better, she's making it
worse," said Cohen. "Let's see, the old test that people can more easily pass is
free. And the tougher test at the private garages is still $35 to $40, even
after the rebates. Who is going to go to the private facilities? She's created a
financial nightmare for them."
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Shirley Turner, D-Mercer, meanwhile, objects to Whitman's use of state
money to subsidize the private garages to keep the prices lower.
</P>
<P>
	   "We shouldn't let the Whitman administration bill taxpayers for another
penny to solve the problems caused by Parsons," Turner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Weinstein said the changes are being made to buy time for Parsons to fix
balky computer programs and streamline the inspection process. The changes are
expected to be in effect until June 30.

<HEADLINE> Some See Hope in Mysterious Preacher  </HEADLINE>
   By JOANN LOVIGLIO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAZLETON, Pa. (AP) -- He appeared out of the blue back in October, clad only
in a dirty white robe as he walked barefoot along the two-lane highway into this
struggling former coal town.
</P>
<P>
	   Folks pointed at first as the man with the shoulder-length hair and scruffy
beard preached to whoever would listen. Before long, though, many in this
largely Roman Catholic community were embracing him as a holy man.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was in the car with me and a man came up and started banging on the
window,'' said the Rev. Gerard F. Angelo, pastor of the Shrine of the Sacred
Heart of Jesus. ``He said, 'Thank you so much for what you're doing. I haven't
been to church in 25 years and now I'm going again. His effect on people is
amazing.'''
</P>
<P>
	   With hundreds of people gathering in fire halls, gymnasiums and open fields
to listen to the stranger, his presence has some worried that the community has
opened its hearts and homes too readily to someone they know little about.
</P>
<P>
	   But his supporters, fervent in their devotion, say they know all they need
to know: The soft-spoken nomad is a messenger of God.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would walk through fire for him,'' said Connie Muir, a Roman Catholic
who took him in to live with her family when it became too cold to sleep
outside. ``He's blessed by the Holy Spirit. People's hearts are really changed
after they've heard him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Though he has preached for up to six hours at a stretch, he is a man of few
words when it comes to himself.
</P>
<P>
	   In interviews, he would not divulge his birthplace or background, saying it
would detract from his message. The robe and messianic appearance, he says,
bring attention to his ministry and make him more approachable.
</P>
<P>
	   When anyone asks his name, he replies ``What's Your Name?'' He says it is
part of a Hebrew tradition to not reveal one's name to a person until you become
their friend, and it is what the locals now call him.
</P>
<P>
	   Police checked his background and found nothing of concern. He was arrested
in Greenfield, Ohio, in August after he refused to stop preaching to a crowd
that became unruly when police tried to break up the gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   He was identified in a police affidavit as Carl J. Joseph, 39.
</P>
<P>
	   The disorderly conduct charge was dismissed, and Hazleton police said they
have yet to receive any complaints about Joseph.
</P>
<P>
	   He says his nine-year trek has brought him to 47 states and 13 countries.
But never has he remained in one place for so long before.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People here have been wonderful. There's such a great need for
spirituality today,'' he said. ``People feel desolate because they have gotten
away from God and his church.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hazleton -- population 23,000 -- and other towns in the region have gone
through troubled times since the coal industry went bust decades ago. Boarded-up
storefronts line the eastern Pennsylvania city's main thoroughfare, and the
unemployment rate for Luzerne County hovers around 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Lots of people around here are hurting, and this guy is the only sign of
hope some of them have seen in a long time,'' said resident Robert Clark. ``It
worries me because people are putting all this stock in a guy who, to me, seems
like he's got a screw loose.''
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph has spoken to as many as 2,000 people at one gathering in Hazleton,
and it is not uncommon to see several dozen people standing in a field at 2 a.m.
listening to him preach.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Lesante, host of a local cable program, has had him on his show four
times -- once for a three-hour call-in special.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For three solid hours the phones were continuously lit up -- they just
rang and rang and rang,'' Lesante said.
</P>
<P>
	   His burgeoning popularity, as well as the nearly unrestricted access he has
been given in local Catholic schools and hospitals, is causing some worry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Carl has always been welcome here to pray with us,'' said Monsignor
Michael J. Delaney, pastor of St. Gabriel's Church in Hazleton. ``The unusual
element of his ministry was a concern. Being it's unusual, we also know we have
to be both welcoming and cautious -- but we wish him well in his efforts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several religious leaders declined to speak publicly, saying they did not
want to further heighten disagreements regarding Joseph within the religious
community.
</P>
<P>
	   Others say that preaching the Gospel is nothing but a good thing, pointing
out that ``What's Your Name'' is not seeking financial gain. He turns over all
money and gifts he receives to local parishes, except for sandals he received
recently because he did not own a pair of shoes.
</P>
<P>
	   As word spreads, Joseph is beginning to bring his ministry to neighboring
towns like Mahanoy City, a community of 5,000 about 20 miles southwest of
Hazleton. He has been staying at the rectory of St. Joseph's Church.
</P>
<P>
	   During a recent two-hour session at the Mahanoy City fire hall, ``What's
Your Name'' told a crowd of several hundred people not to abandon their faith.
Though he identifies himself as Roman Catholic, he says his message is for all
Christians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I encourage everyone to get into communication with God again,'' he said
as the crowd nodded in agreement. ``I've experienced so many different places,
so many different people, so many different cultures, but I've never learned
more than I have from prayer.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he will remain in the area as long as there is a need for his words.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He could be here a while, or he could be gone tomorrow,'' Muir said. ``I'd
like to see him stay around for a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Front-runners in nomination sprint, challengers hope for marathon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - In a sprint to the 2000 presidential
nominations, George W. Bush and Al Gore will not be stopped, so their
challengers are trying to trip them up and turn the races into marathons.
<P>
	   For Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley, the longer the track,
the better the odds.
</P>
<P>
	   That was a tough enough strategy even before primary election states began
leapfrogging each other to pack the early calendar of contests, making it likely
the nominations will be settled before the end of March.
</P>
<P>
	   It is more difficult now.
</P>
<P>
	   So McCain must start beating Bush. And Bradley's talk of long-term campaign
schedules as a signal he intends to keep contesting Gore will ring hollow unless
he, too, starts winning.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has the edge over the Texas governor in polls of likely voters in
Tuesday's New Hampshire presidential primary, but by margins too close to make
either the clear favorite. One survey put Bush barely ahead, and thus
statistically even.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic surveys, Vice President Gore has regained a lead. Polls
published during the final weekend of campaigning for the primary showed Gore
with a widening margin over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   The surveys were conducted in part after the Iowa caucuses, where Gore
trounced the former New Jersey senator nearly two-to-one in the year's first
contest.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush won the crowded Republican race with 41 percent of the vote. Steve
Forbes ran second and claimed the mantle of conservative alternative to Bush and
McCain, the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
	   But Forbes complained he did not get his fair share of debate time when all
five Republicans met Wednesday night, citing what he said was an unwarranted
assumption that Bush and McCain are the real contenders.
</P>
<P>
	   Measured by the New Hampshire and national polls, they are.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is turning tougher against Gore, showing the elbows of an old pro
basketball player in an aggressive, confrontational style in their final debate
before the primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley accused the vice president of lying about his proposals and called
him a divisive, dishonest campaigner. He said all Gore does is attack, attack,
attack. Gore said Bradley had turned negative.
</P>
<P>
	   With that tone, the five weeks between the New Hampshire primary and the
mega-Tuesday primaries March 7 may be testy ones among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no such gap in the Republican calendar. McCain skipped the Iowa
campaign to put time and resources into New Hampshire, upping the stakes,
although he has said he could get by with a narrow loss.
</P>
<P>
	   He does not say that about their next test, Feb. 19 in South Carolina, where
Bush is well ahead in the voter surveys. A victory there is essential to the
McCain challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Republicans vote Feb. 22 in Arizona. While McCain leads in his home
state, where losing would be devastating, the polls rate that race close. There
are GOP primaries in Michigan the same day, in Virginia a week later, and Bush
is strong in both states.
</P>
<P>
	   There also is the matter of money. McCain says he has what he needs to
campaign into the big-state arenas in March. But he will have to be a winner,
soon, to keep raising money. Bush can afford a setback or two; he has the
biggest treasury in presidential campaign history, an estimated $63 million
raised so far.
</P>
<P>
	   While Forbes lags far behind those two in the New Hampshire polls, and
nationally, he insists he can emerge as the final challenger to Bush. He can
afford it, so long as he is willing to keep spending his personal fortune.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic contest, Bradley says he has the resources for what he
describes as "the national campaign" for the nomination, the 11 primaries -
including California and New York - on March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   He also can take advantage of Democratic rules that award nominating votes
in proportion to shares of the primary vote, so there is something to be gained
even in losing. But that can only be a holding action; a candidate who keeps
losing is, obviously, the loser.
</P>
<P>
	   On March 14, Bradley's test gets even tougher, with six primaries in the
South, where he is weakest against Gore of Tennessee, one of the states voting
that day.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp, obviously, wants to clinch as early as possible to avoid
draining the candidate's treasury for what they assume will be a long spring and
early summer of competing against Bush, who would have funds to spare.
</P>
<P>
	   A Bradley victory in New Hampshire would squelch suggestions that he should
get out of Gore's way. A Gore victory would increase the pressure. Either way,
Bradley says he is in for the March round.
</P>
<P>
	   History shows challengers can be persistent:
</P>
<P>
	   -Ronald Reagan lost five primaries in a row to President Gerald R. Ford in
1976, then revived his campaign, finally accepting narrow defeat at the GOP
convention.
</P>
<P>
	   -Bush kept going despite losing more than he won to Reagan in 1980, yielding
on May 26 when the outcome was inevitable, and winding up as vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   -Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., took on President Jimmy Carter in 1980,
won in 10 states, and contested him to the convention, conceding after gaining
concessions on Democratic policy.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dreams come and go with Tuesday's vote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   EXETER, N.H. (AP) - With 800 people packed into a school gymnasium to
hear him speak, and a handful more braving subfreezing weather to shake his
hand, John McCain soaked up the scene and said: "This is the highlight of my
political life."
<P>
	   These are dreamy days for the men who want to be president. But there is
anxiety, too. For some, the verdict of the notoriously fickle New Hampshire
voters will spell the end of their candidacies - or signal the beginning of the
end.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's outcome is critical. Unlike national front-runner George W. Bush,
McCain cannot afford to lose Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   If Bush puts McCain away in New Hampshire, the Arizona senator may look back
at Friday's jam-packed town hall meeting and realize, sadly, that it was indeed
the highlight.
</P>
<P>
	   "The stakes are highest for McCain," said state GOP chairman Steve Duprey.
"But every candidate has something to accomplish before leaving New Hampshire."
</P>
<P>
	   The front-runners must avoid lengthy nomination fights. The top challengers
must strike quickly. The also-rans must catapult themselves into the first tier.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, the millionaire conservative paying for his own campaign,
finished a solid second in Iowa's caucuses, where McCain did not compete. After
billing New Hampshire as a three-way race, Forbes needs to finish second or a
close third for a decent return on his steep investment.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only poll that counts is on Tuesday," Forbes said Saturday at a
Manchester diner as McCain and Bush led in voter surveys. "I would think that
given what has happened so far this year, you would look at polls with a bit of
a skeptical eye."
</P>
<P>
	   Dreaming big, he added, "I'm in through November, and then I'll be taking
the oath of office."
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore rocked rival Bill Bradley in
Iowa's caucuses and could virtually end his threat with another big victory
Tuesday. Party leaders might start calling for Bradley to step aside, allowing
Gore to save his resources for the general election fight.
</P>
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator, however, shows no sign of quitting: tracking
polls suggest he may have stopped his slide in New Hampshire; he has enough
money to compete beyond the state; and he already has scratched out a travel
schedule through March 7, when a series of primaries are scheduled from New York
to California.
</P>
<P>
	   "You go into a different kind of campaign. It's a national campaign at that
point," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats have no delegate-awarding contests between New Hampshire and March
7, giving Tuesday's winner five weeks to build momentum and a sense of
inevitability.
</P>
<P>
	   Inevitability has been Bush's greatest political asset on the Republican
side, with many of his supporters backing him because he seems the most likely
to succeed in November. Losing New Hampshire would suddenly make him vulnerable,
especially if he lost by more than a few percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Bush would still be the best-financed and best-organized candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm in it for the long pull," Bush said Friday. Win or lose, "I will
survive."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain can't say the same thing.
</P>
<P>
	   A significant defeat would strangle his candidacy in New Hampshire. A narrow
loss would give him a moral victory, and he would likely compete in the Feb. 19
South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But that state favors Bush, as does follow-up contests in Michigan and
Virginia. Even in his home state of Arizona, it's a close McCain-Bush race.
Those hurdles would be all but insurmountable unless New Hampshire weakens Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to win a primary to win the nomination," McCain strategist Mike
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
	   For lower-tier Republicans, staying in the race is a victory of sorts.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes finished a distant third in Iowa, but did well enough to chase
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah from the race. That may have been Keyes' high point.
Social conservatives are not much of a force in New Hampshire, and he doesn't
have the money to compete in coast-to-coast primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative activist Gary Bauer nearly dropped out after losing to Keyes,
but decided to give it another week. The prospect of failure was hard to shake.
</P>
<P>
	   Chatting with a voter Friday, Bauer explained that it costs $25,000 a day to
run a campaign. "We've got to do well next week," he said, "because after a
while you ...."
</P>
<P>
	   He shrugged, not finishing the thought: After a while you ... must stop
dreaming.

<HEADLINE> Russia Claims Advances Into Grozny  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STARIYE ATAGI, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces advanced through snowy alleys
and seized shell-shattered high-rises from rebels Saturday in the Chechen
capital, Grozny, but Chechens said they were letting the Russians move in so
they could attack from behind.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians' assault on Grozny has concentrated for more than a week on
Minutka Square, which they advanced toward on Saturday. Taking the square would
give federal forces leverage to push the rebels out of the city center.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Russian presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky said 54 rebels
surrendered in northeast Grozny to forces led by pro-Moscow Chechen leader
Bislan Gantamirov. Speaking on Russia's ORT television, Yastrzhembsky called the
move a ``psychological breakthrough.'' Many of the rebels were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   But up to 3,000 fighters are believed to remain in Grozny, and it was
unclear whether the surrender would mean much in the monthlong battle for the
city. Though Gantamirov claimed Friday he had persuaded some rebel commanders to
give up arms, pro-Moscow Chechens are deeply distrusted in the breakaway
republic, and Gantamirov's previous claims have often proven false.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops have advanced on Minutka Square along side streets and were
battling Chechen fighters some 500 yards from the square, said senior Chechen
rebel commander Mumadi Saidayev. Russian commanders had earlier claimed to be
closer to the square, but this was apparently the first time the rebels admitted
the Russians had made it so close.
</P>
<P>
	   A top Russian commander, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, said the Russians have
seized several high-rise buildings in the Leninsky and Oktyabrsky districts, to
the north and south of Minutka, from rebel snipers who had hindered the
Russians' advance.
</P>
<P>
	   But Saidayev, the Chechen commander, said the Russians were being allowed to
advance so they could be trapped and attacked by Chechen fighters from the rear,
the Interfax news agency reported. That tactic inflicted severe losses on
Russian troops during the last Chechnya war from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   A Chechen fighter who slipped through a supposed Russian blockade and left
Grozny Saturday said rebels have pulled back from some positions in outlying
neighborhoods to avoid scattering their forces, but were preparing strong
defenses closer to the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighter, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Bislan, said
rebel forces were positioned behind Russian troops, ready to stage surprise
attacks. Despite the Russians' claims of progress, federal troops control only a
few blocks in several districts of Grozny, Bislan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Artillery and tank fire rained on Grozny from all sides Saturday, the
Russian military command said. Warplanes and helicopter gunships also bombarded
mountainous rebel outposts in southern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscow sent troops into Chechnya in September after an invasion by
Chechen-based militants into the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in
August. Deadly apartment bombings in several Russian cities also were blamed on
Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Party Gets Lengthy Fund Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A former accountant and key figure in the Christian Democrats'
financial scandal has given the party's Hesse state branch a 1,000-plus page
report on secret party money, state Christian Democratic leaders said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hesse has become a focus in the scandal over a network of financial schemes
run by the Christian Democrats, the conservative German party that led the
government from the early 1980s until 1998. The Hesse branch of the party said
it would likely take a week to go through the report, and after that it would be
made public.
</P>
<P>
	   Horst Weyrauch, the accountant who prepared the report, is the first witness
who will be called in parliament's investigation of whether decisions by former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government were bought. Kohl has admitted taking up to
$1 million in off-the-books donations for the party.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a report in Focus newsmagazine Saturday, Weyrauch had
threatened the party leadership, telling it not to force him to reveal
information about secret party funds. Party officials decided last week to
threaten legal action against Weyrauch after his remarks, which Focus said
included an ominous statement: ``When you want to know the truth, then the
republic totters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, new reports indicated the secret party funds extended even
farther overseas than previously suspected.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Der Spiegel newsmagazine, Weyrauch and the longtime state party
accountant in Hesse, Prince Casimir Sayn-Wittgenstein, worked with people in
Paraguay to design a system to create fake estates. The system was to be used to
funnel money to the party.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the scandal, Spiegel reported, the Christian Democrats may
have to pay $20.5 million back to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl has refused to name the donors who gave the party the $1 million.
German President Johannes Rau indirectly called on Kohl to reveal the names,
telling Bild newspaper Saturday that he saw ``no way to agree with an idea of
honor that stands over law and the state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rau, though, has his own scandal to worry about. Some opposition politicians
are now openly demanding that he resign for accepting free flights from a bank
that had close ties to a state government while he was the state's governor.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report Saturday in Focus, deputy Christian Democratic chairman
Christian Wulff called on Rau to step down. An indirect call for Rau's
resignation also came from conservative opposition leader Michael Glos of the
Christian Social Union in Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
	   On the sidelines of the Christian Democrats' troubles, allegations of a
plane scandal have been growing in recent months against the ruling Social
Democrats in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, another Social Democrat, longtime North Rhine-Westphalia
Finance Minister Heinz Schleusser, resigned after admitting a female companion
went along on two of 49 free plane trips he had taken.
</P>
<P>
	   Rau's lawyer this week released a list of 44 flights Rau made while
governor, paid for by the Westdeutschen Landesbank. A state investigation is
probing whether Rau took the flights for private purposes.

<HEADLINE> Peter Falk Has Dramatic TV Role  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB THOMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Mention the name Peter Falk and "Columbo"
immediately springs to mind. That's only natural, since the Los Angeles cop
mystery has been in primetime TV longer than any other drama.
</P>
<P>
	   The 30-year association with the shambling, trenchcoat-wearing detective has
often obscured Falk's other achievements. Case in point: "A Storm in Winter,"
which appears on the Showtime channel, Sunday, Feb. 6, at 8 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
	   Falk plays an embittered operator of a Jewish deli in a small town in New
York state. Through a mixup, he is entrusted with the care of a 9-year-old
Harlem boy (an impressive Aaron Meeks), who has been granted a summer vacation
out of the city. They clash immediately, exposing their own bigotry. The
heartwarming ending is inevitable, but no less endearing.
</P>
<P>
	   "A Storm in Winter" bears an impressive pedigree. It is based on a script by
the late Rod Serling ("The Twilight Zone"). The director is Robert Wise, Academy
Award winner for "The Sound of Music" and "West Side Story." Now 85, it's his
first movie direction in a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Falk lives in a spacious house along Beverly Hills' movie star row,
also known as North Roxbury Drive. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz lived there,
along with Jimmy Stewart (his lovely old house has been demolished and a huge
replacement is under construction). Rosemary Clooney and Diane Keaton are among
the current residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Falk can be found in the converted garage, where he schmoozes on the phone
with pals, or in the built-on, skylighted studio, where he creates his charcoal
drawings. A few of them, bold-stroked female nudes, stand on an easel.
</P>
<P>
	   "I started drawing when I was doing the Neil Simon play, 'The Prisoner of
Second Avenue' in New York back in 1972 or 1973," he explained. "On 57th Street,
I walked past a building that was the Art Students League. For some unknown
reason, I went in there. I opened a door and there she was.
</P>
<P>
	   "Way down on the left, shoulders back, a light from above, ... naked, was a
model. The female body is awesome. Believe me, I signed up right away." A hearty
laugh.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite two Academy Award nominations ("Murder, Inc.," 1960; "Pocketful of
Miracles," 1961) and a Tony (The Prisoner of Second Avenue," 1972), "Columbo"
(three Emmys) remains Falk's trademark.
</P>
<P>
	   The first "Columbo" appeared in 1967. It became a series in 1971,
alternating with "McMillan and Wife" and "McCloud." "Columbo" was by far the
most popular of the trio, but Falk resisted offers to turn it into a weekly
show. He considered the job too heavy a load for one actor, and he didn't want
to be typecast in one role.
</P>
<P>
	   After a four-year absence, "Columbo" returned as part of the ABC Mystery
Theater, and it has continued making a few appearances every season. A new
episode has been filmed for the spring schedule and two more have been
contracted.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been a blockbuster around the world," he marveled. "It gets a 40 share
in France, to this day! They have a guy in France who does my voice beautifully.
The guy who does it in Iran is the highest-paid actor in Iran."
</P>
<P>
	   And has he been able to avoid the stigma of typecasting? His reply:
</P>
<P>
	   "The first thing I think of is a working guy out there hearing an actor
complain that he's been typecast; to him the actor must sound crazy. That
doesn't mean that I don't feel that I'd probably be a better actor if I had
spent more time doing other things."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the continued showings around the world, Falk receives no residual
payments. The reason: He sold out his rights for a lump sum. That's why he can
afford to live on Roxbury Drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides liking the script, Falk said he accepted "A Storm in Summer" because
of the chance to be directed by Robert Wise. "I like his philosophy of
directing," the actor remarked. "He seems to work by the theory that less is
better."
</P>
<P>
	   The admiration is mutual.
</P>
<P>
	   "Showtime sent me the script, and I liked it very much," said the director
from his home north of Malibu. "And I've always wanted to work with Peter Falk."
</P>
<P>
	   Wise has long been an elder statesman of Hollywood, having served as
president of the Academy and the Directors Guild. His last movie was in 1989 --
"Rooftops," a hard-edged urban drama with music that resembled his classic "West
Side Story" (he shared the directorial credit with Jerome Robbins).
</P>
<P>
	   Why hasn't he worked more?
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know," he replied. "Maybe people thought I was getting along in
years and didn't have it anymore."
</P>
<P>
	   With "A Storm in Summer," Falk declared, Wise proves that he still has it.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak To Meet Next Week  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat will meet next week amid fading hopes for concluding the
outline of a peace agreement by the deadline they set, Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they don't meet it, they'll reach some understanding about how to deal
with that problem,'' a senior U.S. official said Saturday after a 30-minute
meeting between Arafat and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement was the frankest admission yet that American mediators are
likely to fall short of their target for a basic understanding about the future
of Jerusalem, whether there will be a Palestinian state and other knotty issues
at the core of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The Barak-Arafat meeting will be held Thursday or Friday at Erez, a border
crossing between Israel and Palestinian-held Gaza, and will focus on the major
unresolved issues, said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   He described the pursuit of the deadline as a formidable challenge. ``It's
very difficult to get there,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no American claims of progress after Clinton saw Arafat in the
Steigenberger Hotel Belvedere in this Swiss ski resort. They were among scores
of world leaders attending an international economic forum.
</P>
<P>
	   It was their second meeting in nine days. Neither was progress claimed after
the last one, at the White House in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department announced Thursday that senior U.S. mediator Dennis
Ross would go to the Middle East to help in the search for a settlement. Ross is
due in Israel on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lower-ranking Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are to hold intensive
talks early this week at Israel's Read Sea resort Eilat.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has appealed to the two sides to seek less than 100 percent of their
demands. He said a settlement requires as much.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in her own flurry of diplomacy in
Davos, was to see King Abdullah of Jordan Saturday night, Arafat and Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   She then travels to Moscow, where she has separate meetings scheduled Monday
with Foreign Ministers David Levy of Israel and Prince Saud of Saudi Arabia.
They will be in Moscow for a multilateral conference to promote understanding
between the Jewish state and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, Albright and Ross all are prepared to commit themselves to working
on a ``day-by-day basis'' to try to reach an Israeli-Palestinian settlement, the
U.S. official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian officials have raised the possibility of shifting negotiations
to Washington if talks in the region do not produce an accord.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the Palestinians accused Barak of not being serious about
reaching the Feb. 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian planning minister, said his negotiating team
proposed that the talks be conducted in Washington under Clinton's close
supervision, but Israel rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Salim Zanoun, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization's
decision-making Central Council, said the council will meet Wednesday in Gaza
City to set the date for the declaration of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
	   It appeared highly unlikely, however, that the Palestinians would issue a
unilateral declaration of independence and risk angering the Americans before
the September deadline for a peace treaty with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Officers go on trial for 41 shots heard around the city  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - No one disputes the math.
<P>
	   Officer Sean Carroll squeezed off 16 rounds. So did Edward McMellon. Kenneth
Boss added five shots, and Richard Murphy four, for a total of 41.
</P>
<P>
	   Nineteen of the bullets tore through the body of Amadou Diallo in a matter
of seconds, turning the 5-by-8-foot vestibule of his Bronx apartment building
into a dingy death trap.
</P>
<P>
	   It might have ended there if Diallo was an armed criminal, as the police
apparently feared. Instead, he was a street vendor carrying only a pager and
wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly a year later - with a backdrop mixing racial politics and a mother's
well-publicized grief - a jury must decide whether the shooting of the West
African immigrant by the four white officers was murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection for the officers' trial is set to begin Monday. The trial
will be in Albany, N.Y., because an appeals court took the unusual step of
moving the case from the Bronx. It agreed with defense attorneys that a torrent
of pretrial publicity and protests would make it impossible to find impartial
jurors in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Justice Joseph Teresi ruled the trial could be televised - in
part to ensure access to city residents - but that is unlikely to still anger
over the change of venue.
</P>
<P>
	   Civil rights activists, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, have vowed to lead
their followers to Albany to rally behind the Diallo family. They also urged
federal authorities to monitor a case they say symbolizes widespread police
brutality against minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   "Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice for everyone," his mother,
Kadiatou Diallo, said last year after the officers were indicted on charges of
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36, McMellon, 27, Boss, 28, and Murphy, 27, pleaded innocent. But
prosecutors allege they demonstrated a "depraved indifference to human life" by
unleashing the barrage on a defenseless man.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants' decision not to testify before a grand jury left no option
except murder charges carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison, said Bronx
District Attorney Robert Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   "Without (their) explanation, what we have is four people driving up to a
location, pulling out their guns and killing an individual," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys and the city's powerful police union, the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association, maintain the officers made a tragic mistake. Part of a
plainclothes unit assigned to combat street crime, they thought Diallo, 22, was
reaching for a gun while lurking around the apartment building.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers have signaled they will take the witness stand in their own
defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is "about whether you give police officers the benefit of the
doubt," said McMellon's attorney, Stephen Worth. "You either somehow believe a
bunch of cops thought, 'What the hell, we'll shoot this guy for no good reason,'
or you realize that they thought they were in danger of being shot at, and took
proper action."
</P>
<P>
	   Today, many New Yorkers know Diallo's name, and about the 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   But before their worlds collided at about 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999, the
victim and the shooters navigated the city in relative anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's father, Guinean entrepreneur Saikou Amad Diallo, once hawked candy
and cigarettes in Senegal. He later launched a career as a jewel trader. He
married Kadiatou, his second wife, when she was only 14. They divorced in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The eldest of the couple's four children, Diallo studied computers before
leaving Africa for New York in 1996. He peddled videotapes on the streets of
Manhattan and lived in a two-story, red-brick building in a rough section of the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers, clean-cut looking products of more peaceful neighborhoods,
signed on with the nation's largest police department in time to ride a dramatic
downturn in crime. Murders alone plummeted to 629 in 1998 from 2,245 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants were part of the roving Street Crime Unit credited with
driving down the numbers of shootings by arresting armed suspects. The unit made
nearly 4,000 arrests and seized about 1,000 guns in 1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
	   But even before Diallo killing, complaints arose that Street Crime used
unlawful "stop-and-frisk" tactics against young men of color - especially in the
Bronx, a borough with a history of tension between minorities and police. Police
officials have since come under fire for expanding the unit with inexperienced
officers; of the four defendants, only Carroll had been in the unit for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   On the night of the shooting, the officers were patrolling Diallo's
neighborhood in a Ford Taurus, looking for violent suspects. Each was armed with
a 16-shot, semiautomatic pistol and wore a bulletproof vest. Three had been
involved in previous shootings, one fatal. All were deemed justified.
</P>
<P>
	   What happened in front of 1157 Wheeler Avenue in a span of less than a
minute - and what was going through the defendants' minds - will be the focus of
the trial expected to last more than a month.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the defense, the officers stopped their car after spotting
Diallo, wearing a knit Yankees cap, duck into the shadows around his building.
With Carroll and McMellon approaching first and Murphy and Boss following, he
ignored an order to freeze, then made a sudden move - drawing gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense says that as the bullets flew, Carroll was so sure Diallo was
armed he yelled, "Gun!" McMellon fell backward as he and Carroll retreated. That
further created an impression a gun battle was under way.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're talking about split-second decisions," said Steven Brounstein, the
attorney for Boss. "What if this had gone the other way? What if (Boss) held his
fire while his partner was being shot? It would have been a police funeral."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bronx District Attorney's office has largely kept quiet about its case.
</P>
<P>
	   But a civilian witness has said he heard two or three shots, a two-second
pause, then another burst of fire. The pause would support arguments that the
officers had a chance to realize their mistake and hold fire, yet didn't.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution also is expected to use medical evidence to contend that
Diallo was dropped by the first bullets, instantly ending any threat and meaning
the officers continued shooting even though Diallo was on the ground. The
defense contends the victim remained upright, making him a perceived threat
deserving of deadly force.
</P>
<P>
	   An autopsy found Diallo was hit 11 times in the legs. Five bullets went into
the left side of body. He was also hit once in the back, right arm and in the
front of his chest. The bullets perforated his aorta, spinal cord, lungs, liver,
spleen, kidneys and intestines.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, with Diallo dead in the vestibule, Boss' voice could be heard
over police radios calling for an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
	   Five days later, Kadiatou Diallo arrived from Guinea and went straight to
the Bronx. Television crews filmed a woman in traditional West African robes
crying out her son's name as she arrived the scene of his death.
</P>
<P>
	   In the weeks that followed, a team of lawyers for Diallo's estate began
preparing a wrongful death lawsuit sure to seek millions of dollars in damages.
Diallo was buried under a fig tree in an African village founded by his
great-grandfather. And more than 1,200 people - including actress Susan
Sarandon, former Mayor David Dinkins and Rep. Charles Rangel - were arrested for
civil disobedience during demonstrations at Police Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   A more muted protest went on at 1157 Wheeler. Mourners there covered the
bullet-scarred vestibule with graffiti, some still visible today.
</P>
<P>
	   "Amadou," one says, "your life was not in vain."

<HEADLINE> Baseball plays role in Levine's career - even at City Hall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In the baseball-crazed Giuliani administration, the news
earlier this month that Deputy Mayor Randy Levine was leaving to become
president of the New York Yankees surprised almost no one.
<P>
	   After all, Levine, a close friend and valued adviser to the mayor, had
worked in the past as an attorney for Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, as chief
labor negotiator for Major League Baseball owners and served as a conduit
between the Yankees, the Mets and the Giuliani administration while the team
sought a new city-funded stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, for more than a decade, Levine, 44, has shuttled back and forth
between two masters, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   By most accounts, his record of success is stellar, including landmark labor
agreements in both baseball and the city. But Levine also tiptoed into some gray
areas, ethically, playing a role in deals that turned over at least $140 million
in city funds to construction projects involving Steinbrenner and Mets owner
Fred Wilpon.
</P>
<P>
	   Levine, who had no prior experience in economic development before he was
appointed deputy mayor for economic development, planning and administration by
Giuliani two-and-a-half years ago, first met Giuliani in the mid-1980s, when
both worked for the U.S. Justice Department during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
	   After he left Justice in 1988, Levine went to work for the Manhattan law
firm that helped end Steinbrenner's nearly three-year ban from baseball for his
ties to a gambler. Steinbrenner and Levine, who share an interest in
conservative politics and the Yankees, eventually became friends, and Levine's
back-and-forth between City Hall and baseball began.
</P>
<P>
	   The next year, he signed on with Giuliani's failed mayoral bid, and came
back for the 1993 race, which Giuliani won. Levine was then appointed Giuliani's
labor commissioner, and his tasks included being the administration's point
person for discussions on new stadiums for the Yankees and Mets.
</P>
<P>
	   He left the city administration again in 1995 to be baseball's labor
negotiator with the strong backing of both Steinbrenner and Wilpon. Then, after
leading owners and players to an agreement, he rejoined Giuliani in 1997 as
deputy mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   When Levine resigned two weeks ago to become the Yankees president, the
mayor said he planned to bring him back yet again, this time as a top adviser
for a planned Giuliani campaign for U.S. Senate. He also will work for the
prominent Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld law firm as a senior counsel on
labor and employment practices.
</P>
<P>
	   As deputy mayor, Levine is credited with helping the Giuliani administration
reach a tentative accord to build a new headquarters for the New York Stock
Exchange in lower Manhattan and in aiding in the transformation of Times Square
from seedy enclave for prostitutes to home of some of the world's top media
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   But Levine, built like a designated hitter and known around City Hall for
his booming laugh, was primarily valued by Giuliani for his political skills,
unquestioned loyalty, and his record as a top rank negotiator.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, as the city's chief labor negotiator in 1994 and 1995, Levine
helped save the city hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts with city
workers and teachers, after persuading unions to provide givebacks and requiring
that future pay raises be based on productivity gains.
</P>
<P>
	   "Randy," said Giuliani, during an interview, "is exceptionally talented....
He was involved in every decision I made."
</P>
<P>
	   Steinbrenner and Wilpon - who had both known Levine before they hired him to
help negotiate a landmark labor contract on behalf of owners in 1995 that some
have credited with saving baseball - had similarly high praise.
</P>
<P>
	   "I admire his loyalty, his friendship, his ability to negotiate. He's a man
of his word. People respect him," Steinbrenner said through a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   "He subjugates his ego and is very direct and honest," said Wilpon. "When he
tells you something, you can go to the bank with it."
</P>
<P>
	   When Levine returned to the Giuliani administration as deputy mayor, he
signed an agreement with the city's Conflict of Interest Board to recuse himself
from dealings with professional baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   This would avoid any conflict since he was being paid $1,000-a month as a
consultant to major league owners, had an option to return to the sport and,
finally, was being paid between $500,000 and $1 million by owners as part of a
severance package.
</P>
<P>
	   The city conflict of interest agreement expired after one year, when Levine
severed formal ties to baseball. Under city law, he'll be prohibited from
contacting senior Giuliani administration officials in connection with his new
baseball job for one year. But he'll be allowed to take part in the mayor's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal law is much tougher. People leaving high federal posts can be
prohibited from ever dealing with the agencies where they worked.
</P>
<P>
	   During a recent interview, Levine - who like the mayor is a lifelong Yankee
fan born in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island - said he honored the
conflict-of-interest agreement even after he was no longer bound by it.
</P>
<P>
	   "That all ran out years ago, but just on my own, I still continued to
maintain a recusal from baseball when I didn't have to," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The city recusal letter prohibited Levine from "participating in
discussions" and "attending meetings with city or major league baseball
officials," and states, "Mr. Levine's complete recusal requires that he not
participate in any matters which involve major league baseball, or its dealings
with the city, or be otherwise involved as a city official in such dealings."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite that stipulation, Levine has acknowledged discussing with
Steinbrenner a proposal in which the city eventually agreed to spend $76 million
to build a minor league stadium complex for the Yankees on Staten Island, the
centerpiece of an extensive overhaul of the island's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview, Levine refused to discuss his conversation with
Steinbrenner, but in a 1998 interview with the Daily News, Levine acknowledged
that during a breakfast, he told Steinbrenner that Staten Island Borough
President Guy Molinari wanted to discuss the stadium plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Conflict of Interest Board, whose members are appointed by the mayor,
took no action against Levine. A spokesman said the board has a policy of not
commenting on its investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani and other city officials said however, that Levine had nothing to
do with subsequent negotiations or planning for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials do acknowledge however, that Levine helped arrange
a business deal that benefitted Wilpon.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Wilpon called Levine shortly after Levine was named deputy mayor
seeking city financial help to build a 44-story skyscraper that would serve as
the new headquarters for Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilpon said he called Levine at City Hall to "seek incentives" and "to find
out who to talk to" about the project.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, the city promised the company $75 million in tax breaks and $1.5
billion in low interest, tax exempt bonds to finance construction. Additionally,
Wilpon stands to reap millions as the project's developer.
</P>
<P>
	   And while Levine maintains that the deal was necessary to keep Bear Stearns
from moving out of the city, Bear Stearns said the company had never considered
doing so.
</P>
<P>
	   Such tax breaks for profitable businesses building new offices have become
common in recent years, with the threat of moving one chip always on the table.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said that although Levine had a significant role in the Bear
Stearns project, his involvement did not violate Levine's conflict agreement
because it was not strictly baseball-related.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's his job," said Giuliani. "To promote economic development. That's
what a deputy mayor for economic development does: Bring business to the city."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tells Nation To Stay Course  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged the nation Saturday to remain on
the course his administration has set, policies that he said led America from
deep budget deficits to ``unimagined economic strength.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his weekly radio address, Clinton underscored themes from Thursday
night's 89-minute State of the Union message and said the United States has
arrived at a pivotal moment where it is possible to ``shape the future of our
dreams for our children.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who has one year left of his second four-year term, said he will
meet with Republican and Democratic House and Senate leaders Tuesday at the
White House ``to discuss how we can move forward together.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now is not the time to change course,'' Clinton said. ``If we will stay
this course, we can pay the country's debt off for the first time since 1835.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans, portraying the president as a wasteful big spender, said they
will reject his new budget, write their own and carve an attention-getting tax
cut out of the budget surpluses economists now project for the next decade and
more. The Congressional Budget Office has set the figure at $1.9 trillion by
2010.
</P>
<P>
	   ``President Clinton has already figured out how to spend most of that money
for new government spending programs, and that's before the ink's even dry on
his big-spending State of the Union speech,'' Rep. Jim Nussle, R-Iowa, said in
the weekly Republican response to the president's radio talk.
</P>
<P>
	   Nussle and Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican
Conference, said the GOP's first tax target is to scrap the so-called ``marriage
penalty,'' the provision of the Internal Revenue Service code by which couples
earning two incomes fall into higher tax brackets than couples in which one
person is the main breadwinner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I urge (Clinton) to take control of the extreme left of his party and push
for an end to penalizing married couples simply for being married,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton proposes to reduce the ``marriage penalty'' for two-earner couples
by increasing their standard income tax deduction by more than $2,000, with
smaller increases in the deductions that can be claimed by single-earner married
couples and by single filers. The White House said these changes would benefit
42 million families at a cost of $45 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts said that for Republicans, ending the marriage penalty altogether is
``just the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot allow the Democrats' risky, budget-busting tax scheme to raid
the Social Security Trust Fund and hike inflation, turning back the clock on all
we have accomplished,'' Watts said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who taped the radio speech before leaving for a world-trade meeting
in Davos, Switzerland, said he hopes congressional leaders will come to the
White House meeting ready for serious talks on his ambitious State of the Union
proposals, which include a plan to pay off the $3.6 trillion national debt over
the next 13 years.
</P>
<P>
	   He credited his administration's fiscal discipline for moving the country
away from record budget deficits and high unemployment to record budget
surpluses and ``unimagined economic strength.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president said he wants to reserve a third of the projected federal
surplus for debt reduction. He said a lower debt would free up interest payments
that he said should be used to preserve Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will keep it strong and sound for 50 years,'' the president said.

<HEADLINE> Leaders: Holocaust Education Needed  </HEADLINE>
   By KIM GAMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Jerzy Einhorn, only a young man when he was forced
into a concentration camp in western Poland, survived the Holocaust that 6
million other Jews did not.
</P>
<P>
	   Five decades later, he says neo-Nazism is gaining ground -- making it all
the more urgent that the world does not forget the consequences of hate. People
need to remember, for their own sake and their children's, he says, but memories
alone are not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that we who are saved cannot believe that just some 55 years after
that, democracies would be accepting Nazis at all,'' says Einhorn, 75, a
professor at Stockholm's Karolinska Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   His hopes echo those of many world leaders at an International Forum on the
Holocaust, where more than 40 countries pledged Friday to ``uphold the terrible
truth of the Holocaust against those who deny it.''
</P>
<P>
	   That declaration came even as far-right populist Joerg Haider -- who once
praised Adolf Hitler's ``orderly employment policy'' and lauded Waffen SS
veterans as ``decent people of good character'' -- was in talks on forming a
coalition that would control Austria's parliament. And it was issued only hours
before hundreds of neo-Nazis demonstrated in Berlin at the construction site of
a planned memorial to Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Holocaust was unprecedented, but now the precedent is there,'' Israeli
historian Yehuda Bauer said at the conference. ``It depends on all of us,
especially on you, the politicians of this world, to turn this precedent into a
warning.''
</P>
<P>
	   Einhorn was among survivors, activists and educators at the conference who
called for more research, better classroom programs and wider use of the
Internet to show future generations what can happen if racism, xenophobia and
anti-Semitism are tolerated.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors' testimony must be better recorded and still-secret documents
released before living witnesses are gone, participants said.
</P>
<P>
	   And even with all the research that has been done, questions about the
Holocaust remain, delegates said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Historians tell us how the tragedy happened, but why did it happen?''
asked Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-day conference was organized by the Swedish government as part of
its campaign to raise awareness among young people about the genocide of 6
million Jews and more than 2 million others, including Gypsies and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
	   Sending teachers to Israel to study the Holocaust, posting lists and
survivor accounts on the Internet and building more memorials were some of the
programs suggested.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must support each other in the teaching of humanity and civil courage,
so that normal people shall never again, in the name of some criminal ideology,
turn normal places into grim factories of execution,'' German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors' testimony is especially important, speakers said, since only
their stories can prevent future generations from denying the genocide occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We stand on the threshold of the era when ... resources of education will
be the only thing to relay the horrors of what happened and its significance,''
said Hubert Locke of the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The delegates also pointed to recent ethnic conflicts that led to mass
killings and called for more preventive diplomacy and an early warning system to
alert leaders to racial problems that could escalate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the horrible lessons of the Holocaust is that it can happen
again,'' said Ralph Grunewald of the American Jewish Committee. ``It happened in
Rwanda, it happened in East Timor and Kosovo.''

   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will make a
brief visit to Croatia on Wednesday to endorse democratic trends in that Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright will meet the new prime minister, Ivica Racan, members of his
cabinet and parliament and other political figures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The secretary will also take the occasion to congratulate all Croatians,
including the representatives of civil society, who have contributed to the
democratic process,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said in a
statement Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright was sharply critical of the late President Franjo Tudjman's
policies in Croatia, a former republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   The former Cabinet, dominated by Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union,
transferred power Thursday to the coalition government of Social Democrats and
Social Liberals, which defeated the CDU in Jan. 3 parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak To Meet Next Week  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat will meet this week amid fading hopes for concluding the
outline of a peace agreement by the deadline they set, Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they don't meet it, they'll reach some understanding about how to deal
with that problem,'' a senior U.S. official said Saturday after a 30-minute
meeting between Arafat and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement was the frankest admission yet that American mediators are
likely to fall short of their target for a basic understanding about the future
of Jerusalem, whether there will be a Palestinian state and other knotty issues
at the core of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The Barak-Arafat meeting will be held Thursday or Friday at Erez, a border
crossing between Israel and Palestinian-held Gaza, and will focus on the major
unresolved issues, said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   He described the pursuit of the deadline as a formidable challenge. ``It's
very difficult to get there,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no American claims of progress after Clinton saw Arafat in the
Steigenberger Hotel Belvedere in this Swiss ski resort. They were among scores
of world leaders attending an international economic forum.
</P>
<P>
	   It was their second meeting in nine days. Nor was progress claimed after the
last one, at the White House in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department announced Thursday that senior U.S. mediator Dennis
Ross would go to the Middle East to help in the search for a settlement. Ross is
due in Israel on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lower-ranking Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are to hold intensive
talks early this week at Israel's Read Sea resort Eilat.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has appealed to the two sides to seek less than 100 percent of their
demands. He said a settlement requires as much.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in her own flurry of diplomacy in
Davos, saw King Abdullah of Jordan for 45 minutes Saturday night, and was to
confer with Arafat and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   She then travels to Moscow, where she has separate meetings scheduled Monday
with Foreign Ministers David Levy of Israel and Prince Saud of Saudi Arabia.
They will be in Moscow for a multilateral conference to promote understanding
between the Jewish state and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   In his meeting with Albright, Jordan's King Abdullah volunteered to have his
kingdom act as host for the next regional economic conference, State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin also confirmed that neither Syria nor Lebanon would attend the Moscow
conference. Syria's government-controlled press has criticized the conference as
divisive to Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, Albright and Ross all are prepared to commit themselves to working
on a ``day-by-day basis'' to try to reach an Israeli-Palestinian settlement, the
U.S. official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian officials have raised the possibility of shifting negotiations
to Washington if talks in the region do not produce an accord.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the Palestinians accused Barak of not being serious about
reaching the Feb. 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian planning minister, said his negotiating team
proposed that the talks be conducted in Washington under Clinton's close
supervision, but Israel rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Salim Zanoun, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization's
decision-making Central Council, said the council will meet Wednesday in Gaza
City to set the date for the declaration of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
	   It appeared highly unlikely, however, that the Palestinians would issue a
unilateral declaration of independence and risk angering the Americans before
the September deadline for a peace treaty with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Detained Researcher Returns to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By BILL BERGSTROM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Nearly six months after he was detained in China on
charges of smuggling state secrets, a U.S.-based researcher arrived back in
America today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I really feel I'm home now,'' said Song Yongyi, who looked tired but was
smiling broadly as he arrived at Philadelphia International Airport at about
1:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   ``During the past 30 years, I never cried but last night I cried all
night.''
</P>
<P>
	   Song, a librarian at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., and an authority on
China's Cultural Revolution, was detained on Aug. 7 and later was charged under
China's vague secrets law.
</P>
<P>
	   His release came unexpectedly and removed an irritant from U.S.-Chinese
relations as they slowly recover from NATO's bombing of China's embassy in
Belgrade in May. This past week, the U.S. and Chinese militaries resumed a
formal dialogue that Beijing called off in anger over the bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Arlen Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said he believed China
was releasing Song to curry favor with the U.S. Congress. China would like
Congress to stop reviewing its low-tariff trading privileges annually and grant
the rights permanently as part of a deal to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese security officials on Friday took Song from the detention center
where he had been held and sent him to a government office, his wife Helen Yao
said in a telephone interview from their U.S. home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He called me and said he was free,'' said Yao, who was arrested with Song
in August but released in November. ``Today is a very exciting day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Song had planned to become a U.S. citizen in September, after returning from
his research trip to China.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador to China James Prueher said he hoped Song's release would be
``a harbinger of continued open academic research in China'' and of broader
discussions with the Chinese government on related issues. Prueher said in a
statement he was ``delighted for Song Yongyi and his family.''
</P>
<P>
	   Song, 50, has written articles and a book in Chinese about the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution, when Mao Tse-tung unleashed a wave of radical violence to
oust opponents in the Communist Party and ignite revolutionary zeal. A million
people died and millions more were persecuted. Song spent five years in prison,
accused of being a ``counterrevolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Song's specialty has been collecting documents from the Cultural Revolution
period and making them accessible to other scholars.
</P>
<P>
	   Song was collecting old newspapers and other public documents from the
period, as he had done on past trips to China, when he and his wife were
detained on Aug. 7. On Dec. 24 he was charged with ``purchasing or illegally
supplying intelligence for people outside the territory of China.''
</P>
<P>
	   As recently as Tuesday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused Song of harming
China's national security by trying to smuggle 700 pounds of secret documents
out of the country. Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Song had
confessed. Zhu said Song had been purchasing such materials since 1996 using
funds from overseas institutions.
</P>
<P>
	   Song's detention shocked the American academic community. The U.S.
government and members of Congress lobbied China for his freedom. More than 100
China scholars in the United States petitioned Chinese President Jiang Zemin for
his release, saying Song was engaged in normal academic work, not espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   Song, who is from Shanghai, attended college in China when schools reopened
across the country after the Cultural Revolution ended. He went to the United
States in 1989 and earned master's degrees in Chinese literature and library
science, and has worked at Dickinson College since 1997.

<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Legislature and governor can head off
annual toll increases on the New York State Thruway by finding another way to
fund needed improvements to the superhighway and the other transportation
facilities it controls, a Thruway officials says.
<P>
	   The Thruway needs the toll increases - the first would be 1.8 percent
beginning on June 1 - to help pay for $275 million in projects this year,
Thruway Authority Executive Director John Platt said. Under a construction plan
approved by the Authority's board late last week, new road and bridge projects
would grow to nearly $1 billion in five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Authority board approved a plan which could institute annual toll
increases on the Thruway over the next five years tied to an index of
construction costs in 20 U.S. cities published by the Engineering News Record.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Construction Cost Index goes up, so will tolls, pending annual
reviews of the Thruway's finances and needs by the Thruway Authority board. If
the Construction Cost Index goes down, the tolls will not increase. Hikes would
be capped at 3 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Had the system been in place since 1997, toll increases of 2.2 percent each
year would have been in order, the Thruway Authority said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls on the Thruway last went up in 1988, by 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thruway board's three members are all appointees of Gov. George Pataki,
who derailed a proposed Thruway toll increase in 1996. It is chaired by Louis
Tomson, formerly a top figure in Pataki's executive chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said Thruway toll increases would
be a "hidden tax" that might blunt recent economic gains.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our concern is funding the capital program," Platt said. "We're using the
toll adjustment as a hedge against increased construction costs. 'If the Senate
majority wants to make money available for capital projects we'll be more than
happy to discuss this alternative."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno's office on Friday sounded the alarm in Albany about the impending
toll increase. The Thruway Authority's board, meeting Thursday in Albany, had
voted to adopt the toll-increase system without prior public acknowledgment that
it was working on such a plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The toll increase was referred to as an "indexed toll adjustment plan" in a
news release the Authority said it distributed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Platt defended the manner in which the toll-hike plan was revealed.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the starting point of a process," he said Friday night. "The board
has not adopted this. It authorized that we go forward with the public
hearings."
</P>
<P>
	   Four hearings will be held on toll increase in April, tentatively in
Buffalo, Syracuse, Albany and the New York City area. The board would finalize
the plan at some point between then and June 1, Platt said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thruway's per-mile charge for passenger cars would go from 3.1 cents to
3.2 cents with the anticipated toll increase on June 1, still one of the lowest
charges in the Northeast on toll highways, Thruway spokeswoman Anya Frost said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Motor Truck Association reacted angrily to the toll-increase plan.
</P>
<P>
	   With recent fuel-price increases amounting to 15 cents a mile for big rigs,
"the industry is having a near impossible time trying to keep trucks moving,"
Association President Bill Joyce said. "How can the state of New York increase
the tax burden on an industry so vital to the state economy?"
</P>
<P>
	   Platt said the Thruway is reclassifying trucks in a way that will help most
haulers. Fifty-three-foot-long trailers pulled by semis would see toll
reductions of nearly 16 percent under the reclassification, according to Platt.
The tandems where two trailers are coupled together would see their tolls
increase by 2 percent, he said.

<HEADLINE> Century old knitting company shutting down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   JOHNSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - Blaming foreign trade policies and rising costs,
officials of a knitting company that has been making clothes since the late
1800s say they are going out of business.
<P>
	   The Johnstown Knitting Mill Co., which traces it roots to 1893 and employs
229 people, will close by late March, company officials announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnstown Knit, as it is locally known, is an independent-line knitwear
manufacturer. It also sells its clothing - everything from socks to T-shirts to
long underwear.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew it was going to close. We knew for six or eight months," one
employee who didn't want his name published told The Daily Gazette of
Schenectady Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Work just got slower and slower throughout the whole mill," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The business has been in the family of the current president, Thomas B.
Easterly, for five generations.
</P>
<P>
	   "The company attributes a majority of their loss to U.S. foreign trade
policies such as NAFTA, which has encouraged many U.S. companies to manufacture
goods offshore. This has made it next to impossible for most domestic
manufacturers to compete in the marketplace," company officials said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
	   "This announcement comes with great regret. After being part of the
community for such a long time the company has been fortunate to have many good
and longtime employees to whom the company is very grateful . . . ," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Easterly said Friday night that company officials are deeply saddened by the
decision, and he declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't fill a loss like this," Johnstown Mayor, Bill Pollak told The
Gazette.
</P>
<P>
	   Pollak, a lifelong resident who grew up near the West Montgomery Street main
mill. He said it reminded him of the early 1970s, when another local industrial
institution, the Knox Gelatine Co., moved to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "Companies that you think will be in a place forever - bingo - they're gone.

<HEADLINE> Haider Predicts Immigration Ban  </HEADLINE>
   By ROLAND PRINZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Far-right populist Joerg Haider, whose party rose to
prominence in Austria after stoking anti-foreigner sentiment last fall,
predicted Saturday that a government featuring his party would impose a nearly
complete ban on immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider said the only foreigners who would be allowed to move to Austria
would be seasonal workers who would leave after several months.
</P>
<P>
	   He made the announcement as the stream of foreign criticism continued over
the possibility of his Freedom Party's inclusion in government. His party, now
Austria's second largest, has been talking to the Austrian People's Party about
forming a coalition that would control parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Undeterred by the furor abroad, negotiators from his party and the
center-right People's Party were planning to resume their talks aimed at setting
up a joint Cabinet next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider is known for once praising Adolf Hitler's ``orderly employment
policy,'' and for later lauding veterans of the Waffen SS as ``decent people of
good character.'' He has been apologizing ever since.
</P>
<P>
	   But his party made stunning gains in Austria's Oct. 3 parliamentary
elections, drawing heavily on voters who fear that EU expansion and a liberal
immigration policy will cost them their jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   By Saturday, most European governments had criticized Haider. The European
Union has warned Austria against setting up a government that includes Haider's
party, and Belgium is calling for common EU action if such a coalition
materializes.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those joining the chorus of critics were French President Jacques
Chirac, German President Johannes Rau and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Austria must see to it not to isolate itself politically,'' Schroeder told
the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Chirac was reportedly pressing the EU to take ``precise measures'' if
Haider's party joins the Austrian government. The measures were not specified.
</P>
<P>
	   Catherine Colonna, Chirac's spokeswoman, said the president called
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres to tell him it is ``indispensable''
that Austria's 14 European partners act quickly. Portugal currently holds the
rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider, reacting to Chirac's moves, said the French president ``had done
everything wrong that can be done wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president of the European Parliament, Nicole Fontaine, said on French
radio that the EU has sanction powers that would let it exclude member nations.
Guterres, meanwhile, phoned Austrian President Thomas Klestil to express his
concern over the political developments.
</P>
<P>
	   Answering questions on Austrian state radio, Haider said Saturday that his
party and the People's Party are in full agreement on what Austria's new
immigration policy should look like. He said it would be ``tantamount to a de
facto zero immigration'' and that the country should focus on integrating the
foreigners already in Austria instead of letting in more.
</P>
<P>
	   The only exception, he said, would be for seasonal tourism industry
laborers, who would be allowed in from abroad. He added that such a policy
``cannot be challenged internationally and on a European scale.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the radio interview, Haider said he was taking the foreign criticism in
stride.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Basically, such criticism was to be expected from those who cannot put up
with the fact that democracy means change, and democracy means that the people
can decide what they want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want a Europe of the citizens and not one of bureaucrats,'' Haider
stressed, reiterating his past criticisms of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   In a welcome distraction from the furor, Haider celebrated his 50th birthday
Saturday. Stunt fliers, costumed musicians and a giant apple strudel were on
hand as hundreds celebrated the popular leader's birthday near Villach, a
mountain town high in the Austrian Alps.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider visibly enjoyed the accolades from fans and Freedom Party colleagues.
After skiing to several mountain huts, he was cheered by about 300 people who
lined up to greet him and give him presents.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, he danced to alpine music well known in Carinthia province,
where he is governor.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rejects US Terrorism Edict  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan rejected as unwarranted Saturday an
apparent warning from the United States that it could be branded a sponsor of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   The foreign ministry said although the Pakistani government may be
sympathetic to a secessionist uprising in Indian-ruled Kashmir, it is firmly
opposed to terrorism and does not aid religious organizations involved in the
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no warrant for any warning,'' the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the United States warned Pakistan that it could be listed as a
sponsor of terrorism -- making it ineligible for virtually all U.S. aid -- if it
gave direct support to Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen, a militant group that operates in
Kashmir and is headquartered in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The warning followed comments by U.S. State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin earlier in the week that there has long been concern that agencies of the
Pakistani government provided ``general support'' to a number of groups
operating in the territory disputed by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington says there are links between last month's hijacking of an Indian
Airlines plane and Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen, which was placed on the State
Department's list of terrorist organizations in 1997 when it was called
Harkat-ul-Ansar.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Pakistan's foreign ministry repeated its condemnation of the
hijacking and vowed to punish the hijackers if they are arrested in Pakistan.
The hijacking ended in Afghanistan with 155 hostages freed in exchange for the
Indian government's release of three pro-Kashmiri militants.
</P>
<P>
	   The most prominent of the militants is Maulana Masood Azhar, a
Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen member who had been in jail in India since 1994 without
being charged.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his release he has toured Pakistan making speeches condemning India
and trying to recruit holy warriors to fight Indian troops in the part of
Kashmir ruled by India.
</P>
<P>
	   The former princely state, tucked in the shadows of the Himalayan Mountains,
is divided between Pakistan and India but both countries claim a united Kashmir
as their own. The neighbors have fought two wars over Kashmir and last summer
engaged in a bitter border dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Pakistan there is legitimate sympathy with the Kashmir people, who are
suffering Indian military occupation and sustained repression which has been
widely documented by human rights organizations,'' said the Pakistani statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The legitimate Kashmiri struggle cannot be described as terrorist
activity,'' it said. ``However we believe in the peaceful negotiations process
... (and) official Pakistani agencies do not provide any support to the
religious organizations'' involved in the insurgency.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the foreign ministry statement, these organizations are bound
by Pakistani laws and ``infringement of the laws would entail required action.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan has been a close ally of the United States in the battle against
terrorism, the statement says, offering as an example the extradition from
Pakistan of suspects involved in the World Trade Center bombing in New York and
the attack on U.S. Embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pakistan does not condone international tension,'' the statement said.
``We have demonstrated our opposition to terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile Saturday, rockets fired from across the border in India slammed
into the Pakistani village of Daholo Wali, killing two people and wounding three
others, said Shahid Mahmood, deputy commissioner of the Sialkot region.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian troops in the area have fired heavy mortars and waged regular gun
battles across the border, he said. Several other rockets have landed without
exploding.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack came just one day after two bombs shook Karachi, killing four
people and wounding 32 others. Most of the dead and wounded in Karachi were
worshippers at a mosque, which was heavily damaged by one of the bombs.

    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Most of New York's high school seniors have passed
the state's required Regents test in English, despite fears that hundreds of
thousands of them would miss graduating this spring because of new state diploma
requirements.
<P>
	   State Education Commissioner Richard Mills told a forum on education
standards at Union College in Schenectady earlier this month that more than 90
percent of the seniors have already made the grade on the English Regents test.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Mills will release the scores of the seniors who took the test
before January. Education Department officials have refused to reveal the exact
number, but they have acknowledged that Mills had made a good estimate at the
forum.
</P>
<P>
	   Education officials previously had announced that three out of four students
required to pass a Regents English exam before graduation had done so. At that
time, they could not say how many of those students were seniors.
</P>
<P>
	   Public school students will have to pass five Regents exams - in English,
math, American history, global studies and a science - to receive a diploma
starting in 2003. The requirements currently are being phased in, with one
subject added each academic year.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's seniors are the first who must pass the state's English Regents
exam to graduate as part of a state Board of Regents-imposed program to raise to
school standards. Students must also satisfactorily complete their regular
course work in order to get a diploma.
</P>
<P>
	   Some state lawmakers have advocated legislation to delay the Regents'
graduation requirements while the process is studied more. Others have pushed
alternative exams to the Regents, like so-called portfolios.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills rejected the alternative testing route this week, upsetting one
legislator.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cookie-cutter standardized testing should not be the only way to tell that
students are meeting the new, higher standards," said Democratic Assemblyman
Richard Brodsky of Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York City, 87 percent of the seniors have passed the English Regents
test, according to New York City Board of Education figures. Before January,
28,560 of New York City seniors had passed the test while 4,553 hadn't,
spokeswoman Margie Feinburg said. About half the ones who needed to take the
test had failed it previously while the other half hadn't taken it yet, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some students had a touch of bad luck when they missed the test due to last
Wednesday's heavy snowstorm across much of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   A survey by the state Education Department of the state biggest urban and
highest-need districts indicated very few students were affected, according to
state Education Department spokesman Bill Hirschen. No specific figures were
available.
</P>
<P>
	   Hirschen said a last chance at passing the English Regents will be offered
students in June if they are to graduate with their class.

<HEADLINE> Gates Takes da Vinci Work to Exhibit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Microsoft mogul Bill Gates brought Leonardo da Vinci's
``Leicester Codex'' to Germany's capital Saturday, opening an exhibit that
includes drawings by 20th century artist Joseph Beuys.
</P>
<P>
	   Beuys, who began his studies in natural science, was inspired by the
discovery of a lost Leonardo manuscript in Spain in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Like Leonardo four centuries earlier, Beuys broke through barriers of art
and science,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
	   The codex got its name in 1715 when it was acquired by Thomas Coke, the Earl
of Leicester. Gates bought it in 1994 for $30.8 million, making it the only
known Leonardo notebook in private hands.
</P>
<P>
	   It chronicles Leonardo's experiments into geology, paleontology, human
anatomy and other subjects. The manuscript includes sketches that show the way
water flows around obstacles, and suggestions of types of machines that could be
powered by falling water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His observations impress people more than ever around the world,'' Gates
said. ``This notebook speaks to us by stimulating our own forces of
creativity.''

<HEADLINE> Shovels Shipped in Forest Protest  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT SONNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELKO, Nev. (AP) -- Disgruntled Westerners shipped thousands of shovels to
northeast Nevada to protest federal environmental policy and lend support to
residents feuding with the U.S. Forest Service over a washed-out road.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 makeshift floats and other vehicles were entered in a parade
Saturday to carry an estimated 10,000 shovels down Elko's main street to a rally
at the county courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has taken on a life of its own,'' said O.Q. ``Chris'' Johnson, a local
businessman who helped organize the Jarbidge Shovel Brigade Parade. ``It's
bigger than the Fourth of July.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ranchers, loggers, miners and small business owners donated the shovels in a
show of support for locals' efforts to rebuild the South Canyon Road along the
Jarbidge River in the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. The Forest Service has
fought their efforts, saying the road work and erosion would harm the river's
population of bull trout, an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the shovels were delivered in a caravan from Montana, where loggers
and mill workers long have been at odds with the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Somehow, sending a shovel seems symbolic. Maybe it will make a
difference,'' said Cary Hegreberg of Helena, Mont., executive vice president of
the Montana Wood Products Association.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most people understand shovels are a symbol of work. That's something we
have in common -- we want to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elko County Commissioner Mike Nannini, who helped organize the parade, said
shovels arrived by mail from as far away as Rhode Island and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just a grassroots deal. It's not just the West anymore. These people
are saying `No more,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jarbidge River, in a remote canyon near the Idaho border, is home of the
southernmost population of bull trout in North America.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1.5-mile road leads to a trailhead for a wilderness, and provides
vehicle access to fishing and camping along the river.
</P>
<P>
	   The Elko County Commission claims the Forest Service has no jurisdiction
over the South Canyon Road along the river because the road was there before the
Humboldt National Forest was established in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson and others threatened to rebuild the road by hand, but a federal
judge in Reno issued a court order banning any work on the road in November.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy has prompted a congressional field hearing and has become a
lightning rod for criticism of President Clinton's proposal to protect millions
of acres of roadless areas in national forests.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican, offered his support for the protest
in a letter to organizers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since the vast majority of the public lands are in the West, perhaps the
bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., simply don't understand the impact their
decisions have on our western way of life,'' Guinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the protesters was Bob Secrist of Elko.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm in the firewood business and the Forest Service is giving me a bad
time. They are supposed to manage the forest but they are just shutting it down
and locking it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president wants to make everything roadless. That's fine for the
people in Kansas, but 85 percent of our land is controlled by the government in
Nevada. We're expected to make a living on the other 15 percent,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Erupts in Rebel-Held Congo  </HEADLINE>
   By HRVOJE HRANJSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- An active volcano spat out fire and rocks Saturday
night near the eastern Congolese rebel stronghold at Goma, spreading panic among
residents who thought they were under attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nyamuragira volcano, one of two straddling Rwanda's border with eastern
Congo, became active Wednesday, when the rim turned red and occasional fire
balls shot out, resembling the sound of artillery, residents said by telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can see fire. People are waking up thinking they've been attacked,''
one resident, who identified himself only as Tenda, said. ``Those near the
volcano are leaving their homes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Residents and an official at the Ugandan Consulate in Goma said Goma was not
immediately threatened since the volcano's destruction had been directed toward
Virunga National Park, on the opposite side of the populated area. However two
neighborhoods had been evacuated, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two volcanoes have occasionally erupted since 1979, when the burning
lava spilled into some sections of Goma and forced the town to temporarily
evacuate.
</P>
<P>
	   The volcano turned active again in 1996 as more than 1 million Rwandan Hutu
refugees began crossing back home into Rwanda, ending 2 1/2 years in exile in
the aftermath of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the Seismological Institute in Goma could not immediately be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels in Goma took up arms in August 1998 against President Laurent Kabila,
taking control of the eastern half of Africa's third largest nation. Last
summer, the rebels and Kabila concluded a peace accord with a shaky cease-fire
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Russia Looks Into Detained Reporter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin sent a prosecutor to Chechnya
on Saturday to investigate the reported arrest of a Russian journalist by
Russian security forces.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor will look into the circumstances of Andrei Babitsky's
detention, Putin aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yastrzhembsky gave no details of the arrest, but said on Russian television
that Babitsky did not have accreditation for working in Chechnya. The military
grants such permission only to a handful of pro-government journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky, a Radio Liberty correspondent, has angered Russian officials with
his consistent criticism of the Chechnya war. He has been missing since Jan. 15,
when he last called his family and colleagues from the Chechen capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing security sources, Interfax reported Friday that Babitsky had been
detained by Russian security services in Chechnya and charged with fighting in
armed bands. The RTR television channel cited a Russian Interior Ministry
spokesman as saying Babitsky had been detained for not having proper
accreditation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian government has accused Babitsky in the past of backing the
rebels. Secret service agents raided his Moscow apartment Jan. 8 and seized
photographs he took of dead Russian soldiers, said his wife, Lyuda Babitskaya.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S.-sponsored Radio Liberty sent its director to Moscow to look into
the case, and the State Department expressed concerns about infringements on
media freedom in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Journalists occasionally are detained by the strict military command in and
near Chechnya, but usually are released quickly.

<HEADLINE> Moroccan Held in Role in Terror Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A Moroccan man who crossed the border from Canada is being
held as a material witness for the investigation of an Algerian whose border
arrest led to heightened security concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Youssef Karroum is not being held as a suspect, said his lawyer, Gene
Grantham. ``He's being held to determine if he knows anything about other
ongoing investigations,'' Grantham said.
</P>
<P>
	   Karroum was detained Thursday at Blaine, a border crossing about 100 miles
north of Seattle, and on Friday a U.S. magistrate ordered him held as a material
witness. Another court appearance was set for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials treated the case with an unusual level of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Justice Department sources told The Seattle Times that the case
involves an investigation related to Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian arrested Dec. 14
in Port Angeles, allegedly with a car full of explosives. Ressam has pleaded
innocent to charges that he was planning a terrorist bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle was shaken by news that Ressam had a motel reservation near the
Space Needle. The city later canceled New Year's Eve celebration at the park
beneath the Space Needle because of security concerns, although there was no
specific threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Karroum was arrested by agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
and the Customs Service who became suspicious about his documentation, the Times
reported. In addition, a computer check showed that his name had been
``red-flagged'' by the FBI, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   During a search of Karroum's vehicle, bomb-sniffing dogs reacted to traces
of a chemical officials think may be the explosive nitroglycerin, the Times
said. However, no bomb was found and law-enforcement sources said the dogs can
be wrong and that further tests are required.
</P>
<P>
	   Law-enforcement officials told the Times that they were unsure where Karroum
fits in the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Cuba: Elian's Mother Forced on Trip  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro is vowing to carry on protests
for the return of Elian Gonzalez for 10 years if need be and says the
6-year-old's mother was ``practically kidnapped'' for her fatal journey toward
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to a conference of economists Friday, Castro blamed the disaster on
the mother's boyfriend, Larazo Rafael Munero, who organized the boat trip that
ended in death for himself, Elisabeth Brotons and nine other people off the
Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mother was practically kidnapped along with the boy'' to make the
trip, Castro said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What kind of ruffian is this guy?'' Castro asked. ``We have 100 pages of
reports on him,'' apparently referring to police documents.
</P>
<P>
	   According to sources quoted by the Miami Herald, Munero -- who reportedly
drove a taxi in the Cuban city of Cardenas -- had fled to Florida in June 1998
and returned to Cuba later that year, only to be jailed for several months.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba's government and Communist Party have mounted daily demonstrations to
support Elian's father's demand that he be returned to Cuba. Hundreds of
thousands of people have marched through the streets chanting the name of the
boy official news media call ``the elfin prince.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have never in the past put on such a display of people and public unity
and I don't believe we will tire of it,'' Castro said. ``We have the resources
to go on for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, rescued off the Florida coast in an inner tube on Nov. 25, has been
staying in Miami with a paternal great-uncle who, backed by anti-Castro exile
groups, is trying to keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to Munero, Castro said, ``The first thing we had to do is verify
what kind of man this 'hero' is because we knew it would be the theory that it
was the mother who dreamed of a 'land of freedom.' We know all the cliches.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a mother who was practically kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban leader called Brotons ``an excellent girl'' who had suffered seven
miscarriages before delivering Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One who is born among eight pregnancies: How desired must be that child
whom they have taken by force from his father and grandmothers,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
	   The child's paternal and maternal grandmothers were expected to continue a
tour of the United States, where they have been campaigning for Elian's return,
the government's Prensa Latina news agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said Saturday that Elian
told him he didn't want to go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a very intelligent young man and I was able to ask him without any
coaching a couple of questions,'' said Burton, who supports a measure to make
Elian a U.S. citizen in order to impede administration efforts to return him to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton met with the boy for 30 minutes at the Little Havana home in Miami
where the boy is staying.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first question I asked him is how did he like living here and he said
he liked it very much as he was blowing bubbles. And then I said `Would you like
to go back to Cuba?' And he was very firm in saying 'No' and this without any
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 chanting, flag-waving protesters marched in front of the
headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami
demanding that Elian be sent back to Cuba. The crowd yelled ``Send Elian Home''
as a small plane towing a banner with the same slogan passed overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   The march was organized by a pro-Castro group, the Antonio Maceo Brigade.

<HEADLINE> Deal Reached on Biotech Foods  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT CRENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- U.N. talks here finally produced rules governing trade in
genetically engineered products Saturday, nearly a year after previous talks
collapsed in the face of international discord.
</P>
<P>
	   The new rules are complex, and many may be subject to legal challenges or
interpretations. But for now they contain language letting a country ban imports
of a genetically modified product if it feels there is not enough scientific
evidence showing the product is safe.
</P>
<P>
	   It requires exporters to label shipments that contain genetically altered
commodities such as corn or cotton. It also tries to dictate how those safety
rules will coexist with free trade rules governed by the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, a major producer of genetically engineered products, had
opposed labeling and had fought import bans except in cases where the product is
shown to be risky. It was forced to make concessions on those and several other
points.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting back tears, the conference's president, Juan Mayr, congratulated
his colleagues on reaching a compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The adoption of this protocol represents a victory for the environment,''
Mayr said.
</P>
<P>
	   The protocol is intended to protect the environment from damage due to
genetically modified organisms. Environmentalists and some scientists worry that
bioengineered plants, animals and bacteria could wipe out native strains or
spread their genetic advantages to weeds and other undesirable species.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's fish genes in fruit, poultry genes in fish, animal genes in
plants, growth hormones in milk, insect genes in vegetables, tree genes in grain
and in the case of pork, human genes in meat,'' said Steve Gilman, an organic
farmer in Stillwater, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   A first attempt to draw up a biosafety protocol ended last February in
Cartagena, Colombia, when the United States and five partners blocked a pact
that was acceptable to the other 125 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's new agreement came after a week of intense negotiations that
pitted the United States and its five allies in the talks -- Canada, Australia,
Argentina, Chile and Uruguay -- against the European Union and a coalition of
developing nations. As protesters stood outside in single-digit temperatures
chanting ``Hey, ho, GMOs have got to go,'' negotiators worked until just before
dawn to hammer out the final details.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU and developing nations had argued that countries should be allowed to
refuse imports of a genetically modified product if little is known about its
environmental effect. The United States and its partners had disagreed, saying
many of the proposed rules would restrict trade.
</P>
<P>
	   But the political situation changed in the last year, with major U.S. food
producers like Archer Daniels Midland and Gerber either demanding that
genetically modified products be segregated from other products or refusing to
use them altogether. Scientific studies have suggested that monarch butterflies
and other beneficial insects may be harmed by genetically engineered crops.
</P>
<P>
	   And protests at the WTO talks in Seattle last month also suggested that the
American public has concerns about genetically altered food.
</P>
<P>
	   EU negotiators, whose constituency strongly opposes genetic modifications in
food, used the changed climate to exact a number of concessions from the U.S.
delegation. Nonetheless, U.S. negotiators said they were satisfied with the
final agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The agreement that we achieved is a very substantial improvement over the
agreement we started with,'' U.S. Undersecretary of State Frank Loy said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the end, the sides' most serious differences turned out to be over how
the biosafety protocol would relate to WTO rules, and whether shipments of
genetically modified commodities should be labeled.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists have complained in recent years that the WTO's free trade
pact has overridden regulations meant to protect human and ecological health.
But Saturday's agreement calls for the biosafety protocol and the WTO rules to
be ``mutually supportive'' with nothing ``intended to subordinate this Protocol
to other international agreements.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the protocol, exporters will be required to apply the label ``may
contain living modified organisms'' to all shipments containing genetically
altered commodities. The protocol allows for a revision of that labeling policy
after two years.
</P>
<P>
	   In a legal question mark, the United States has neither signed nor ratified
the biodiversity treaty that oversees the new protocol. So technically, the U.S.
is not bound to honor it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not being part of this treaty makes it more challenging for us here,''
U.S. negotiator David Sandalow said.
</P>
<P>
	   Genetically modified crops are already widespread. About 70 million acres of
genetically engineered plants were cultivated worldwide in 1999. In the United
States, genetically engineered varieties account for about 25 percent of corn
and 40 percent of soybeans.
</P>
<P>
	   Biotechnology proponents point to the potential of the technology to
increase yields and improve nutrition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The longer I use it the more I believe in it,'' said Robert M. Boeding, an
Iowa farmer who has grown genetically modified corn for the last five years. He
says the modified strain keeps him from having to use dangerous pesticides to
protect his crop from insects.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Memorial Plan Protested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Hundreds of neo-Nazis demonstrated Saturday at the site of
Germany's planned memorial to Holocaust victims, and also took the politically
charged move of marching through Berlin's landmark Brandenburg Gate.
</P>
<P>
	   The extreme-right National Party of Germany had been banned by police from
demonstrating out of fears of violence, but a court late Friday overturned the
decision and allowed the event to go forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of police blocked streets in central Berlin to make way for the
about 500 demonstrators, who headed down the main Under den Linden boulevard to
the site of the memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   They then marched through the nearby Brandenburg Gate -- a particularly
symbolic act given that Nazi troops during Adolf Hitler's reign once held
torchlight processions through the gate. During past neo-Nazi demonstrations,
police have not allowed participants to go through the Brandenburg Gate.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators carried a banner at the head of their procession reading,
``Stop the Memorial,'' and some carried the old German red, white and black
national flag -- one which had the word ``Skinheads'' written on it.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said two arrests were made by people allegedly displaying banned
symbols. In Germany, spreading Nazi propaganda is illegal. Authorities also
stopped about 25 marchers from singing an SS song.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, a counter-demonstration was held by supporters of the
memorial. At several points during the neo-Nazi demonstration, opponents
gathered in smaller groups and shouted ``Nazis raus!'' at the demonstrators,
meaning ``Nazis get out!''
</P>
<P>
	   In the central city of Goettingen, a counter-demonstration against neo-Nazis
drew about 2,000 participants. The city had been the planned site of a
demonstration by the nationalist party, but authorities there had also banned it
because of fears of violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Michel Friedman, a vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany,
called for ``no tolerance for racists'' at the Goettingen event.
</P>
<P>
	   Police there said 22 people, left and right extremists, were taken into
custody.
</P>
<P>
	   German leaders on Thursday held a ceremonial dedication for the Holocaust
memorial, which will consist of a vast field of 2,700 close-set concrete slabs
resembling stones in a graveyard. Thursday was also Germany's annual Day of
Remembrance for Victims of Nazism, established in 1996 to coincide with the day
Soviet soldiers liberated the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland in
1945.
</P>
<P>
	   After 10 years of debate, parliament last year approved the memorial, the
first in Germany dedicated solely to ``the murdered Jews of Europe.''

<HEADLINE> Report: State and city buildings fail to provide equal access to  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Nineteen city and state buildings in the city fail to
provide equal access for people with disabilities, said a report issued Saturday
by state Assemblyman Scott Stringer.
<P>
	   The report listed nearly 100 alleged violations of the American with
Disabilities Act (ADA) accessibility guidelines in buildings ranging from City
Hall to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   "The city and state use a half-loafed approach to making government
accessible to disability," said Stringer, who was joined by a half dozen
disabled activists.
</P>
<P>
	   Reported violations included elevator call buttons placed too high for a
person in a wheelchair at the Brooklyn Municipal Building and Bronx Borough
Hall. None of the buildings surveyed was equipped with a text telephone (TTY or
TDD) for the hearing impaired.
</P>
<P>
	   And many buildings reportedly had front doors that were far too heavy for a
person in the wheelchair to open without help.
</P>
<P>
	   "If government can't provide this kind of access, how can we demand private
companies to do it," Stringer asked reporters. "This could all be remedied very
easily."
</P>
<P>
	   Marty Sesmer, 62, who suffers from a circulatory disease that has forced him
to use a wheelchair since 1983, said that he does not have equal access to many
buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I go to a municipal building I never know what I'm going to run into,"
he said. "I usually have to bring someone with me to help me navigate some of
these places."
</P>
<P>
	   Stringer said he will submit his findings to the State Assembly and to the
Department of Justice and will enjoin them to look into the reported violations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Americans with Disabilities Act, passed in 1990, prohibits
discrimination against the disabled in employment, public accommodations,
transportation and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Buildings Department, whose responsibility it is to make sure
buildings adhere to the ADA guidelines, could not be reached for comment on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at City Hall and the offices of the Queens and Bronx borough
presidents, all of whose offices were cited in the report, did not return calls
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Burton: Elian Wants To Stay  </HEADLINE>
   By MADELINE BARO DIAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- About 200 chanting, flag-waving protesters marched in front of
INS headquarters Saturday, demanding that 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez be sent home
to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Dan Burton, whose congressional maneuvering to keep Elian in the
United States has infuriated the boy's father, said Saturday that the 6-year-old
told him he doesn't want to go back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a very intelligent young man and I was able to ask him without any
coaching a couple of questions,'' the Indiana Republican said after meeting for
30 minutes with Elian at the home where the boy is staying with relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first question I asked him is how did he like living here and he said
he liked it very much as he was blowing bubbles. And then I said `Would you like
to go back to Cuba?' And he was very firm in saying 'No' and this without any
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the subject of heated debate since he was found clinging to
an inner tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast. His mother and 10 others traveling
with him drowned during an effort to leave Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers were expected to continue a tour of the United States,
where they have been campaigning for Elian's return, Cuba's Prensa Latina news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, the protesters at the Immigration and Naturalization Service
office yelled ``Send Elian Home'' as a small plane towing a banner with the same
slogan passed overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban-Americans among the group said they wanted to show that not all
Cuban-Americans want Elian to remain here. They said the 6-year-old had been
kidnapped and should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every child needs a father and a mother,'' said Juan Morales, a Cuban who
has lived in the United States for eight years. ``If the mother dies, the person
directly responsible is the father and not the uncle and not the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Andres Gomez, national coordinator of the Antonio Maceo Brigade, a group
that organized the protest and advocates normalizing relations with Cuba, said
the demonstrators have a noble purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are coming together in this case in defense of the most fundamental
rights of a human being, which are the rights of a child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Saturday, a demonstration was planned by the anti-Castro Democracy
Movement, a group which wants Elian to stay put. The group planned to launch a
flotilla to pay tribute to Elizabeth Brotons, Elian's mother.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled Elian should return to his father. But its order has not
been carried out because the government agreed to hold off until a federal court
considers a challenge filed by the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler originally said he would hear arguments
March 6 on whether the relative's lawsuit should be dismissed. But on Friday, he
moved that day up to Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to block Elian's return to Cuba, Burton earlier this month
subpoenaed the boy to appear before the House Government Reform Committee, which
he chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Elian's father expressed outrage. ``What right does that man
have?'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said. ``Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton said it is unlikely that Elian will actually appear before the
committee, but he didn't rule that out entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department asserts that if Elian is not returned to Cuba, it
could hurt attempts to retrieve American children taken out of the country by a
foreign-born parent against the wishes of the child's American parent.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton said the situations are not identical.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are talking about people who are leaving a totalitarian, communist
state,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Nurse Sues Bombing Suspect Rudolph  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A nurse who was seriously injured in the 1998
bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic is suing fugitive suspect Eric Robert
Rudolph, partly in an effort to block any profits he might receive from a book
or movie, her attorney said.
</P>
<P>
	   Emily Lyons and her husband, Jeff, are also seeking damages in the suit
against Rudolph, which they filed Thursday in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She feels very strongly that he should never profit from his conduct
involving the clinic,'' said her attorney, Scott Powell.
</P>
<P>
	   Lyons was arriving for work when a bomb exploded Jan. 29, 1998, outside New
Woman All Women Health Care. The blast killed an off-duty Birmingham policeman.
Lyons lost her left eye and has undergone numerous operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Rudolph is charged in six bombings, including the 1996 Centennial Park blast
during the Olympic Games in Atlanta that killed one person and injured 100
others.
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement has searched for Rudolph for more than two years, focusing
on remote areas in western North Carolina near his home.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak To Meet Next Week  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat will meet next week amid fading hopes for concluding the
outline of a peace agreement by the deadline they set, Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they don't meet it, they'll reach some understanding about how to deal
with that problem,'' a senior U.S. official said Saturday after a 30-minute
meeting between Arafat and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement was the frankest admission yet that American mediators are
likely to fall short of their target for a basic understanding about the future
of Jerusalem, whether there will be a Palestinian state and other knotty issues
at the core of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The Barak-Arafat meeting will be held Thursday or Friday at Erez, a border
crossing between Israel and Palestinian-held Gaza, and will focus on the major
unresolved issues, said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   He described the pursuit of the deadline as a formidable challenge. ``It's
very difficult to get there,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no American claims of progress after Clinton saw Arafat in the
Steigenberger Hotel Belvedere in this Swiss ski resort. They were among scores
of world leaders attending an international economic forum.
</P>
<P>
	   It was their second meeting in nine days. Nor was progress claimed after the
last one, at the White House in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department announced Thursday that senior U.S. mediator Dennis
Ross would go to the Middle East to help in the search for a settlement. Ross is
due in Israel on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lower-ranking Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are to hold intensive
talks early this week at Israel's Red Sea resort Eilat.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has appealed to the two sides to seek less than 100 percent of their
demands. He said a settlement requires as much.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in her own flurry of diplomacy in
Davos, saw King Abdullah of Jordan for 45 minutes Saturday night, and was to
confer with Arafat and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   She then travels to Moscow, where she has separate meetings scheduled Monday
with Foreign Ministers David Levy of Israel and Prince Saud of Saudi Arabia.
They will be in Moscow for a multilateral conference to promote understanding
between the Jewish state and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   In his meeting with Albright, Jordan's King Abdullah volunteered to have his
kingdom act as host for the next regional economic conference, State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin also confirmed that neither Syria nor Lebanon would attend the Moscow
conference. Syria's government-controlled press has criticized the conference as
divisive to Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, Albright and Ross all are prepared to commit themselves to working
on a ``day-by-day basis'' to try to reach an Israeli-Palestinian settlement, the
U.S. official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian officials have raised the possibility of shifting negotiations
to Washington if talks in the region do not produce an accord.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the Palestinians accused Barak of not being serious about
reaching the Feb. 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian planning minister, said his negotiating team
proposed that the talks be conducted in Washington under Clinton's close
supervision, but Israel rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Salim Zanoun, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization's
decision-making Central Council, said the council will meet Wednesday in Gaza
City to set the date for the declaration of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
	   It appeared highly unlikely, however, that the Palestinians would issue a
unilateral declaration of independence and risk angering the Americans before
the September deadline for a peace treaty with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Officers go on trial for 41 shots heard around the city  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - No one disputes the math.
<P>
	   Officer Sean Carroll squeezed off 16 rounds. So did Edward McMellon. Kenneth
Boss added five shots, and Richard Murphy four, for a total of 41.
</P>
<P>
	   Nineteen of the bullets tore through the body of Amadou Diallo in a matter
of seconds, turning the 5-by-8-foot vestibule of his Bronx apartment building
into a dingy death trap.
</P>
<P>
	   It might have ended there if Diallo was an armed criminal, as the police
apparently feared. Instead, he was a street vendor carrying only a pager and
wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly a year later - with a backdrop mixing racial politics and a mother's
well-publicized grief - a jury must decide whether the shooting of the West
African immigrant by the four white officers was murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection for the officers' trial is set to begin Monday. The trial
will be in Albany, N.Y., because an appeals court took the unusual step of
moving the case from the Bronx. It agreed with defense attorneys that a torrent
of pretrial publicity and protests would make it impossible to find impartial
jurors in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Justice Joseph Teresi ruled the trial could be televised - in
part to ensure access to city residents - but that is unlikely to still anger
over the change of venue.
</P>
<P>
	   Civil rights activists, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, have vowed to lead
their followers to Albany to rally behind the Diallo family. They also urged
federal authorities to monitor a case they say symbolizes widespread police
brutality against minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   "Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice for everyone," his mother,
Kadiatou Diallo, said last year after the officers were indicted on charges of
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36, McMellon, 27, Boss, 28, and Murphy, 27, pleaded innocent. But
prosecutors allege they demonstrated a "depraved indifference to human life" by
unleashing the barrage on a defenseless man.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants' decision not to testify before a grand jury left no option
except murder charges carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison, said Bronx
District Attorney Robert Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   "Without (their) explanation, what we have is four people driving up to a
location, pulling out their guns and killing an individual," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys and the city's powerful police union, the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association, maintain the officers made a tragic mistake. Part of a
plainclothes unit assigned to combat street crime, they thought Diallo, 22, was
reaching for a gun while lurking around the apartment building.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers have signaled they will take the witness stand in their own
defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is "about whether you give police officers the benefit of the
doubt," said McMellon's attorney, Stephen Worth. "You either somehow believe a
bunch of cops thought, 'What the hell, we'll shoot this guy for no good reason,'
or you realize that they thought they were in danger of being shot at, and took
proper action."
</P>
<P>
	   Today, many New Yorkers know Diallo's name, and about the 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   But before their worlds collided at about 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999, the
victim and the shooters navigated the city in relative anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's father, Guinean entrepreneur Saikou Amad Diallo, once hawked candy
and cigarettes in Senegal. He later launched a career as a jewel trader. He
married Kadiatou, his second wife, when she was only 14. They divorced in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The eldest of the couple's four children, Diallo studied computers before
leaving Africa for New York in 1996. He peddled videotapes on the streets of
Manhattan and lived in a two-story, red-brick building in a rough section of the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers, clean-cut looking products of more peaceful neighborhoods,
signed on with the nation's largest police department in time to ride a dramatic
downturn in crime. Murders alone plummeted to 629 in 1998 from 2,245 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants were part of the roving Street Crime Unit credited with
driving down the numbers of shootings by arresting armed suspects. The unit made
nearly 4,000 arrests and seized about 1,000 guns in 1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
	   But even before Diallo killing, complaints arose that Street Crime used
unlawful "stop-and-frisk" tactics against young men of color - especially in the
Bronx, a borough with a history of tension between minorities and police. Police
officials have since come under fire for expanding the unit with inexperienced
officers; of the four defendants, only Carroll had been in the unit for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   On the night of the shooting, the officers were patrolling Diallo's
neighborhood in a Ford Taurus, looking for violent suspects. Each was armed with
a 16-shot, semiautomatic pistol and wore a bulletproof vest. Three had been
involved in previous shootings, one fatal. All were deemed justified.
</P>
<P>
	   What happened in front of 1157 Wheeler Avenue in a span of less than a
minute - and what was going through the defendants' minds - will be the focus of
the trial expected to last more than a month.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the defense, the officers stopped their car after spotting
Diallo, wearing a knit Yankees cap, duck into the shadows around his building.
With Carroll and McMellon approaching first and Murphy and Boss following, he
ignored an order to freeze, then made a sudden move - drawing gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense says that as the bullets flew, Carroll was so sure Diallo was
armed he yelled, "Gun!" McMellon fell backward as he and Carroll retreated. That
further created an impression a gun battle was under way.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're talking about split-second decisions," said Steven Brounstein, the
attorney for Boss. "What if this had gone the other way? What if (Boss) held his
fire while his partner was being shot? It would have been a police funeral."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bronx District Attorney's office has largely kept quiet about its case.
</P>
<P>
	   But a civilian witness has said he heard two or three shots, a two-second
pause, then another burst of fire. The pause would support arguments that the
officers had a chance to realize their mistake and hold fire, yet didn't.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution also is expected to use medical evidence to contend that
Diallo was dropped by the first bullets, instantly ending any threat and meaning
the officers continued shooting even though Diallo was on the ground. The
defense contends the victim remained upright, making him a perceived threat
deserving of deadly force.
</P>
<P>
	   An autopsy found Diallo was hit 11 times in the legs. Five bullets went into
the left side of body. He was also hit once in the back, right arm and in the
front of his chest. The bullets perforated his aorta, spinal cord, lungs, liver,
spleen, kidneys and intestines.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, with Diallo dead in the vestibule, Boss' voice could be heard
over police radios calling for an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
	   Five days later, Kadiatou Diallo arrived from Guinea and went straight to
the Bronx. Television crews filmed a woman in traditional West African robes
crying out her son's name as she arrived the scene of his death.
</P>
<P>
	   In the weeks that followed, a team of lawyers for Diallo's estate began
preparing a wrongful death lawsuit sure to seek millions of dollars in damages.
Diallo was buried under a fig tree in an African village founded by his
great-grandfather. And more than 1,200 people - including actress Susan
Sarandon, former Mayor David Dinkins and Rep. Charles Rangel - were arrested for
civil disobedience during demonstrations at Police Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   A more muted protest went on at 1157 Wheeler. Mourners there covered the
bullet-scarred vestibule with graffiti, some still visible today.
</P>
<P>
	   "Amadou," one says, "your life was not in vain."

<HEADLINE> The blue crabs are OK, but the crabbers are not  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   OCEAN CITY, Md. (AP) - After a bad year in 1998, the consensus among
Mid-Atlantic fishing agencies is that the blue crab is doing OK.
<P>
	   Now it is the watermen who are hurting.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, debate surrounding the blue crab has centered largely on
maintaining a sustainable population in the Chesapeake and Delaware bays. It is
feared that overfishing the blue crab could wipe out an industry worth more than
$50 million a year on the Chesapeake alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Several dozen watermen, stuffed uncomfortably into the chairs of an Ocean
City Convention Center conference room Saturday, said it is time the debate
focused on keeping watermen in business.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the crab is in trouble. I think the crabber is in trouble,"
said Tommy Leggett, who runs a boat out of Hampton Roads, Va., on the Elizabeth
River.
</P>
<P>
	   There are more crab pots in the water, but watermen aren't pulling up any
more crabs than previous years. Leggett said watermen are working more hours and
spending more on fuel and equipment just to keep even.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to work a lot more pots to get the same number of crabs," he said.
"And you need to do that just to keep up and pay the bills."
</P>
<P>
	   Leggett and others were gathered to hear a panel of biologists and state
regulators, gathered at the 26th Annual East Coast Commercial Fishermen's and
Aquaculture Exposition, talk about managing the blue crab population.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel sounded a serious note during a three-day conference that features
cocktail parties, piles of free samples of fried seafood, and oyster tonging
contests.
</P>
<P>
	   There is great concern about the future of the blue crab. While 1999's
harvest appears to be much better than the poor catch in 1998, the average size
of the blue crabs seems to be shrinking.
</P>
<P>
	   There were questions raised by watermen about when the crabs are plentiful.
The season didn't pick up, particularly in the upper Chesapeake Bay, until late
July.
</P>
<P>
	   Years of blue crab studies will likely produce stricter regulation of
crabbing in many states.
</P>
<P>
	   Delaware, for example, has legislation before its General Assembly which
would allow state agencies to control the number of blue crabs fished from the
western half of the Delaware Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chesapeake Bay Commission is urging both Virginia and Maryland to limit
the rate of development on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay in order to reduce
damage to the environment of the blue crab and other fish.
</P>
<P>
	   But watermen say they are frustrated by the poor economy of their industry,
and that state agencies don't do much to help them.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Jeanks, of Leonardo, N.J., said he took his crab pots out of Sandy Hook
Bay nearly 30 years ago because the catch wasn't big enough to justify the work.
He turned instead to clamming.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, with blue crabs appearing to be in some abundance in New Jersey waters,
he wants to crab again, but can't afford the $10,000 to get a state crabbing
license.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey, which limits the number of crabbing licenses it issues, has
given many of those commercial licenses to people whose lives don't depend on
it, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I make my living on the water, and I can't get a crab license," he said.
"This makes me so mad, I can't even tell you."
</P>
<P>
	   Many watermen said changes must be made to licensing and regulation to
ensure that commercial crab fishing remains a viable industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody has to gear up as much as they can and crab as much as they can
just to keep up," said Steve Konka, a waterman out of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation of the watermen is something like a trap, said Douglas Lipton,
an economist with the University of Maryland's Sea Grant Extension.
</P>
<P>
	   There are more pots in the water, but the overall catch hasn't changed -
meaning fewer crabs in each pot. That prompts the waterman to throw in even more
pots to catch up, and that just adds to the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   "The additional pots aren't catching any more crabs, and that's what's
leading to the reduced incomes," Lipton said. "We need to look at the
regulations we have and ask, is this working? Perhaps not."

<HEADLINE> Kohl Party Gets Lengthy Fund Report  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- A key figure in the Christian Democrats' financial scandal
has given the party's Hesse state branch a 1,000-plus page report on secret
party money, state Christian Democratic leaders said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hesse has become a focus in the scandal over a network of financial schemes
run by the Christian Democrats, the conservative German party that led the
government from the early 1980s until 1998. The Hesse branch of the party said
it would likely take a week to go through the report, and after that it would be
made public.
</P>
<P>
	   Horst Weyrauch, the accountant who prepared the report, is the first witness
who will be called in parliament's investigation of whether decisions by former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government were bought. Kohl has admitted taking up to
$1 million in off-the-books donations for the party.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a report in Focus magazine Saturday, Weyrauch had threatened
the party leadership, telling it not to force him to reveal information about
secret party funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Party officials decided last week to threaten legal action against Weyrauch
after his remarks, which Focus said included an ominous statement: ``When you
want to know the truth, then the republic totters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, new reports indicated the secret party funds extended even
farther overseas than previously suspected.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Der Spiegel magazine, Weyrauch and the longtime state party
accountant in Hesse, Prince Casimir Sayn-Wittgenstein, worked with people in
Paraguay to design a system to create fake estates. The system was to be used to
funnel money to the party.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the scandal, Spiegel reported, the Christian Democrats may
have to pay $20.5 million back to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Hesse Gov. Roland Koch revealed that the state party had
diverted more than $9.5 million to Swiss bank accounts in 1983. The money was
apparently sent abroad to flout stricter campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a report to be published Sunday in the newspaper Welt am
Sonntag, money from the Hesse accounts was passed on in ``considerable amounts''
to the national party. However, Christian Democrat financial officials said
Saturday the fact that amounts and dates of transactions seem to be similar
doesn't necessarily indicate any connection.
</P>
<P>
	   The party's federal office in Berlin said it would keep in close touch with
Hesse officials to determine whether the millions held in secret Swiss accounts
by the state party are connected to the national party.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl has refused to name the donors who gave the party the $1 million.
German President Johannes Rau indirectly called on Kohl to reveal the names,
telling Bild newspaper Saturday that he saw ``no way to agree with an idea of
honor that stands over law and the state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rau, though, has his own scandal to worry about. Some opposition politicians
are now openly demanding that he resign for accepting free flights from a bank
that had close ties to a state government while he was the state's governor.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report Saturday in Focus, deputy Christian Democratic chairman
Christian Wulff called on Rau to step down. An indirect call for Rau's
resignation also came from conservative opposition leader Michael Glos of the
Christian Social Union in Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
	   On the sidelines of the Christian Democrats' troubles, allegations of a
plane scandal have been growing in recent months against the ruling Social
Democrats in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, another Social Democrat, longtime North Rhine-Westphalia
Finance Minister Heinz Schleusser, resigned after admitting a female companion
went along on two of 49 free plane trips he had taken.
</P>
<P>
	   Rau's lawyer this week released a list of 44 flights Rau made while
governor, paid for by the Westdeutschen Landesbank. A state investigation is
probing whether Rau took the flights for private purposes.

<HEADLINE> Russia Claims Advances Into Grozny  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STARIYE ATAGI, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces advanced through snowy alleys
and seized shell-shattered high-rises from rebels Saturday in the Chechen
capital, Grozny, but Chechens said they were letting the Russians move in so
they could attack from behind.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians' assault on Grozny has concentrated for more than a week on
Minutka Square, which they advanced toward on Saturday. Taking the square would
give federal forces leverage to push the rebels out of the city center.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Russian presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky said 54 rebels
surrendered in northeast Grozny to forces led by pro-Moscow Chechen leader
Bislan Gantamirov. Speaking on Russia's ORT television, Yastrzhembsky called the
move a ``psychological breakthrough.'' Many of the rebels were wounded.
</P>
<P>
	   But up to 3,000 fighters are believed to remain in Grozny, and it was
unclear whether the surrender would mean much in the monthlong battle for the
city. Though Gantamirov claimed Friday he had persuaded some rebel commanders to
give up arms, pro-Moscow Chechens are deeply distrusted in the breakaway
republic, and Gantamirov's previous claims have often proven false.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops have advanced on Minutka Square along side streets and were
battling Chechen fighters some 500 yards from the square, said senior Chechen
rebel commander Mumadi Saidayev. Russian commanders had earlier claimed to be
closer to the square, but this was apparently the first time the rebels admitted
the Russians had made it so close.
</P>
<P>
	   A top Russian commander, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, said the Russians have
seized several high-rise buildings in the Leninsky and Oktyabrsky districts, to
the north and south of Minutka, from rebel snipers who had hindered the
Russians' advance.
</P>
<P>
	   But Saidayev, the Chechen commander, said the Russians were being allowed to
advance so they could be trapped and attacked by Chechen fighters from the rear,
the Interfax news agency reported. That tactic inflicted severe losses on
Russian troops during the last Chechnya war from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   A Chechen fighter who slipped through a supposed Russian blockade and left
Grozny Saturday said rebels have pulled back from some positions in outlying
neighborhoods to avoid scattering their forces, but were preparing strong
defenses closer to the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The fighter, who asked to be identified only by his first name, Bislan, said
rebel forces were positioned behind Russian troops, ready to stage surprise
attacks. Despite the Russians' claims of progress, federal troops control only a
few blocks in several districts of Grozny, Bislan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Artillery and tank fire rained on Grozny from all sides Saturday, the
Russian military command said. Warplanes and helicopter gunships also bombarded
mountainous rebel outposts in southern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscow sent troops into Chechnya in September after an invasion by
Chechen-based militants into the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in
August. Deadly apartment bombings in several Russian cities also were blamed on
Chechens.
</P>
<P>
	   International criticism of the war has been building. U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan, wrapping up a trip to Moscow on Saturday, reiterated his call for an
end to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one can support or encourage terrorism but ... one should take steps to
protect civilians,'' he told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said Saturday he was disheartened by
Moscow's tactics and concerned about other Caucasian hot spots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have expressed our disillusionment with the Russian administration for
the methods they used in trying to promote the unity of their country, for
having taken the people directly as their targets,'' Ecevit said at an economic
conference in Davos, Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Mother of Megan Kanka wants tougher sex offender law in New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Maureen Kanka, one of the nation's best-known
crusaders for laws to warn parents about sex offenders, now says it is time for
New Jersey to use the Internet for a tougher Megan's Law.
<P>
	   And her hometown state senator, Peter Inverso, R-Mercer, who helped Kanka
convert her family tragedy into a groundbreaking statute, has agreed to help her
and has arranged a meeting with the state attorney general to discuss the
matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Kanka's daughter, 7-year-old Megan, was killed in 1994 by a convicted sex
offender who lived across the street but whose criminal past was a secret to his
Hamilton Township neighbors. Jesse Timmendequas now sits on New Jersey's death
row for the crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The crime triggered a spate of Megan's Law sex offender laws across the
United States and as well as a federal law ordering state officials to share
information on sex offender movements with other states.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's law provides for community notification door-to-door when the
highest risk offenders move in or get out of prison. When offenders are deemed
to pose a moderate risk, only officials at schools, daycare centers and
facilities with custody of children receive the notification.
</P>
<P>
	   Kanka told the Associated Press Friday she wants all parents no matter where
they live to have access to complete listings of sex offenders' names, addresses
and photos on Internet Web sites or at local police departments, which could be
equipped with CD-ROMs developed by the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Kanka claimed she has seen such systems in operation in California and other
states.
</P>
<P>
	   "If other states are capable of doing it, then so are we," Kanka said. "We
need to have a better notification law. I think when you look at the number of
notifications that are actually going out, it is minimal for the number of
offenders there are in this state."
</P>
<P>
	   State figures show that of 6,513 offenders registered with local
authorities, notifications have been conducted on only 1,042, and of those only
110 have been door-to-door for offenders deemed to pose a high risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Inverso said he is ready to sponsor a tougher Megan's Law, especially now
that the existing law has been successfully defended in state and federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am leaning toward the idea of making information more accessible,"
Inverso said, "I have been tussling for a long time with people not having
information when they want to buy a home."
</P>
<P>
	   Neighborhood notifications about high-risk sex offenders are limited to
residents in a carefully proscribed area. Potential homebuyers are not included.
They get the notice only after moving in.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's wrong that people can't get the information until they actually move
into a residence," Inverso said. "I think the time may have come that we have to
look at some of these options."
</P>
<P>
	   "I know that people in this state are not happy with the current law when it
was explained to them," Kanka said. "They were under the impression you would be
able to find out more."
</P>
<P>
	   Kanka said she has spent countless hours traveling the state to meet with
parents' groups and PTAs, "and they are not pleased with it, and I do not blame
them."
</P>
<P>
	   Kanka acknowledges her proposal for a new Internet registry might exceed the
limits courts have stipulated. To resolve this, Kanka said it is time to amend
the New Jersey Constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have amended the constitution for other things that in my opinion are a
lot less important than this," Kanka said. "We can never lose sight of the fact
that anyone convicted of any type of crime, it is public record. If you know how
to get it, it is available to everyone."
</P>
<P>
	   Kanka does not fault the current New Jersey law, noting it provided a
purpose and goal in her life at an excruciating time.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were going through a heavy trauma, the loss of our daughter," she said.
"It was something to start with, and I thought it was a wonderful start. There
was always the notion that we would go further."
</P>
<P>
	   As for the current law, U.S. District Judge Joseph Irenas last week ordered
Farmer to bring more uniformity to the conduct of community notifications to
prevent leaks. Irenas also issued an order to have all such notifications halted
provided a federal appeals court agrees.

<HEADLINE> Peace Settlement in Burundi Urged  </HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG NELSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Trying to ease a humanitarian crisis that
imperils Tanzania and Burundi, the defense ministers of both nations said
Saturday that security along their border has improved and urged a speedy end to
Burundi's civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated army has killed more
than 200,000 Burundians since fighting started six years ago and has driven at
least 300,000 more people into U.N.-operated refugee camps in neighboring
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
	   For months, the Burundian government has bitterly accused Tanzania of
winking at rebel recruitment in the refugee camps and condoning cross-border
raids by the insurgents. Just as rancorously, Tanzania has denied the
allegations, saying it has devoted meager resources to care for the refugees at
the expense of its own people.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, none of the recent vitriol was evident.
</P>
<P>
	   A Burundian delegation led by Defense Minister Cyrille Ndayirukiye said
Tanzania had strengthened security measures along the frontier. The officials
said they were not training the rebels fighting to oust Burundian President
Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement issued at the end of the one-day talks between Ndayirukiye and
his Tanzanian counterpart, Edgar Maokoka Majogo, also said the Burundian
government would create ``favorable conditions for the conducive return of the
refugees.'' Burundian officials said that was a reference to Burundi's support
for a peace plan mediated by former South African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mandela-led peace talks began in 1998. They are set to resume next month
in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela said Monday that President Clinton has pledged to play a personal
role in helping bring peace to the central African nation, embroiled in war
since Tutsi paratroopers killed the country's first democratically elected
president, a Hutu. Tutsis, while a minority, control Burundi's political,
military and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled into Tanzania,
the Burundian army has herded up to 350,000 people into internal ``regroupment''
camps since September.
</P>
<P>
	   The army says the relocation was necessary to stem escalating rebel attacks
on the Burundian capital, Bujumbura. But international human rights groups have
condemned the camps as breeding grounds for hunger, disease and more violence.

<HEADLINE> Confessed Spy Sentenced in Miami  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A confessed member of a spy ring was sentenced to seven years
in prison for attempting to infiltrate U.S. military installations in Florida
for the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   Alejandro Alonso, a U.S. citizen born in Des Moines, Iowa, was the first
member of the group to be sentenced. He had pleaded guilty to being an agent for
a foreign country. Five others who have pleaded guilty are awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can only say that I did wrong,'' Alonso said after sentencing Friday.
``I am repentant. I apologize to this court and to the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alonso was charged with trying to penetrate U.S. military bases, infiltrate
anti-Castro exile groups and manipulate U.S. media and political organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said his assignment was to report on the Cuban-exile group
Democracy Movement. He joined exile demonstrations, disclosed the names of
participants and reported on related U.S. Coast Guard activity, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He was one of 10 people arrested in September 1998 in connection with the
spy ring. Four others were added to the list of defendants in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   After his arrest, Alonso told investigators where to find a fake
identification kit, a page of codes, and a pad of water-soluble paper used for
secret messages.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said the ring tried to infiltrate the U.S. Southern Command and
planted an agent at the U.S. Navy's Boca Chica Naval Air Station near Key West.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Warns of Unrest in East Timor  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. investigators have recommended that the world
body establish a human rights tribunal to prosecute those responsible for
atrocities in East Timor, the BBC and people familiar with the investigators'
report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed tribunal would be somewhat different from the United Nations'
two established tribunals in that the investigators call for participation by
Indonesia and East Timor. The tribunal would be seated in both countries rather
than in a neutral setting, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
	   It isn't clear, however, that the Security Council would support an inquiry
for Indonesia, which is carrying out its own investigation into the violence.
U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who visited East Timor late last year, has
said he hoped another tribunal wouldn't be necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   The rights experts calling for a tribunal said the United Nations should
first determine who was responsible by conducting further investigations into
the wave of violence that tore through East Timor before and after its Aug. 30
vote for independence, the BBC and the sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   East Timor's people voted overwhelmingly in a U.N.-organized ballot to
separate from Indonesia, which invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
later annexed it.
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesian-backed militias went on a weeks-long killing and looting rampage
to protest the results, destroying large parts of the territory and driving tens
of thousands of East Timorese into neighboring, Indonesian-controlled West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, to be officially released Monday, comes after the U.N.
Commission of Inquiry visited East Timor and Indonesia late last year to conduct
preliminary investigations into allegations of serious violations of fundamental
human rights and international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The United Nations should establish an international human rights tribunal
consisting of judges appointed by the United Nations, preferably with the
participation of members from East Timor and Indonesia,'' the investigators'
report concluded, according to a source reading from the document.
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesia immediately rejected the proposed tribunal, saying it was under no
legal obligation to accept the recommendations of the U.N. inquiry, the British
Broadcasting Corp., said.
</P>
<P>
	   In an angry letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan accompanying the report,
Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Abdurrahman Shihab said the report was biased
and dismissed the accusations as totally false and baseless, the BBC said. He
also warned that setting up a U.N. tribunal would create obstacles in the
promotion of friendly relations between Indonesia and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   In his own accompanying letter, Annan said it would be up to the General
Assembly, Security Council and the Geneva-based Commission on Human Rights to
decide what further action was required, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan did say, however, that he would strengthen the ability of the U.N.
mission running East Timor to investigate the allegations in collaboration with
the ongoing Indonesian investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council on two previous occasions has set up international
tribunals -- for crimes committed during Rwanda's 1994 genocide and the wars in
the former Yugoslavia. Those tribunals were set up in third countries: Arusha,
Tanzania for the Rwandan tribunal and The Hague, Netherlands for the Yugoslav
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   In the report, members of the human rights commission of inquiry said
national efforts by the Indonesian government to prosecute those responsible
would not be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
	   An Indonesian law under consideration to deal with human rights abuses
committed prior to Aug. 8 was ``beset with problems and if enacted would not be
efficacious,'' the rights investigators concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   While they hadn't seen the final draft of the law, they noted that since
most crimes were committed in East Timor, the Indonesians might not be able to
investigate the allegations fully. Similarly, East Timorese might not be willing
to travel outside of the territory to testify, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Concedes Radiation Exposure  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reversing a position held for decades, the government has
concluded for the first time that many workers who built America's nuclear
weapons likely became ill because of exposure to radiation or toxic chemicals,
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings, based on a review of dozens of studies and raw medical data
covering an estimated 600,000 workers at 14 nuclear weapons sites, could lead to
compensation to the families of some of the workers. Many were unaware that they
were being exposed to such health risks.
</P>
<P>
	   While the draft report of the studies did not show a direct causal link
between workplace exposures and specific illnesses, it found that workers at the
plants suffered higher than normal rates of a wide range of cancers and clearly
were exposed to cancer-causing radiation and chemicals in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
	   The studies, reviewed by a special task force, examined health records and
other data covering three decades of the Cold War from the late 1940s into the
1960s. An official familiar with the report emphasized it does not relate to
workers' conditions today.
</P>
<P>
	   But the draft report, which President Clinton ordered last July, marks a
reversal in the government's long-standing position that no links exist between
work conducted at the Cold War-era weapons plants and later illnesses. That
argument has stymied numerous lawsuits seeking compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   While the compensation issue has yet to be resolved, the government now is
acknowledging that hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of workers may well have
been made sick by their working environment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It does appear that in the DOE complex, there is a direct link between
exposure and the possibility of contamination,'' Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said in Davos, Switzerland, where he is accompanying President
Clinton at an economic forum.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Richardson cautioned that the
findings are preliminary and won't be completed for several months. Still,
Richardson said, if the findings are borne out, ``The honorable thing for the
government to do is to protect its workers, past and present,'' including
compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said elevated rates of 22 categories of cancer were found among
workers at 14 facilities in the department's atomic weapons complex. They
included leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma and cancers of the prostate, kidney,
salivary gland and lung.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The exposures we are seeing are in excess'' of those in similar population
groups, a source familiar with the report said. ``We don't know what the cause
is, but it's clearly related to exposure there (in the workplace).''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton ordered the review after the Energy Department concluded
the government should compensate workers who had developed an incurable lung
disease because of exposure to beryllium, a material used in nuclear weapons
production.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson and the White House wanted to determine if other nuclear weapons
plant workers likewise should be compensated because of exposure to plutonium,
uranium and a variety of radioactive or highly toxic substances. The interagency
group reviewed dozens of epidemiological studies, raw health data and other
documents, many of which in the past have been dismissed by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   The draft report makes no conclusion on compensation, which will be examined
in the coming months. Recommendations are likely in the final report. One
official said compensation most likely would be to families ``in the hundreds,
not thousands,'' although the number at this time remains little more than a
guess.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will use the final report to develop a recommendation to Congress,
which is responsible for providing the money.
</P>
<P>
	   The draft report's conclusions were first reported Saturday by The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
	   Daniel J. Guttman, an attorney for the Paper, Allied-Industrial Chemical and
Energy Workers Union, told the Times the government turnabout was stunning,
because for years the government has marginalized the risks to the thousands of
weapons plant workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The report's findings included workers at plutonium production facilities at
Savannah River in South Carolina and Hanford in Washington state; the Rocky
Flats plant near Denver, where plutonium was molded into weapons components;
uranium enrichment and processing plants at the Oak Ridge, Tenn., complex; the
Fernald uranium processing plant near Cincinnati; and the Lawrence Livermore and
Los Alamos national laboratories in California and New Mexico, respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the plants still produce nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> Moroccan Held in Role in Terror Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A Moroccan man who crossed the border from Canada is being
held as a material witness for the investigation of an Algerian whose border
arrest led to heightened security concerns, The Seattle Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Youssef Karroum is not being held as a suspect, said his lawyer, Gene
Grantham. ``He's being held to determine if he knows anything about other
ongoing investigations,'' Grantham said.
</P>
<P>
	   Karroum was detained Thursday at Blaine, a border crossing about 100 miles
north of Seattle, and on Friday a U.S. magistrate ordered him held as a material
witness. Another court appearance was set for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials treated the case with an unusual level of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Justice Department sources told The Seattle Times that the case
involves an investigation related to Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian arrested Dec. 14
in Port Angeles, allegedly with a car full of explosives. Ressam has pleaded
innocent to charges that he was planning a terrorist bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle was shaken by news that Ressam had a motel reservation near the
Space Needle. The city later canceled New Year's Eve celebration at the park
beneath the Space Needle because of security concerns, although there was no
specific threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Karroum was arrested by agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
and the Customs Service who became suspicious about his documentation, the Times
reported. In addition, a computer check showed that his name had been
``red-flagged'' by the FBI, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   During a search of Karroum's vehicle, bomb-sniffing dogs reacted to traces
of a chemical officials think may be the explosive nitroglycerin, the Times
said. However, no bomb was found and law-enforcement sources said the dogs can
be wrong and that further tests are required.
</P>
<P>
	   Law-enforcement officials told the Times that they were unsure where Karroum
fits in the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Slices By Swiss Cuisine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIEDERURNEN, Switzerland (AP) -- In a country famed for chocolate and fondue
eaten in fine restaurants, the president of the United States ordered pizza and
Diet Coke at a roadside filling station's cafe.
</P>
<P>
	   Blowing snow denied him his usual helicopter ride, so President Clinton had
to be driven down a snowy Swiss mountainside Saturday from the World Economic
Forum at Davos to Zurich, where Air Force One waited to take him home.
</P>
<P>
	   The presidential motorcade of around 30 vehicles stopped at the BP station
outside Niederurnen, two-thirds of the way through the three-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
	   In the attached cafe, Clinton and two advisers sat on stools at the dark
Formica lunch counter and ordered their very American snacks. An elderly Swiss
man in a red sweater on the stool beside Clinton's continued eating his lunch
and minding his own business, although he did look peculiarly at his neighbor.
</P>
<P>
	   About 15 White House aides and a like number of Secret Service agents
schmoozed around the cafe. When he finished the pizza and soda, Clinton ordered
a cup of coffee and meandered through the dining room chatting with patrons.
</P>
<P>
	   Before he left, Clinton bought three Swatches, although he did not says
whose wrists the watches would grace.

<HEADLINE> Murder one verdict returned in kill-for-hire case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ELIZABETHTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - A jury has found an Essex County man guilty
of a murder-for-hire plot in which his wife died of drowning after water was
forced down her throat in the couple's northern New York home.
<P>
	   Saturday afternoon's verdict means Jeffrey Glanda, 49, could face the death
penalty or life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The body of Jeannine Glanda was discovered in August 1997 in a Ford Explorer
that was partially submerged in a nearby lake. According to testimony, Glanda
offered and associate, Nicholas Pecararo, $15,000, a new pickup truck and a
snowmobile to help commit the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   In his closing argument Friday, lead defense counsel Dennis Schlenker
attacked the testimony of Pecararo and Julius Elmore - the prosecutions star
witnesses - calling them "the most despicable human beings" he ever met,
according to the Plattsburgh Press-Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Pecararo had testified he and Glanda attacked and killed Mrs. Glanda. But
the defense tried to argue that Pecararo committed the murder and lied to skirt
the death penalty, saying that someone else killed the woman.
</P>
<P>
	   District Attorney Ronald Briggs in closing arguments Friday described the
breakdown of the Glandas' relationship in 1994, their separation and how Mr.
Glanda offered Plattsburgh auto mechanic Donald Hilborn $10,000 in 1996 to kill
Mrs. Glanda.
</P>
<P>
	   Briggs then fast-forwarded to 1997, citing Pecararo's testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Pecararo testified that after Glanda attacked his wife in her home he
shocked her with a stun gun while Pecararo held her.
</P>
<P>
	   Glanda allegedly then beat her and poured large amounts of water down her
throat until she died, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Glanda ordered Pecararo to have sex with her, but he refused, Pecararo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Glanda "is a court reporter who knows about DNA evidence" that sexual
contact would leave and was trying to frame Pecararo, Briggs said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pecararo said he took the body to upper Cascade Lake in Keene and dumped it
and her Ford Explorer into the lake.
</P>
<P>
	   Kimberly Musgrove testified she heard the splash when the Explorer hit, and
Kevin Reynolds said he found Mrs. Glanda's purse and some personal belongings on
Route 73 near where her body was found.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical examiner couldn't estimate the moment of death, but ruled she
died by being strangled and having water poured down her throat.
</P>
<P>
	   Briggs said Pecararo testified because of guilt.
</P>
<P>
	   "The defendant could control Nicholas Pecararo's actions but could not
control his soul," Briggs told the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Briggs argued that Glanda told Hilborn and Pecararo the same thing,
specifically that he wanted Mrs. Glanda dead and it had to look like an accident
to collect on the insurance money.
</P>
<P>
	   Glanda had taken out three insurance policies on his wife, the last one 18
days before her death, according to testimony. The husband would have received
$130,000 through the policies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Money is the oldest motive in the world," Briggs said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday, state Supreme Court Justice G. Thomas Moynihan instructed the jury
to ignore testimony from Mrs. Glanda's divorce attorney, William Cantwell. He
had said he was working on custody papers for Mrs. Glanda four weeks before his
client's death.
</P>
<P>
	   Glanda faces the death penalty or life without parole when he is sentenced.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Protest World Forum Summit  </HEADLINE>
   By CLARE NULLIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- More than 1,000 anti-free trade activists defied
a protest ban Saturday and staged a hectic demonstration at a gathering of the
world's political and corporate elite in this secluded Alpine resort.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the protesters -- including environmentalists and anarchists --
broke windows at a McDonald's restaurant and vandalized several cars. Others
burned an American flag they had pulled down from the facade of a luxury hotel
where most of the world leaders are staying, and used police barricades to try
to break the hotel's windows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But at least Davos didn't become a second Seattle,'' said local government
president Peter Aliesch in reference to the riots during December's World Trade
Organization meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Two police officers were injured, though not seriously, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The protests took place outside the site where President Clinton delivered a
speech to the gathered leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   After several hours and under increasingly heavy snow, the protesters
dispersed with the cry ``We'll be back!'' and some of them singing the Communist
anthem, the Internationale.
</P>
<P>
	   Swiss President Adolf Ogi criticized the skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The use of force is extremely regrettable,'' he told journalists. The
World Economic Forum, which organizes the Davos meeting, deplored that ``a
limited number of demonstrators chose violence over dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police -- although equipped with full riot gear -- kept a deliberately
nonconfrontational approach even when under assault from snowballs, blocks of
ice, ski sticks and other makeshift weapons. Only two people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite having declared a ban on all protests during Clinton's visit and
calling out troops for extra backup, authorities made no attempt to stop the
first demonstrators as they entered the long narrow main street through the
village. But they then seemed to be taken by surprise as an estimated 1,300
protesters pushed through control barriers.
</P>
<P>
	   Firing warning shots, security forces retreated to less than 500 yards from
the conference center and hotel hosting Clinton. They then barricaded off the
street with land cruisers equipped with huge metal grids to prevent further
disruption.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yankee Clinton go home,'' read one typical banner. ``Don't let the
multinationals destroy the people. Resist,'' read another.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The New Spirit of Davos. Resistance against international exploitation,''
declared another banner in reference to the conference organizers' oft-repeated
claims that it is the ``Spirit of Davos'' that attracts hundreds of global
political and business leaders each year.
</P>
<P>
	   The critics say they have the same concerns about the World Economic Forum
as about the World Trade Organization: that it is undemocratic, secretive and
only concerned with maximizing commercial profits. They say that vital deals and
decisions are struck behind closed doors with little consideration shown to
public concerns, for example on genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
	   Radical French farmers' unions, which have campaigned against McDonald's in
France and the globalization it represents and which were out in force in
Seattle, were among the protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our concerns need to be more represented in everyday public opinion,''
said Alain Pulles, one of the farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the demonstrators were clad in ski gear to escape official
attention. Others were masked and belonged to anarchist groups.
</P>
<P>
	   An AP photographer was roughed up as he took a picture of a demonstrator
felling a police officer with a cross country ski.

<HEADLINE> Some See Hope in Mysterious Preacher  </HEADLINE>
   By JOANN LOVIGLIO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAZLETON, Pa. (AP) -- He appeared out of the blue back in October, clad only
in a dirty white robe as he walked barefoot along the two-lane highway into this
struggling former coal town.
</P>
<P>
	   Folks pointed at first as the man with the shoulder-length hair and scruffy
beard preached to whoever would listen. Before long, though, many in this
largely Roman Catholic community were embracing him as a holy man.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was in the car with me and a man came up and started banging on the
window,'' said the Rev. Gerard F. Angelo, pastor of the Shrine of the Sacred
Heart of Jesus. ``He said, 'Thank you so much for what you're doing. I haven't
been to church in 25 years and now I'm going again.' His effect on people is
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
	   With hundreds of people gathering in fire halls, gymnasiums and open fields
to listen to the stranger, his presence has some worried that the community has
opened its hearts and homes too readily to someone they know little about.
</P>
<P>
	   But his supporters, fervent in their devotion, say they know all they need
to know: The soft-spoken nomad is a messenger of God.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would walk through fire for him,'' said Connie Muir, a Roman Catholic
who took him in to live with her family when it became too cold to sleep
outside. ``He's blessed by the Holy Spirit. People's hearts are really changed
after they've heard him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Though he has preached for up to six hours at a stretch, he is a man of few
words when it comes to himself.
</P>
<P>
	   In interviews, he would not divulge his birthplace or background, saying it
would detract from his message. The robe and messianic appearance, he says,
bring attention to his ministry and make him more approachable.
</P>
<P>
	   When anyone asks his name, he replies ``What's Your Name?'' He says it is
part of a Hebrew tradition to not reveal one's name to a person until you become
their friend, and it is what the locals now call him.
</P>
<P>
	   Police checked his background and found nothing of concern. He was arrested
in Greenfield, Ohio, in August after he refused to stop preaching to a crowd
that became unruly when police tried to break up the gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   He was identified in a police affidavit as Carl J. Joseph, 39.
</P>
<P>
	   The disorderly conduct charge was dismissed, and Hazleton police said they
have yet to receive any complaints about Joseph.
</P>
<P>
	   He says his nine-year trek has brought him to 47 states and 13 countries.
But never has he remained in one place for so long before.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People here have been wonderful. There's such a great need for
spirituality today,'' he said. ``People feel desolate because they have gotten
away from God and his church.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hazleton -- population 23,000 -- and other towns in the region have gone
through troubled times since the coal industry went bust decades ago. Boarded-up
storefronts line the eastern Pennsylvania city's main thoroughfare, and the
unemployment rate for Luzerne County hovers around 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Lots of people around here are hurting, and this guy is the only sign of
hope some of them have seen in a long time,'' said resident Robert Clark. ``It
worries me because people are putting all this stock in a guy who, to me, seems
like he's got a screw loose.''
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph has spoken to as many as 2,000 people at one gathering in Hazleton,
and it is not uncommon to see several dozen people standing in a field at 2 a.m.
listening to him preach.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Lesante, host of a local cable program, has had him on his show four
times -- once for a three-hour call-in special.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For three solid hours the phones were continuously lit up -- they just
rang and rang and rang,'' Lesante said.
</P>
<P>
	   His burgeoning popularity, as well as the nearly unrestricted access he has
been given in local Catholic schools and hospitals, is causing some worry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Carl has always been welcome here to pray with us,'' said Monsignor
Michael J. Delaney, pastor of St. Gabriel's Church in Hazleton. ``The unusual
element of his ministry was a concern. Being it's unusual, we also know we have
to be both welcoming and cautious -- but we wish him well in his efforts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several religious leaders declined to speak publicly, saying they did not
want to further heighten disagreements regarding Joseph within the religious
community.
</P>
<P>
	   Others say that preaching the Gospel is nothing but a good thing, pointing
out that ``What's Your Name'' is not seeking financial gain. He turns over all
money and gifts he receives to local parishes, except for sandals he received
recently because he did not own a pair of shoes.
</P>
<P>
	   As word spreads, Joseph is beginning to bring his ministry to neighboring
towns like Mahanoy City, a community of 5,000 about 20 miles southwest of
Hazleton. He has been staying at the rectory of St. Joseph's Church.
</P>
<P>
	   During a recent two-hour session at the Mahanoy City fire hall, ``What's
Your Name'' told a crowd of several hundred people not to abandon their faith.
Though he identifies himself as Roman Catholic, he says his message is for all
Christians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I encourage everyone to get into communication with God again,'' he said
as the crowd nodded in agreement. ``I've experienced so many different places,
so many different people, so many different cultures, but I've never learned
more than I have from prayer.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he will remain in the area as long as there is a need for his words.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He could be here a while, or he could be gone tomorrow,'' Muir said. ``I'd
like to see him stay around for a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Airline Expecting Some Crash Blame  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- American Airlines and one of its pilots likely
will be assigned part of the blame when federal investigators issue a report on
the June 1 airport crash that killed 11 people, an airline official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We bear a heavy responsibility here,'' said John Hotard, an airline
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded a three-day
hearing on the crash of American Airlines Flight 1420.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB won't issue a report with its determination of the probable cause
of the crash until some time later.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hotard said he expects the report will put a major share of the
responsibility on the airline and the plane's chief pilot, Richard Buschmann,
for the decision to land during a raging thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's fairly cut and dried,'' Hotard said. ``Knowing the NTSB, that may be
where they go -- that he shouldn't have landed, any way.''
</P>
<P>
	   The McDonnell-Douglas MD-82, carrying 145 passengers and crew, landed
off-center and then barreled off the end of the runway, striking metal supports
for a lighting system, breaking apart and catching fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Buschmann and 10 passengers died and 110 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Aviation experts testified Friday that the plane could have stopped on the
runway, even though it was wet and there was a steady crosswind of about 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   But the plane's braking was hindered because its spoilers -- wing panels
that help deceleration by putting more weight on the wheels -- were not
deployed, said Thomas Yager, a NASA research engineer who specializes in runway
braking.
</P>
<P>
	   Co-pilot Michael Origel has testified that he believed Buschmann set the
spoilers to deploy automatically upon landing. But Origel, whose duty it was to
confirm the task, said he could not recall the position of the spoiler handle
before the accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Instances in which spoilers have not deployed when properly set are rare,
said Robert Baker, vice chairman of American Airlines' parent company, AMR Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Experts said the plane's deceleration also was impeded because the pilots
did not apply wheel brakes until 11 seconds after touchdown -- choosing to
operate them manually rather than automatically.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the head of the NTSB reserved his harshest criticism at the
conclusion of the hearings for the emergency response team. Survivors endured 18
minutes of being pelted with hail and heavy rain before the first emergency crew
radioed that there were ``walking wounded'' and asked for a bus to take them to
shelter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to look at the cold reality of how long that response took ... and
see if maybe you all can come up with some real improvements and set a model for
the nation,'' NTSB Chairman James Hall said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Four minutes after seeing the plane touch down, an air traffic controller
called for help because he got no response from the crew. It took an additional
six minutes before firefighters realized they had gone to the wrong end of the
runway. And when firefighters got to the correct end, they had to swing around
and unlock a chained gate to reach the crash site.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire Chief Lawrence Tyner defended the department's response, saying that
the four firefighters had to drive their three trucks slowly in order to see
through the heavy rain. More firefighters arrived after they located the crash
site.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one on that night wanted to find that aircraft any quicker than those
four men,'' Tyner said. ``They did the very best they could with the information
they had.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Basque Fundraisers Arrested  </HEADLINE>
   By ADAM BROWN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- In a surprise operation in several cities, Spanish
police on Saturday arrested eight people who allegedly cooperated with gunmen
fighting for independence of the Basque region.
</P>
<P>
	   The operation, which began with 270 police officers conducting a pre-dawn
raid, was aimed at cutting off fundraising and international diplomacy efforts
of the separatist organization ETA, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ETA has waged a 32-year-old campaign to win independence for the Basque
region, which straddles the border of France and Spain. The group is believed to
have killed about 800 people since its inception.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said the operation ``practically eliminated the international
relations apparatus'' which ``gives logistical support to member and
collaborators of ETA in Europe and the Iberian peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
	   Television news TVE, citing unidentified police sources, said several of
those arrested belong to Herri Batasuna, a party widely seen as the political
wing of ETA.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Minister Margarita Mariscal de Gante said those arrested have ``a
very clear and unmistakable connection with armed bands'' and denied the
operation had political motivations against Herri Batasuna.
</P>
<P>
	   The state news agency Efe, also citing unidentified police sources, said the
arrests took place in the Basque cities of Vitoria, Tudela, Bilbao, Portugalete
and in the Madrid airport, following a two-year police investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said police also searched the homes of several of those arrested,
seizing documents.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrests come a little more than a week after a car-bomb attack, blamed
on ETA, that killed an army colonel in Madrid and sparked mass demonstrations
nationwide to call for peace. In the most recent rally, about 25,000 people
marched Saturday in the northern city of Pamplona.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, ETA announced an end to a 14-month truce, sparking fears of a
resurgence of separatist violence in Spain.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militia Kills Guerrillas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli-backed militiamen killed two guerrillas in
a clash in southern Lebanon early Saturday, militia officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of the South Lebanon Army, a 2,500-member militia supported by
Israel, said the guerrillas' bodies were retrieved and taken to the border town
of Marjayoun, where they were shown to local journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   SLA officials in Marjayoun said the guerrillas were killed in a battle with
SLA fighters around Ali Taher, one of a string of outposts along the edge of a
border zone that Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern towns from
cross-border attacks. In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman confirmed the
deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   No SLA members were hurt in the fighting, the militia officials said. There
was no immediate comment from Lebanese guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the 2,500 SLA militiamen, about 1,500 Israeli soldiers are
deployed in the border zone. Guerrillas of Hezbollah, Amal and other groups have
been fighting for years to end the occupation.

<HEADLINE> Another Pipeline in Brazil Leaks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Ten days after a disastrous oil spill polluted
Rio's Guanabara Bay, environmental officials have discovered another leaky oil
pipeline belonging to the government petroleum company Petrobras.
</P>
<P>
	   The small leak was discovered in a line near an oil refinery in Cubatao,
about 40 miles southeast of Sao Paulo, the Sao Paulo State Environmental Office
said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 52 gallons of a substance used to dilute fuel oil leaked out,
environmental engineer Maria Alencar said in a televised interview from the
site. She described the environmental impact as negligible. Still, she said,
Petrobras could be fined if investigators find the leak occurred due to
negligence or inadequate maintenance.
</P>
<P>
	   Petrobras was fined a record $28.4 million for the disastrous leak of some
338,000 gallons of crude oil from the Reduc refinery into Guanabara Bay last
week. The company got a 30 percent discount for paying the fine in cash.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil from the Reduc spill washed up on beaches and spread through
protected mangrove swamps, an important breeding ground for fish and wildlife.
The federal environmental protection agency, Ibama, said it will take the area
at least a decade to recover.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Leader Drops Party Job  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Hungarian Premier Viktor Orban on Saturday stepped
down as chairman of the leading party in Hungary's coalition government to
concentrate on running the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Orban said that in his efforts to improve conditions in Hungary he has
neglected his party, Fidesz, which he has run since 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over the past year and a half since I have been premier, I often could not
separate my work as prime minister and of party chairman,'' Orban told a party
congress convened to elect a new chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy chairman Laszlo Koever, the only candidate, was unanimously elected
to replace him.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungary's future appears promising. The country was admitted to NATO and is
a frontrunner for European Union membership. But the popularity of Orban's
center-right government has steadily declined.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My task will be to coordinate party work ... and to prepare it for the
2002 general elections, so that it (will) be strong enough to win again,''
Koever said after the party congress.

<HEADLINE> Ice Storm Hits Atlanta Area  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The second ice storm in a week made highways treacherous
Saturday, leaving the pavement so slippery in places people couldn't stand, let
alone drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Cars slid into police cars and trucks trying to clear the roads, and
ice-covered overpasses and interchanges were shut down across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Another storm earlier in the week had knocked out electrical service to
thousands of customers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just happened so suddenly,'' said state Department of Transportation
spokeswoman Kim Law. ``You look out your window and not see any ice on the trees
and assume it's OK. Well, it's anything but.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ice was blamed for a 47-car pileup at the junction of Interstate 20 and
Interstates 75/85 in downtown Atlanta. Later, 12 other cars slid into each other
on I-20. One traffic death in the state was blamed on the ice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had (vehicles) slide into 10 of our officer's cars,'' said DeKalb
County Police spokeswoman Mikki Jones. ``Everyone needs to slow down. We're
seeing people try to drive 70 miles an hour on the interstate.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the weather system turned up the East Coast, storm advisories were posted
Saturday across South and North Carolina, where residents were still digging out
after last week's record snowfall of 20 inches. An ice storm warning was in
effect for northeastern Alabama.
</P>
<P>
	   The same storm had dropped more than a foot of snow in areas across the
Plains and the South and was blamed for three deaths in Arkansas, one in
Louisiana and five in Missouri. A 14-year-old boy died in a sledding accident
near Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   Rick Cantrell and John Schifko hoped to see Atlanta's sights after driving
from St. Louis for the Super Bowl, but watching drivers not used to ice trying
to maneuver on the slick pavement made them think again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is child's play compared to what we get in St. Louis, but the worst
hazard is everyone else,'' Cantrell said. ``We saw people going too fast on the
interstate and spin out left and right.''
</P>
<P>
	   The storm also iced roads in Kentucky on Saturday, forcing police to close a
10-mile section of Interstate 75. ``It's utter chaos this morning, brother,''
said State Police Sgt. Russ Harney in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
	   In Lexington, Ky., Ken Kurtz, 70, and his wife were out shopping when the
sleet began.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hit the parking lot with clear windows, and by the time we came out 25
minutes later every window was coated with ice,'' Kurtz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Temperatures in the 40s were forecast for Super Bowl Sunday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until it does melt off, we are begging people to stay off the roads,''
said Ken Davis of the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. ``We are doing
everything we can to get things in order for the game, but Mother Nature may not
cooperate.''

<HEADLINE> Judge orders, and advocates agree, notice limits must be enforced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - When a federal judge last week ordered tougher
limits on the release of information about sex offenders, advocates of Megan's
Law were not surprised.
<P>
	   Maureen Kanka, mother of the slain girl for whom Megan's law is named, said
she even supports aspects of the ruling condemning leaks of the information
intended to be delivered door-to-door to carefully proscribed neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, Kanka said she wants New Jersey to get to work on a tougher law
that includes Internet Web site listings of all sex offenders for all parents to
see.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, Megan's Law provides for door-to-door notification when the
highest risk offenders move in or get out of prison. When offenders are deemed
to pose a moderate risk, only officials at schools, daycare centers and
facilities with custody of children receive the notification.
</P>
<P>
	   Kanka's daughter, 7-year-old Megan, was killed in 1994 by a convicted sex
offender who lived across the street but whose criminal past was a secret to his
Hamilton Township neighbors. This triggered a spate of Megan's Laws in
legislatures across the United States and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Joseph Irenas cited the case of a sex offender
notification document that was leaked to a Middlesex County newspaper that
published the details, including a map of where the offender lived.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also cited the case of a school principal who received a
sex-offender notification at home, photocopied it and distributed it at her
school, which was outside the zone of notification.
</P>
<P>
	   Less dramatic cases involve teachers sending sex offender notices home with
the children, or stacks of notices being left at the office of a daycare center
for all to take - including parents picking up children.
</P>
<P>
	   Irenas said, "A system of distributing this information with zero leakage to
unauthorized persons is, in reality, unattainable."
</P>
<P>
	   "However, the mandate for the attorney general is not to devise a perfect
system, but one calculated to achieve the goals of the statute without
unreasonably impinging on the nontrivial privacy interests of the plaintiffs.
The record before (me) shows that the current system fails to meet this
standard."
</P>
<P>
	   Irenas attached to his ruling an order to have all sex offender
notifications stopped if Attorney General John Farmer does not appeal or if the
federal appeals court agrees. Farmer's spokesman, Roger Shatzkin, said no
decision had been made by Friday on how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Barocas, one of the chief lawyers for sex offender cases in the Public
Defenders office, has argued that these sorts of problems mean Megan's Law
cannot function within the confines of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   State and federal courts have required limits because a convicted felon who
is out of prison is entitled to some degree of the privacy all other citizens
enjoy in their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Kanka said she had anticipated such problems and is confident they can be
addressed. So is victim's advocate James O'Brien, director of the Victims of
Violent Crime Compensation Board.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brien and Kanka served on a 1995 task force that developed guidelines for
Megan's Law. Both said once the area of a neighborhood to be notified about the
presence of a sex offender has been defined, the delivery of these notices must
be careful. It is not supposed to be splashed all over schools, supermarket
bulletin boards or the front pages of local newspapers, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the judge's (opinion) is excellent to that extent," O'Brien said.
"That was something that our panel didn't want, either. I don't think we paid
less attention to the uniformity than we needed to, but it is just a case when
you have 21 different departments operating under certain guidelines, you are
going to have some diversity to it."
</P>
<P>
	   Morris County prosecutor John Dangler, head of the association representing
all prosecutors, said sex offender notifications are difficult to control, but
added it can be done with sufficient public education.
</P>
<P>
	   "The court recognized the problem: How do you disseminate information to the
public that is supposed to be kept private? One doesn't go with the other,"
Dangler said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dangler said every agency he knows is enforcing the limits as vigorously as
they can.
</P>
<P>
	   "But it is a very different matter for me as a prosecutor or anyone else to
keep you from, after work, going out for a few drinks or going home or whatever,
and saying to someone, 'Hey, you know that guy at the corner..."'

<HEADLINE> Gore Changes Abortion Position  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore retracted his 13-year-old
statement equating abortion to ``the taking of a human life'' as he scrambled
Saturday to keep the issue, a traditional stumbling block for Republicans, from
tripping him up against Democrat Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, my position has changed,'' Gore said. ``I strongly support a woman's
right to choose and if (Bradley) disputes that, then he is making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley began airing a new television ad in the state Saturday in which the
former New Jersey senator calls himself the only presidential candidate who
``has been pro-choice for everyone all the time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in Manchester, Bradley said, ``I was pro-choice from the day I
entered politics. ... It's not an issue you can dance around. ''
</P>
<P>
	   The topic clearly was on Gore's mind as he answered reporters' questions
about his own congressional record while strolling through Milford's snowy town
square.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who represented Tennessee in the House from 1977-85 and the Senate
from 1985-93, was asked if he still believes, as he wrote a constituent in 1987,
that abortion ``is the taking of a human life.''
</P>
<P>
	   He was quick to note he had qualified that statement: ``I didn't write that.
I didn't. I used the word 'arguably,' and yes, my position has changed. I would
not use that phrasing today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said the only abortion matter with which he had wrestled in the past
was whether public money should help pay for abortions for poor women -- the
Medicaid funding for abortions he says he now supports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've always supported keeping abortion legal and I've always been attacked
by the anti-choice groups for that position since the beginning of my career,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the National Right to Life Committee gave Gore an 84 percent
approval rating for anti-abortion votes he cast while in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League
rated Gore's House career decidedly ``anti-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among the 30 votes the group scored against Gore was his ``yea'' in 1984 to
define the word ``person'' under four existing civil rights laws to include
``unborn children from the moment of conception.'' The organization
characterized that as a move toward an ``all out prohibition on abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nancy Greaney, a Gore supporter and former teacher from Bedford, was
surprised to learn of Gore's past votes but said, ``I'd never hold them against
him.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people's opinions and beliefs evolve,'' Greaney said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellie Bofman, an undecided Democrat who shook hands with Gore in the Milford
square Saturday, was conflicted about reports of Gore's abortion record.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think its a crime to change your mind, but I wish more politicians
would admit they changed their mind,'' the retired teacher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the case, Bofman added, Bradley ``demeaned Gores character by
implying he lied.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had cornered Gore in debate on Wednesday, pressing him to concede
his inconsistency on abortion rights. In the days since, the vice president has
faced more questions about his record.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley orchestrated the debate question and follow-up TV commercial in a
drive to undercut Gore's support among women and reverse his own slip in polls
in time for Tuesday's first-in-the-nation primary.
</P>
<P>
	   A front page article Friday in The Boston Globe, the newspaper with the
biggest New Hampshire circulation, questioned the veracity of Gore's statement
in debate that he ``had always been for a woman's right to choose.'' Asked
Friday afternoon about the morning paper's story, Gore, a former journalist and
avid news reader, said he had not seen it.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman caller to New Hampshire public radio the same day told Gore on-air:
``I understand if you've changed your position in your career but ... I don't
know how I can support your candidacy if you're dishonest about such an
important subject and especially on national television.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign responded by producing a testimonial from feminist Gloria
Steinem and signatures from 42 members of Congress in an ``open letter'' stating
what Gore once had counted on being obvious in this election: ``Al Gore is
pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   That letter was e-mailed to hundreds of political reporters and passed
around a state Democratic party dinner Friday night. It was followed by a list
of 300 New Hampshire women pledging their support for Gore, in part, because of
his commitment to women's health and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane called the sudden flurry of paper ``an effort to
help the press,'' and said Gore would continue to focus on issues such as
Medicaid, Medicare and education, where he differs widely with Bradley.

<HEADLINE> Bush Brings Parents Into Campaign  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush, who would be president,
campaigned for the first time Saturday alongside his father, who once was, as
the field of White House hopefuls plowed toward this week's leadoff New
Hampshire primary. Bill Bradley charged Al Gore was trying to ``dance around''
earlier qualms about abortion as he bid to cut into the vice president's core
Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
	   With the polls pointing to a tight finish, at least on the Republican side,
Sen. John McCain mocked Bush's endgame strategy as ``quick, get me another
endorsement'' from the GOP establishment. People lining up behind the
front-runner now are ``the same ones running our party in 1996 and 1998, when we
lost elections,'' said the Arizona senator, who has come from far back in the
pack to within striking distance of victory in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who has moved past Bradley in recent polls, sought to blunt his
rival's attack on his position on abortion and his credibility. Asked whether he
would call abortion ``arguably the taking of human life,'' as he wrote to a
constituent 1987, the vice president said, ``I would not use that phrasing
today.''
</P>
<P>
	   He quickly added, though, that ``on the narrow question, I've always
supported Roe v. Wade. I've always supported keeping abortion legal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, who finished a strong second in last week's Iowa caucuses,
Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer all made their rounds on the campaign's final weekend,
hoping for surprises in Tuesday's vote that would catapult them into the thick
of the GOP race. Forbes released new radio commercials attacking Bush for
failing to be a firm enough foe of abortion, and for overseeing a big increase
in spending in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowds were bigger Saturday, the political theater more entertaining, as
New Hampshire voters prepared to render their verdict. A man stood on a
Manchester street corner, wearing a Bill Clinton mask and waving a Bush placard.
His presence on a wind-whipped day underscored that this begins the flood of
primaries that will lead to election of the current president's successor.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, after months of campaigning and thousands of candidate speeches, not
everyone was ready to declare a preference. ``I'm slow to make my decision,''
said Robi Jackson, 57, of Portsmouth, who described herself as leaning toward
Bush. ``My feeling is they all have wonderful ideas, but when you get to
Washington, well, you know what they say: `Talk is cheap.'''
</P>
<P>
	   A Bush victory Tuesday would cement his credentials as front-runner and
damage, if not cripple, McCain's ability to sustain his challenge. The Texas
governor began his day in Portsmouth, where he appeared before one of the
largest crowds he's seen thus far, an estimated 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   From there, he went to Milford, where he posed for a Bush family political
appearance. Father George Bush, mother Barbara and other family members flanked
him, joined as well by Elizabeth Dole, the wife of the 1996 presidential nominee
and herself a campaign dropout this time around.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This boy, this son of ours, is not going to let you down,'' promised the
former president -- who ran three times in the New Hampshire primary and won
twice. ``He's going to go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I heard my family was coming up here to knock on doors it gave me
that extra impetus to keep charging in New Hampshire,'' said his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Aboard McCain's campaign bus, the candidate said the GOP establishment ``has
become more and more alarmed'' at the possibility of his victory. ``We've
interfered with a coronation.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic race, Bradley unveiled a new television ad that said of
abortion, ``This is the kind of issue that you can't straddle.'' Campaigning
during the day, the former New Jersey senator said, ``I was pro-choice from the
day I entered politics, and I will always be pro-choice. It's not an issue you
can dance around.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said in campaign debate last week that he had once opposed federal
funding for abortions under Medicaid but had otherwise always been for abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, my position has changed,'' Gore said. ``I strongly support a woman's
right to choose, and if (Bradley) disputes that, then he is making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer plunged into the Democratic dispute, questioning Gore's candor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I almost fell off my chair ... when I saw Al Gore deny that he had ever
been pro-life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When it comes to an issue this profound, a politician that plays games on
something involving life and death I think loses all credibility to aspire to
the White House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes said he doesn't plan any abrupt change in strategy in the final days
of a race that looks bleak for him. ``I think one of the things most important
for us is to walk the walk with integrity. It's dictated by the fact that I
think this is what the country needs,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kofi Annan Praises Russia's Putin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan praised Russia's acting
President Vladimir Putin on Saturday as ``businesslike and decisive,'' despite
their differences over Moscow's war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin ``came across as someone who had facts, who was businesslike and
decisive, and had a sense of where he wants to go,'' Annan said Saturday. ``In
this dynamic and fast-changing world these qualities are very useful in his
dealings with other leaders around the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two met Friday for a few hours, and spoke about the Chechnya campaign,
which Putin has spearheaded.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Annan held talks with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Russian
Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II before leaving for New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan said the visit helped him understand the magnitude of the Chechnya
problem, though he still wants to see negotiations and an end to the war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one can support or encourage terrorism,'' he said Saturday, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency. But ``the means we use should be proportional and
appropriate. And all measures should be taken to ensure that civilians do not
get caught in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
	   International leaders have accused Russia of using indiscriminate force in
Chechnya, citing high civilian casualties and the 250,000 refugees. Russia
insists it is targeting only rebel positions, and says the offensive is aimed at
rooting out Chechen militants blamed for terrorist acts in Russia.

<HEADLINE> Gore Changes Abortion Position  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore retracted his 13-year-old
statement equating abortion to ``the taking of a human life'' as he scrambled
Saturday to keep the issue, a traditional stumbling block for Republicans, from
tripping him up against Democrat Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, my position has changed,'' Gore said. ``I strongly support a woman's
right to choose and if (Bradley) disputes that, then he is making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley began airing a new television ad in the state Saturday in which the
former New Jersey senator calls himself the only presidential candidate who
``has been pro-choice for everyone all the time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in Manchester, Bradley said, ``I was pro-choice from the day I
entered politics. ... It's not an issue you can dance around. ''
</P>
<P>
	   The topic clearly was on Gore's mind as he answered reporters' questions
about his own congressional record while strolling through Milford's snowy town
square.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who represented Tennessee in the House from 1977-85 and the Senate
from 1985-93, was asked if he still believes, as he wrote a constituent in 1987,
that abortion ``is the taking of a human life.''
</P>
<P>
	   He was quick to note he had qualified that statement: ``I didn't write that.
I didn't. I used the word 'arguably,' and yes, my position has changed. I would
not use that phrasing today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said the only abortion matter with which he had wrestled in the past
was whether public money should help pay for abortions for poor women -- the
Medicaid funding for abortions he says he now supports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've always supported keeping abortion legal and I've always been attacked
by the anti-choice groups for that position since the beginning of my career,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the National Right to Life Committee gave Gore an 84 percent
approval rating for anti-abortion votes he cast while in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League
rated Gore's House career decidedly ``anti-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among the 30 votes the group scored against Gore was his ``yea'' in 1984 to
define the word ``person'' under four existing civil rights laws to include
``unborn children from the moment of conception.'' The organization
characterized that as a move toward an ``all out prohibition on abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nancy Greaney, a Gore supporter and former teacher from Bedford, was
surprised to learn of Gore's past votes but said, ``I'd never hold them against
him.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people's opinions and beliefs evolve,'' Greaney said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellie Bofman, an undecided Democrat who shook hands with Gore in the Milford
square Saturday, was conflicted about reports of Gore's abortion record.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think its a crime to change your mind, but I wish more politicians
would admit they changed their mind,'' the retired teacher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the case, Bofman added, Bradley ``demeaned Gores character by
implying he lied.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had cornered Gore in debate on Wednesday, pressing him to concede
his inconsistency on abortion rights. In the days since, the vice president has
faced more questions about his record.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley orchestrated the debate question and follow-up TV commercial in a
drive to undercut Gore's support among women and reverse his own slip in polls
in time for Tuesday's first-in-the-nation primary.
</P>
<P>
	   A front page article Friday in The Boston Globe, which has a large
circulation in New Hampshire, questioned the veracity of Gore's statement in
debate that he ``had always been for a woman's right to choose.'' Asked Friday
afternoon about the morning paper's story, Gore, a former journalist and avid
news reader, said he had not seen it.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman caller to New Hampshire public radio the same day told Gore on-air:
``I understand if you've changed your position in your career but ... I don't
know how I can support your candidacy if you're dishonest about such an
important subject and especially on national television.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign responded by producing a testimonial from feminist Gloria
Steinem and signatures from 42 members of Congress in an ``open letter'' stating
what Gore once had counted on being obvious in this election: ``Al Gore is
pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   That letter was e-mailed to hundreds of political reporters and passed
around a state Democratic party dinner Friday night. It was followed by a list
of 300 New Hampshire women pledging their support for Gore, in part, because of
his commitment to women's health and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane called the sudden flurry of paper ``an effort to
help the press,'' and said Gore would continue to focus on issues such as
Medicaid, Medicare and education, where he differs widely with Bradley.

<HEADLINE> Murder one verdict returned in kill-for-hire case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ELIZABETHTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - A jury has found an Essex County man guilty
of a murder-for-hire plot in which his wife died of drowning after water was
forced down her throat in the couple's Lake Placid home.
<P>
	   Saturday afternoon's verdict means Jeffrey Glanda, 49, could face the death
penalty or life in prison for first-degree murder. The jury began deliberations
Friday afternoon after a 14-day trial filled with testimony of a marriage torn
apart and grisly details of the beating that led to the death of Jeannine
Glanda.
</P>
<P>
	   The body of 39-year-old Jeannine Glanda was discovered in August 1997 in a
Ford Explorer that was partially submerged in a nearby lake. According to
testimony, Glanda offered his landscaper, a long-time friend named Nicholas
Pecararo, $15,000, a new pickup truck and a snowmobile to help commit the
murder.
</P>
<P>
	   In his closing argument Friday, lead defense counsel Dennis Schlenker
attacked the testimony of Pecararo and Julius Elmore - the prosecutions star
witnesses - calling them "the most despicable human beings" he ever met,
according to the Plattsburgh Press-Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Pecararo said he was 15 years old when he met the defendant and did
landscaping work around Glanda's home. Pecararo testified that he and Glanda
attacked and killed Mrs. Glanda. But the defense tried to argue that Pecararo
committed the murder and lied to skirt the death penalty, saying that someone
else killed the woman.
</P>
<P>
	   District Attorney Ronald Briggs in closing arguments Friday described the
breakdown of the Glandas' relationship in 1994, their separation and how Mr.
Glanda offered Plattsburgh auto mechanic Donald Hilborn $10,000 in 1996 to kill
Mrs. Glanda.
</P>
<P>
	   Briggs then fast-forwarded to 1997, citing Pecararo's testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Pecararo testified that after Glanda attacked his wife in her home he
shocked her with a stun gun while Pecararo held her.
</P>
<P>
	   Glanda then beat her and poured large amounts of water down her throat until
she died, authorities said. Glanda ordered Pecararo to have sex with her, but he
refused, Pecararo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Glanda "is a court reporter who knows about DNA evidence" and was trying to
frame Pecararo, Briggs said. DNA evidence from sexual contact could identify the
attacker.
</P>
<P>
	   Pecararo said he took the body to upper Cascade Lake in Keene and dumped it
and her Ford Explorer into the lake.
</P>
<P>
	   Kimberly Musgrove testified she heard the splash when the Explorer hit, and
Kevin Reynolds said he found Mrs. Glanda's purse and some personal belongings on
Route 73 near where her body was found.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical examiner couldn't estimate the moment of death, but ruled that
she died by being strangled and having water poured down her throat.
</P>
<P>
	   Briggs said Pecararo testified because he felt guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   "The defendant could control Nicholas Pecararo's actions but could not
control his soul," Briggs told the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Briggs argued that Glanda told Hilborn and Pecararo the same thing,
specifically that he wanted Mrs. Glanda dead and it had to look like an accident
to collect on the insurance money.
</P>
<P>
	   Glanda had taken out three insurance policies on his wife, the last one 18
days before her death, according to testimony. The husband would have received
$130,000 through the policies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Money is the oldest motive in the world," Briggs said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday, state Supreme Court Justice G. Thomas Moynihan instructed the jury
to ignore testimony from Mrs. Glanda's divorce attorney, William Cantwell. He
had said he was working on custody papers for Mrs. Glanda four weeks before his
client's death.
</P>
<P>
	   Glanda faces the death penalty or life without parole when he is sentenced.

<HEADLINE> Detained Researcher Returns to U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By BILL BERGSTROM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A college librarian held in China for nearly six months
on charges of smuggling state secrets returned to the United States on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``During the past 30 years, I never cried, but last night I cried all
night,'' said Song Yongyi, looking tired but smiling broadly as he arrived at
Philadelphia International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Song was detained in August and later charged under China's vague secrets
law. He had been collecting newspapers and documents concerning the Cultural
Revolution, the period from 1966 to 1976 when Mao Tse-Tung unleashed a wave of
violence against opponents and a million people were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Song, who is from Shanghai, spent five years in prison during that time,
accused of being a ``counterrevolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
	   He moved to the United States in 1989, earned master's degrees in Chinese
literature and library science and has worked at Dickinson College since 1997.
He has written articles and a book in Chinese on the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Song received the unexpected news that he was being released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am feeling very tired because during the last 36 hours I never got
sleep,'' Song said before heading home to Carlisle, 110 miles west of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   He praised his wife, Helen Yao, for helping organize a campaign among
academics for his release. More than 100 China scholars in the United States and
elsewhere petitioned Chinese President Jiang Zemin, saying Song was engaged in
normal academic work, not espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Song said the items he collected had all been published, he was
accused by the Chinese Foreign Ministry of ``purchasing or illegally supplying
intelligence'' to people outside China.
</P>
<P>
	   China's ambassador to the United States, Li Zhao Xing, said Friday that Song
was released as a show of leniency after he ``admitted all the facts related to
his criminal activities ... and also voluntarily revealed evidence against
illegal activities of others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Song said he admitted nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In China we have a saying that the small officer gives small lie, bigger
officer gives bigger lie and the state department gives the biggest lie. In my
case, it's exactly true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he was tormented but not physically abused during his detention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They didn't touch me physically. But I should say they mentally touched
me. It is very ruthless,'' Song said. ``For instance, they not only arrested me,
at the same time they arrested my wife. My wife knows nothing about my project.
She is an artist.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yao had been detained with her husband on Aug. 7, but was released in
November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every time they question me, they always say, 'Your wife said such and
such, your wife identified such,''' Song said. ``So I take them seriously. I
say, 'I believe this is not true, bring my wife in.' Then they suddenly say,
'OK, we'll move to the next topic.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Song, who suffers from colon cancer, said the Chinese denied his requests to
see a doctor. He planned to arrange a physical examination on his return home.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Penn., who has introduced a bill to grant Song U.S.
citizenship, said he thought the release was an effort to smooth U.S.-Chinese
relations. China would like Congress to stop reviewing its low-tariff trading
privileges annually and grant the rights permanently as part of a deal to join
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   ``China's record has not been good on human rights,'' Specter said. ``If
China wants to be a respected member of the community of nations, they have to
respect human rights.''

<HEADLINE> Rep. Burton: Elian Wants To Stay  </HEADLINE>
   By MADELINE BARO DIAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- About 200 chanting, flag-waving protesters marched in front of
INS headquarters Saturday, demanding that 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez be sent home
to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Dan Burton, whose congressional maneuvering to keep Elian in the
United States has infuriated the boy's father, said Saturday that the 6-year-old
told him he doesn't want to go back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a very intelligent young man and I was able to ask him without any
coaching a couple of questions,'' the Indiana Republican said after meeting for
30 minutes with Elian at the home where the boy is staying with relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first question I asked him is how did he like living here and he said
he liked it very much as he was blowing bubbles. And then I said `Would you like
to go back to Cuba?' And he was very firm in saying 'No' and this without any
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the subject of heated debate since he was found clinging to
an inner tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast. His mother and 10 others traveling
with him drowned during an effort to leave Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers were expected to continue a tour of the United States,
where they have been campaigning for Elian's return, Cuba's Prensa Latina news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, the protesters at the Immigration and Naturalization Service
office yelled ``Send Elian Home'' as a small plane towing a banner with the same
slogan passed overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban-Americans among the group said they wanted to show that not all
Cuban-Americans want Elian to remain here. They said the 6-year-old had been
kidnapped and should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every child needs a father and a mother,'' said Juan Morales, a Cuban who
has lived in the United States for eight years. ``If the mother dies, the person
directly responsible is the father and not the uncle and not the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Andres Gomez, national coordinator of the Antonio Maceo Brigade, a group
that organized the protest and advocates normalizing relations with Cuba, said
the demonstrators have a noble purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are coming together in this case in defense of the most fundamental
rights of a human being, which are the rights of a child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Saturday, the anti-Castro Democracy Movement, a group which wants
Elian to stay put, launched a flotilla of about 20 boats to pay tribute to
Elian's mother and the 10 others who drowned. About 300 people, including about
200 aboard boats, took part.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators released balloons into the air and threw flowers into the
water as the American and Cuban national anthems played. Donato Dalrymple, a
fisherman who found Elian floating at sea, tossed a wreath with flowers arranged
in the pattern of the Cuban flag into the water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today we're here to remember ... the mother of Elian Gonzalez, Elisabeth
Brotons, and the other people who drowned in the unfortunate tragedy,'' said
Ramon Saul Sanchez, the leader of the Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled Elian should return to his father. But its order has not
been carried out because the government agreed to hold off until a federal court
considers a challenge filed by the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler originally said he would hear arguments
March 6 on whether the relative's lawsuit should be dismissed. But on Friday, he
moved that day up to Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to block Elian's return to Cuba, Burton earlier this month
subpoenaed the boy to appear before the House Government Reform Committee, which
he chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Elian's father expressed outrage. ``What right does that man
have?'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said. ``Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton said it is unlikely that Elian will actually appear before the
committee, but he didn't rule that out entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department asserts that if Elian is not returned to Cuba, it
could hurt attempts to retrieve American children taken out of the country by a
foreign-born parent against the wishes of the child's American parent.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton said the situations are not identical.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are talking about people who are leaving a totalitarian, communist
state,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dozens Protest Anthrax Vaccine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Dozens of people demonstrated Saturday outside Dover Air
Force Base, where a pilot who has refused to take a mandatory series of
injections against anthrax faces a possible court-martial.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Sonnie Bates, 35, is believed to be the highest-ranking officer in the
Air Force to face the possibility of a court-martial for refusing to take the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
	   The military has ordered all of its 2.4 million reserve and active-duty
soldiers, sailors and airmen to be inoculated as a defense against biological
warfare. Several have been prosecuted for refusing the shots, which the military
says are safe.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters carried signs which read: ``Free Major Bates'' and ``My husband
will take a bullet for America but not the Anthrax vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people who refuse this vaccine are being raped of the same civil
rights they fight to protect,'' said Gloria Webb of Ellendale, south of Dover.
</P>
<P>
	   Louise Rempfer of Suffield, Conn., said her husband, once a National Guard
Major and a pilot, resigned his commission rather than take a vaccine he feels
is unsafe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am here in support of my husband and to show support for Maj. Bates,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The group of about 35 protesters, including Bates' wife, Roxane, marched
past the base's north gate, which was closed as they passed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These people had a right to express themselves,'' said base spokesman Maj.
Frank Smolinsky. ``Freedom of speech is one of the things the military fights to
protect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Smolinsky said the policy of mandatory vaccinations would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We absolutely stand behind the vaccination procedure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After about 20 minutes, the protesters were asked to clear the gate by
military police.
</P>
<P>
	   Bates has said he won't take the injections because he believes the
Department of Defense can't guarantee he won't become permanently disabled by
sickness from the shots.
</P>
<P>
	   An investigating officer is to hold a hearing this week at the base to
determine whether Bates should face a court-martial for disobeying an order.
</P>
<P>
	   Bates could face up to five years in a military prison, the loss of his
rank, and the loss of the military pension he has worked to gather for the
nearly 14 years he has served as a pilot.

<HEADLINE> IMF To Probe Ukraine Fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund will investigate
new allegations of possible misuse of its funds in Ukraine, a top IMF official
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanley Fischer, the IMF's first deputy managing director, said the fund's
officials are confident that they have a clear picture of the current state of
Ukraine's finances. But he said the organization will look into allegations that
IMF funds were misappropriated.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the Financial Times reported that former Ukrainian Prime Minister
Pavlo Lazarenko has offered to testify that Ukraine's present government
misappropriated millions of dollars in IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have no evidence that it happened,'' Fischer said Saturday in Davos,
where the World Economic Forum is being held.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we nonetheless had better check, and we will do that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lazarenko, who is wanted in Switzerland on money laundering charges and is
in custody in the United States, has been in contact with several U.S. lawmakers
about the possibility of testifying before a House committee, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazarenko, who led Ukraine's government in 1996-97, is seeking political
asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The IMF and Ukraine are negotiating a $2.5 billion loan program that was
suspended last summer after the country failed to meet economic targets.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate development, Fischer shook hands with Argentina's president,
Fernando de la Rua, on a deal for a three-year, $7.4 billion loan package for
the South American country.
</P>
<P>
	   There was ``agreement on the principles and details of the program,'' with
just a few technicalities left to sort out, Fischer said at an annual conference
of political and business leaders in the Alpine resort of Davos.
</P>
<P>
	   Fischer said Argentina's president had taken ``very impressive structural
measures,'' including labor market and social security reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, European officials and economists at the gathering also discussed
the weakness of Europe's common currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   French Finance Minister Christian Sautter said Saturday that he hopes
currency markets will soon take notice of economic recovery in the 11 countries
that have switched to the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   That performance ``isn't perceived sufficiently,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Law Makes Egyption Divorce Easier  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A 32-year-old housewife became the first woman to file
for divorce under a new law that makes it easier for Egyptian women to leave
their husbands.
</P>
<P>
	   Wafa Mosaad Gabr, who had been trying to end her marriage for three years,
filed for divorce because she simply didn't want to live with her husband,
El-Sayyed Mohammed Ibrahim, a 38-year old farmer, the woman's lawyer said. The
lawyer, Mostafa Eid, did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The law, which had faced strong opposition in male-dominated and
overwhelmingly Muslim Egypt, was passed by the country's People's Assembly
Wednesday night and approved by President Hosni Mubarak on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The new legislation makes it easier for women to obtain a divorce, though
the process remains more difficult for women than it is for men. Islamic law
gives men the right to divorce their wives anytime and without the approval of a
court or any other authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the old law, women had to prove that physical or psychological harm
was caused by husbands to obtain a divorce.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, women must only declare before a court that they want a divorce. Judges
will give the couple three months to try and reconcile and six months if they
have children. An immediate divorce will be granted at the end of the trial
period if they don't change their minds.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new law, women who divorce their husbands must return their
dowries and relinquish all financial claims, including alimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Gabr, who got married in 1986, had previously asked her husband to divorce
her, Eid said.
</P>
<P>
	   If Gabr gets her divorce, she will return the equivalent of $30, which her
husband paid as a dowry. But for her three children, she would still get child
support payments, which are not affected under the new law.
</P>
<P>
	   The first hearing in the case is set for March 14.

<HEADLINE> Judge Nixes Indefinite INS Jailing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Another federal judge has ruled that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service cannot indefinitely hold immigrants who have been ordered
deported for crimes but whose native countries refuse to accept them.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter's ruling affects 130 legal immigrants
being held at detention centers in central California who already have served
prison time for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatter said the policy violates the immigrants' rights to due process.
Concluding that they pose a flight risk or danger is not sufficient reason to
detain them for what amounts to the rest of their lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has agreed to review a similar ruling
by a federal judge in Seattle. That case is scheduled to be argued next month,
but a decision likely is several months away.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationwide, the INS holds about 3,800 people in indefinite custody for
crimes ranging from petty theft to murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The practice has been upheld by federal judges in San Diego and Nevada, and
by federal appeals courts in New Orleans and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatter's ruling Thursday was hailed by civil liberties groups that have
criticized the INS policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a resounding rejection of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service argument that they can hold someone forever,'' said Lucas Guttentag,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The court recognized that the purpose of immigration detention is to
effectuate deportation, not to sentence someone to life in prison,'' Guttentag
said.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Burton: Elian Wants To Stay  </HEADLINE>
   By MADELINE BARO DIAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- About 200 chanting, flag-waving protesters marched in front of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service's office Saturday, demanding that
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez be sent home to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Dan Burton, whose congressional maneuvering to keep Elian in the
United States has infuriated the boy's father, said Saturday that the boy told
him he doesn't want to go back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a very intelligent young man and I was able to ask him without any
coaching a couple of questions,'' the Indiana Republican said after meeting for
30 minutes with Elian at the home where the boy is staying with relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first question I asked him is how did he like living here and he said
he liked it very much as he was blowing bubbles. And then I said `Would you like
to go back to Cuba?' And he was very firm in saying 'No' and this without any
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the subject of heated debate since he was found clinging to
an inner tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast. His mother and 10 others traveling
with him drowned during an effort to leave Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers were expected to continue a tour of the United States,
where they have been campaigning for Elian's return, Cuba's Prensa Latina news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, the protesters at the INS office yelled ``Send Elian Home'' as a
small plane towing a banner with the same slogan passed overhead.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban-Americans among the group said they wanted to show that not all
Cuban-Americans want Elian to remain here. They said the boy had been kidnapped
and should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every child needs a father and a mother,'' said Juan Morales, a Cuban who
has lived in the United States for eight years. ``If the mother dies, the person
directly responsible is the father and not the uncle and not the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Andres Gomez, national coordinator of the Antonio Maceo Brigade, a group
that organized the protest and advocates normalizing relations with Cuba, said
the demonstrators have a noble purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are coming together in this case in defense of the most fundamental
rights of a human being, which are the rights of a child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Saturday, the anti-Castro Democracy Movement, a group which wants
Elian to stay put, launched a flotilla of about 20 boats to pay tribute to
Elian's mother and the 10 others who drowned. About 300 people, including about
200 aboard boats, took part.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators released balloons into the air and threw flowers into the
water as the American and Cuban national anthems played. Donato Dalrymple, a
fisherman who found Elian floating at sea, tossed a wreath with flowers arranged
in the pattern of the Cuban flag into the water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today we're here to remember ... the mother of Elian Gonzalez, Elisabeth
Brotons, and the other people who drowned in the unfortunate tragedy,'' said
Ramon Saul Sanchez, the leader of the Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled Elian should return to his father. But its order has not
been carried out because the government agreed to hold off until a federal court
considers a challenge filed by the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler originally said he would hear arguments
March 6 on whether the relative's lawsuit should be dismissed. But on Friday, he
moved that day up to Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to block Elian's return to Cuba, Burton earlier this month
subpoenaed the boy to appear before the House Government Reform Committee, which
he chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, Elian's father expressed outrage. ``What right does that man
have?'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said. ``Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton said it is unlikely that Elian will actually appear before the
committee, but he didn't rule that out entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department asserts that if Elian is not returned to Cuba, it
could hurt attempts to retrieve American children taken out of the country by a
foreign-born parent against the wishes of the child's American parent.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton said the situations are not identical.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are talking about people who are leaving a totalitarian, communist
state,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak Meeting Announced  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat will meet this week amid fading hopes for concluding the
outline of a peace agreement by the deadline they set, Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they don't meet it, they'll reach some understanding about how to deal
with that problem,'' a senior U.S. official said Saturday after a 30-minute
meeting between Arafat and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement was the frankest admission yet that American mediators are
likely to fall short of their target for a basic understanding about the future
of Jerusalem, whether there will be a Palestinian state and other knotty issues
at the core of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The Barak-Arafat meeting will be held Thursday or Friday at Erez, a border
crossing between Israel and Palestinian-held Gaza, and will focus on the major
unresolved issues, said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   He described the pursuit of the deadline as a formidable challenge. ``It's
very difficult to get there,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no American claims of progress after Clinton saw Arafat in the
Steigenberger Hotel Belvedere in this Swiss ski resort. They were among scores
of world leaders attending an international economic forum.
</P>
<P>
	   It was their second meeting in nine days. Nor was progress claimed after the
last one, at the White House in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department announced Thursday that senior U.S. mediator Dennis
Ross would go to the Middle East to help in the search for a settlement. Ross is
due in Israel on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lower-ranking Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are to hold intensive
talks early this week at Israel's Red Sea resort Eilat.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has appealed to the two sides to seek less than 100 percent of their
demands. He said a settlement requires as much.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in her own flurry of diplomacy in
Davos, saw King Abdullah of Jordan for 45 minutes Saturday night, and was to
confer with Arafat and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   She then travels to Moscow, where she has separate meetings scheduled Monday
with Foreign Ministers David Levy of Israel and Prince Saud of Saudi Arabia.
They will be in Moscow for a multilateral conference to promote understanding
between the Jewish state and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   In his meeting with Albright, Jordan's King Abdullah volunteered to have his
kingdom act as host for the next regional economic conference, State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin also confirmed that neither Syria nor Lebanon would attend the Moscow
conference. Syria's government-controlled press has criticized the conference as
divisive to Arab unity.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, Albright and Ross all are prepared to commit themselves to working
on a ``day-by-day basis'' to try to reach an Israeli-Palestinian settlement, the
U.S. official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian officials have raised the possibility of shifting negotiations
to Washington if talks in the region do not produce an accord.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the Palestinians accused Barak of not being serious about
reaching the Feb. 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian planning minister, said his negotiating team
proposed that the talks be conducted in Washington under Clinton's close
supervision, but Israel rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Salim Zanoun, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization's
decision-making Central Council, said the council will meet Wednesday in Gaza
City to set the date for the declaration of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
	   It appeared highly unlikely, however, that the Palestinians would issue a
unilateral declaration of independence and risk angering the Americans before
the September deadline for a peace treaty with Israel.

<P>
   THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) -- A teen-age boy survived a 63-foot fall from his
seventh-story apartment balcony after landing on two small plastic dumpsters,
police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The 17-year-old boy was hospitalized with a fractured leg and a mild
concussion, police and doctors said.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident occurred late Friday in Thessaloniki, a northern port city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have learned that the young man had an argument with his mother, who
did not let him go out,'' said the city's police chief, Yannis Panagopoulos.
``He apparently made a mock threat to jump off the balcony. He slipped, fell,
and landed on the plastic garbage containers.''

   JOHNSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- A knitting mill that has been making clothing since
the late 1800s is going out of business, and company officials blame foreign
trade policies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Johnstown Knitting Mill Co., which traces it roots to 1893 and employs
229 people, will close by late March, company officials announced Friday.

</P>
<P>
	   ``The company attributes a majority of their loss to U.S. foreign trade
policies such as NAFTA, which has encouraged many U.S. companies to manufacture
goods offshore. This has made it next to impossible for most domestic
manufacturers to compete in the marketplace,'' company officials said in a news
release.

<HEADLINE> Gore Changes Abortion Position  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore retracted his 13-year-old
statement equating abortion to ``the taking of a human life'' as he scrambled
Saturday to keep the issue, a traditional stumbling block for Republicans, from
tripping him up against Democrat Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, my position has changed,'' Gore said. ``I strongly support a woman's
right to choose and if (Bradley) disputes that, then he is making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley began airing a new television ad in the state Saturday in which the
former New Jersey senator calls himself the only presidential candidate who
``has been pro-choice for everyone all the time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in Manchester, Bradley said, ``I was pro-choice from the day I
entered politics. ... It's not an issue you can dance around.''
</P>
<P>
	   To try and settle the bedrock question for many Democratic women, Gore
indulged several reporters' questions as, coffee in hand, he walked through
Milford's town square.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who represented Tennessee in the House from 1977-85 and the Senate
from 1985-93, was asked whether he still believes that abortion -- in the
questioner's words -- ``is the taking of a human life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Obviously prepared, Gore was quick to recall that he had qualified the
statement at the time. ``I didn't write that. I didn't. I used the word
'arguably,' and yes, my position has changed,'' Gore acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, in a 1987 letter to a constitutent, Gore wrote that abortion ``is
arguably the taking of a human life.'' In any event, Gore added that he ``would
not use that phrasing today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said the only abortion matter with which he had wrestled was whether
public money should help pay for abortions for poor women -- the Medicaid
funding for abortions he says he now supports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've always supported keeping abortion legal and I've always been attacked
by the anti-choice groups for that position since the beginning of my career,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the National Right to Life Committee gave Gore an 84 percent
approval rating for anti-abortion votes he cast while in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League
rated Gore's House career decidedly ``anti-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among the 30 votes the group scored against Gore was his ``yea'' in 1984 to
define the word ``person'' under four existing civil rights laws to include
``unborn children from the moment of conception.'' The organization
characterized that as a move toward an ``all out prohibition on abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nancy Greaney, a Gore supporter and former teacher from Bedford, was
surprised to learn of Gore's record but said, ``I'd never hold it against him.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people's opinions and beliefs evolve,'' Greaney said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellie Bosman, an undecided Democrat who shook hands with Gore in the Milford
square Saturday, was conflicted about reports of Gore's abortion record.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it's a crime to change your mind, but I wish more
politicians would admit they changed their minds,'' the retired teacher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the case, Bosman added, Bradley ``demeaned Gores character by
implying he lied.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had cornered Gore in debate on Wednesday, pressing him to concede
his inconsistency on abortion rights. In the days since, the vice president has
faced more questions about his record.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley orchestrated the debate question and follow-up TV commercial in a
drive to undercut Gore's support among women and reverse his own slip in polls
in time for Tuesday's first-in-the-nation primary.
</P>
<P>
	   A front page article Friday in The Boston Globe, which has a large
circulation in New Hampshire, questioned the veracity of Gore's statement in
debate that he ``had always been for a woman's right to choose.'' Asked Friday
afternoon about the morning paper's story, Gore, a former journalist and avid
news reader, said he had not seen it.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman caller to New Hampshire public radio the same day told Gore on-air:
``I understand if you've changed your position in your career but ... I don't
know how I can support your candidacy if you're dishonest about such an
important subject and especially on national television.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign responded by producing a testimonial from feminist Gloria
Steinem and signatures from 42 members of Congress in an ``open letter'' stating
what Gore once had counted on being obvious in this election: ``Al Gore is
pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   That letter was e-mailed to hundreds of political reporters and passed
around a state Democratic party dinner Friday night. It was followed by a list
of 300 New Hampshire women pledging their support for Gore, in part, because of
his commitment to women's health and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane called the sudden flurry of paper ``an effort to
help the press,'' and said Gore would continue to focus on issues such as
Medicaid, Medicare and education, where he differs widely with Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Bradley backers stood outside Gore's
town meeting in Lebanon to distribute a 1984 letter in which Gore wrote, ``It is
my deep personal conviction that abortion is wrong. ... innocent human life must
be protected.''
</P>
<P>
	   Said Nadler, ``He wrote this and voted to civil rights protection to the
fetus. So, if he says he was always pro-choice, he's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, Gore told his audience of mostly undecided voters that Bradley has
sought in recent days ``to manufacture some differences on issues where there
really are no differences.'' Of the 13 questions he fielded from voters, none
was about abortion.

campaigned for the first time Saturday alongside his father, who once was, as
the field of White House hopefuls plowed toward this week's leadoff New
Hampshire primary. Bill Bradley charged Al Gore was trying to ``dance around''
earlier qualms about abortion as he bid to cut into the vice president's core
Democratic support.

	   With the polls pointing to a tight finish, at least on the Republican side,
Sen. John McCain mocked Bush's endgame strategy as ``quick, get me another
endorsement'' from the GOP establishment. People lining up behind the
front-runner now are ``the same ones running our party in 1996 and 1998, when we
lost elections,'' said the Arizona senator, who has come from far back in the
pack to within striking distance of victory in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who has moved past Bradley in recent polls, sought to blunt his
rival's attack on his position on abortion and his credibility. Asked whether he
would say abortion ``is arguably the taking of a human life,'' as he wrote to a
constituent 1987, the vice president said, ``I would not use that phrasing
today.''
</P>
<P>
	   He quickly added, though, that ``on the narrow question, I've always
supported Roe v. Wade. I've always supported keeping abortion legal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, who finished a strong second in last week's Iowa caucuses,
Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer all made their rounds on the campaign's final weekend,
hoping for surprises in Tuesday's vote that would catapult them into the thick
of the GOP race. Forbes released new radio commercials attacking Bush for
failing to be a firm enough foe of abortion, and for overseeing a big increase
in spending in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowds were bigger Saturday, the political theater more entertaining, as
New Hampshire voters prepared to render their verdict. A man stood on a
Manchester street corner, wearing a Bill Clinton mask and waving a Bush placard.
His presence on a wind-whipped day underscored that this begins the flood of
primaries that will lead to election of the current president's successor.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, after months of campaigning and thousands of candidate speeches, not
everyone was ready to declare a preference. ``I'm slow to make my decision,''
said Robi Jackson, 57, of Portsmouth, who described herself as leaning toward
Bush. ``My feeling is they all have wonderful ideas, but when you get to
Washington, well, you know what they say: `Talk is cheap.'''
</P>
<P>
	   A Bush victory Tuesday would cement his credentials as front-runner and
damage, if not cripple, McCain's ability to sustain his challenge. The Texas
governor began his day in Portsmouth, where he appeared before one of the
largest crowds he's seen thus far, an estimated 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   From there, he went to Milford, where he posed for a Bush family political
appearance. Father George Bush, mother Barbara and other family members flanked
him, joined as well by Elizabeth Dole, the wife of the 1996 presidential nominee
and herself a campaign dropout this time around.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This boy, this son of ours, is not going to let you down,'' promised the
former president -- who ran three times in the New Hampshire primary and won
twice. ``He's going to go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I heard my family was coming up here to knock on doors it gave me
that extra impetus to keep charging in New Hampshire,'' said his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Aboard McCain's campaign bus, the candidate said the GOP establishment ``has
become more and more alarmed'' at the possibility of his victory. ``We've
interfered with a coronation.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic race, Bradley unveiled a new television ad that said of
abortion, ``This is the kind of issue that you can't straddle.'' Campaigning
during the day, the former New Jersey senator said, ``I was pro-choice from the
day I entered politics, and I will always be pro-choice. It's not an issue you
can dance around.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said in campaign debate last week that he had once opposed federal
funding for abortions under Medicaid but had otherwise always been for abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, my position has changed,'' Gore said. ``I strongly support a woman's
right to choose, and if (Bradley) disputes that, then he is making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer plunged into the Democratic dispute, questioning Gore's candor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I almost fell off my chair ... when I saw Al Gore deny that he had ever
been pro-life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When it comes to an issue this profound, a politician that plays games on
something involving life and death I think loses all credibility to aspire to
the White House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes said he doesn't plan any abrupt change in strategy in the final days
of a race that looks bleak for him. ``I think one of the things most important
for us is to walk the walk with integrity. It's dictated by the fact that I
think this is what the country needs,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 2 dead in Plainfield house fire, 7 others escape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PLAINFIELD, N.J. (AP) - Two people died early Saturday morning in a
house fire as firefighters desperately tried to reach them. Seven others inside
the burning home were able to escape, officials said.
<P>
	   Fire officials said the blaze appears to have started accidentally.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire at 707 W. 4th St. began shortly before 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Fire Chief Paul Newborn said a man and a woman, in their 20s or 30s,
appeared to have been living in the basement of the 2 1/2-story home. Their
names were not released pending family notification.
</P>
<P>
	   No other injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was under control around 10 a.m., Newborn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Newborn said there were smoke detectors upstairs, which had alerted the
residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from the Union County Arson Task Force focused their attention
primarily on the basement, where the two had perished.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're calling (the fire) accidental from a heat source," said Newborn, who
would not say whether a space heater had caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had some reports of space heaters (downstairs)," said Newborn. "But
we're pretty sure at this point that the fire started in the basement. However,
it remains under further investigation."
</P>
<P>
	   Timothy Jack, 32, has lived on W. 4th St. for 15 years, and said keeping
warm during the colder months has always been a problem for people living in
these multiple-family homes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Like everyone else around here, you leave your oven on to keep warm," he
said. "I mean, look at these old houses with these old windows. That's the only
way you can keep warm."
</P>
<P>
	   Newborn said there was no stove in the basement living area.
</P>
<P>
	   The owner of the building was at the scene several hours after the fire had
been declared under control, but he refused to speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Departments from several neighboring departments were also called to help
battle the blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven survivors had been placed temporarily in a nearby hotel off Route
22, officials said. Their names had not been released.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Protest World Forum Summit  </HEADLINE>
   By CLARE NULLIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- More than 1,000 anti-free trade activists defied
a protest ban Saturday and staged a hectic demonstration at a gathering of the
world's political and corporate elite in this secluded Alpine resort.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the protesters -- including environmentalists and anarchists --
broke windows at a McDonald's restaurant and vandalized several cars. Others
burned an American flag they had pulled down from the facade of a luxury hotel
where most of the world leaders are staying, and used police barricades to try
to break the hotel's windows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But at least Davos didn't become a second Seattle,'' said local government
president Peter Aliesch in reference to the riots during December's World Trade
Organization meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Two police officers were injured, though not seriously, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The protests took place outside the site where President Clinton delivered a
speech to the gathered leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   After several hours and under increasingly heavy snow, the protesters
dispersed with the cry ``We'll be back!'' and some of them singing the Communist
anthem, the Internationale.
</P>
<P>
	   Swiss President Adolf Ogi criticized the skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The use of force is extremely regrettable,'' he told journalists. The
World Economic Forum, which organizes the Davos meeting, deplored that ``a
limited number of demonstrators chose violence over dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police -- although equipped with full riot gear -- kept a deliberately
nonconfrontational approach even when under assault from snowballs, blocks of
ice, ski sticks and other makeshift weapons. Only two people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite having declared a ban on all protests during Clinton's visit and
calling out troops for extra backup, authorities made no attempt to stop the
first demonstrators as they entered the long narrow main street through the
village. But they then seemed to be taken by surprise as an estimated 1,300
protesters pushed through control barriers.
</P>
<P>
	   Firing warning shots, security forces retreated to less than 500 yards from
the conference center and hotel hosting Clinton. They then barricaded off the
street with land cruisers equipped with huge metal grids to prevent further
disruption. Clinton was in the hotel at the time, conducting business.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yankee Clinton go home,'' read one typical banner. ``Don't let the
multinationals destroy the people. Resist,'' read another.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The New Spirit of Davos. Resistance against international exploitation,''
declared another banner in reference to the conference organizers' oft-repeated
claims that it is the ``Spirit of Davos'' that attracts hundreds of global
political and business leaders each year.
</P>
<P>
	   The critics say they have the same concerns about the World Economic Forum
as about the World Trade Organization: that it is undemocratic, secretive and
only concerned with maximizing commercial profits. They say that vital deals and
decisions are struck behind closed doors with little consideration shown to
public concerns, for example on genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
	   Radical French farmers' unions, which have campaigned against McDonald's in
France and the globalization it represents and which were out in force in
Seattle, were among the protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our concerns need to be more represented in everyday public opinion,''
said Alain Pulles, one of the farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the demonstrators were clad in ski gear to escape official
attention. Others were masked and belonged to anarchist groups.
</P>
<P>
	   An AP photographer was roughed up as he took a picture of a demonstrator
felling a police officer with a cross country ski.

<HEADLINE> Norfolk Southern to lay off 550  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- Norfolk Southern Corp. is laying off 550 union workers,
blaming falling revenue, high diesel prices and a weak export coal market.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials confirmed the layoffs Friday, just two days after Norfolk
Southern announced an early retirement program for 1,200 nonunion employees. The
company has about 35,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The layoffs, set to take effect next Friday, affect track and machine
workers who belong to the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way and are scattered
across the Norfolk-based railroad's 12 divisions in 22 states, mostly east of
the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
	   Diesel prices, coupled with problems associated with the company's takeover
of Conrail last year, caused Norfolk Southern's fourth-quarter profits to plunge
81 percent to $31 million, or 8 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokeswoman Susan Bland said the layoffs had more to do with business
conditions, including a decline in the export coal market to Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   She said more layoffs could follow.

<HEADLINE> Shovels Shipped in Forest Protest  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT SONNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELKO, Nev. (AP) -- Hundreds of disgruntled Westerners paraded through town
with 10,000 shovels Saturday to protest federal environmental policy and lend
support to residents feuding with the U.S. Forest Service over a washed-out
road.
</P>
<P>
	   The residents want to rebuild a dirt road along the Jarbidge River in the
Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, but the Forest Service has fought their
efforts, saying the erosion would harm the river's bull trout population.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have learned we must stand together, shoulder to shoulder, to defeat
those who would destroy our way of life and the West as we know it,'' State
Assemblyman John Carpenter, a Republican from Elko, said during Saturday's
rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Two hundred horse-drawn wagons, makeshift floats, ATVs, motorcycles,
snowmobiles and pickup trucks loaded with tons of shovels donated from across
the West paraded down Elko's main street to a rally at the county courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 3,000 people lined the streets with shovels and American flags,
and children waved plastic, sandbox shovels. Several protesters carried signs
that read: ``Stop Clinton's War on the West.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has taken on a life of its own,'' said O.Q. ``Chris'' Johnson, a local
businessman who helped organize the Jarbidge Shovel Brigade Parade. ``It's
bigger than the Fourth of July.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the shovels were delivered in a caravan from Montana, where loggers
and mill workers long have been at odds with the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Somehow, sending a shovel seems symbolic. Maybe it will make a
difference,'' said Cary Hegreberg of Helena, Mont., executive vice president of
the Montana Wood Products Association.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most people understand shovels are a symbol of work. That's something we
have in common -- we want to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elko County Commissioner Mike Nannini, who helped organize the parade, said
shovels arrived by mail from as far away as Rhode Island and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's just a grassroots deal. It's not just the West anymore. These people
are saying `No more,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jarbidge River, in a remote canyon near the Idaho border, is home of the
southernmost population of bull trout in North America.
</P>
<P>
	   The disputed road, a 1.5 mile dirt stretch, connects to a trailhead for a
wilderness path and provides vehicle access to fishing and camping along the
river.
</P>
<P>
	   The Elko County Commission claims the Forest Service has no jurisdiction
over the South Canyon Road because the road was there before the Humboldt
National Forest was established in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson and others threatened to rebuild the road by hand, but a federal
judge in Reno issued a court order banning any work on the road in November.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy has prompted a congressional field hearing and has become a
lightning rod for criticism of President Clinton's proposal to protect millions
of acres of roadless areas in national forests.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican, offered his support for the protest
in a letter to organizers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since the vast majority of the public lands are in the West, perhaps the
bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., simply don't understand the impact their
decisions have on our western way of life,'' Guinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the protesters was Bob Secrist of Elko.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm in the firewood business and the Forest Service is giving me a bad
time. They are supposed to manage the forest but they are just shutting it down
and locking it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president wants to make everything roadless. That's fine for the
people in Kansas, but 85 percent of our land is controlled by the government in
Nevada. We're expected to make a living on the other 15 percent,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Trade Show Said A Success  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- The first American trade show in communist Cuba in four
decades wrapped on Saturday with organizers saying that several manufacturers of
U.S. medical products expected to make sales to government hospitals and clinics
in coming months.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It went exceedingly well -- much better than expected,'' said Peter W.
Nathan, president of PWN Exhibicion LLC of Westport, Conn. as exhibitors packed
up X-ray machines and other hospital equipment in cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Several of the 97 American companies that participated are expected to apply
for licenses from the U.S. Treasury Department to sell products to Cuban medical
institutions, Nathan said. He did not provide specifics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether the money to buy is there remains to be seen, but there is
interest,'' said Nathan.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Healthcare Exhibition is the latest small advance in U.S.-Cuban
relations since January 1999, when President Clinton changed rules to allow
increased contact between Americans and Cubans and to ease sales of medical
goods.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost a decade after the collapse of its socialist partners in Eastern
Europe, the Cuban government remains strapped for hard currency and often cannot
come up with the cash needed to buy imported goods. Payments to U.S. companies
are complicated by the U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   But long-term contacts rather than sales were the goal with this first show,
Nathan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rules limiting U.S. medical exports to Cuba under decades-old trade
sanctions were eased last year. There have been several proposals to fully lift
restrictions on food and medical sales, but they have failed to gain full
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We found that they wanted a lot of information,'' said Denisse Garcia,
Latin American operations manager for Datex-Ohmedia, which exhibited anesthesia
machines and baby incubators.
</P>
<P>
	   Datex-Ohmedia, as many of the other exhibitors, was donating some of its
equipment to hospitals and clinics. It was giving an incubator to the nonprofit
Roman Catholic charity Caritas and leaving an anesthesia machine for the
government's MedCuba agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Miguel Angel Campomanes, director of Latin American sales for Zeiss optical
devices, said he had received enough interest to make as much as $1 million in
sales, ``if they have the money.''
</P>
<P>
	   The booth run by Zeiss Humphrey, of Dublin, Calif., was among the most
popular during the five-day show because of its free vision tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Archer Daniels Midland Co. of Decatur, Ill., the show's primary sponsor,
also attracted much attention for its vitamin E samples.
</P>
<P>
	   Other major exhibitors included Eastman Kodak Co. imaging devices, Eli Lilly
&AMP; Co. pharmaceuticals, and Gerber Products Co. nutritional products for
children.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials say that since 1992 they have granted 40 to 50 licenses to
American companies to sell medicines and medical supplies in Cuba, and that only
a handful of requests have been turned down.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government says it licensed $19 million worth of American medical
sales to Cuba in 1998 and $26 million worth in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But actual sales have been much lower, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   The last such U.S. trade gathering on the island is believed to have been a
1960 meeting for American travel agents.

Russian Advance on Grozny Said Trap
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   STARIYE ATAGI, Russia (AP) -- Chechen rebels said they allowed Russian
forces to advance on the capital city of Grozny so they could be trapped and
attacked by Chechen fighters from the rear. The Russians' assault on Grozny has
concentrated for more than a week on Minutka Square, a position they believe
will help them push the rebels out of the city center. Moscow sent troops into
Chechnya in September after an invasion by Chechen-based militants into the
neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in August. Deadly apartment bombings in
several Russian cities also were blamed on Chechens.

Gore Scrambles on Abortion Issue
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MILFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore scrambled today to keep the
abortion issue from tripping him up against Democrat Bill Bradley, retracting
his 13-year-old statement equating abortion to "the taking of a human life."
Gore said his position has changed. "I strongly support a woman's right to
choose and if (Bradley) disputes that, then he is making a mistake," Gore said.
Gore said the only abortion matter with which he had wrestled in the past was
whether public money should help pay for abortions for poor women -- the
Medicaid funding for abortions he says he now supports.

Radiation Exposures Acknowledged

Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said. A draft government report, which reviewed
worker exposure during early decades of the Cold War at 14 nuclear weapons
plants, could lead to compensation to the families of the workers, many of whom
were unaware they were being exposed to such health risks.

EU Warns Austria on Haider

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- In keeping with the populist party's prominence for
stoking anti-foreigner sentiment in Austria, Joerg Haider predicted Saturday
that a government featuring his far-right party would impose a nearly complete
ban on immigration. Haider said the only foreigners who would be allowed to move
to Austria would be seasonal workers who would leave after several months. By
Saturday, most European governments had criticized Haider. The European Union
has warned Austria against setting up a government that includes Haider's party,
and Belgium is calling for common EU action if such a coalition materializes.

Deal Reached on Biotech Foods
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- U.N. talks here finally produced rules governing trade in
genetically engineered products today. Though complex, and subject to legal
challenges or interpretations, the new rules for now contain language letting a
country ban imports of a genetically modified product if it feels there is not
enough scientific evidence showing the product is safe. It requires exporters to
label shipments that contain genetically altered commodities such as corn or
cotton. It also tries to dictate how those safety rules will coexist with free
trade rules governed by the World Trade Organization. Previous talks collapsed
nearly a year ago in the face of international discord.

demonstrating out of fears of violence, but a court late Friday overturned the
decision and allowed the event to go forward.

champion Julius Francis five times and stopped him in the second round Saturday
night. Francis didn't run and did his best to exchange punches with the former
heavyweight champion, who was wild early in the first round. Francis actually
landed a couple good body punches.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Burton: Elian Wants To Stay  </HEADLINE>
   By MADELINE BARO DIAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- About 200 chanting, flag-waving protesters marched in front of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service's office Saturday, demanding that
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez be sent home to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Dan Burton, whose congressional maneuvering to keep Elian in the
United States has infuriated the boy's father, said Saturday that the boy told
him he doesn't want to go back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a very intelligent young man and I was able to ask him without any
coaching a couple of questions,'' the Indiana Republican said after meeting for
30 minutes with Elian at the home where the boy is staying with relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first question I asked him is how did he like living here and he said
he liked it very much as he was blowing bubbles. And then I said `Would you like
to go back to Cuba?' And he was very firm in saying 'No' and this without any
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the subject of heated debate since he was found clinging to
an inner tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast. His mother and 10 others traveling
with him drowned during an effort to leave Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers were expected to continue a tour of the United States,
where they have been campaigning for Elian's return, Cuba's Prensa Latina news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100,000 Cubans gathered Saturday in the Cuban city of Cienfuegos
for another in an almost daily series of government-sponsored, nationally
televised rallies for Elian's return. One child speaker idolized the boy as ``a
kidnapped angel.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Ottawa, about 30 protesters marched in front of the new U.S. embassy
carrying signs that read: ``End the Kidnapping'' and ``Cuban Children are Not
for Sale.'' In Los Angeles, some three dozen demonstrators rallied in support of
sending Elian back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If that was an American boy over in Cuba, we would have the whole Marine
Corps over there trying to get him back,'' said Rudy Pisani, 68, of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban-Americans among the protesters at the INS office in Miami said they
wanted to show that not all Cuban-Americans want Elian to remain here. They said
the boy had been kidnapped and should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every child needs a father and a mother,'' said Juan Morales, a Cuban who
has lived in the United States for eight years. ``If the mother dies, the person
directly responsible is the father and not the uncle and not the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Andres Gomez, national coordinator of the Antonio Maceo Brigade, a group
that organized the protest and advocates normalizing relations with Cuba, said
the demonstrators have a noble purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are coming together in this case in defense of the most fundamental
rights of a human being, which are the rights of a child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Saturday, the anti-Castro Democracy Movement, a group which wants
Elian to stay put, launched a flotilla of about 20 boats to pay tribute to
Elian's mother and the 10 others who drowned. About 300 people, including about
200 aboard boats, took part.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators released balloons into the air and threw flowers into the
water as the American and Cuban national anthems played. Donato Dalrymple, a
fisherman who found Elian floating at sea, tossed a wreath with flowers arranged
in the pattern of the Cuban flag into the water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today we're here to remember ... the mother of Elian Gonzalez, Elisabeth
Brotons, and the other people who drowned in the unfortunate tragedy,'' said
Ramon Saul Sanchez, the leader of the Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled Elian should return to his father. But its order has not
been carried out because the government agreed to hold off until a federal court
considers a challenge filed by the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler originally said he would hear arguments
March 6 on whether the relative's lawsuit should be dismissed. But on Friday, he
moved the hearing up to Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to block Elian's return to Cuba, Burton earlier this month
subpoenaed the boy to appear before the House Government Reform Committee. He
said it is unlikely that Elian will actually appear before the committee, but he
didn't rule it out.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department asserts that if Elian is not returned to Cuba, it
could hurt attempts to retrieve American children taken out of the country by a
foreign-born parent against the wishes of the child's American parent.

<HEADLINE> Texas Families Asses Blast Damage  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT SLAGLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GATESVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Robert Shoaf knelt over one of the 10 craters now
dotting his property and sighed in disbelief as he clasped a jagged strip of
artillery shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One hundred yards that way, it would have hit my house,'' Shoaf said
Saturday, pointing west to the home he shares with his wife, Joan, about 100
miles southwest of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   Just days earlier, Shoaf and 11 other family members who live on the
300-acre cattle ranch were ducking for cover as Army battalions eight miles away
at Fort Hood launched a volley of 155 mm Howitzer artillery shells toward their
property.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It roared like a whistle, and then a bomb exploded,'' the 70-year-old
said. ``I didn't know what it was until the next morning when we found the
holes.''
</P>
<P>
	   A 4-foot length of the foundation of his home cracked, and chunks of
shrapnel lodged in the nearby home of his son Jay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was unreal, like a war zone,'' said Jay Shoaf's wife, Tammy.
</P>
<P>
	   The force of Wednesday night's blasts, which continued for about an hour,
shook pictures off of walls, broke a chandelier in the family room and cracked
sections of dry wall.
</P>
<P>
	   The shelling happened during a training exercise involving two artillery
battalions, said Lt. Col. Maryane Cummings, a spokeswoman for Fort Hood.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're really concerned about safety so that is why we stopped all practice
firing until we find out what happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cummings said she would not speculate on what went wrong. She said base
officials are conducting an investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Shoaf said Army officials had been out to survey the damage on Friday
and were expected to return to meet with the family on Tuesday. His family wants
some assurance that it won't happen again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We still live here,'' said Mrs. Shoaf. ``They better check their
instruments before they start up again.''

	   Football fans driving to Atlanta for the Super Bowl hit icy and treacherous
conditions in the Southeast on Saturday, while the West and Northeast had
generally clear conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Ice and sleet coated roads throughout northern Georgia, southeastern
Tennessee and northwestern South Carolina. Farther south, scattered rain showers
fell over sections of Alabama and southern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of crashes littered Atlanta's streets and police advised against
driving. A 47-car pileup tied up traffic at the junction of Interstate 20 and

</P>
<P>
	   The same storm had dropped more than a foot of snow in areas across the
Plains and the South and was blamed for three deaths in Arkansas, one in
Louisiana and five in Missouri. A 14-year-old boy died in a sledding accident
near Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   By Saturday, light snowfall spread from Chicago into Kentucky and Tennessee,

<HEADLINE> NAACP Denounces Confederate Flags  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS WILLIAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN MARCOS, Texas (AP) -- Intensifying their pressure on Republican Gov.
George W. Bush, civil rights leaders on Saturday called for Texans to purge
Confederate flags from public spaces in order to remove ``badges of slavery and
racism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of leaders from NAACP branches in Texas met Saturday to discuss ways
to combat racism. Kyev Tatum of the Hill Country Branch said he was frustrated
with what he described as Bush's unclear position on the flag.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, many leaders within our state government have refused to
take a stand,'' Tatum said. ``We believe it is our duty and our responsibility
to bring that to the attention of the people of Texas and the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   In South Carolina, thousands of people have protested the Confederate flag
flying atop the Statehouse there and urged the Legislature to take it down. The
Republican presidential candidates competing in that state's primary next month
have sidestepped the issue, saying it is an issue for South Carolinians to
solve. The Democratic candidates have said it should be removed.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bledsoe, president of the Texas NAACP, has asked Bush to support an
effort to remove a plaque that includes a representation of the flag from the
state Supreme Court building in Austin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to remove all vestiges and badges of slavery and racism so
African-Americans can have the same rights and opportunities accorded to other
citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked Bush's position on the plaques, Bush spokesman Scott McClellan
said Saturday that representations of all six governments that once held
authority in Texas are present in the capitol. McClellan would not say whether
Bush wanted the plaques removed.
</P>
<P>
	   Tatum asked the state board of the NAACP to endorse a protest in Austin
against the Confederate flags and for stronger hate-crime laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Bledsoe said he supports the rally and wants to combine it with a protest of
the state Senate's decision to designate April as Confederate History and
Heritage Month. A resolution was adopted by the Senate last March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It slipped through the Legislature,'' Bledsoe said. ``Even the black
caucus members were completely unaware that it occurred.''
</P>
<P>
	   The resolution describes the Civil War as a struggle for state's rights and
individual freedom and says the defense of slavery was a factor for only 2
percent of Texans who fought in the war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Politically correct revisionists would have Texas children believe that
their Confederate ancestors fought for slavery when in fact most Texans joined
the Confederate armed forces to defend their homes, their families and their
proud heritage as Texans,'' the resolution reads.
</P>
<P>
	   McClellan said Bush was asked to sign a proclamation in support of the
resolution, but declined. Bush did not comment when the Senate approved the
resolution, he said.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Burton: Elian Wants To Stay  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- More than 100,000 Cubans gathered to demand the return of
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez on Saturday, and President Fidel Castro vowed to carry
on such protests for 10 years if need be.
</P>
<P>
	   At the government-sponsored rally in the central Cuban city of Cienfuegos,
one child speaker called the boy ``a kidnapped angel.'' The nationally televised
event, the latest in a series of daily rallies, mixed Cuban communist patriotism
with increasingly bitter denunciations of Castro's foes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Down with Yankee imperialism!'' shouted one boy from the podium at the
rally. Speakers claimed the boy was held by a group of ``worms,'' reviving a
once-common epithet for anti-Castro exiles that the government had abandoned in
recent years while trying to appeal to moderate Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   The government announced another large rally on Sunday in Havana to welcome
Elian's grandmothers home from the United States, where they have been
campaigning for the boy's return. The grandmothers were expected to arrive
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 people staged demonstrations in Miami on Saturday to urge the
boy's return to Cuba, and a slightly larger group also staged a protest aboard
boats there to demand that the boy stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's mother, her boyfriend and nine other people died off the Florida
coast when their boat sank during an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, rescued while clinging to an inner tube on Nov. 25, has been staying
in Miami with a paternal great-uncle who, backed by anti-Castro exile groups, is
trying to keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   While speaking to a conference of economists Friday, Castro blamed the
disaster on the mother's boyfriend, Larazo Rafael Munero, who organized the
fatal boat trip.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mother was practically kidnapped along with the boy'' to make the
trip, Castro said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What kind of ruffian is this guy?'' Castro asked. ``We have 100 pages of
reports on him,'' apparently referring to police documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba's government and Communist Party have mounted daily demonstrations to
support Elian's father's demand that he be returned to Cuba. Hundreds of
thousands of people have marched through the streets chanting the name of the
boy official news media call ``the elfin prince.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have never in the past put on such a display of people and public unity
and I don't believe we will tire of it,'' Castro said. ``We have the resources
to go on for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to Munero, Castro said, ``The first thing we had to do is verify
what kind of man this 'hero' is because we knew it would be the theory that it
was the mother who dreamed of a 'land of freedom.' We know all the cliches.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a mother who was practically kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban leader called Brotons ``an excellent girl'' who had suffered seven
miscarriages before delivering Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One who is born among eight pregnancies: How desired must be that child
whom they have taken by force from his father and grandmothers,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said Saturday that Elian
told him during a meeting that he didn't want to go back to Cuba. Burton
supports a measure to make Elian a U.S. citizen in order to impede
administration efforts to return him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, about 200 chanting, flag-waving protesters marched in front of
the headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami on
Saturday, demanding that Elian be sent back to Cuba.

Saturday, lecturing world leaders on the perils of excluding poorer nations from

presidents, prime ministers, politicians and 1,000 business leaders, Clinton
endorsed unfettered global trade and investment -- as long as it recognizes

primary. Bill Bradley charged Al Gore was trying to "dance around" earlier

isn't met, "they'll reach some understanding about how to deal with that
problem," a senior U.S. official said Saturday after a 30-minute meeting between
Arafat and President Clinton. The statement was the frankest admission yet that
American mediators are likely to fall short of their target for a basic
understanding about the future of Jerusalem, whether there will be a Palestinian
state and other knotty issues at the core of the Arab-Israeli dispute.

Russian Advance on Grozny Said Trap
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   STARIYE ATAGI, Russia (AP) -- Chechen rebels said they allowed Russian
forces to advance on the capital city of Grozny so they could be trapped and
attacked by Chechen fighters from the rear. The Russians' assault on Grozny has
concentrated for more than a week on Minutka Square, a position they believe
will help them push the rebels out of the city center. Moscow sent troops into
Chechnya in September after an invasion by Chechen-based militants into the
neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in August. Deadly apartment bombings in
several Russian cities also were blamed on Chechens.

	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- The U.S. government reversed a position held for
decades Saturday, saying workers at nuclear weapons plants likely suffered a
wide range of cancers because of exposure to radiation and toxic chemicals,
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said. A draft government report, which reviewed
worker exposure during early decades of the Cold War at 14 nuclear weapons
plants, could lead to compensation to the families of the workers, many of whom
were unaware they were being exposed to such health risks.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Fires Indian Expert  </HEADLINE>
   By PETER MUELLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The founder of Brazil's Indian Affairs Bureau
and a pioneer of indigenous rights said Saturday that the government had fired
him because it no longer wanted to pay his salary.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando Villas Boas, 86, said he was notified of his dismissal by fax. He
was semiretired and held a position with the agency that was mostly honorary.
</P>
<P>
	   Villas Boas said it seemed the bureau had fired him to save his salary,
worth $730 a month. The explanation from the bureau, known as Funai, was that he
wasn't entitled to a salary since he was awarded a special pension last year,
also of $730 a month, or 1,315 reals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never made much money, and a thousand more or less won't make much
difference. It's the way I was fired,'' Villas Boas said by telephone from his
home in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I and my brothers created Funai. I chose the name. After 40, 50 years,
Funai decides I'm not worth anything,'' he said. ``I guess we're just like the
Indians -- unprotected by the state.''
</P>
<P>
	   No one was available at the agency on Saturday to comment. Bureau President
Frederico Mares de Souza Filho, who signed the fax, reportedly was visiting
tribes in the Amazon region.
</P>
<P>
	   Villas Boas and his three brothers, Claudio, Alvaro and Leonardo, were
pioneers in Brazil's Amazon, pushing into the uncharted jungle in the 1940s to
make contact with tribes that had never seen Westerners. They witnessed the harm
that roads and airstrips caused to Indians and became outspoken defenders of
Indian rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando and Claudio, the most famous of the four, eventually moved in with
Indians and stayed for 32 years. In 1961, they persuaded the government to
create its first, and probably most successful, reservation -- Xingu National
Park.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen Indian nations were transferred from ancestral lands to the 5.6
million-acre park in northern Mato Grosso state, 870 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro. Today, more than 3,000 Indians live there in relative isolation from
white culture.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando, the last surviving brother, urged the Indians to resist intrusion
by any means necessary. He is revered by tribal leaders, and in 1998 he was
honored in Xingu at a Kuarup, a scared ritual for the dead, in tribute to his
deceased brothers.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Burton: Elian Wants To Stay  </HEADLINE>
   By MADELINE BARO DIAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- About 200 chanting, flag-waving protesters marched in front of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service's office Saturday, demanding that
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez be sent home to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Dan Burton, whose congressional maneuvering to keep Elian in the
United States has infuriated the boy's father, said Saturday that the boy told
him he doesn't want to go back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's a very intelligent young man and I was able to ask him without any
coaching a couple of questions,'' the Indiana Republican said after meeting for
30 minutes with Elian at the home where the boy is staying with relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first question I asked him is how did he like living here and he said
he liked it very much as he was blowing bubbles. And then I said `Would you like
to go back to Cuba?' And he was very firm in saying 'No' and this without any
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the subject of heated debate since he was found clinging to
an inner tube Nov. 25 off the Florida coast. His mother and 10 others traveling
with him drowned during an effort to leave Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers, who have been in the United States campaigning for the
boy's return, were expected to return to Cuba during the weekend. The Cuban
government announced a rally would be held Sunday to welcome them home.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100,000 Cubans gathered Saturday in the Cuban city of Cienfuegos
for another in an almost daily series of government-sponsored, nationally
televised rallies for Elian's return. One child speaker idolized the boy as ``a
kidnapped angel.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Ottawa, about 30 protesters marched in front of the new U.S. embassy
carrying signs that read: ``End the Kidnapping'' and ``Cuban Children are Not
for Sale.'' In Los Angeles, some three dozen demonstrators rallied in support of
sending Elian back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If that was an American boy over in Cuba, we would have the whole Marine
Corps over there trying to get him back,'' said Rudy Pisani, 68, of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban-Americans among the protesters at the INS office in Miami said they
wanted to show that not all Cuban-Americans want Elian to remain here. They said
the boy had been kidnapped and should be returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every child needs a father and a mother,'' said Juan Morales, a Cuban who
has lived in the United States for eight years. ``If the mother dies, the person
directly responsible is the father and not the uncle and not the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
	   Andres Gomez, national coordinator of the Antonio Maceo Brigade, a group
that organized the protest and advocates normalizing relations with Cuba, said
the demonstrators have a noble purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are coming together in this case in defense of the most fundamental
rights of a human being, which are the rights of a child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Saturday, the anti-Castro Democracy Movement, a group which wants
Elian to stay put, launched a flotilla of about 20 boats to pay tribute to
Elian's mother and the 10 others who drowned. About 300 people, including about
200 aboard boats, took part.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrators released balloons into the air and threw flowers into the
water as the American and Cuban national anthems played. Donato Dalrymple, a
fisherman who found Elian floating at sea, tossed a wreath with flowers arranged
in the pattern of the Cuban flag into the water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today we're here to remember ... the mother of Elian Gonzalez, Elisabeth
Brotons, and the other people who drowned in the unfortunate tragedy,'' said
Ramon Saul Sanchez, the leader of the Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled Elian should return to his father. But its order has not
been carried out because the government agreed to hold off until a federal court
considers a challenge filed by the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler originally said he would hear arguments
March 6 on whether the relative's lawsuit should be dismissed. But on Friday, he
moved the hearing up to Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to block Elian's return to Cuba, Burton earlier this month
subpoenaed the boy to appear before the House Government Reform Committee. He
said it is unlikely that Elian will actually appear before the committee, but he
didn't rule it out.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department asserts that if Elian is not returned to Cuba, it
could hurt attempts to retrieve American children taken out of the country by a
foreign-born parent against the wishes of the child's American parent.

<HEADLINE> Cubams Rally Again For Elian  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- More than 100,000 Cubans gathered to demand the return of
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez on Saturday, and President Fidel Castro vowed to carry
on such protests for 10 years if need be.
</P>
<P>
	   At the government-sponsored rally in the central Cuban city of Cienfuegos,
one child speaker called the boy ``a kidnapped angel.'' The nationally televised
event, the latest in a series of daily rallies, mixed Cuban communist patriotism
with increasingly bitter denunciations of Castro's foes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Down with Yankee imperialism!'' shouted one boy from the podium at the
rally. Speakers claimed the boy was held by a group of ``worms,'' reviving a
once-common epithet for anti-Castro exiles that the government had abandoned in
recent years while trying to appeal to moderate Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   The government announced another large rally on Sunday in Havana to welcome
Elian's grandmothers home from the United States, where they have been
campaigning for the boy's return. The grandmothers were expected to arrive
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 people staged demonstrations in Miami on Saturday to urge the
boy's return to Cuba, and a slightly larger group also staged a protest aboard
boats there to demand that the boy stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's mother, her boyfriend and nine other people died off the Florida
coast when their boat sank during an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, rescued while clinging to an inner tube on Nov. 25, has been staying
in Miami with a paternal great-uncle who, backed by anti-Castro exile groups, is
trying to keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   While speaking to a conference of economists Friday, Castro blamed the
disaster on the mother's boyfriend, Larazo Rafael Munero, who organized the
fatal boat trip.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mother was practically kidnapped along with the boy'' to make the
trip, Castro said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What kind of ruffian is this guy?'' Castro asked. ``We have 100 pages of
reports on him,'' apparently referring to police documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba's government and Communist Party have mounted daily demonstrations to
support Elian's father's demand that he be returned to Cuba. Hundreds of
thousands of people have marched through the streets chanting the name of the
boy official news media call ``the elfin prince.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have never in the past put on such a display of people and public unity
and I don't believe we will tire of it,'' Castro said. ``We have the resources
to go on for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to Munero, Castro said, ``The first thing we had to do is verify
what kind of man this 'hero' is because we knew it would be the theory that it
was the mother who dreamed of a 'land of freedom.' We know all the cliches.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a mother who was practically kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban leader called Brotons ``an excellent girl'' who had suffered seven
miscarriages before delivering Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One who is born among eight pregnancies: How desired must be that child
whom they have taken by force from his father and grandmothers,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said Saturday that Elian
told him during a meeting that he didn't want to go back to Cuba. Burton
supports a measure to make Elian a U.S. citizen in order to impede
administration efforts to return him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, about 200 chanting, flag-waving protesters marched in front of
the headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami on
Saturday, demanding that Elian be sent back to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Concerns Delay Kosovo Electricity  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Electricity from Greece, which would alleviate
shortages in Kosovo, has been held up by infrastructure problems in Albania and
Macedonia, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The power would have to transit these countries to reach Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the U.N. mission in Kosovo, the province needs 620-650
megawatts of power at peak periods this winter. The main power plant at Obilic
can only generate about 450 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the station escaped damage during the 78-day NATO airstrikes
against Yugoslavia last year, it has suffered severe neglect over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Approximately 100 megawatts are currently being imported from Serbia,
Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
	   Greece has promised to donate at least 60 megawatts of power a day and said
it could substantially increase this amount if necessary. However,
infrastructure problems in neighboring Macedonia and Albania are presently
preventing delivery of the donated power.
</P>
<P>
	   Electricity can be cut off for up to eight hours a day in most areas. Some
households have even suffered power cuts for more than 24 hours. But a rotation
system has been introduced to cope with the deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   The long power outages during the harsh winter have forced many residents to
resort to wood-burning stoves because central heating systems are dependent on
electricity. But even fire wood is often not sufficiently available.
</P>
<P>
	   Macedonians fear that transmitting power through their country could cause
problems in their own power grid, even though broken lines for such
transmissions have been repaired, said Joan Pierce, responsible for donor
coordination and utilities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody agrees there is some risk,'' Pierce said. ``But the Macedonians
tend to take the line that any risk is not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in Macedonia have said opening the disused Negotino power plant in
the west of the country would enable Greece to transit through to Kosovo. But
financing is not yet secured and negotiations are dragging on.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations is also looking into supplying energy from Greece through
Albania, Pierce says, although infrastructure problems exist there as well.
</P>
<P>
	   In early January, Kosovo's top international administrator Bernard Kouchner
blamed Macedonian authorities for holding up at the border 20 tons of oil needed
to run the plants.
</P>
<P>
	   Repairing the two main power plants, Kosovo A and Kosovo B in Obilic, six
miles east of the capital Pristina, is also proving to be an uphill struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the two units at the 15-year-old Kosovo B station have a capacity of
about 200-250 megawatts, but one was shut down after a fire there earlier this
month. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
	   Once begun, repairs will take at least four weeks, said Bill White, head of
British company Mott MacDonald in charge of restoring the power plant.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to formally announce her
candidacy for the U.S. Senate on Feb. 6 at a State University of New York campus
not far from her new home in suburban Westchester County, aides said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sunday mid-afternoon event will be held at the university's Purchase
campus. The first lady will be accompanied by President Clinton, their daughter,
Chelsea, and the first lady's mother, Dorothy Rodham.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the announcement, the Clinton campaign has plans for 500
simultaneous house parties across the state that are expected to attract more
than 24,000 supporters, her campaign said. She plans to call to the parties
after her announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am thrilled to have the support of so many New Yorkers who believe in my
candidacy and who know that I will fight for them and the issues they care
about,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are really ready to hit the ground running with Hillary when she
announces,'' state Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is expected to face New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a
Republican, for the Senate seat being vacated at the end of this year by
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Giuliani has not yet said when he plans to
enter the race. Both have been campaigning and raising money for months.

<HEADLINE> Law Makes Egyptian Divorce Easier  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A 32-year-old housewife became the first woman to file
for divorce under a new law that makes it easier for Egyptian women to leave
their husbands.
</P>
<P>
	   Wafa Mosaad Gabr, who had been trying to end her marriage for three years,
filed for divorce because she simply didn't want to live with her husband,
El-Sayyed Mohammed Ibrahim, a 38-year old farmer, the woman's lawyer said. The
lawyer, Mostafa Eid, did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The law, which had faced strong opposition in male-dominated and
overwhelmingly Muslim Egypt, was passed by the country's People's Assembly
Wednesday night and approved by President Hosni Mubarak on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The new legislation makes it easier for women to obtain a divorce, though
the process remains more difficult for women than it is for men. Islamic law
gives men the right to divorce their wives anytime and without the approval of a
court or any other authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the old law, women had to prove that physical or psychological harm
was caused by husbands to obtain a divorce.

	   Now, women must only declare before a court that they want a divorce. Judges
will give the couple three months to try and reconcile and six months if they
have children. An immediate divorce will be granted at the end of the trial
period if they don't change their minds.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new law, women who divorce their husbands must return their
dowries and relinquish all financial claims, including alimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Gabr, who got married in 1986, had previously asked her husband to divorce
her, Eid said.
</P>
<P>
	   If Gabr gets her divorce, she will return the equivalent of $30, which her
husband paid as a dowry. But for her three children, she would still get child
support payments, which are not affected under the new law.
</P>
<P>
	   The first hearing in the case is set for March 14.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Trade Show Said A Success  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- The first American trade show in communist Cuba in four
decades wrapped up on Saturday with organizers saying that several manufacturers
of U.S. medical products expected to make sales to government hospitals and
clinics in coming months.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It went exceedingly well -- much better than expected,'' said Peter W.
Nathan, president of PWN Exhibicion LLC of Westport, Conn., as exhibitors packed
up X-ray machines and other hospital equipment in cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Several of the 97 American companies that participated are expected to apply
for licenses from the U.S. Treasury Department to sell products to Cuban medical
institutions, Nathan said. He did not provide specifics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whether the money to buy is there remains to be seen, but there is
interest,'' said Nathan.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Healthcare Exhibition is the latest small advance in U.S.-Cuban
relations since January 1999, when President Clinton changed rules to allow
increased contact between Americans and Cubans and to ease sales of medical
goods.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost a decade after the collapse of its socialist partners in Eastern
Europe, the Cuban government remains strapped for hard currency and often cannot
come up with the cash needed to buy imported goods. Payments to U.S. companies
are complicated by the U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   But long-term contacts rather than sales were the goal with this first show,
Nathan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rules limiting U.S. medical exports to Cuba under decades-old trade
sanctions were eased last year. There have been several proposals to fully lift
restrictions on food and medical sales, but they have failed to gain full
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We found that they wanted a lot of information,'' said Denisse Garcia,
Latin American operations manager for Datex-Ohmedia, which exhibited anesthesia
machines and baby incubators.
</P>
<P>
	   Datex-Ohmedia, as many of the other exhibitors, was donating some of its
equipment to hospitals and clinics. It was giving an incubator to the nonprofit
Roman Catholic charity Caritas and leaving an anesthesia machine for the
government's MedCuba agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Miguel Angel Campomanes, director of Latin American sales for Zeiss optical
devices, said he had received enough interest to make as much as $1 million in
sales, ``if they have the money.''
</P>
<P>
	   The booth run by Zeiss Humphrey, of Dublin, Calif., was among the most
popular during the five-day show because of its free vision tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Archer Daniels Midland Co. of Decatur, Ill., the show's primary sponsor,
also attracted much attention for its vitamin E samples.
</P>
<P>
	   Other major exhibitors included Eastman Kodak Co. imaging devices, Eli Lilly
&AMP; Co. pharmaceuticals, and Gerber Products Co. nutritional products for
children.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials say that since 1992 they have granted 40 to 50 licenses to
American companies to sell medicines and medical supplies in Cuba, and that only
a handful of requests have been turned down.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government says it licensed $19 million worth of American medical
sales to Cuba in 1998 and $26 million worth in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But actual sales have been much lower, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   The last such U.S. trade gathering on the island is believed to have been a
1960 meeting for American travel agents.

<HEADLINE> Haider Predicts Immigration Ban  </HEADLINE>
   By ROLAND PRINZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Far-right populist Joerg Haider, whose party rose to
prominence in Austria after stoking anti-foreigner sentiment last fall,
predicted Saturday that a government featuring his party would impose a nearly
complete ban on immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider said the only foreigners who would be allowed to move to Austria
would be seasonal workers who would leave after several months.
</P>
<P>
	   He made the announcement as the stream of foreign criticism continued over
the possibility of his Freedom Party's inclusion in government. His party, now
Austria's second largest, has been talking to the Austrian People's Party about
forming a coalition that would control parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Undeterred by the furor abroad, negotiators from his party and the
center-right People's Party were planning to resume their talks aimed at setting
up a joint Cabinet next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider is known for once praising Adolf Hitler's ``orderly employment
policy,'' and for later lauding veterans of the Waffen SS as ``decent people of
good character.'' He has been apologizing ever since.
</P>
<P>
	   But his party made stunning gains in Austria's Oct. 3 parliamentary
elections, drawing heavily on voters who fear that EU expansion and a liberal
immigration policy will cost them their jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   By Saturday, most European governments had criticized Haider. The European
Union has warned Austria against setting up a government that includes Haider's
party, and Belgium is calling for common EU action if such a coalition
materializes.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those joining the chorus of critics were French President Jacques
Chirac, German President Johannes Rau and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Austria must see to it not to isolate itself politically,'' Schroeder told
the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Chirac was reportedly pressing the EU to take ``precise measures'' if
Haider's party joins the Austrian government. The measures were not specified.
</P>
<P>
	   Catherine Colonna, Chirac's spokeswoman, said the president called
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres to tell him it is ``indispensable''
that Austria's 14 European partners act quickly. Portugal currently holds the
rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider, reacting to Chirac's moves, said the French president ``had done
everything wrong that can be done wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president of the European Parliament, Nicole Fontaine, said on French
radio that the EU has sanction powers that would let it exclude member nations.
Guterres, meanwhile, phoned Austrian President Thomas Klestil to express his
concern over the political developments.
</P>
<P>
	   Answering questions on Austrian state radio, Haider said Saturday that his
party and the People's Party are in full agreement on what Austria's new
immigration policy should look like. He said it would be ``tantamount to a de
facto zero immigration'' and that the country should focus on integrating the
foreigners already in Austria instead of letting in more.
</P>
<P>
	   The only exception, he said, would be for seasonal tourism industry
laborers, who would be allowed in from abroad. He added that such a policy
``cannot be challenged internationally and on a European scale.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the radio interview, Haider said he was taking the foreign criticism in
stride.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Basically, such criticism was to be expected from those who cannot put up
with the fact that democracy means change, and democracy means that the people
can decide what they want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want a Europe of the citizens and not one of bureaucrats,'' Haider
stressed, reiterating his past criticisms of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   In a welcome distraction from the furor, Haider celebrated his 50th birthday
Saturday. Stunt fliers, costumed musicians and a giant apple strudel were on
hand as hundreds celebrated the popular leader's birthday near Villach, a
mountain town high in the Austrian Alps.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider visibly enjoyed the accolades from fans and Freedom Party colleagues.
After skiing to several mountain huts, he was cheered by about 300 people who
lined up to greet him and give him presents.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, he danced to alpine music well known in Carinthia province,
where he is governor.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Henry David Akin, a lawyer for more than seven decades and
lead partner in the Dallas law firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, died of
pneumonia Thursday. He was 100.
</P>
<P>
	   As an attorney, Akin mentored two young lawyers, Robert Strauss and Richard
Gump, and 21 years later became partners with them in an internationally known
law firm bearing their names. The firm now has more than 900 lawyers around the
world.
</P>
<P>
	   Akin was known for his vast legal experience.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan D. Feld, 63, senior executive partner and member of the firm since
1960, said he was constantly reminded of that fact.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about an individual case, Feld said, Akin ``would tell me what he
thought the law was and then he would quote from a Supreme Court of Texas case
that he personally had tried.''
</P>
<P>
	   Akin practiced law well into his 90s and taught at Southern Methodist
University's School of Law one hour a week for 32 years.
Tony Doyle
</P>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Tony Doyle, an Irish actor who was one of the stars of the
``Ballykissangel'' television series, died Friday at age 58.
</P>
<P>
	   Doyle died at St. Thomas's Hospital in London a few hours after collapsing
at his home, coroner John Bradley said. An autopsy was planned for Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   He received an Irish Television and Film Award last year for his role in the
television adaptation of John McGahern's novel, ``Amongst Women.''
</P>
<P>
	   Doyle appeared in numerous television productions, and was cast in two
recently released Irish films, ``I Went Down'' and ``A Love Divided.''
</P>
<P>
	   In ``Ballykissangel,'' a hit show that has run for the past four seasons
here, Doyle portrayed shady businessman Brian Quigley.
Francis Haskell
</P>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Francis Haskell, professor emeritus of the history of art at
Oxford University, died Jan. 18 of cancer. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
	   Haskell published his first book, ``Patrons and Painters: a Study of the
Relations between Art and Society in the Age of the Baroque,'' in 1963.
</P>
<P>
	   The book marked an important departure from the art history of its time,
which was mainly concerned with the development of styles and studies of
individual artists, according to an obituary in The Times of London.
</P>
<P>
	   Haskell instead was one of few who explored how art was commissioned and
created, The Times said.
</P>
<P>
	   When in 1967 he was elected professor of the history of art at Oxford, he
was only the second person to hold the title. It was a somewhat frustrating post
since the university did not offer a degree in art history, only a one-year
diploma course. Haskell retired in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Other books by Haskell included ``Rediscoveries In Art: Some Aspects Of
Taste, Fashion And Collecting In England And France,'' 1976; ``Taste And The
Antique; The Lure Of Classical Sculpture 1500-1900,'' co-authored by Nicholas
Penny, 1981; and ``History and Its Images: Art and The Interpretation Of The
Past,'' 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   He is survived by his wife, Larissa Salmina.
Martha Jean Steinberg
</P>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Martha Jean ``The Queen'' Steinberg, a longtime Detroit
radio personality, died Saturday of an undisclosed illness. She was 69.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Steinberg, an owner and president of WQBH-AM, was a major radio and
community personality since arriving here in 1963 from Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   Her message ``to bridge the gap between the power structure and the
forgotten man'' was heard weekdays on her radio show called ``Inspiration with
the Queen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her message of redemption, self-reliance, love and self-respect also was
heard in Detroit on WJLB-FM radio, where she worked from 1966 to 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do not know a soul who did not love her,'' Mayor Dennis Archer said.
``She was a visionary. She was prayerful. And she always sought ways to bring
people together.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Steinberg also was a partner in the MGM Grand Detroit casino.
</P>
<P>
	   A native of Memphis, Ms. Steinberg started her career at WDIA-AM, a
50,000-watt station that covered five states.
</P>
<P>
	   She was recognized by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 as one of
rock's pioneering deejays and was named ``Michiganian of the Year'' by The
Detroit News in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   She also was a nondenominational minister. In 1975, she founded the Home of
Love, a church, community center and low-income housing complex on Detroit's
west side.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include three daughters and two granddaughters.
Jerry Thompson
</P>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Jerry Thompson, a veteran journalist best known for
the series of award-winning articles he wrote after infiltrating the Ku Klux
Klan, died Friday after a long battle with colon cancer. He was 59.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson produced the series of newspaper articles on Klan activity in 1980
and 1981. He was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1988, and chronicled his battle
with the disease in his columns for The Tennessean.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, a former reporter for the newspaper, worked
alongside Thompson.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Jerry taught me first of all about newspapering -- getting the facts and
getting them right, and most of all, getting them first,'' Gore told The
Tennessean in a statement.

6-year-old Elian Gonzalez today, and President Fidel Castro vowed to carry on
such protests for 10 years if need be. The nationally televised event, the
latest in a series of daily rallies, mixed Cuban communist patriotism with

politicians and 1,000 business leaders, Clinton endorsed unfettered global trade
and investment -- as long as it recognizes concerns about workplace safety and a
clean environment. Protests were also a presence in Davos. Outside the town's
Congress Center, where Clinton spoke, police fired warning shots and tear gas in

<HEADLINE> Texas Families Asses Blast Damage  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT SLAGLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GATESVILLE, Texas (AP) -- Robert Shoaf knelt over one of the 10 craters now
dotting his property and sighed in disbelief as he clasped a jagged strip of
artillery shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One hundred yards that way, it would have hit my house,'' Shoaf said
Saturday, pointing west to the home he shares with his wife, Joan, about 100
miles southwest of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   Just days earlier, Shoaf and 11 other family members who live on the
300-acre cattle ranch were ducking for cover as Army battalions eight miles away
at Fort Hood launched a volley of 155 mm Howitzer artillery shells toward their
property.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It roared like a whistle, and then a bomb exploded,'' the 70-year-old
said. ``I didn't know what it was until the next morning when we found the
holes.''
</P>
<P>
	   A 4-foot length of the foundation of his home cracked, and chunks of
shrapnel lodged in the nearby home of his son Jay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was unreal, like a war zone,'' said Jay Shoaf's wife, Tammy.
</P>
<P>
	   The force of Wednesday night's blasts, which continued for about an hour,
shook pictures off of walls, broke a chandelier in the family room and cracked
sections of dry wall.
</P>
<P>
	   The shelling happened during a training exercise involving two artillery
battalions, said Lt. Col. Maryane Cummings, a spokeswoman for Fort Hood.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're really concerned about safety so that is why we stopped all practice
firing until we find out what happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cummings said she would not speculate on what went wrong. She said base
officials are conducting an investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Shoaf said Army officials had been out to survey the damage on Friday
and were expected to return to meet with the family on Tuesday. His family wants
some assurance that it won't happen again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We still live here,'' said Tammy Shoaf. ``They better check their
instruments before they start up again.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Nixes Indefinite INS Jailing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Another federal judge has ruled that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service cannot indefinitely hold immigrants who have been ordered
deported for crimes but whose native countries refuse to accept them.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter's ruling affects 130 legal immigrants
being held at detention centers in central California who already have served
prison time for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatter said the policy violates the immigrants' rights to due process.
Concluding that they pose a flight risk or danger is not sufficient reason to
detain them for what amounts to the rest of their lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has agreed to review a similar ruling
by a federal judge in Seattle. That case is scheduled to be argued next month,
but a decision likely is several months away.
</P>
<P>
	   The 130 immigrants affected by Thursday's ruling have all completed prison
sentences that averaged about three years, Deputy Federal Public Defender David
McLane said Saturday. Their cases will have to be heard by magistrate judges
before they are released.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Theoretically, everybody gets out, hopefully over the next couple of
months,'' Deputy Federal Public Defender Robert Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the immigrants was sentenced to a day in jail for stealing a razor
from Sears and food from a grocery store. He has been in custody for three
years, Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationwide, the INS holds about 3,800 people in indefinite custody for
crimes ranging from petty theft to murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The practice has been upheld by federal judges in San Diego and Nevada, and
by federal appeals courts in New Orleans and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatter's ruling was hailed by civil liberties groups that have criticized
the INS policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a resounding rejection of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service argument that they can hold someone forever,'' said Lucas Guttentag,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The court recognized that the purpose of immigration detention is to
effectuate deportation, not to sentence someone to life in prison,'' Guttentag
said.

</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, as a senior Justice Department attorney, Greene drafted much of the
1965 Voting Rights Act as well as the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
	   On the bench, Greene was known as an organized judge who combined a gentle
manner with firm control over his courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Born Heinz Gruenhaus in Frankfurt, Germany, in February 1923, Greene became
a U.S. citizen and Americanized his name after his Jewish parents fled Germany
in 1939.
</P>
<P>
	   He earned his law degree at night at George Washington University, became an
assistant U.S. attorney and later moved to Justice Department headquarters,
heading the Civil Rights Division's appeals and research section.
</P>
<P>
	   Burke Marshall, who headed the division at the time, once recalled that
Greene's section wrote the legal briefs leading to the Supreme Court's 1962
ruling that congressional districts must represent approximately an equal number
of people.
</P>
<P>
	   Greene took senior status on the District Court with a reduced workload on
Aug. 6, 1995, 30 years to the day after President Johnson named him to the
District of Columbia Court of General Sessions. In 1978, President Carter
promoted him to the federal bench from the chief judgeship of the D.C. Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   Greene was proud that he persuaded former President Reagan to testify on
videotape in former national security adviser John Poindexter's 1990 Iran-Contra
trial without a Supreme Court confrontation. Reagan had resisted, but Greene
said that when the time came, ``I found him very pleasant. He didn't put on any
airs.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1986, Greene blocked the Library of Congress from banning from its
building five people who had protested cuts in the library's public hours.
``Banning is not one of the remedies present in the U.S. Constitution,'' he
wrote. ``Perhaps in the Soviet Union or South Africa, but not here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Greene acknowledged he was considered an activist judge, telling The
Associated Press, ``I do tend to hold in favor of the person who's gotten the
raw deal.''
</P>
<P>
	   He unsuccessfully attacked federal sentencing guidelines that sharply limit
judges' discretion. He and some fellow jurists insisted the guidelines give
prosecutors too much power to determine sentences by deciding what charges to
file.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his varied achievements, even Greene's friends persisted in linking
him to the AT&AMP;T case.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 1995 interview, then-White House counsel Abner Mikva, former chief
judge of the federal appeals court in Washington, recalled an incident when he
and Greene were going to another judge's Christmas party.
</P>
<P>
	   On the way over, Mikva said, Greene was grumbling that people had descended
on him at a telephone store when he went in to buy a phone and someone had
spotted him as the man who made phone-shopping possible.
</P>
<P>
	   That's the price of presiding over a big case, Mikva said he told his
colleague. And when they arrived at the party, Greene heard it all over again --
this time from then-Chief Justice Warren Burger.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Burger said, `Harold, let me tell you what you've done to my phone
bill,''' Mikva said. He recalled that Greene ``just gave me that wry smile.''
</P>
<P>
	   Greene leaves his wife, Evelyn, a son, a daughter and three grandchildren.

had cornered Gore in debate on Wednesday, pressing him to concede his
inconsistency on abortion rights. The National Right to Life Committee gave Gore

<HEADLINE> Report: Kohl Rejects Accusations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Former chancellor Helmut Kohl strongly rejected accusations
that money changed hands under the table in a deal involving a former East
German refinery, a newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview published in Welt am Sonntag, Kohl echoed an earlier denial
by his spokesman that he had discussed money with then-French President Francois
Mitterrand in making the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I at no time received money, and also had no knowledge whatsoever about
shady financial machinations,'' the newspaper quoted Kohl as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   A report by German and French television claimed last weekend that
Mitterrand arranged for payment of $15 million to the Christian Democrats in
1992 to help the campaign of his friend Kohl, part of payoffs for the deal by
French oil concern Elf Aquitaine to buy the Leuna refinery.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The accusations now raised -- that Mitterrand allowed me to receive 30
million marks for the campaign in connection with Elf Aquitaine's involvement in
Leuna -- are absurd,'' Kohl was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   They are ``a terrible concoction of unproven statements, slander and
anonymous tips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl said that making the Leuna deal happen prevented mass unemployment in
the area of the refinery, and said he even acted against West German companies
that would have preferred to go without the competition.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl underscored that he at no time discussed concrete details of the deal
with Mitterrand, saying those were not the things that politicians dealt with.

<HEADLINE> Spy Agency Confirms Computer Outage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The super-secret National Security Agency confirmed
Saturday night that it had a ``serious computer problem'' last week that
affected its ability to process intelligence information.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency issued a brief statement a few hours after the outage was
reported by ABC News, which said its sources characterized the problem as the
biggest computer failure in the history of the NSA.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This problem, which was contained to the NSA headquarters complex at Fort
Meade, Md., did not affect intelligence collection, but did affect the
processing of intelligence information,'' the agency statement said. ``NSA
systems were impacted for 72 hours.''
</P>
<P>
	   It said the outage started at 7 p.m. EST Monday and that the system was
restored on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no evidence of malice or no evidence of a Y2K problem,'' said an
agency official who asked not to be identified by name.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Contingency plans were immediately put into effect that called on other
aspects of the NSA system to assume some of the load,'' the agency statement
said. ``While intelligence collection continued, NSA technicians worked to
recover the IT (information technology) infrastructure. That backlog of
intelligence processing is almost complete and NSA is confident that no
significant intelligence information has been lost.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said the agency ``is currently operating within the window of
normal operations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Until a few years ago, the National Security Agency was so secret there was
no public acknowledgment by the government of its existence and employees could
be disciplined for merely saying they worked there.
</P>
<P>
	   It specializes in electronic intelligence gathering through satellites,
telephone intercepts and other methods.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Department acknowledged earlier this month that it made mistakes
in its pre-New Year's Eve testing of a Y2K correction for a computer system that
processes imagery from intelligence satellites.
</P>
<P>
	   The computer system broke down that night, interrupting the flow of by
satellite information for several hours.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Pentagon insisted the trouble did not jeopardize U.S. national
security.

<HEADLINE> Bradley gets "almost endorsement"  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - Bill Bradley is getting "an almost endorsement"
from the conservative New Hampshire Sunday News.
<P>
	   The newspaper said Saturday it will publish an editorial headlined "Almost
an Endorsement," "Committed Democrats Should Vote for Bradley."
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper and its daily companion, The Union Leader, rarely endorse
Democrats in presidential elections. In Tuesday's primary, the newspapers have
endorsed Republican Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   An excerpt of the editorial says Vice President Al Gore's "dishonesty in
this campaign makes him an unacceptable choice for Democratic-leaning voters."
</P>
<P>
	   The reference apparently is to the latest fight between Bradley and Gore
over the vice president's past statements regarding abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has suggested Gore has misrepresented his own record, as well as
others. Bradley insists Gore once opposed abortion, yet during this campaign he
claims he always supported a woman's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley rhetorically asked supporters Saturday in Manchester: how can women
trust somebody who doesn't tell the truth in a campaign to tell the truth as
president?
</P>
<P>
	   Gore retracted his 13-year-old statement equating abortion to "the taking of
a human life" as he scrambled to keep the issue, a traditional stumbling block
for Republicans, from tripping him up against Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes, my position has changed," Gore said Saturday. "I strongly support a
woman's right to choose and if (Bradley) disputes that, then he is making a
mistake."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley began airing a new television ad in the state Saturday in which the
former New Jersey senator calls himself the only presidential candidate who "has
been pro-choice for everyone all the time."

<HEADLINE> Bradley Details Heart Condition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley said he has
required anesthesia for treatment of his irregular heartbeat, but his doctor
reaffirmed that he is fit to be president, The New York Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, 56, has known he has a heart irregularity known as atrial
fibrillation since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Three times after attacks of fibrillation, Bradley has needed a procedure
known as cardioversion, in which the heart is jolted with electricity to snap it
back into normal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
	   Before undergoing a cardioversion, a patient is made unconscious for several
minutes with an anesthetic and sedative to avoid feeling the burning pain from
the jolts of electricity, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with the paper, Bradley recalled: ``They give you
anesthesia, you kind of drift, and then when you wake up they say you are back
in rhythm. When you wake up, you are completely alert, you can function.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what he would do if he needed such a procedure as president, Bradley
told the paper he might have to invoke the 25th Amendment, using its provisions
to turn over executive power to his vice president temporarily.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Interesting, I do not know,'' Bradley said. ``I have not thought of
that.'' He added that ``the 25th Amendment sounds a reasonable way to go,'' but
that this was ``a decision that I can make down the road a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's doctors told the paper he is in excellent physical condition and
that his bouts of irregular heartbeat were not a serious threat to his health or
to his ability to be president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley ``should be able to function perfectly fine as president,'' said Dr.
Robert H. Heissenbuttel, his personal physician at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Bradley said he experienced another irregular heartbeat episode
several days earlier. It was his fifth in the past month, but didn't require a
doctor's attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley disclosed on Dec. 10 -- after he had to cancel a campaign event
because his heart wouldn't stop racing -- that he has the condition since 1996.
The former senator called the condition a minor irritation, and said he hadn't
felt the need to reveal his condition.

<HEADLINE> Gore Changes Abortion Position  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore retracted his 13-year-old
statement equating abortion to ``the taking of a human life'' as he scrambled
Saturday to keep the issue, a traditional stumbling block for Republicans, from
tripping him up against Democrat Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, my position has changed,'' Gore said. ``I strongly support a woman's
right to choose and if (Bradley) disputes that, then he is making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley began airing a new television ad in the state Saturday in which the
former New Jersey senator calls himself the only presidential candidate who
``has been pro-choice for everyone all the time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in Manchester, Bradley said, ``I was pro-choice from the day I
entered politics. ... It's not an issue you can dance around.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the conservative New Hampshire Sunday News said it was giving
``an almost endorsement'' to Bradley because Gore's ``dishonesty in this
campaign makes him an unacceptable choice for Democratic-leaning voters.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Sunday paper and it's daily companion, The Union Leader, rarely endorses
Democrats in presidential primaries. The papers have already endorsed Steve
Forbes in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
	   To try and settle the bedrock abortion question for many Democratic women,
Gore indulged several reporters' questions as, coffee in hand, he walked through
Milford's town square.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who represented Tennessee in the House from 1977-85 and the Senate
from 1985-93, was asked whether he still believes that abortion -- in the
questioner's words -- ``is the taking of a human life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Obviously prepared, Gore was quick to recall that he had qualified the
statement at the time. ``I didn't write that. I didn't. I used the word
'arguably,' and yes, my position has changed,'' Gore acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, in a 1987 letter to a constituent, Gore wrote that abortion ``is
arguably the taking of a human life.'' In any event, Gore added that he ``would
not use that phrasing today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said the only abortion matter with which he had wrestled was whether
public money should help pay for abortions for poor women -- the Medicaid
funding for abortions he says he now supports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've always supported keeping abortion legal and I've always been attacked
by the anti-choice groups for that position since the beginning of my career,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the National Right to Life Committee gave Gore an 84 percent
approval rating for anti-abortion votes he cast while in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League
rated Gore's House career decidedly ``anti-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among the 30 votes the group scored against Gore was his ``yea'' in 1984 to
define the word ``person'' under four existing civil rights laws to include
``unborn children from the moment of conception.'' The organization
characterized that as a move toward an ``all out prohibition on abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nancy Greaney, a Gore supporter and former teacher from Bedford, was
surprised to learn of Gore's record but said, ``I'd never hold it against him.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people's opinions and beliefs evolve,'' Greaney said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellie Bosman, an undecided Democrat who shook hands with Gore in the Milford
square Saturday, was conflicted about reports of Gore's abortion record.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it's a crime to change your mind, but I wish more
politicians would admit they changed their minds,'' the retired teacher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the case, Bosman added, Bradley ``demeaned Gores character by
implying he lied.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had cornered Gore in debate on Wednesday, pressing him to concede
his inconsistency on abortion rights. In the days since, the vice president has
faced more questions about his record.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley orchestrated the debate question and follow-up TV commercial in a
drive to undercut Gore's support among women and reverse his own slip in polls
in time for Tuesday's first-in-the-nation primary.
</P>
<P>
	   A front page article Friday in The Boston Globe, which has a large
circulation in New Hampshire, questioned the veracity of Gore's statement in
debate that he ``had always been for a woman's right to choose.'' Asked Friday
afternoon about the morning paper's story, Gore, a former journalist and avid
news reader, said he had not seen it.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman caller to New Hampshire public radio the same day told Gore on-air:
``I understand if you've changed your position in your career but ... I don't
know how I can support your candidacy if you're dishonest about such an
important subject and especially on national television.''
</P>
<P>
	   Spooked at the prospect of doubt taking hold, the Gore campaign rounded up a
testimonial from feminist Gloria Steinem and signatures from 42 members of
Congress in an ``open letter'' stating what Gore once had counted on being
obvious in this election: ``Al Gore is pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   That letter was e-mailed to hundreds of reporters and passed around a state
Democratic dinner. It was followed by a list of 300 New Hampshire women pledging
their support for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane called the flurry of paper ``an effort to help
the press.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also went to air Saturday night with a TV ad labeling himself
``pro-education, pro-environment, pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Bradley backers stood outside Gore's
town meeting in Lebanon to distribute a 1984 letter in which Gore wrote, ``It is
my deep personal conviction that abortion is wrong. ... innocent human life must
be protected.''
</P>
<P>
	   Said Nadler, ``He wrote this and voted to give civil rights protection to
the fetus. So, if he says he was always pro-choice, he's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, Gore told his audience that Bradley has sought in recent days ``to
manufacture some differences on issues where there really are no differences.''
Of the 13 questions he fielded from voters, none was about abortion.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines To Test TV on Jets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- Starting this spring, passengers on one Alaska Airlines jet
will be able to watch ESPN, the Learning Channel and CNN during flights. If
enough passengers tune in, the airline may offer satellite TV in all of its
jetliners.
</P>
<P>
	   While many international flights and some transcontinental flights offer
movies, most shorter domestic flights don't provide video entertainment. Alaska
Airlines' test plane will have small video screens on the backs of all its
seats, giving passengers access to the shorter programs on 24 cable channels.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our programs, for the most part, come in 30-minute segments. That's perfect
for these short-haul flights," said Terry Ferguson, vice president of business
development and strategic planning for DirecTV, which is providing the
programming.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines officials must decide whether to charge for the service or
offer it free.
</P>
<P>
	   Costs for the service are high. The antenna needed to capture the television
signals bounced off satellites by DirecTV costs about $250,000 per airplane,
experts say, while adding the screens could cost $8,000 per seat.
</P>
<P>
	   The views of business travelers would carry much weight in Alaska Airlines'
test, and business travelers interviewed Friday at Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport didn't think much of the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wouldn't convince me to switch," said Tony Damiano, a plastics salesman
from Oakland, Calif. "I'm more concerned with routes. Alaska only flies north
and south, and about half my trips are west to east. And besides, I don't want
to split up my frequent flier miles."
</P>
<P>
	   Mel Spencer, who owns a chain of furniture rental stores and has homes in
Phoenix and Puyallup, Wash., also was skeptical of the service.

<HEADLINE> Bush Brings Parents Into Campaign  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush, who would be president,
campaigned for the first time Saturday alongside his father, who once was, as
the field of White House hopefuls plowed toward this week's leadoff New
Hampshire primary. Bill Bradley charged Al Gore was trying to ``dance around''
earlier qualms about abortion as he bid to cut into the vice president's core
Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
	   With the polls pointing to a tight finish, at least on the Republican side,
Sen. John McCain mocked Bush's endgame strategy as ``quick, get me another
endorsement'' from the GOP establishment. People lining up behind the
front-runner now are ``the same ones running our party in 1996 and 1998, when we
lost elections,'' said the Arizona senator, who has come from far back in the
pack to within striking distance of victory in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who has moved past Bradley in recent polls, sought to blunt his
rival's attack on his position on abortion and his credibility. Asked whether he
would say abortion ``is arguably the taking of a human life,'' as he wrote to a
constituent 1987, the vice president said, ``I would not use that phrasing
today.''
</P>
<P>
	   He quickly added, though, that ``on the narrow question, I've always
supported Roe v. Wade. I've always supported keeping abortion legal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, meanwhile, acknowledged in an interview being published Sunday by
The New York Times that he has briefly undergone anesthesia three times for
treatment of his irregular heart beat since December 1996. Bradley's physician
reiterated in the article that the condition does not inhibit Bradley's ability
to serve as president.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, who finished a strong second in last week's Iowa caucuses,
Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer all made their rounds on the campaign's final weekend,
hoping for surprises in Tuesday's vote that would catapult them into the thick
of the GOP race. Forbes released new radio commercials attacking Bush for
failing to be a firm enough foe of abortion, and for overseeing a big increase
in spending in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowds were bigger Saturday, the political theater more entertaining, as
New Hampshire voters prepared to render their verdict. A man stood on a
Manchester street corner, wearing a Bill Clinton mask and waving a Bush placard.
His presence on a wind-whipped day underscored that this begins the flood of
primaries that will lead to election of the current president's successor.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, after months of campaigning and thousands of candidate speeches, not
everyone was ready to declare a preference. ``I'm slow to make my decision,''
said Robi Jackson, 57, of Portsmouth, who described herself as leaning toward
Bush. ``My feeling is they all have wonderful ideas, but when you get to
Washington, well, you know what they say: `Talk is cheap.'''
</P>
<P>
	   A Bush victory Tuesday would cement his credentials as front-runner and
damage, if not cripple, McCain's ability to sustain his challenge. The Texas
governor began his day in Portsmouth, where he appeared before one of the
largest crowds he's seen thus far, an estimated 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   From there, he went to Milford, where he posed for a Bush family political
appearance. Father George Bush, mother Barbara and other family members flanked
him, joined as well by Elizabeth Dole, the wife of the 1996 presidential nominee
and herself a campaign dropout this time around.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This boy, this son of ours, is not going to let you down,'' promised the
former president -- who ran three times in the New Hampshire primary and won
twice. ``He's going to go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I heard my family was coming up here to knock on doors it gave me
that extra impetus to keep charging in New Hampshire,'' said his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Aboard McCain's campaign bus, the candidate said the GOP establishment ``has
become more and more alarmed'' at the possibility of his victory. ``We've
interfered with a coronation.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic race, Bradley unveiled a new television ad that said of
abortion, ``This is the kind of issue that you can't straddle.'' Campaigning
during the day, the former New Jersey senator said, ``I was pro-choice from the
day I entered politics, and I will always be pro-choice. It's not an issue you
can dance around.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said in campaign debate last week that he had once opposed federal
funding for abortions under Medicaid but had otherwise always been for abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yes, my position has changed,'' Gore said. ``I strongly support a woman's
right to choose, and if (Bradley) disputes that, then he is making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer plunged into the Democratic dispute, questioning Gore's candor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I almost fell off my chair ... when I saw Al Gore deny that he had ever
been pro-life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When it comes to an issue this profound, a politician that plays games on
something involving life and death I think loses all credibility to aspire to
the White House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes said he doesn't plan any abrupt change in strategy in the final days
of a race that looks bleak for him. ``I think one of the things most important
for us is to walk the walk with integrity. It's dictated by the fact that I
think this is what the country needs,'' he said.

<P>
    TORONTO (AP) -- Steve Thomas scored two goals, including the winner with 19
seconds left, as the Toronto Maple Leafs rallied from a two-goal deficit to beat
the Los Angeles Kings 3-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan Berard and Thomas scored 90 seconds apart early in the third period to
tie the game, then teamed up for the decisive goal. Berard's wrist shot from the
point was deflected by Thomas past goalie Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
	   After getting booed by their fans at various stages of the first and second
periods, the Leafs came out strong in the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Igor Korolev found Berard behind the Kings' defense and Berard skated in
alone on Fiset and beat him with a deke to the backhand at 5:02 for his third
goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas tied it at 6:32 when he flipped a Mats Sundin pass over Fiset.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan Smolinski and Jere Karalahti scored in the first period for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles outshot Toronto 31-21 and the Leafs were 0-for-4 on the power
play.
</P>
<P>
	   Smolinski opened the scoring 4:11 in when his attempted pass across the slot
to Jason Blake deflected off Toronto defenseman Tomas Kaberle's stick past
Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles went ahead 2-0 at 13:36 on a power play when Karalahti's slap
shot from the point went through a screen created by Blake. Karalahti, a
24-year-old rookie, has three goals and nine points in 16 games since joining
the Kings from Finland. He missed the first month of the season waiting for visa
problems to be rectified.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Six U.N. agencies are appealing for $190
million in aid for more than 8 million people in Ethiopia hit by natural
disasters or displaced by fighting, news reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   There are about 7.8 million people threatened by famine due to drought and
flooding in Ethiopia, and hundreds of thousands of others who have been forced
to leave their homes, the newspaper Ethiopian Herald reported, citing a U.N.
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The appeal lists a number of priority interventions in food assistance,
health, water sanitation, nutrition, education, special protection needs and
agriculture,'' said Samuel Nyambi, the chief representative of the U.N.
Development Program.
</P>
<P>
	   Other U.N. agencies joining in the call for Ethiopian aid include the World
Health Organization, UNICEF, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the Food
and Agriculture Organization and the U.N. Population Fund.

    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Jamie McLennan stopped 21 shots and got his first win in
more than two months as the St. Louis Blues beat the Colorado Avalanche 4-0
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The shutout was McLennan's second of the season and seventh of his career.
McLennan's last shutout came in his most recent win, Nov. 26 against Buffalo.
McLennan snapped a four-game winless streak with the win.
</P>
<P>
	   The shutout was St. Louis' seventh of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig Conroy scored two goals, including one short-handed, to lead the
Blues.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Pellerin added a short-handed goal, marking the second time this
season St. Louis scored two short-handed goals in a game.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was the first for St. Louis against Colorado since April 4,
1998, a span of seven games.
</P>
<P>
	   Conroy scored his short-handed goal at 15:10 of the first to give St. Louis
the lead. Conroy beat Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy for his ninth of the
season.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis got second-period goals from Michal Handzus and Pellerin to make
it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
	   Conroy added his second goal of the game in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Roy stopped 17 of 21 shots he faced and lost for the first time in 10 games.
Roy was replaced with 9:38 remaining by Marc Denis.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis coach Joel Quenneville received a game-misconduct at 8:06 of the
third period for arguing a penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado played without five regulars on Saturday, including its third
leading scorer Joe Sakic who has a groin pull.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis' leading scorer Pierre Turgeon left the game in the first period
with a sprained thumb.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado ended its five-game road trip with a record of 1-3-1.

<P>
    SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Ray Whitney and Bret Hedican scored and Mike Vernon
stopped a season-high 38 shots Saturday night as Florida ended a two-game losing
skid with a 2-1 victory over Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
	   Vernon had a great stop with his glove on Georges Laraque with 11:56 left.
He also stopped Tom Poti, while sliding down, a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida had lost consecutive games to Eastern Conference powers New Jersey
and Philadelphia, and was 1-3-1 in its five games prior to Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oilers had won two straight, and scored seven goals Friday against the
Lightning.
</P>
<P>
	   Edmonton had notched at least a point in seven consecutive games. It was
only the second time this month the Oilers played a game and did not earn a
point.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida has not lost three in a row since dropping seven straight last March
31-Apr. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oilers jumped out to a 1-0 lead just 2:54 in when Mike Grier one-timed a
shot from the slot past Vernon.
</P>
<P>
	   The Panthers scored a pair of goals three minutes apart to go up 2-1 after
the first. Whitney scored a power-play goal at 4:21 on a shot from just inside
the blue line, his 299th NHL point, then Hedican's slap shot beat Tommy Salo at
7:21.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitney's goal, his 22nd, broke a 1-for-19 power play dry spell for the
Panthers.
</P>
<P>
	   Vernon improved to 13-9-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Edmonton will play eight of nine games on the road.

<HEADLINE> Cult Accused in Attack Offers Money  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT STODDARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO, Japan (AP) -- As part of its campaign to clean up its image, the cult
accused in the 1995 nerve-gas attack on Tokyo subways offered Saturday to pay a
total of $1.14 million a year as compensation to the victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Tatsuko Muraoka, who replaced Shoko Asahara as guru of the Aum Shinri Kyo
cult this month, said several tens of thousands of dollars will be paid to the
victims immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't intend to deny that I bear a heavy responsibility,'' said Fumihiro
Joyu, one of the cult's leaders, appearing before reporters for the first time
since his release from prison last month.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear how many people the cult was offering to
compensate.
</P>
<P>
	   Aum, which recently changed its name to Aleph, also said it will start a
personal computer company and transfer all proceeds into a victims fund.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement comes as Aum tries to soften its image. Tokyo toughened its
laws last month to let authorities seize Aum's assets more easily and monitor
the cult more closely.
</P>
<P>
	   A government panel is preparing to announce in the coming week what affect
the decision will have on Aum.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the cult apologized for the subway gassing that killed 12 people
and sickened 5,500 people -- something it had refused to do for the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
	   The cult's recent expressions of contrition, however, have been received
with deep skepticism by the Japanese public not only because of its timing but
also because the cult has not opened its books.
</P>
<P>
	   Police say it earns about $66 million a year from its discount computer
chain stores. The cult is believed to operate other businesses and have revenue
from followers' donations. It can also sell its assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Aum had promised to compensate the victims, but Saturday's announcement was
the first time it gave figures and some details on the compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   Joyu, who acknowledged Asahara's involvement in the gassing, defended
Asahara's teachings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I approve of our exalted teacher Asahara's spiritual practices,'' Joyu
told reporters at the cult's Yokohama office.
</P>
<P>
	   Joyu, who was never charged in the subway gassing, denied knowing about the
attack in advance but said he had been overexuberant in defending the cult and
denying its guilt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to apologize for that,'' Joyu said, appearing before the cameras
in a conservative suit instead of the loose robes that used to be the cult
trademark.
</P>
<P>
	   Asahara is on trial on charges of masterminding the sarin gassing. Cult
members have also been charged in the slaying of an anti-cult lawyer and his
family, the murders of wayward followers and a separate sarin gassing that
killed seven people and sickened more than 200 in a residential area in central
Japan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the victims have received only a portion of the damages set by the
Japanese courts. Only 1,136 people have come forward to claim compensation,
partly because of fears they may lose their jobs if people find out they are
sarin victims.

	   BERLIN (AP) -- Former chancellor Helmut Kohl strongly rejected accusations
that money changed hands under the table in a deal involving a former East
German refinery, a newspaper reported Sunday. In an interview published in Welt
am Sonntag, Kohl echoed an earlier denial by his spokesman that he had discussed
money with then-French President Francois Mitterrand in making the deal. A
report by German and French television claimed last weekend that Mitterrand
arranged for payment of $15 million to the Christian Democrats in 1992 to help
the campaign of his friend Kohl, part of payoffs for the deal by French oil
concern Elf Aquitaine to buy the Leuna refinery.

<HEADLINE> Bruins Owner Raps Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Bruins coach Pat Burns said he had no quarrel with
owner Jeremy Jacobs, who blamed coaching for the team's lackluster performance
this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can understand Jeremy's position," Burns said before Saturday night's 1-0
victory over the Buffalo Sabres. "When you own a multi-million dollar business,
you can damn well criticize who you want."
</P>
<P>
	   Burns recently notched his 400th career victory and is only the 14th coach
in NHL history to reach that milestone. He has also coached in 800 games with a
.569 winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
	   "Pat is a hell of a coach, but with all their injuries, he is playing with
the Providence Bruins roster and he is still doing a good job," Buffalo Sabres
coach Lindy Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston, 17-21-13-4, has stumbled in part because of goalie Byron Dafoe's
contract holdout and forward Jason Allison's season-ending injury.
</P>
<P>
	   "This thing coming out today was surprising," Bruins captain Ray Bourque
said. "We don't need that right now and it is a distraction."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins, fighting for the Eastern Conference's final playoff spot, were
expected to compete for the conference title this season. Their poor performance
has caused the typically hands-off Jacobs to speak out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think our team has been managed well by Harry (Sinden) and Mike
(O'Connell)," Jacobs told The Boston Globe, referring to the general manager and
his assistant. "But our coaching has not been what I think it should be.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think our coaches need to do a better job. I don't feel our fans are
getting what they deserve. They should be getting better than what we've done."

<HEADLINE> 2 dead in Plainfield house fire, 7 others escape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PLAINFIELD, N.J. (AP) - Two people died early Saturday morning in a
house fire as firefighters desperately tried to reach them. Seven others inside
the burning home were able to escape, officials said.
<P>
	   Fire officials said the blaze appears to have started accidentally.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire at 707 W. 4th St. began shortly before 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Fire Chief Paul Newborn said the victims appeared to have been living
in the basement of the 2 1/2-story home.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthonius Eugene, 24, and Irene Cancel, 23, died in the blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   No other injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was under control around 10 a.m., Newborn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Newborn said there were smoke detectors upstairs, which had alerted the
residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from the Union County Arson Task Force focused their attention
primarily on the basement, where the two had perished.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're calling (the fire) accidental from a heat source," said Newborn, who
would not say whether a space heater had caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had some reports of space heaters (downstairs)," said Newborn. "But
we're pretty sure at this point that the fire started in the basement. However,
it remains under further investigation."
</P>
<P>
	   Timothy Jack, 32, has lived on W. 4th St. for 15 years, and said keeping
warm during the colder months has always been a problem for people living in
these multiple-family homes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Like everyone else around here, you leave your oven on to keep warm," he
said. "I mean, look at these old houses with these old windows. That's the only
way you can keep warm."
</P>
<P>
	   Newborn said there was no stove in the basement living area.
</P>
<P>
	   The owner of the building was at the scene several hours after the fire had
been declared under control, but he refused to speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Departments from several neighboring departments were also called to help
battle the blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   The seven survivors had been placed temporarily in a nearby hotel off Route
22, officials said. Their names had not been released.

    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vitali Yachmenev scored a short-handed goal and an
empty-net tally and Tomas Vokoun made 34 saves Saturday night, leading the
Nashville Predators to a 3-1 win over the Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Nashville's third win in four games, moving the second-year Predators
within four points of the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The Flames lost their third straight and second in 24 hours. Calgary lost
4-1 Friday night at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville defenseman Mark Millar scored the first goal on a long wrist shot
that sailed past Flames goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere's left skate.
</P>
<P>
	   Vokoun was at his best in the third period, stopping 18 of 19 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Yachmenev made it 2-0 on a short-handed breakaway 4:39 into the third when
he slipped a back-hander by Giguere before slamming face-first into the rear
boards.
</P>
<P>
	   Valeri Bure scored Calgary's only goal with 44.5 seconds left, a
sixth-attacker goal in a scramble of players. Yachmenev scored into the empty
net with one second left in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   With 9:11 remaining in the second, and Nashville ahead 1-0, the crowd of
16,729 came to its feet when the Predators wished the Tennessee Titans well in
Sunday's Super Bowl against the St. Louis Rams.

<HEADLINE> Under Jordan, Wizards Fire Coach  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH WHITE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gar Heard was fired Saturday night as coach of the
Washington Wizards, the team's first major move since Michael Jordan became head
of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Heard was fired after the Wizards' 103-98 victory over the Cleveland
Cavaliers. Washington is 14-30 and in last place in the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
	   Rod Higgins, an assistant with the Golden State Warriors and a former
teammate of Jordan's in Chicago, will be the new coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan, in Atlanta for the Super Bowl, was not with the team when the
announcement was made.
</P>
<P>
	   "I mentioned that when I was became a member of the Washington Wizards that
I would evaluate the team and the coaching staff," Jordan was quoted as saying
in a statement released by the team. "I felt it was necessary to make a change
at this time."
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan joined the team Jan. 19 and vowed to shake things up. It was
immediately clear that Heard was on the hit list. Heard had very little
one-on-one contact with Jordan from the start, and Jordan put on a jersey and
used his own motivational tactics to liven up one of Heard's practices on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "You never have a chance to show what you can do," Heard said.
"Unfortunately that's the nature of the business. I think they had their mind
made up when he got here. I never got an opportunity to talk to him. When you
come in you want to bring your own people. Next time things will work better."
</P>
<P>
	   The Wizards job was a long-awaited break for Heard, who toiled for 12 years
as an assistant with Dallas, Indiana, Philadelphia and Detroit. His only
previous head coaching experience in the NBA was in 1993 as interim coach of the
Dallas Mavericks, who were 9-44 under him.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sure this won't be my last opportunity," Heard said. "When you get
older you have to work a little harder."
</P>
<P>
	   Heard's old-school style didn't suit thirtysomething veterans, particularly
point guard Rod Strickland, who is notoriously late for practices and admits to
not giving his all on the practice court.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been tough around here," Strickland said. "The atmosphere hasn't been
good. It's been a lot of negativity, so put it on the players, put it on the
coaches, put it on everybody -- things weren't right, and it wasn't fun."
</P>
<P>
	   Said Heard: "You still need players to win in this league. Maybe now they
will step up."
</P>
<P>
	   Also fired were assistants Butch Beard and Mike Bratz. Assistant Tree
Rollins will be retained.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wizards haven't won a playoff game in 12 years, and Higgins will be the
team's fifth coach since 1996, following Jim Lynam, Bernie Bickerstaff, Jim
Brovelli and Heard.
</P>
<P>
	   Higgins, who turned 40 on Monday, will be a first-time head coach. He has
been an assistant with the Warriors for six seasons, following a 13-year playing
career with Chicago, Seattle, San Antonio, New Jersey, Sacramento, Cleveland and
Golden State. He played with Jordan in Chicago in the 1984-85 season and again
at the end of the 1985-86 season.
</P>
<P>
	   General manager Wes Unseld would not confirm Higgins' hiring, but several
players said they were told that Higgins would be the coach.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coach Heard also mentioned that Rod Higgins would come in and be our coach
for the rest of the year," forward Juwan Howard said. "I watched him as a kid
growing up when he was with the Chicago Bulls."
</P>
<P>
	   Heard and the players were caught off guard by the news, which came after a
sloppy but tense home victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "The timing was kind of funny," forward Aaron Williams said. "Everybody's
spirits were up after a good win that we really needed."
</P>
<P>
	   Most players, however, figured something was in the air, given the team's
woes and Jordan's vow to turn around the franchise.
</P>
<P>
	   "It can't get any worse, I don't think," Strickland said. "At least I hope."

<HEADLINE> Bradley gets "almost endorsement"  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) - Bill Bradley is getting "an almost endorsement"
from the conservative New Hampshire Sunday News.
<P>
	   The newspaper said Saturday it will publish an editorial headlined "Almost
an Endorsement," "Committed Democrats Should Vote for Bradley."
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper and its daily companion, The Union Leader, rarely endorse
Democrats in presidential elections. In Tuesday's primary, the newspapers have
endorsed Republican Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   An excerpt of the editorial says Vice President Al Gore's "dishonesty in
this campaign makes him an unacceptable choice for Democratic-leaning voters."
</P>
<P>
	   The reference was to the latest fight between Bradley and Gore over the vice
president's past statements regarding abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has suggested Gore has misrepresented his own record, as well as
others. Bradley insists Gore once opposed abortion, yet during this campaign he
claims he always supported a woman's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley rhetorically asked supporters Saturday in Manchester: how can women
trust somebody who doesn't tell the truth in a campaign to tell the truth as
president?
</P>
<P>
	   Gore retracted his 13-year-old statement equating abortion to "the taking of
a human life" as he scrambled to keep the issue, a traditional stumbling block
for Republicans, from tripping him up against Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes, my position has changed," Gore said Saturday. "I strongly support a
woman's right to choose and if (Bradley) disputes that, then he is making a
mistake."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley began airing a new television ad in the state Saturday in which the
former New Jersey senator calls himself the only presidential candidate who "has
been pro-choice for everyone all the time."

<HEADLINE> Murder one verdict returned in kill-for-hire case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ELIZABETHTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - A jury has found an Essex County man guilty
of a murder-for-hire plot in which his wife died of drowning after water was
forced down her throat in the couple's Lake Placid home.
<P>
	   Saturday afternoon's verdict means Jeffrey Glanda, 49, could face the death
penalty or life in prison for first-degree murder. The jury began deliberations
Friday afternoon after a 14-day trial filled with testimony of a marriage torn
apart and grisly details of the beating that led to the death of Jeannine
Glanda.
</P>
<P>
	   The body of 39-year-old Jeannine Glanda was discovered in August 1997 in a
Ford Explorer that was partially submerged in a nearby lake.
</P>
<P>
	   According to testimony, Glanda offered his landscaper, a long-time friend
named Nicholas Pecararo, $15,000, a new pickup truck and a snowmobile to help
commit the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   In his closing argument Friday, lead defense counsel Dennis Schlenker
attacked the testimony of Pecararo and Julius Elmore - the prosecutions star
witnesses - calling them "the most despicable human beings" he ever met,
according to the Plattsburgh Press-Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Pecararo said he was 15 years old when he met the defendant and did
landscaping work around Glanda's home. Pecararo testified that he and Glanda
attacked and killed Mrs. Glanda. But the defense tried to argue that Pecararo
committed the murder and lied to skirt the death penalty, saying that someone
else killed the woman.
</P>
<P>
	   Pecararo pleaded guilty in 1997 to second-degree murder in exchange for his
testimony. The plea lets the Tupper Lake man avoid the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   District Attorney Ronald Briggs in closing arguments Friday described the
breakdown of the Glandas' relationship in 1994, their separation and how Mr.
Glanda offered a Plattsburgh auto mechanic Donald Hilborn $10,000 in 1996 to
kill Mrs. Glanda.
</P>
<P>
	   Briggs then fast-forwarded to 1997, citing Pecararo's testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Pecararo testified that after Glanda attacked his wife in her home he
shocked her with a stun gun while Pecararo held her.
</P>
<P>
	   Glanda then beat her and poured large amounts of water down her throat until
she died, authorities said. Glanda ordered Pecararo to have sex with her, but he
refused, Pecararo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Glanda "is a court reporter who knows about DNA evidence" and was trying to
frame Pecararo, Briggs said. DNA evidence from sexual contact could identify the
attacker.
</P>
<P>
	   Pecararo said he took the body to upper Cascade Lake in Keene and dumped it
and her Ford Explorer into the lake.
</P>
<P>
	   Kimberly Musgrove testified she heard the splash when the Explorer hit, and
Kevin Reynolds said he found Mrs. Glanda's purse and some personal belongings on
Route 73 near where her body was found.
</P>
<P>
	   The medical examiner couldn't estimate the moment of death, but ruled that
she died by being strangled and having water poured down her throat.
</P>
<P>
	   Briggs said Pecararo testified because he felt guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   "The defendant could control Nicholas Pecararo's actions but could not
control his soul," Briggs told the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Briggs argued that Glanda told Hilborn and Pecararo the same thing,
specifically that he wanted Mrs. Glanda dead and it had to look like an accident
to collect on the insurance money.
</P>
<P>
	   Glanda had taken out three insurance policies on his wife, the last one 18
days before her death, according to testimony. The husband would have received
$130,000 through the policies.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor claimed Glanda wanted to stop his wife from financially
draining him in divorce, which would hurt his affluent lifestyle. The court
stenographer was known for expensive tastes - a Mercedes Benz, gold jewelry, and
an exclusive home in the Olympic village.
</P>
<P>
	   "Money is the oldest motive in the world," Briggs said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday, state Supreme Court Justice G. Thomas Moynihan instructed the jury
to ignore testimony from Mrs. Glanda's divorce attorney, William Cantwell. He
had said he was working on custody papers for Mrs. Glanda four weeks before his
client's death.
</P>
<P>
	   In court Saturday, Glanda showed no facial reaction, but swayed between his
two defense attorneys as the jury foreman announced the verdict in the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Glanda's family held hands, some quietly sobbing as the foreman
responded "guilty" to five felony charges. In addition to two counts of
first-degree murder, Glanda was convicted of two counts of burglary and one
count of conspiracy. He was found not guilty of offering Plattsburgh auto
mechanic Donald Hilborn $10,000 in 1996 to kill Mrs. Glanda.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the courtroom, Glanda maintained he was framed by Briggs and state
police.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll all find out that Briggs made deals, lots of deals, that's why the
case went the way it did," he said, questioning why more investigators didn't
testify. "What were they hiding?"
</P>
<P>
	   Glanda said prosecutors wanted "bigger fish to fry."
</P>
<P>
	   "From the get-go they were all jealous of me," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sentencing phase of Mr. Glanda's trial will begin shortly. Jurors return
Feb. 7 to decide whether Mr. Glanda is sentenced to death or given life without
parole.

<HEADLINE> No. 8 Ohio St. 68, Purdue 59  </HEADLINE>
    By RUSTY MILLER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien called it a "classic Big
Ten game." Others might have painted it in considerably less flattering terms.
</P>
<P>
	   In a rough-and-tumble battle that saw players hitting the deck on a regular
basis, No. 8 Ohio State got six points from Michael Redd in a late 13-2 run to
get by Purdue 68-59 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every possession was like a war," said Scoonie Penn, who led Ohio State
(14-3, 5-1 Big Ten) with 19 points.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Buckeyes on top 48-46 with 8:41 left, Redd, who finished with 14
points, hit a shot from the lane. After Penn hit a foul shot, Redd scored inside
and then hit a fastbreak layup off an alley-oop from Penn.
</P>
<P>
	   Penn then added a layup of his own before George Reese and Ken Johnson
scored on rebound follows to put Ohio State ahead 61-48. The lead never dropped
below seven again.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were determined to buckle down in the second half and we finally made
some shots," said Redd, who had hit only 3-of-12 shots from the field before
making three in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's conceivable that he could go 0-for-15 and we'd still try to run
something for him to win the game for us," O'Brien said. "When you have good
players, you ride your good players. You can't get away from your good players.
Michael and Scoonie will continue to be the focus of our offense and we'll try
to get them as many shots as we can."
</P>
<P>
	   The win was the sixth in a row for Ohio State, which has won 10 of its last
11.
</P>
<P>
	   Play was stopped for 10 minutes in the second half while the officiating
crew watched a video tape of the previous play.
</P>
<P>
	   Just after Penn released a 3-pointer, a whistle away from the ball sent
Brian Brown to the line. Brown hit both free throws to give Ohio State a 48-42
lead with 9:49 left.
</P>
<P>
	   After Purdue (13-7, 4-3) inbounded and went through a sequence of its
offense, Carson Cunningham was fouled. But before he could shoot the free
throws, the officials knelt around a courtside monitor for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   A Value City Arena capacity crowd of 19,100 booed and Keady and O'Brien
paced the sidelines with exasperated expressions on their faces.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials decided that Reese, not Brown, should have shot the foul shots
at the other end. Brown's points were taken off the scoreboard and Reese was
sent to the line -- 28 seconds having run off the clock since the earlier foul.
After Reese made both, Cunningham then took his shots before play resumed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll have to see that on tape to really be sure," Purdue coach Gene Keady
said. "A lot of times I think, 'That was a really bad call.' Probably about 80
percent of the time that I've thought that over the course of my 42 years in
coaching, the referee was right. I'm not going to say he was wrong on that
thing, but it was weird."
</P>
<P>
	   "It was just a wash, with a different shooter," O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson, the nation's leading shot blocker, scored 10 points and had 10
rebounds to go with seven blocks. Reese added 10 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Cunningham matched his season high with 19 points, with Brian Cardinal and
Greg McQuay each scoring 11. Cardinal also had 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just could not get over the hump," Keady said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jaraan Cornell, Purdue's leading scorer with 15.1 points a game, made his
only field goal with 1:25 left and finished with two points.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, Ohio State beat the Boilermakers 72-43 -- their most lopsided
victory in the series in 38 years. The latest meeting in Columbus was
considerably different.
</P>
<P>
	   "We beat a good team," Redd said. "I don't want anyone to listen to other
people's expectations. We just have to play the best that we can."
</P>
<P>
	   Purdue shot 38.2 percent from the field, marking the fifth game in a row an
Ohio State opponent has failed to top 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> Wizards 103, Cavaliers 98  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH WHITE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gar Heard's firing was determined well before tipoff, but
it turned out to be a somewhat fitting ending to a sloppy game between two bad
teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Rod Strickland had 26 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds and rookie
Richmond Hamilton scored a career-high 21 points Saturday night as the
Washington Wizards fumbled and bumbled their way to a 103-98 victory over the
Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
	   Immediately after the game, Heard and two assistant coaches were fired, the
Wizards' first major move since Michael Jordan became head of basketball
operations. Golden State assistant Rod Higgins, a former teammate of Jordan's,
will be the new coach.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a good win," Heard said. "I won my first game and my lost game
tonight. It was a good ride. Unfortunately, I wasn't the guy they wanted here."
</P>
<P>
	   Washington is 14-30 and in last place in the Atlantic Division.
</P>
<P>
	   "Things weren't going well around here, so it's not a surprise to me,"
Wizards guard Rod Strickland said. "I hope this can make things better. Now we
have another coach to get used to or whatever, but things weren't going well. I
don't think it could get any worse."
</P>
<P>
	   In a game between losing teams, the Wizards won primarily because they were
slightly less bad than the Cavaliers, who have lost six straight on the road.
There were 29 turnovers, a week's worth of missed layups, and neither team
played much defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland's Shawn Kemp had the most miserable game of all, getting in foul
trouble early and missing easy layups in the second half. He had 14 points and
10 rebounds before fouling out with 3:38 to go.
</P>
<P>
	   Kemp drew two technicals protesting his sixth foul and had to be restrained
as he left the court. That gave the Wizards four consecutive free throws; they
made three to build a 97-89 lead that helped make the difference.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not going to make it worse for myself and start talking about it," Kemp
said. "Everybody is disappointed with calls. You just have to deal with it."
</P>
<P>
	   The Wizards still nearly blew it, though, as the Cavaliers cut the lead to
two twice in the final two minutes. Strickland saved the day with a prayer off
the glass as the shot clock expired and a rebound off Bob Sura's missed jumper
in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
	   Sura had 23 points to lead the Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
	   For much of the game, each team seemed determined to play as poorly as the
other to keep the score close. Down 61-50 in the third quarter, the Wizards
loped along on a 17-2 run that contained some sequences that threatened to set
the game back a couple of decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Kemp couldn't finish a simple layup on a fast break. Jahidi White was called
for his fourth foul for a trying to get rebounding position on a made free
throw. Kemp got poked in the eye and couldn't see for a few seconds, yet he took
an outside jumper anyway and badly missed. Juwan Howard couldn't finish a dunk
with only token body contact from Kemp. There were also sloppy turnovers at
midcourt.
</P>
<P>
	   "The difference in the game was the play at the start and at the beginning
of the third," coach Randy Wittman said. "I thought in both we were
lackadaisical, and ultimately it cost us the game."
</P>
<P>
	   The Wizards improved to 2-3 since Jordan joined the team as part-owner, head
of basketball operations and occasional practice partner. Jordan missed the game
because he is in Atlanta for the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   With Kemp in early foul trouble, Sura carried the load in the first quarter
for the Cavaliers with nine points in a 13-2 run. Cleveland committed 10
first-half turnovers, but made up for it by outrebounding Washington 27-18 to
take a 54-49 lead at the half.

<HEADLINE> A&AMP;M's Toombs Charged With DWI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    COLLEGE STATION, Texas (ap) -- Texas A&AMP;M's leading rusher, sophomore
fullback Ja'Mar Toombs, was arrested early Saturday by College Station police
and charged with driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-foot, 265-pound Toombs was a star of the Aggies' emotional 20-16
victory over Texas in November. He rushed 37 times for 126 yards and scored
twice.
</P>
<P>
	   Toombs, who was a high school All-American in Kilgore, Texas, was released
from jail on $1,500 bail, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Toombs had three passengers in his car when he was pulled over for a traffic
violation shortly after midnight Friday, College Station police Sgt. Donny
Andreski said.
</P>
<P>
	   After failing field sobriety tests, Toombs was taken into custody, and a
breathalyzer test indicated a blood alcohol level of .10, Andreski said. The
legal alcohol limit in Texas is .08.
</P>
<P>
	   Athletic director Wally Groff and football coach R.C. Slocum, who attended
A&AMP;M's annual football banquet Saturday night, declined to speculate on how the
arrest will affect Toombs' status with the team.
</P>
<P>
	   "Frankly, I'm disappointed in the fact that he was picked up," Groff told
the Bryan-College Station Eagle. "We'll check into it and see what we'll do at
the proper time."
</P>
<P>
	   Slocum said: "It always concerns you if there's any involvement in something
like that. I just found out about it. I will withhold any comment until I find
out more about it."
</P>
<P>
	   Toombs just completed his sophomore season and has two years of eligibility
remaining. He was A&AMP;M's leading rusher this season with 147 carries for 583
yards and nine touchdowns. He also caught nine passes for 128 yards and one
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Toombs was arrested in May on a charge of possession of marijuana. He was
placed on deferred adjudication and was ordered to perform community service.
Under deferred adjudication, with good behavior a conviction can be eventually
removed from a person's record.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks 107, Nuggets 96  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- Cedric Ceballos scored 25 of his 31 points in the first half
as Dallas beat Denver 107-96 on Saturday night, extending the Mavericks' winning
streak to four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Ceballos was 11-for-19 from the field, hit all six free throws and added 10
rebounds as the Mavericks put together their first four-game winning streak
since 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
	   Erick Strickland added 15 points and Steve Nash had 12 for the Mavericks,
who have won seven of their last nine for their most successful stretch since
taking nine of 10 in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
	   Nuggets forward Antonio McDyess went scoreless for the first time in his
career, playing a career-low seven minutes due to tendinitis in his right knee.
McDyess had gone 90 consecutive games scoring in double figures, the
second-longest streak in the league.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas finished with an 8-5 record for January. The Mavericks' last winning
January was 9-7 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant Stith had a season-high 27 points for the Nuggets, who have lost
seven of their last nine. James Posey added 15 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nuggets made a late run, closing within 100-94 with 49.4 seconds to play
on Popeye Jones' 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Mavericks made seven of eight free throws in the final minute to
close out the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas charged to a 28-10 lead after the first quarter in Denver's lowest
scoring quarter of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mavericks padded their advantage to as much as 47-21 with 4:30 left
until the intermission. At that point, Ceballos had outscored the entire Denver
team, 23-21.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas went on to a 58-37 halftime lead after Denver missed 14 of its first
17 field goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nuggets reduced the deficit to 69-56 with 5:36 left in the third period
on consecutive jumpers by Nick Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Mavericks finished the quarter with a 18-5 spurt led by Michael
Finley's seven points to take an 87-61 lead into the final quarter.

<HEADLINE> Two Films Split Top Sundance Prize  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- The gritty boxing saga "Girlfight" and the tender
sibling-reunion tale "You Can Count on Me" shared top honors Saturday at the
Sundance Film Festival, the nation's top showcase for independent movies.
</P>
<P>
	   The two movies split the grand jury prize for best dramatic film.
</P>
<P>
	   "Girlfight" also won the dramatic directing award for Karyn Kusama, and "You
Can Count on Me" won the Waldo Salt screenwriting award for Kenneth Lonergan,
who also directed the film.
</P>
<P>
	   "Girlfight" stars Michelle Rodriguez as a young woman who channels her
fierce temper to become a champion boxer. "You Can Count on Me" features Laura
Linney and Mark Ruffalo as a sister and brother struggling to maintain a sense
of family years after their parents are killed in a car crash. Matthew Broderick
co-stars in the movie.
</P>
<P>
	   The grand jury prize for documentary went to "Long Night's Journey Into
Day," which examines four cases that came before South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission in the aftermath of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
	   The documentary directing award went to Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman for
"Paragraph 175," an exploration of Nazi atrocities against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
	   The audience award for dramatic film, chosen by public balloting, went to
"Two Family House," a 1950s portrait of an Italian-American loser who bucks
tradition when he takes up with a young Irish woman and her baby by a black man.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dark Days," which examines a group of New York's homeless who built their
own shantytown community in an underground tunnel, won the audience award for
documentary. "Saving Grace," starring Brenda Blethyn as a destitute British
widow who grows marijuana in her greenhouse to cover her debts, won the audience
award for world cinema.
</P>
<P>
	   The dramatic jury awarded two special acting honors. Janet McTeer, who won a
Golden Globe last week for "Tumbleweeds," and Aidan Quinn, Pat Carroll, Jane
Adams, Gregory Cook and Iris DeMent received a special jury prize for
outstanding ensemble performance in "Songcatcher." McTeer stars as a
musicologist in 1907 who gathers folk songs in the Appalachian backwoods.
</P>
<P>
	   Donal Logue won a special jury prize for outstanding performance in "The Tao
of Steve," in which he plays an overweight womanizer whose pickup artistry is
based on the cool aloofness of Steve McQueen. Logue's character, defending his
underachieving lifestyle, utters the line: "Doing stuff is overrated. I mean,
Hitler did a lot, but don't we all wish he'd stayed home and gotten stoned?"
</P>
<P>
	   Other awards presented Saturday, the next-to-last day of the Sundance
festival:
</P>
<P>
	   Cinematography award in dramatic competition: Tom Krueger, "Committed."
</P>
<P>
	   Freedom of Expression Award, documentary: "Dark Days."

Ramblin' Jack," directed by Aiyana Elliott.
</P>
<P>
	   Special jury prize for writing, documentary: Daniel McCabe, Paul Stekler and

<HEADLINE> Ice Storm Hits Atlanta Area  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The second ice storm in a week made highways treacherous
Saturday, leaving the pavement so slippery in places people couldn't stand, let
alone drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Cars slid into police cars and trucks trying to clear the roads, and
ice-covered overpasses and interchanges were shut down across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just happened so suddenly,'' said state Department of Transportation
spokeswoman Kim Law. ``You look out your window and not see any ice on the trees
and assume it's OK. Well, it's anything but.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another storm earlier in the week had knocked out electrical service to
thousands of customers across the Southeast. In North Carolina, about 500
customers were still without power Saturday as state emergency management
officials prepared for another blast as the storm moved up the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 20,000 homes lost power as the latest storm moved through Georgia.
Icy roads were blamed for a 47-car pileup at the junction of two interstates in
downtown Atlanta and 12-car pileup on an interstate a few hours later. Two
deaths in the state were also blamed on the ice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had (vehicles) slide into 10 of our officer's cars,'' said DeKalb
County Police spokeswoman Mikki Jones. ``Everyone needs to slow down. We're
seeing people try to drive 70 miles an hour on the interstate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Three multi-car pileups were reported on interstates and highways in the
Charlotte, N.C., area. Saturday evening, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police began
asking drivers to stay off the roads.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike last week's storm, which dropped 20 inches of snow in parts of North
Carolina with little warning, state emergency operations were prepared for the
worst.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got everybody here,'' Bill Figulski said from the state emergency
operations center in Raleigh, N.C. ``Everything's set in place. We're just going
to sit back now and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 1,100 National Guard personnel were ready to respond to emergencies
during and after the storm, with four-wheel drive vehicles, cargo trucks and
emergency fuel trailers set up at five locations across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Storm advisories were posted across South and North Carolina, where
residents were still digging out after last week's record snowfall. The National
Weather Service was forecasting accumulations of as much as a half inch of ice
in parts of South Carolina by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Freezing rain and sleet had already glazed roads in southern West Virginia
by Saturday evening. In northeastern Alabama, and ice storm warning remained in
effect, and in Arkansas, ice and snow still covered many roads and highways, and
the freezing temperatures were expected to continue into Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   A few days earlier, the same storm dropped more than a foot of snow in areas
across the Plains and the South and was blamed for three deaths in Arkansas, one
in Louisiana and five in Missouri. A 14-year-old boy died in a sledding accident
near Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   Rick Cantrell and John Schifko hoped to see Atlanta's sights after driving
from St. Louis for the Super Bowl, but watching drivers not used to ice trying
to maneuver on the slick pavement made them think again.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is child's play compared to what we get in St. Louis, but the worst
hazard is everyone else,'' Cantrell said. ``We saw people going too fast on the
interstate and spin out left and right.''
</P>
<P>
	   The storm also iced roads in Kentucky on Saturday, forcing police to close a
10-mile section of interstate. ``It's utter chaos this morning, brother,'' said
State Police Sgt. Russ Harney in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
	   In Lexington, Ky., Ken Kurtz, 70, and his wife were out shopping when the
sleet began.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hit the parking lot with clear windows, and by the time we came out 25
minutes later every window was coated with ice,'' Kurtz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Temperatures in the 40s were forecast for Super Bowl Sunday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until it does melt off, we are begging people to stay off the roads,''
said Ken Davis of the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. ``We are doing
everything we can to get things in order for the game, but Mother Nature may not
cooperate.''

<HEADLINE> Report Explores AIDS, Priests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- AIDS has quietly caused the deaths of hundreds of
Roman Catholic priests in the United States although other causes may be listed
on some of their death certificates, The Kansas City Star reported in its Sunday
editions.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first of a three-part series, the newspaper reported that its
examination of death certificates and interviews with experts indicated several
hundred priests had died of AIDS-related illnesses since the mid-1980s and
hundreds more are living with HIV, the virus that causes the disease. The death
rate of priests from AIDS is at least four times that of the general population,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   Church leaders in the United States and at the Vatican declined requests to
discuss the findings, the Star said, and the Vatican referred questions to local
bishops.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishop Raymond J. Boland of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, said the
AIDS deaths show that priests are human. ``Much as we would regret it, it shows
that human nature is human nature,'' Boland said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Star sent confidential questionnaires to 3,000 of the 46,000 priests in
the United States last fall, asking about AIDS and other issues, and received
responses from 801 priests, a 27 percent return rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Six of 10 priests responding said they knew of at least one priest who had
died of an AIDS-related illness and one-third knew a priest living with AIDS.
Three-fourths said the church needed to provide more education to seminarians on
sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about their sexual orientation, 75 percent said they were
heterosexual, 15 percent said they were homosexual and 5 percent said they were
bisexual.
</P>
<P>
	   The Star said exact numbers of priests who have died of AIDS or become
infected with HIV is unknown, partly because many suffer in solitude. When
priests tell their superiors, the cases generally are handled quietly.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper cited the case of Bishop Emerson J. Moore, who left the
Archdiocese of New York in 1995 and went to Minnesota, where he died in a
hospice of an AIDS-related illness. His death certificate attributed the death
to ``unknown natural causes'' and listed his occupation as ``laborer'' in the
manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
	   After an AIDS activist filed a complaint, officials changed the cause of
death to ``HIV-related illness,'' the newspaper reported, but the occupation was
not corrected.
</P>
<P>
	   Farley Cleghorn, an epidemiologist with the Institute of Human Virology in
Baltimore, said he has treated about 20 priests and religious-order brothers
with AIDS, all of whom had kept it a secret.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The church and religious orders need to acknowledge that there is a
problem -- that priests have sex and they are susceptible to all sexually
transmitted diseases, including AIDS,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
    TORONTO (AP) -- Just hanging around paid off Saturday for Steve Thomas and
the Toronto Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas' second goal of the game came with 19 seconds left, and Toronto,
which overcame a two-goal deficit, beat the Los Angeles Kings 3-2.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was just going by the net and it hit my stick," Thomas said. "Someone is
looking down on me."
</P>
<P>
	   Two days ago, Thomas scored the winning goal with one minute left as Toronto
beat the New York Rangers. Thomas, limited to one goal in his first 28 games,
has five goals in the last three games and 13 for the season.
</P>
<P>
	   "He can do no wrong now," Toronto goalie Curtis Joseph, who had 29 saves,
said. "That just goes to show you to stay with it, don't change your pattern,
keep your chin up."
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan Berard and Thomas scored 90 seconds apart early in the third period to
tie the game, then teamed up for the decisive goal. Berard's wrist shot from the
point was deflected by Thomas past goalie Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
	   After getting booed by their fans at various stages of the first and second
periods, the Leafs came out strong in the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Igor Korolev found Berard behind the Kings' defense and Berard skated in
alone on Fiset and beat him with a deke to the backhand at 5:02 for his third
goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas tied it at 6:32 when he flipped Mats Sundin's pass over Fiset.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've maintained a good work ethic and good things were bound to happen,"
Thomas said. "I've been in the right place at the right time lately and maybe
this will lead to a good second half."
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't question the effort of our team," Los Angeles coach Andy Murray
said. "We played hard and worked hard and we got what we deserve. Eventually,
things will start to go our way."
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan Smolinski and Jere Karalahti scored in the first period for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles outshot Toronto 31-21 and the Leafs were 0-for-4 on the power
play.

<HEADLINE> No. 5 Notre Dame 87, Georgetown 56  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Even after 13 consecutive wins, Notre Dame coach
Muffett McGraw isn't ready for her No. 5 Irish to do any bragging.
</P>
<P>
	   Niele Ivey scored 18 points as Notre Dame beat Georgetown 87-56 Saturday
night to extend its winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we were undefeated at this point, I'd be really happy," said McGraw, who
rested her starters for most of the second half. "Right now we're beating the
teams we're supposed to beat."
</P>
<P>
	   Danielle Green added 14 points for the Irish (17-2, 8-0 Big East), and Ruth
Riley had 12 despite sitting out most of the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Notre Dame jumped out to a 20-7 lead with 13:32 remaining in the first half
and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
	   A layup by freshman forward Amanda Barksdale with 6:46 remaining in the game
gave the Irish a their largest lead, 79-39.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the largest margin of victory this season for the Irish, who last
lost on Dec. 8 to Purdue 71-61.
</P>
<P>
	   Katie Smrcka-Duffy led Georgetown (11-8, 4-4) with 23 points and a
school-record 10 steals. The Hoyas, who had won four straight before the loss,
committed 30 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Irish shot 63 percent for the game, while the Hoyas shot just 27
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was Notre Dame's night," Georgetown coach Patrick Knapp said. "I thought
in the second half we worked hard to sustain a strong effort, but nothing went
in for long stretches of time."
</P>
<P>
	   With the game sealed by halftime, McGraw was able to give her reserves
extended playing time in the second half. For the game, 11 of the 12 Notre Dame
players scored.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is the best game we've played in a while," McGraw said.
"Michigan State (an 84-54 victory on Dec. 11) was the best game we've played all
year, but I think this one is right up there."

Candidates Spar Over Abortion
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Candidates from both parties Saturday called into
question their rival's positions on abortion. For the Democrats, Bill Bradley
accused Al Gore of trying to "dance around" earlier qualms about abortion as he
bid to cut into the vice president's core party support. Republican Steve Forbes
released new radio commercials attacking George W. Bush for failing to be a firm
enough foe of abortion, and for overseeing a big increase in spending in Texas.

Bradley Details Heart Condition
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley said he has
required anesthesia for treatment of his irregular heartbeat, but his doctor
reaffirmed that he is fit to be president, The New York Times reported Sunday.
Bradley, 56, has known he has atrial fibrillation since 1996. Three times after
attacks of fibrillation, Bradley has needed a procedure known as cardioversion,
in which the heart is jolted with electricity. Before undergoing a
cardioversion, a patient is made unconscious for several minutes. Asked what he
would do if he needed such a procedure as president, Bradley told the paper he
might have to invoke the 25th Amendment to turn over power to his vice president
temporarily.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The super-secret National Security Agency confirmed
Saturday night that it had a "serious computer problem" last week that affected
its ability to process intelligence information. The agency issued a brief
statement a few hours after the outage was reported by ABC News, which said its
sources characterized the problem as the biggest computer failure in the history
of the NSA. "This problem, which was contained to the NSA headquarters complex
at Fort Meade, Md., did not affect intelligence collection, but did affect the
processing of intelligence information," the agency statement said.

Sunday in Havana to welcome Elian's grandmothers home from the United States.

Kofi Annan Praises Russia's Putin

<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan praised Russia's acting
President Vladimir Putin on Saturday as "businesslike and decisive." Although
Annan said he still wants to see negotiations and an end to the war in Chechnya.
International leaders have accused Russia of using indiscriminate force in
Chechnya, citing high civilian casualties and the 250,000 refugees. Russia
insists it is targeting only rebel positions, and says the offensive is aimed at
rooting out Chechen militants blamed for terrorist acts in Russia.

Report Explores AIDS, Priests
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- AIDS has quietly caused the deaths of hundreds of
Roman Catholic priests in the United States although other causes may be listed
on some of their death certificates, The Kansas City Star reported in its Sunday
editions. In the first of a three-part series, the newspaper reported that its
examination of death certificates and interviews with experts indicated several
hundred priests had died of AIDS-related illnesses since the mid-1980s and
hundreds more are living with HIV, the virus that causes the disease. Church
leaders in the United States and at the Vatican declined requests to discuss the
findings, the Star said, and the Vatican referred questions to local bishops.
