<HEADLINE> Quebec's Liberals Edge Ahead in Support, Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Liberal Party in Quebec has
regained the psychological advantage of enjoying a lead over the
ruling Parti Quebecois (PQ) in popular support, according to a new
 poll published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Quebec is scheduled to hold a general election on November 30,
which will decide which party rule the resource-rich province of
Canada in the next four or five years and is expected to have a
large impact on Canada's future.
</P>
<P>
The separatist PQ has vowed that if elected, it will ask for
another referendum on Quebec's independence from Canada when
winning conditions exist.
</P>
<P>
Despite Liberals' lead, the outcome of the election remains
uncertain as 10 percent of those polled said they were undecided
or refuse to make a choice. Of those who cited a party preference,
one-third said they could change their mind over the next three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The poll found 47.9 percent of decided voters supported the
Liberals, while 46.9 percent backed the PQ. Only 4.3 percent said
they would back the Action Democratique party.
</P>
<P>
A similar poll a week earlier gave the PQ a narrow lead at 47.5
percent to 46.2 percent for Liberals and 5.7 percent for the
Action Democratique.
</P>
<P>
The problem for the Liberals is that the francophone vote
dominates more than 70 of the province's 125 riding, according to
Canada's leading newspaper the Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
A total of 56.3 percent of francophone voters said they would
opt for the PQ, while 37.8 percent backed the Liberals and 5.3
percent supported the Action Democratique.
</P>
<P>
In addition, much of the success of the parties depends upon
the popularity of their leaders. Here, PQ leader Lucien Bouchard
far outdistanced Liberal leader Jean Charest, with Bouchard picked
up by 44.4 percent of those polled and 30.2 percent opted for
latter.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted for the Globe and Mail and Le Journal de
Montreal between November 2 and 5, questioned 1,004 voters and had
an error margin of plus or minus 3.1 percent.

<P>
PARIS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Saturday called on Israel and Palestinians to apply the Wye
agreements in the letter and the spirit.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri,
Chirac said that France wishes the Wye agreements a success.
</P>
<P>
"The agreements should be respected by the two sides, in the
letter but also in the spirit. That is to say no one can take
back with one hand what he has given to the other," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this hypothesis, this agreement will be a step in the good
direction," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also expressed the wish that Israel can relaunch its
peace negotiations with Lebanon and Syria, as it has done with the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls Iraqi Attitude toward UNSCOM Unacceptable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Saturday described as "unacceptable" the attitude adopted by the
Iraqi government toward the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of destroying Iraq's arms of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"France much regret the position, which for us is at the same
time incomprehensible and unacceptable, of President Saddam
Hussein to cut cooperation with UNSCOM. I don't think it is in the
interests of anyone and certainly not Iraq, certainly not the
peace," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement following a meeting with visiting
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri in the Elysee presidential
palace.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France, as well as other member countries of
the United Nations Security Council, has adopted a stand of "great
firmness" toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council adopted unanimously a
resolution on Thursday, urging Iraq to resume cooperation with the
UNSCOM, which Baghdad suspended in late October.
</P>
<P>
Iraq asked U.N. to change the chief of the UNSCOM and start the
procedure of lifting economic sanctions as two pre-conditions for
resuming cooperation in disarmament.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of consultation will be held on Saturday in Paris by
high-level diplomats of France, the United States and Britain on
the situation in the Yugoslav province Kosovo and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. presidential advisor for national security affairs,
Sandy Berger, the advisor of British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
John Holmes, and the advisor of President Chirac, Jean-David
Levitte, will attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar On Human Rights, Democracy Concepts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- "Human rights for a third world
country like Myanmar mean the rights to enjoy the basic human
requirements such as security, food and shelter," a latest Myanmar
official report said.
</P>
<P>
The report on the political situation of Myanmar, issued by the
Office of Strategic Studies of the Defence Ministry, commented
that human rights mean to various nations with different economic,
social, historical, cultural and traditional values.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar is at the moment trying to fulfil these basic
essential requirements and after that it will move on to another
set of necessities such as health and education followed by
economic development," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Challenging the United States in its commitment and obligation
in fulfilling the basic human rights, the report said that
security can never be guaranteed in most of the U.S. cities,
citing security after dark, starvation on streets and death of
homeless people during the winter season there.
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that Myanmar does not have homeless people
who die of being neglected by their own government which is
implementing the project called "From Huts to Proper Houses
Scheme."
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the Western's nations theory of democracy
has not only failed in many developing countries but created
instability and chaos.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar must and will start to build up her democratic
institution with a solid foundation first and from there on it
will expand and develop into a much higher level," it stressed,
saying that no country in the world can expect to achieve a
functioning democracy in a reverse way like expecting or forcing a
child to run first before learning how to walk properly.
</P>
<P>
It also charged that in the U.S. the basic universal human
rights such as security and protection of citizens, properties and
lives have been overshadowed and sidetracked by other individual
rights.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the sanctions and other pressures imposed by the
U.S. and the European Union (EU) on Myanmar, the report said
these moves indicate the West's real intention, which is
"hypocrisy but not democracy and might is right but not human
right."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar in May 1997,
banning new investments in the country, while the EU restricted
visa issue in 1996 to Myanmar high-level officials, freezing on
contacts at ministerial level and on an embargo on the sale of
military equipment to the country. The EU sanctions were extended
to further six months since April this year.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the internal political situation in Myanmar, it
predicted that the demand for the freedom to exercise full
political rights will come when Myanmar reaches a more mature
stage where the unity of the 135 ethnic groups living in the
country becomes stronger and when the fundamental needs of the
population have been fulfilled to a much higher level.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar must and should be at her very stage of development
prioritizing national unity, peace, stability and developing her
economy with an aim of creating a strong middle class," the report
emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Sihanouk Willing to Offer Security Guarantee for Opposition Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's King Norodom
Sihanouk Saturday urged two opposition party leaders to return to
the country, saying that their security will be assured.
</P>
<P>
In a message to diplomatic corps, the King said if Prince
Ranariddh, president of FUNCINPEC party, agrees to meet at his
residence (at the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh) with Chea Sim and
Hun Sen, president and vice-president of the ruling Cambodian
People's Party (CPP), "I will be available for organizing a summit
meeting on November 7 to 13 at the Royal Palace."
</P>
<P>
"Ranariddh, throughout his stay in Phnom Penh will stay, with
two of his bodyguards, at the Kantha Bopha residence inside the
Royal Palace in Phnom Penh where his security will be assured,"
the King said.
</P>
<P>
The King also informed that he will leave here on November 14
for Beijing to have a medical checkup and the treatment of some of
his illnesses.
</P>
<P>
He especially stressed that Sam Rainsy, president of his
self-named party, will receive the same treatment as Ranariddh in
Phnom Penh, if he joins with Ranariddh for the inter-Cambodian
summit.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen immediately made a response to
the King's message, saying he fully supports King's security
offers to Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
The government also reiterated Friday that all politicians,
especially those elected in July, enjoy total freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
Many opposition parliamentarians left Cambodia shortly after
they were sworn in on September 24, including Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy. They claimed they felt no safety in the country.
</P>
<P>
The three major parties recently have been deadlocked over a
location for a summit to move coalition talks forward.

country's youth to fight against dangers posed by western culture.
</P>
<P>

citing the perverse influence of western culture on some South
East Asian countries.

Addressing the zonal conference of the Indian Chamber of
Commerce in Varanasi, Joshi warned that western countries,

<HEADLINE> 15 U.N. Arms Inspectors Leaves Baghdad Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen U.N. weapons
inspectors left Baghdad Saturday aimed the Iraq-U.N. standoff
over the Iraqi decision to halt cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) for disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for UNSCOM here, said the 15
people who had left Baghdad included six members of a missile
team.
</P>
<P>
She said the six-member team just happened to be here when Iraq
announced its decision on October 31 that it was halting all
forms of cooperation with UNSCOM, including its monitoring
activities.
</P>
<P>
In response to the Iraqi decision, UNSCOM announced on Friday
that it would withdraw 26 people from its staff of about 120
currently working in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM spokesman Ewen Buchanan announced in New York on
Thursday that the U.N. planned to reduce its arms inspectors in
Iraq by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources who asked not to be identified told Xinhua that
another 20 inspectors will be withdrawn from Iraq in the following
days.
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense to keep high-powered people sitting there
doing nothing when presumably they all have jobs to do in their
own countries," said Buchanan, explaining why the U.N. took this
move.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution on Thursday,
which condemned the latest Iraqi defiance and urged it to rescind
its decision, but so far Iraq has refused to back down.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Trade Union to Stage on Strikes Every </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trades
Unions (ZCTU) Saturday resolved to embark on strikes every
Wednesday to press the government to review the recent fuel and
food price increases.
</P>
<P>
Addressing local journalists after a meeting of the ZCTU
General Council in Harare, Secretary General Morgan Tsvangirai
said the labor movement had decided to start the stayaways this
Wednesday until the government resolved the issues, the
Zimbabwean News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU demand that the government should suspend the 67
percent fuel hike immediately until the report on corruption at
the National Oil Council of Zimbabwe was tabled.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU General Council met Saturday morning to assess the
situation on the recent hike of prices of fuel which resulted in
violent demonstrations in some suburbs of Harare and the
dormitory town of Chitungwiza.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai said the decision had been taken in the best
interest.
</P>
<P>
Last week the government approved the increase fuel prices of
more than 67 percent in a bid to improve the viability of
national oil company of Zimbabwe which had been operating at a
loss.
</P>
<P>
The powerful labor movement staged a mass work boycott in
March this year after the government introduced a 2.5 percent
increase in sales tax which was later scrapped.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Says No Delay in Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said here Saturday that there will not be any delay in
the deployment of the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missile
system.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks in his official statement issued
here Saturday in response to a recent European Commission report
which said the missiles' deployment in Cyprus has been again
delayed until spring next year.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Clerides described the report as "completely
unfounded," and reiterated once again that "a public debate on
the missiles issue is not in the best interests of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that as it has been repeatedly said, the
decision to postpone the deployment of the missiles was taken by
the National Council, the top advisory body to the president on the
handling of the Cyprus problem, and "only with a new decision of
the National Council can this change."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president emphasised that he has not raised at the
National Council any issue for a new postponement of the arrival
of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered the S-300 surface-to-air missiles from Russia
in January 1997, in a bid to bolster the Republic's defense
capability.
</P>
<P>
Local press has reported that the missiles will be deployed on
the Greek island of Crete, instead of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Britain and some other countries have voiced their
objection to the planned deployment of the missiles while Turkey
has threatened to launch pre-emptive strike against the missiles
if they are deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the Russians were to deliver the
missiles by July this year. The original delivery date was put
back until the end of autumn and then until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has declared that it would cancel the
missile deal only if there is substantial progress in the peace
efforts for a comprehensive solution or steps leading to the
island's demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has so far maintained 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus,
which was declared unilaterally by Turkish Cypriots in 1983 as a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only
by Ankara.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A 10-member Poverty Alleviation
Committee was inaugurated by Nigerian authorities Saturday in the
capital of Abuja, the official News Agency of Nigeria said.
</P>
<P>
The the committee's responsibility is to review the roles and
functions of various institutions and programs relating to
poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the committee is expected to identify a specific
agency which will be charged the overall responsibility for
coordinating, monitoring and appraising the poverty alleviation
programs of the government.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the launching ceremony, the Minister of State
for Finance, Wilson Akpan-Etukudo, noted that in spite of the
achievements recorded by Nigeria's poverty alleviation programs,
the incidence of poverty in Africa's most populous country has
continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, there is an urgent need to review the
current approach with a view to accelerate the rate at which
poverty could be reduced in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than half of Nigeria's 108 million
population are living below the poverty line.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Jihad Claims Responsibility for Jerusalem's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The radical group of Islamic
Jihad of Palestine Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide
car bombing in Jerusalem Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This heroic operation is not the first and not going to be
the last," the group said in a leaflet faxed to news
organizations. "We refuse any political agreement that would
recognize the Zionist enemy."
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, a car loaded with explosives blasted at the
entrance of Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, killing two and
injuring 25.
</P>
<P>
The two killed in the blasts were identified by Israeli police
as the assailants. Shortly after the blasts, the Palestinian
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) also claimed responsibility
for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Friday's bombing caused another blow to the peace process. The
Israeli cabinet suspended indefinitely its ratification of the
peace accord signed last month in Washington with the
Palestinians and urged the Palestinians to do more to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian cabinet condemned the attack following its
meeting on Friday night, but also said that Israel should not use
the attack as a pretext for delaying implementation of the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had a telephone conversation
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Friday night on the
bombing incident and urged him to continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, Palestinian security forces rounded up
a number of Islamic activists for questioning.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Crown Prince Meets Iranian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince and
Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz met in Riyadh
Saturday with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on
the latest Iraqi-U.N. crisis and the sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Iranian diplomatic sources in Riyadh said that the two sides
discussed a number of issues of mutual concern, with Iraq's latest
standoff with the United Nations and the oil prices being the core
of their discussions, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraq suspended last week all its relations with the U.N.
Special Committee (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq, stopping all
inspection and monitoring work, which aroused strong criticism
from the U.S. and its allies.
</P>
<P>
Both Saudi Arabia and Iran are against any strikes on Iraq and
advocate a diplomatic approach to the crisis and bring Baghdad in
compliance with United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The present crippling U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 can not be lifted until U.N. inspectors
certify that it has been free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian sources said the two sides also discussed oil, the
main source of income for Iran and Saudi Arabia, in a bid to seek
a common ground on shoring up oil prices in the global market.
</P>
<P>
Falling prices have hurt economies of both countries, which
are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC). But they disagree on how to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Iran favored additional output reductions to improve the oil
prices while Saudi Arabia liked an extension of previous cuts
until the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that during the meeting, Kharrazi also
conveyed the crown prince a message from Iranian President
Mohammed Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The message dealt with bilateral ties and means of promoting
them in various fields in addition to regional, Islamic and
international issues of mutual concern, the sources said.
</P>

Kharrazi, who arrived in Saudi Arabia on Friday to perform
Umrah (small pilgrimage) ahead of his official visit, had already
held lengthy talks with his Saudi counterpart Prince Saud
Al-Faisal on issues surrounding the Gulf, the Middle East and the
Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran had been tense because
of Tehran's much-hyped policy of exporting its Islamic
revolution. The revolution in 1979 toppled the late shah's regime
and brought about the clergymen's rule.
</P>
<P>
The ice only began to thaw after Iran's moderate President
Mohammad Khatami took office last year.
</P>
<P>
The ties have been steadily improving since Iran's former

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- With seven astronauts on
board, U.S. space shuttle "Discovery" landed at the Kennedy Space
Center, Cape Canaveral, this afternoon local time at 12:06.
</P>
<P>
With the drag chute door missing 4 minutes before "Discovery"'s
launching, NASA feared that the landing might be troublesome
because of the possible popping up of the chute. However the
space shuttle got a smooth landing this afternoon to everybody's
cheers.
</P>
<P>
The seven astronauts were accorded warm welcome, and the oldest
astronaut in the world, the 77-year-old astronaut John Glenn's
wife Annie, and their two children and two grandsons were among
the people at the space center.
</P>
<P>
During their 9-day-flight, the astronauts covered 3.68 million
miles and went around the Earth 134 times. They conducted 83
science experiments, centering on aging in space. NASA officials
said that after returning to the ground, John Glenn will receive
four hour tests immediately and then face more shots and blood
draws.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Opposes Military Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid Saturday expressed opposition to possible
military actions against Iraq for its latest standoff with the
U.N. over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent Iraqi decision to halt cooperation with
the U.N. weapons inspectors, Abdel-Meguid defended Iraq's right to
complain the ways some inspectors used in investigating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the revelation made by former inspector
Scott Ritter, an American who resigned in August, that he
routinely briefed Israeli intelligence agents on the findings of
Iraq's weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief, in the meantime, underlined the need for
Iraq to deal with the U.N. arms inspections with flexibility.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced a week ago to stop all dealings with the
U.N. Special Commission overseeing disarmament, in what is seen a
protest against the U.N. Security Council's failure to propose a
timetable for the lifting of the eight-year-old sanction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's decision has prompted serious reaction from the United
States, which has said that all options, including use of military
force, are on the table.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid maintained that a planned comprehensive review by
the U.N. Security Council of the Iraqi issue should be linked to
the lifting of the sanctions, imposed after Iraqi troops run over
neighbor Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided on October 30 to carry out the
comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with the U.N.
resolutions, but without the guarantee demanded by Iraq that the
review leads to the removal of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The crippling sanctions can not be lifted until U.N. weapons
inspectors certify that Iraq has destroyed all its nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.

<HEADLINE> GCC Official Wants Peaceful Solution of Iraqi-U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) expressed hope Saturday that the
latest Iraqi-U.N. standoff would be resolved peacefully to avoid
an escalation of tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
In his statement to Kuwait News Agency, Abdullah Bishara, the
just-elected chairman of the GCC Advisory Council, hoped that
the war option would be ruled out and the crisis be resolved with
Iraq's full compliance with the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's in our best interest that peaceful co-existence
prevails in the region with serious Iraqi cooperation with the
United Nations.... The region has been experiencing tension since
flare-up of the Iraq-Iran war in 1980," Bishara said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation for the GCC role in maintaining
balance of powers, stability and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Bishara, personal advisor to Kuwait's first Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah and former
GCC secretary general, made the remarks after he was elected
earlier Saturday as chairman of the GCC Advisory Council during
its first meeting.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced its decision on October 31 that it was halting
all forms of cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)
for disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution on Thursday,
which condemned the latest Iraqi defiance and urged it to rescind
its decision, but so far Iraq has refused to back down.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming GCC summit meeting, which will be held in Abu
Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates next month, Bishara said that the
GCC leaders would jointly reassert that Iraq must fully implement
all the U.N. resolutions related to its invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The GCC official also said that the Gulf leaders would again
demand that Iraq demonstrate good and peaceful intentions, admit
committing a crime with the aggression of Kuwait as a violation of
Arab and international charters.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates.

according to an earlier estimate of the Ministry of Water,
Forestry and Environment Protection. Over 16,000 people are
currently isolated in villages that are now in blackout.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Identify Cancer Killer Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- British and Swiss scientists
said Saturday that they have identified cells in the immune system
which attack and kill skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the killer cells, known as cytotoxic T
lymphoctyes, could help develop vaccines against the malignant
melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer and eventually
help boost the immune system to fight against other cancers.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, Britain, and
a Swiss research group at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research
in Lausanne, have developed a new technique to isolate and count
cancer killer cells.
</P>
<P>
The technique, based on earlier research into cells which
attack HIV virus, creates fake targets for cells which attack
cancer.
</P>
<P>
The targets, known as tetrameters, mimic the cancer cells and
contain three parts of the surface of a malignant melanoma cell.
</P>
<P>
They also contain a fluorescent dye so that the
cancer-attacking cells show up under a microscope when they lock
onto the tetrameters.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have worked on skin cancer because many
patients who suffer from it are known to go into spontaneous
remission, suggesting that their immune systems had been able to
fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
Dr Vincenzo Cerundolo, who led the British team, said that
though their work was still far from making the tumor go into
regression, they were well on the way to creating vaccines which
could boost the immune system.
</P>
<P>
"With this new technique, they will be able to monitor very
quickly whether the vaccines are boosting the immune system," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The results of the research are published in this week's
Journal of Experimental Medicine.

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Although the U.S. economy
has started to lose some momentum, it is expected to continue to
grow during 1999, according to an economic and housing forecast
presented at an ongoing national conference.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the country's GDP in 1999 will be about half of
this year's growth rate, estimated to be 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Association of Realtors (NAR) annual
convention and trade exposition in Anaheim, California, NAR's
consulting economist John Tuccillo said existing-home sales in
1999 will slide to 4.2 million or 4.3 million units from this
year's expected record of 4.75 million units. This year's resales
will be about 13 percent above the previous record in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tuccillo cited economic growth, long-term growth in the stock
market, favorable demographic factors, low interest rates and
strong employment growth as contributing to the record housing
market.
</P>
<P>
The market currently is shifting into a different phase, he
said. The slowing economy means slower employment growth, but he
said the strong demographic factors along with low interest rates
will keep 1999 strong.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the U.S. economy is tied to the worldwide
economy, said Tuccillo, citing Japan as "a big problem." But he
predicted that if Japan gets its act together, "the United States
will return to its growth path sooner, hopefully in the first part
of 2000."
</P>
<P>
The United States is relatively insulated from world financial
markets, but the biggest impact on the nation's economy is from
decreased demand for U.S. products overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tuccillo expected the flight to quality investments, especially
U.S. Treasury bills, to slow down in 1999, but he said interest
rates are expected to decline another quarter to half of a
percentage point from current levels.
</P>
<P>
NAR is the largest professional association of the United
States representing nearly 720,000 members involved in all aspects
of the real estate industry.

<HEADLINE> Schaeuble Replaces Kohl as Leader of German Conservatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) Saturday installed Wolfgang Schaeuble as the party's
new leader to replace former chancellor and party leader Helmut
Kohl, who was defeated by the Social Democrats (SPD) in the
general elections a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble, a long designated successor to Kohl, was elected CDU
chairman by an overwhelming majority at the party's convention in
Bonn on Saturday. He will continue to hold his current post as the
CDU parliamentary leader.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who had been CDU leader for 25 years, offered to step
down after the election defeat on September 27 to take personal
responsibility. However, he was still elected CDU's honorary
chairman on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With Schaeuble now at the helm, the CDU formally ushered in a
new era to play its still unfamiliar new role as Germany's main
opposition party after having been the main ruling party for the
past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
The unbearably high unemployment of over four million and a
widespread voters' desire for political change have been widely
blamed for the party's election defeat in September.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the party convention, Schaeuble admitted that the
CDU needs to do some rethinkings now and that the party's failure
to push through necessary structural reforms in Germany is part of
the reasons for the power change in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
But he also sharply criticized the economic program put forward
by the new coalition government formed between the SPD and
ecologist Greens party, saying that it would shy away investment
and employment.
</P>
<P>
Paralyzed below the waist after an assassination attempt during
the 1990 election race, Schaeuble, 55, has been viewed as a
tough-debater and a strategist of the CDU.
</P>
<P>
As one of the main loyal aides to Kohl, he had been frequently
employed by the former chancellor to play the role as a
troubleshooter over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
He is also ranked as Germany's most popular politician in
opinion polls.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House of
Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, who had announced he would
not seek reelection to the post, said Saturday he is also
resigning his seat in the House.
</P>
<P>
"I could hardly stand by and allow the party to cannibalize
itself," The Associated Press quoted Gingrich as saying outside
his home in Marietta, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
He said he would resign after figuring out the legalities. "As
a practical matter for me to stay in the House would make it
impossible for a new leader to learn, to grow, to do what they
have to do."
</P>
<P>
Calling on Republicans to pull together, Gingrich said, "The
prospect of Al Gore as president and a Democratic Congress should
be enough to focus every Republican in the country."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich's decision to leave congress set up a succession
struggle for the post next only to the presidency and vice
presidency.
</P>
<P>
If Gingrich resigns his House seat, the newly elected
Democratic governor of Georgia would have 10 days to call for an
election. The speaker assured his colleagues in the conference
call that his district will elect a Republican.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich decision to step aside came only three days after the
Republicans lost five seats in the elections Tuesday -- the first
time since 1934 that the party in power in the White House had
scored gains in midterm elections.

<HEADLINE> New Caledonians Vote for Pro-Independence Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The residents on the French South
Pacific territory of New Caledonia voted on Sunday with a crashing
majority for an agreement which could allow the archipelago to
gain independence from France within 15 to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
With a high turnout of 74.24 percent of the 106,000 registered
voters, 71.87 percent voted in favor of an agreement signed six
months ago by the French government and two major political
parties of the island.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Noumea, New Caledonia's capital, said that
followers of both the pro-independence party the Front de
Liberation Nationale Kanak Socialiste (FLNKS) and the
anti-independence party Rassemblement pour la Caledonie dans la
Republique (RPCR) voted for the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin with
the FLNKS and the RPCR in Noumea, Paris will gradually yield
autonomous power to the local authorities of New Caledonia prior
to a referendum around 2015 on whether the archipelago should be
fully independent.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin both hailed the approval of the agreement by the New
Caledonians.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time for New Caledonia to hold a
referendum, after the islanders voted in 1988 for an agreement
signed by the French government with the FLNKS and the RPCR which
ended violent clashes between the local Kanaks and French
settlers.

championship while Bulgaria was out of contention despite their
win over South Korea on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban team enjoyed a great advantage in blocking and
attacking over their Chinese opponents, winning the match
comfortably with a 15-6, 15-8 and 15-11 score.
</P>
<P>
The victory put Cuba into the semi-finals with a perfect
record.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Bulgaria took advantage of the bad attacking
game of South Korea, winning 15-5, 12-15, 15-6 and 15-12.
</P>
<P>
For Bulgaria this victory was the first since a long time
against an Asian team. "We did not meet them in the last years,"
said Bulgarian head coach Panchev. "So the team did not really
know what to expect."
</P>
<P>
South Korea's loss meant that China still had chance to
qualify for the semi-finals as now South Korea, Croatia and China
registered the same score on the standings of the group. The top
two teams in each group enter the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, China will play Bulgaria, South Korea meet Italy
and Croatia will face Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Croatia defeated Italy 10-15, 15-13, 8-15, 15-12,

straight wins after beating Peru 15-2, 15-9, 15-6 to grab a place
in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Brazil beat Japan 15-10, 15-4, 15-7 while the Netherlands
defeated Dominican Republic 15-8, 15-3, 15-7.

<HEADLINE> Iran voices Readiness to Buy Caspian Oil, Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran said Sunday it is ready to
buy Caspian oil and gas in an effort to convince the Caspian Sea
littoral states to export their oil and gas through Iranian
territory.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi voiced the readiness
in a message to the second international seminar on Caspian oil
and gas, which opened here Saturday, the official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran is ready to buy 1.5 million barrels of
oil and 200 million cubic meters of gas each day for its domestic
consumption.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we are the best trading partner in any venture for
exploration of Caspian resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, transferring oil to Europe by pipeline through Iran
and via Iranian ports is the most logical route that can be used
by Caspian littoral countries thanks to its extensive network of
ports, railways, roads and oil pipelines, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
The five Caspian littoral countries are Iran, Russia,
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Iran believes cooperation in exploitation and transport of
resources can pave the way for forging stronger regional
cooperative links and serve as a vehicle for peace, security and
sustainable economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to have a share in the transfer of Caspian oil,
Iran earlier announced a barter plan to receive the Caspian oil in
the north while delivering equivalent amount of Iranian oil in the
Gulf to the consumers of the Caspian states.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S., which prefers to see the oil from the
Caspian passing through an allied country like Turkey, rather than
hostile Iran, has firmly opposed the plan.
</P>
<P>
It has threatened to impose an embargo on foreign companies
which invested in Iran's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Turkey and Iran all vie for pipelines that transfer
Caspian oil and gas to the West to traverse their territories.
</P>
<P>
Oil from Azerbaijan started flowing through a preliminary
Russian pipeline last fall to Russia's Black Sea port of
Novorossisk, from where the oil will be transported to Europe in
tankers through the Bosporus Strait.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey and the U.S. are opposed to the Russian route,
arguing that the heavy oil tanker traffic through the narrow
Bosporus Strait has led to hundreds of accidents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey has received strong support from the U.S. to
build a pipeline from the Azeri capital of Baku to its
mediterranean port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
The post-cold war era unilateralism, pursued by the U.S., is
doomed to fail, Kharrazi said, "this policy has to be stopped, if
we want economic prosperity for our region that will undoubtedly
have positive impact on the world economy as well."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Noted Professor Exhibits Paris-Themed Oil Paintings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of oil paintings
by a noted Chinese painter was held recently at the Beijing
International Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
The dozens of oil paintings on exhibit are the work of Yin
Rongsheng, a professor at China's Central Academy of (CAFA)
Fine Arts, and have a common theme: Paris.
</P>
<P>
Yin, who was a visiting scholar at the state-run National
Higher Fine Arts School in 1984, has titled the exhibition "In
Memory of Paris."
</P>
<P>
Born in 1930, Yin graduated from the CAFA's oil painting
department in 1954 and taught there until the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"I like the artistic charm of Paris; there is art everywhere,"
Yin said of his experiences in Paris, where he held an exhibit of
his work in the spring of 1985.
</P>
<P>
His current Beijing exhibit is expected to be shown in Paris
next May.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980s, Yin's paintings often depicted the Chinese
scene over the years, and many of them have been collected at the
Museum of the Chinese Revolution, the China Military Museum, and
the China Fine Arts Gallery.

MOSCOW, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
returned to Moscow Sunday from the Black Sea resort of Sochi,
where he spent about 10 days recuperating from "extreme fatigue."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin arrived in the capital in the afternoon, the Itar-Tass
news agency quoted the presidential press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old president went to Sochi on October 30 on a
vacation prescribed by his doctors, days after he canceled a trip
to Vienna.
</P>
<P>
He suffered from cold and later bronchitis in earlier October,
forcing him to cut short his visit to Kazakhstan by one day.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had two heart attacks in 1996 in the wake of the June
16 presidential election. He also underwent a quintuple heart
bypass surgery in November that year.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Yet to Decide Which City to Stage 2002 World Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- FIFA delegates did not make
commitments on which city to stage the final match of 2002 World
Cup as they concluded an inspection of Japan's preparations for
hosting the event Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Japanese football association president Shunichiro Okano has
put heavy pressure on FIFA delegation not to declare which city
will stage the final match, said Antonio Matarrese, the FIFA vice
president and member of the FIFA organizing committee for the
World Cup 2002.
</P>
<P>
Matarrese said FIFA would wait for a recommendation from the
Japanese organizing committee, then the FIFA World Cup 2002
organizing committee would submit its report to its board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
Yokohama, which has completed the largest stadium in Japan
with a capacity of 70,000 seats, has already declared its bid to
stage the final match.
</P>
<P>
Saitama also joined the fray. The Saitama Prefectural Stadium
now under construction will be the biggest in Japan built
especially for football with a capacity of 63,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
But the most serious challenge may come from the capital city
Tokyo. The World Cup final matches have been usually staged in
the capital of a host country.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese football association official said: "As noted in
FIFA regulations, a 'national stadium' can stage any matches if
requested by FIFA. We can renovate the current National Stadium
(in Tokyo)."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Hosts 274,000 Foreign Refugees: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is providing
asylum to 274,328 refugees from some 20 African countries, 30,108
less than six month ago, according to the United Nations High

</P>
<P>
A report issued by the UNHCR Office here said that Ethiopia
has some 203,631 Somali refugees receiving UNHCR assistance in
eight camps in the East.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of 29,927 Somali refugees in Ethiopia in the

by the UNHCR and the Administration for Refugee and Returnee
Affairs of Ethiopia, said the report available here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Repatriation of Somali refugees from camps in eastern Ethiopia
to north Somalia, which started in December 1997, is continuing.
</P>
<P>
A total of 50,565 Somalis have been repatriated from
Hartisheik, Darwanaji and Teferi Ber refugee camps, to safe and
peaceful areas between west of Hargeisa and Boroma.
</P>
<P>
"The projected total repatriation for 1998 is 70,000, and for
1999 90,000," the report said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR statistics show that the number of Sudanese refugees
increased from 58,507 to 58,826 over the past six months, while
that of Kenyan refugees reduced from 8,671 to 8,271.

KUWAIT CITY, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Security men in Saudi
Arabia have foiled three attempts to smuggle 90 kilograms of
hashish and arrested the perpetrators, a Saudi security official
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
General Mutlaq Al-Sibai, chief of border guards in the eastern
area of Saudi Arabia, said that the border guard patrols in
Al-Riqi area, northeast of the kingdom, have foiled three attempts
to smuggle 90 kilograms of hashish, the Saudi Press Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
But the news agency didn't mention the nationalities of the
smugglers and when the attempts were aborted.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time since the end of August that the Saudi
anti-drug authorities have foiled drug smuggling attempts.
</P>
<P>
In the last two actions, 651,000 drug tablets and 200
kilograms of hashish were seized by Saudi border guards.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, like other oil-rich Gulf countries, is becoming
one of the clear targets for drug traffickers.
</P>

The Gulf kingdom, which adopts a strict policy against
narcotics, imposes capital punishment on drug traffickers
and dealers.

<HEADLINE> Nortel Networks Puts Emphasis on China Market  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada-based Nortel Networks
continues to increase its presence in China after a
9.1-billion-U.S.-dollar takeover of the global network
communications company Bay Networks earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
A senior Nortel Networks executive said this largest-ever world
network industry merger will greatly promote the company's
operations in China.
</P>
<P>
As a leading digital switches and optical transmission systems
company, Nortel Networks has established a remarkable presence in
China.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, it has signed more than 52 million U.S. dollars
worth of contracts with the only two telecommunications operators
in China to supply them with digital optical transmission and
GSM900 mobile communications systems.
</P>
<P>
It has also put into operation in the city of Xi'an in
northwest China one of the country's first CDMA mobile
communications networks
</P>
<P>
The company has also set up several joint ventures in Guangdong
in south China producing digital program controlled switches. So
far, it has sold ISDN switches with a total capacity of 20 million
lines in the country, or 8 to 10 percent of China's total.
</P>
<P>
Before being purchased by Nortel, Bay Networks already had a
strong presence in China. It is the leading ATM-switch supplier in
the country in terms of the number of connecting ports, and has
supplied equipment for ATM backbone networks in Beijing, Tianjin
and Hebei Province, and for campus data networks at Qinghua
University, Beijing University and the Beijing Posts and
Telecommunications University.
</P>
<P>
The company's products were also used to build dedicated data
networks for the State Tax authorities and other governmental
departments.

leading position in network communications.
</P>
<P>
Nortel Networks has adopted an all-round strategy to expand its
presence in telephones, mobile communications, specialized
networks, cable TV and Internet Protocol.
</P>
<P>
It has also set forth the idea of "integrated network" to help
operators in China and other countries combine the transmission
of data, voice and image on the basis of existing networks.
</P>
<P>
At the China '98 International Exhibition of Telecommunications
Equipment and Technology, Nortel Networks introduced a complete
line of its latest products and technologies, including wide-band
mobile communications systems, a switch that handles combined
data, voice and image signals, and a router/switch and wide-band
transmission system.
</P>
<P>
Its DWDM wide-band transmission system will be installed in
public telecommunications networks in Shaanxi Province in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
A Nortel Networks official said that since the size of the
multi-media service market in China is growing at an annual rate
of 200 percent, the company is accelerating the integration of the
products and technologies of Nortel and Bay Networks to meet the
specific needs of China.

<HEADLINE> 12 Percent Wage Cut Will Be Proposed in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong revealed Sunday that the Committee on
Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC) is going to propose a wage costs
cut amounting at least to 12 percent, the Television Corporation
of Singapore reported.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the revelation to reporters at a tree planting event
earlier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to TCS, Lee asked both employers and employees to
heed the strong signals that this is the only choice available to
make a balance wage adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Noting a 15 percent CPF (Central Provident Fund) cut was
exercised during the last recession in 1986, Lee said, "We had no
flexi-wage so it was only the CPF cut and 15 percent on CPF equals
12 percent on wages, so that is one benchmark."
</P>
<P>
"This time I think if you compare to (1986) the situation is
probably a more serious one so I don't think it can be a less than
12 percent cut in total wage cuts," Lee was quoted.
</P>
<P>
"But whatever is the number, we will divide that between the
CPF point and the wage point so that (there) is a good balance,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
On October 29, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong told the
Ordinary Delegates' Conference of the National Trades Union
Congress that labor costs would be reduced by five to eight
percent by introducing wage restraint for annual increments and
the flexi-wage systems to trim the variable component of wages.
</P>
<P>
He also noted, "this is a substantial reduction in wage costs
but not enough to restore our competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
Goh also said, "We bite the bullet and take a 10 percent cut"
in employers' contribution to the employees' CPF accounts as a
major measure to reduce labor costs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Tops List in Luring Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia topped the
list of Arab countries in luring foreign investments during
1984-1995, according to a study carried by official Saudi Press
Agency Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The study, prepared by Saudi Arabia's research center of the
council for commerce and industry chambers, said that Saudi
Arabia held the highest accumulated rate of direct investments
during the period of 1984-1995.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of investments brought into Saudi Arabia by
foreign investors stood at 10.7 billion U.S. dollars, or 35
percent of the gross accumulated foreign investments lured by the
Arab countries, the study said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that manpower cost and productivity were of prime
importance for successful management of performance and
investment.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it said, the cost-return is always the most important
concern for investors. It is thus necessary for the pioneering
administrator to cut labor cost and upgrade productivity, it
added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Saudi Arabia's flexible labor securing policy,
the labor cost in the Gulf kingdom had been modest compared with
other Arab states, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Other factors that counted include free economy system,
expanded market, full fledged infrastructure network, availability
of raw materials, as well as government incentives, security and
stability, it said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Police Foil Major Swindling Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Local police in this Chinese
capital city have arrested three people including a Taiwan
resident who are suspected of having swindled hundreds of millions
of yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ni Wenliang, the 41-year-old leader of the criminal clique, is
a native of Gushi County, Henan Province who now lives in Taipei,
the provincial capital of Taiwan, and holds a Belize passport.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Ni and Gao Zhenyu, from Shandong Province, and
Gong Congying, a native Beijinger, allegedly colluded in setting
up a number of firms to then buy the Xinguoda Futures Brokerage
Co., Ltd..
</P>
<P>
Since January this year, they began luring customers to invest
in futures with the brokerage firm by promising to share trading
risks and pay higher interests.
</P>
<P>
The police later discovered that "Xinguoda" was completely
fraudulent as the swindlers had never entered the futures market,
and all the "trading" was done on a fake "exchange" opened
somewhere in Shandong in east China.
</P>
<P>
As of November 5, the "brokerage firm" had received 532 million
yuan from 4,121 investors and paid 169 million yuan to the
investors in the form of "profits" and interest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the criminal ring had drawn cash or checks worth 140
million yuan, all of which were remitted abroad or hidden
domestically.
</P>
<P>
So far, the police have confiscated 15 million yuan in cash and
over seven million yuan in kind, including cars, real estate
properties and office facilities, and tools.
</P>
<P>
A search is underway for the remainder of the swindled money,
according to police sources.

<HEADLINE> Singapore-Malaysian Funds Agreement Not Charity: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 8 (Xinhua)-- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said Singapore's latest agreement to
help Malaysia raise funds in his country should be seen as a deal
and not as an act of charity, the Television Corporation of
Singapore (TCS) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the talks between Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok tong and his Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohamad in the
Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur on November 5, Lee was quoted
as saying that "the Malaysian discussions are on a win-win basis."
</P>
<P>
"The Malaysians have expressed desire to raise funds in
Singapore so I think a deal can be worked out which is beneficial
to both sides," TCS quoted without specifying the venue and date.
</P>
<P>
According to TCS, Lee emphasized that "it is not an exercise of
Malaysian charity to Singapore or Singapore charity to Malaysia."
</P>
<P>
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong made his latest trip to
Malaysia in a bid to ease the tense bilateral relations between
the two countries and at talks both sides agreed to set aside
their differences and focus on improving ties.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties between the two countries were hit after April
by a series of issues including the relocation of Malaysia's
Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) facilities in Singapore,
the use of Malaysian airspace by the Republic of Singapore Air
Force and the publication of Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's
memoirs.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between the two leaders, Mahathir expressed
hope to raise funds in Singapore to help his country ride out the
economic crisis and Goh Chok Tong promised to help. The two
leaders told a press conference after the talks that officials
from the two countries will negotiate the fund-raising issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of two rival Kurdish
factions of Iraq pledged here on Sunday that they will make joint
efforts in creating an environment of peace and stability in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) Politburo Member Hosyar
Vebari told reporters that KDP leader Massoud Barzani and
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) Chairman Jalel Talabani "had
held positive and constructive talks."
</P>
<P>
The two Kurdish leaders also pledged to explore ways to
strengthen ties with Turkey, Vebari said.
</P>
<P>
Both Barzani, who arrived here last Tuesday, and Talabani, who
came here Saturday, stressed the continuation of the Washington
Accord signed on September 17, he said.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord, signed by Barzani and Talabani in Washington
under the auspices of the United States State Department, is aimed
at ending armed conflicts in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This greatly annoyed Turkey which initiated the Ankara Peace
Process jointly with the U.S. and Britain to solve the Kurdish
issue in northern Iraq, which became a power vacuum following the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Turkey fears that the Washington accord would lead to an
independent Kurdish homeland in northern Iraq which would further
encourage Turkish Kurds to fight for their own independence in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly sent troops to northern Iraq, trying to
wipe out the rebel Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has taken
shelter there and launched attacks against Turkish targets in a
14-year-long armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Barzani's visit to Ankara has eased
Turkey's concerns over the future of northern Iraq after the
signing of the Washington accord.
</P>
<P>
Barzani, who sides with Turkey to fight the PKK, will leave
Turkey Sunday after winding up his five-day visit to Ankara and
Talabani will hold talks with Turkish high-ranking officials.

NANCHANG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The power shortage in Xunwu
County, an old revolutionary base in east China's Jiangxi
Province, was ended today as a local hydro-electric power station
went into operation.
</P>
<P>
The Douyan Hydro-Electric Power Station has a designed power-
generating capacity of 37,500 kw, the second largest among
China's hydro-electric power stations at the county level. Two
12,500-kw generators at the station began operating today.
</P>
<P>
The new station has made electricity accessible to all villages
and 95 percent of the rural families in Xunwu, according to county
secretary Lai Yijin.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in Xunwu has been slowed by a lack of power as
the county's rich water resources remained untapped because of
fund shortages, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new power station is expected to generate 10 million yuan
in fiscal revenues and add more than 100 yuan a year to the per
capita income of the region's farmers, Lai said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Two Israelis arrested in Cyprus
on Saturday have denied the charge against them of spying on the
Cypriot army between November 6-7 in the southern coastal village
of Zygi.
</P>
<P>
Udi Argov, 37, and Ig'al Damari, 49, appeared before Larnaca
District Court Saturday and were then remanded in custody for
eight days pending investigations.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were arrested after a police stakeout of the
apartment they had leased in Zygi, a military area.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Embassy said in a statement issued Sunday that it
had reported the details to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, adding
that "to the best of our knowledge, the two Israelis have denied
the allegations against them."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus police said that an Israeli Embassy official had
visited the suspects, who were transferred to the Central Prisons
in Nicosia Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Eviripides Evriviades, Cypriot ambassador to Israel, has said
Cyprus is investigating "all possibilities," including the chance
"that maybe these people were spying for Turkey."
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis were said to have visited Cyprus between
October 15-22 when the Cypriot National Guard staged its annual
exercise code-named "Nikiforos."
</P>
<P>
The arrest of the two Israelis came less than a week after
Israeli President Ezer Weizman paid a three-day state visit to
Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Help Zambia Alleviate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
and the Zambian government have earmarked a total of over 80
billion Kwacha (about 40 million U.S. Dollars) for poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The money mainly provided by the WFP will also be used in
skill training for the youths and women of Zambia in a period
from 1998 to 2002, according to Sunday Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the WFP will allocate 28.6 million
Dollars for basic activities and 3.3 million Dollars for
supplementary activities in light of the urgent needs of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government will also allocate 10.7 million Dollars
to the endeavor.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure progress in poverty reduction, the share of social
sector expenditure in the budget was progressively raised from 20
percent in 1991 to 34 percent in 1996, and was maintained at this
level for 1997," said a WFP report.
</P>
<P>
Despite this positive achievement, the report said, social
sector expenditure had declined in real terms, reflecting the
overall cutback in real government expenditures necessitated to
achieve greater fiscal rigor.
</P>
<P>
The report said that though one of the most prosperous
countries in the sub-Saharan Africa in the past, Zambia has
become one of the world's poorest countries, with low economic
development, declining incomes, increasing poverty and alarming
deteriorating social indicators.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
state president F.W. de Klerk has married his Greek-born
sweetheart Elita Georgiades in a tiny Greek Orthodox church in
southwest South Africa, Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The couple were spotted walking hand in hand toward their car
after the very private ceremony at Onrusrivier near Hermanus
Saturday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"We had planned a very private place and we didn't want it
public," de Klerk was quoted as saying. "We had hoped in due
course to have made a statement, after a few days."
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, 62, got a divorce from his wife of 38 years, Marike,
on October 30.
</P>
<P>
Elita, 46, had been married to Greek shipping tycoon Tony
Georgiades.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, who negotiated his party out of power in a bid to
abolish apartheid in the early 1990s, was awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1993 together with Nelson Mandela, who is now South
African president.

<HEADLINE> Polar Spirit Wins MSOQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALI, November 8 (Xinhua)-- Team Polar Spirit of Finland
overcame a serious challenge from Team EAR to win the second
annual Mild Seven Outdoor Quest on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were going to come back and catch us," said
Polar Spirit's Petri Forsman. "They're all such accomplished
athletes, and they have a great deal of running and biking skill.
But somehow we hung on. It feels very, very good to win this
race."
</P>
<P>
Polar Spirit takes home 46,000 U.S. dollars for the victory.
Team Mild Seven of China, a crowd favorite, finished sixth
overall.
</P>
<P>
The Mild Seven Outdoor Quest is a multi-sport endurance
competition. Four-person teams, each including at least one
woman, race a total of 230km over the course of four stages. The
events feature mountain biking, trail running, mountaineering,
lake paddling, kayaking, team biathlon and offroad inline skating.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 MSOQ was perhaps the most competitive race of its
kind in history, with a roster of competitors that included world
champions, Olympic champions, national champions, and even the
occasional legend, as was the case with Team EAR's Paula
Newby-Fraser, the eight-time winner of the Hawaiian Ironman
triathlon.
</P>
<P>
In the end, Polar Spirit won the event. They are a team
without pedigree, having honed their competitive skills through
such offbeat sports as rogaining (day-long orienteering
competitions) and cross-country skiing.
</P>
<P>
Lightly regarded coming into the race -- pre-race predictions
had them finishing out of the top 10 -- the Finns displayed a
daunting combination of teamwork, endurance, strength, and
blazing speed.
</P>
<P>
Polar Spirit held a five-minute lead into the fourth stage.
</P>
<P>
The final stage would be the toughest of all, with teams
starting with 15km of mountain bike biathlon, then 2km trail
running, 2km lake paddling in traditional Dali dinghy, 7km
offroad inline skating, and another 15km of mountain bike
biathlon before the finish.
</P>
<P>
Polar Spirit, which won the fourth stage in 3:23:17, clocked
the winning overall time of 16:31:51.
</P>
<P>
Team EAR, whose members are from Australia, United States and
Canada, placed second in 16:51:50, while Team BMC Software of the
United States was third in 17:13:08.

<HEADLINE> 10th China International Science and Peace Week Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The 10th China International
Science and Peace Week opened here today. Chinese scientists
will take part in various activities focusing on scientific
advancement and world peace in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
During the week, scientific and technological expositions,
academic lectures, book and painting exhibitions and film
screenings will be held in China's major cities to publicize the
important role science and technology plays in social development.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has sent a letter
of congratulation in which he said scientists play a crucial role
in international affairs encompassing security and disarmament,
economic development, human rights, and environment and public
health. He said the involvement of scientists in these affairs
derives from a basic concern for human welfare, and that the
scientific ethos is vital to international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the 43rd United Nations General Assembly passed a
resolution proclaiming the week which includes November 11 every
year as International Science and Peace Week. During this week,
the member countries are urged to hold activities educating the
public on the important role science and technology plays in the
maintenance of world peace and social development.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, more than 80 million Chinese have taken part
in these activities.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Minister Criticizes Health Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Health Minister Nkandu
Luo has abolished a 10 percent bonus from user fees to all the
health workers in the country, according to Sunday Times of
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the health workers from Livingstone and Kazungula
districts at the Victoria Hall in southern Zambia, the minister
ordered that bonus be paid only to those workers who deserve them
and not everyone as in the past.
</P>
<P>
She accused some health workers of being self-centered and
having few interests of patients at heart.
</P>
<P>
"Some health managers are drunk with their titles, while
patients are suffering due to poor management, this cannot be
tolerated," she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that she was saddened to find drugs meant
for patients being sold in bars, markets and streets with their
foreign trade marks due to pilfering by drivers and some workers
in the hospitals of the country.
</P>
<P>
She told health workers to take a critical look at themselves
and to evaluate as to whether they have been in conformity with
the demand of the nation before they are kicked out of the
system.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in a week the minister accused the
country's health workers.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, she told health personnel to stop selling drugs
meant for hospitals or risk being suspended and eventually
sacked.
</P>
<P>
She said that measures have been put in place to investigate
such unscrupulous people.

<HEADLINE> Letter Appeals to Beijingers Not To Eat Wild Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Beijing wildlife conservation
officials and experts today make public an open letter appealing
to residents in the Chinese capital to take the lead, and not eat
wild animals.
</P>
<P>
This was a part of today's activities marking the 10th
anniversary of China's first law on the protection of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
"Protecting wild animals is not only necessary for the future
of mankind, but also a sign of the progress of civilization
in a nation," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"Every resident should refuse to take wild animals as food and
try to stop harming them and their habitations," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The letter has the full support of the State Forestry
Administration and the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Association.
</P>
<P>
"Eating wild animals is a bad habit," said Zhang Lianyou, an
official of the State Forestry Administration, "it is completely
unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
"At present, more and more Chinese have come to refuse to eat
wild animals. However, many wild animals -- like snakes and frogs
-- are still available in a few restaurants of Beijing and other
major cities," he said.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that more than 300 wildlife-related violations
have been reported in the city.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, according to the Beijing Municipal Association of
Wildlife Conservation, wildlife resources around Beijing have been
on rise in recent years with the growth of the region's forest
coverage.
</P>
<P>
"For example, the number of bird species around here has been
increased from 340 in the 1960s to 370 now," an local wild
conservation official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A team of foreign investors
has arrived in Afghanistan to explore venues for investments in
various fields in a bid to help in the reconstruction of the
war-devastated country.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Sunday from the Afghan capital of Kabul
said, the investors, belonging to France, Germany, Britain, South
Africa, Pakistan and the U.S., are accompanied by experts in the
fields of telecommunications, oil and gas and construction of
roads.
</P>
<P>
One of the major concerns of the investors is the installation
of a new telecommunication system to replace the existing one that
has lost its vigor, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The investors discussed with the Afghan Taliban administration
ways and means to promote foreign investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a senior Taliban official responsible for
communications assured the investors of full cooperation from the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported Sunday
that the Taliban are developing Afghanistan's largest copper mine,
with a total reserves of 11 billion tons, near Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Nine international consortiums, including Siemens from Germany,
are reported to have signed a memorandum of understanding on
investing in the mine located 35 kilometers south of Kabul.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Calls for Promoting Kindness, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong has said the Singapore Kindness Movement has taken added
significance because of the current difficult economic climate.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the point when he spoke at the launch
Sunday of the first Singapore Kindness Week that is designed to
cultivate a culture of kindness and consideration in Singapore and
to convey the value of kindness and consideration to the young
people.
</P>
<P>
Noting the economic downturns could have a negative impact on
social behavior, Goh said, "When the economic pie shrinks, some
people tend to look after themselves only as they compete for jobs
or struggle to keep their business alive."
</P>
<P>
"It is precisely during such difficult times that kindness and
consideration are needed," he emphasized. "It is in these trying
times that our character as a people is put to test."
</P>
<P>
Citing his own experiences that an elderly Chinese lady in
Canton, China, used her domestic renminbi to buy biscuits for him,
a Korean lady offered to share her umbrella with him in a drizzle
and a Marine Parade resident in his own country gave him a packet
of sliced ginseng during election campaign, Goh said the virtues
embodied in these kind little acts are needed to maintain balance
and harmony in the society.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister called upon Singaporeans to make the kindness
movement a truly civic movement by encouraging Singaporeans from
all walks of life to embrace its message of kindness.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Kindness Movement was first unfolded in response to
Goh's call in 1996 when, in his new year's message, he called upon
Singaporeans "to complement our economic achievement with social,
cultural and spiritual development" with an aim to make Singapore
"a gracious society."
</P>
<P>
According to the prime minister, Singapore Kindness Movement
has made good progress in the past two years and from this year on
a week in every year will be designated as the Singapore Kindness
Week to remind and encourage Singaporeans to make the lives of
others more pleasant through little acts of kindness throughout
the year.

<HEADLINE> Killing of Former Minister Not Political: Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police have ruled out
any political motive behind the killing of former finance
minister Ronald Penza.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations show that the killing could not
have been politically motivated because of the manner in which
they attacked the two houses in the early hours of Friday in the
suburb of Lusaka, Times of Zambia newspaper Sunday quoted police
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka police chief Ryan Chitoba and Zambian police spokesman
Beenwell Chimfwembe said here Saturday that three of the six
gunmen who attacked the house of Penza and his neighbor were
killed by police later on Friday when the group tried to rob a
filling station near Independence Stadium and two others were
also gunned down at a hideout in Chazanga township near the
capital.
</P>

Chitoba said that "when they attacked the first house, they
beat up the occupants and insisted on seeing the owner of the
house Mr. Kamanga so that he could give them some dollars."
</P>
<P>
At the Penza's, the bandits also asked for dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chimfwembe said that all the dead suspects had previous
criminal records and were believed to be behind the spate of
robberies which have rocked the capital city of late.
</P>
<P>
"These people are ordinary criminals who wanted dollars so I
don't think the killing could have been political motived," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Asked why police killed the suspects instead of capturing
them, Chimfwembe said that they were armed and opened fire when
they saw the police.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police inspector Francis Ndhlovu told a two-day
workshop on crime prevention beginning here Saturday that the
main reasons for the increased crimes are the adverse social
economic conditions, poverty, urbanization, broken families and
drug abuse.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Catholics to Take AIDS Test Before Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The dioceses of the Catholic
Church in Nigeria have asked members who want to get married to
produce the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) test
certificate in a bid to check the spread of the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Sunday quoted secretary of social
communication of the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria Rev. Fr.
Emmanuel Badejo as saying that the development is aimed at
creating understanding among the couples about their health,
beliefs and life style during their married life.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, in the archdiocese of Onitsha, before
a marriage can be solemnized in any of its parishes, the two
parties must have been tested for the deadly disease and their
certificates submitted to their priest.
</P>
<P>
If one of them tests positive to the disease, the priest will
counsel them and tell them the realities and implications of what
they are entering into.
</P>
<P>
Badejo noted that it is not a directive, it is rather an
advice, adding that it is not restricted to the AIDS test alone
and the couples are encouraged to carry out comprehensive tests
including their blood types and so on.
</P>
<P>
Badejo, who is the press secretary of the Catholic Bishops
Conference of Nigeria, pointed out that "even when one party is
discovered not to be too well, they can still insist they want to
do it."
</P>
<P>
But, he added, there have been some marriages that have been
called off because of revelations from the AIDS test.
</P>
<P>
"Not very many people may want to live with any one with such
a deadly disease. But I think it is good for all of us, it is an
important way of checking the spread of the disease," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986 when the first AIDS patient was reported in the
west African country, there has been steady increase of the AIDS
victim percentage in its population from 1.75 percent in 1991/92
to 4.5 percent in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
Lagos State Health Commissioner Michael Ogunbesan said early
this month that "results of HIV screening for patients in our
hospitals have increased from 9.4 percent in 1996 to 14 percent
in 1997 and 16 percent have been recorded so far in 1998."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Enhances Civic Awareness of Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Hong Kong
official said here Sunday that to enhance the public understanding
of the Basic Law, the mini-constitution of the Special
Administrative region (SAR), is as important as its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law is the cornerstone of the rule of law in the
HKSAR," said Elsie Leung, Secretary for Justice at the opening
ceremony of the Civic Education Day, the culmination of a
fortnight campaign aimed at promoting civic awareness and public
understanding of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that effective implementation of the Basic Law
could only be guaranteed by the public's recognition of the status
of the Basic Law as the mini-constitution of Hong Kong. Only
through this understanding can the principles of "one country, two
systems" and "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong" be fully
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Committee on the Promotion of Civic Education,
the campaign highlighted the vital importance of the Basic Law as
a legal instrument and its relevance to the daily life of the Hong
Kong people.
</P>
<P>
The Civic Education Day concluded the campaign, which comprised
about 30 activities, such as carnivals, shows and exhibitions.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Officials Say 20 Stadiums for Next World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The organizers in South Korea
and Japan have assured world soccer governing body FIFA that the
2002 World Cup co-hosted by the two countries will be staged in
20 stadiums as planned, FIFA officials said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"They have assured us the stadiums will all be built, and
therefore we will continue with 10 venues in both Japan and
(South) Korea," said Alan Rothenberg, former president of the
United States Soccer Federation.
</P>
<P>
He added that South Korea handed FIFA a plan to build 10
stadiums while Japan also plans to use 10 stadiums.
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to balance their operational and financial
burdens against the idea that they want to take the World Cup to
as many parts of their respective countries as they can," said
Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
FIFA officials also said the ticketing problems taking place
in this summer's World Cup finals in France would not recur in
2002.
</P>
<P>
"The mismanagement of the ticket sales and distribution in
France is an excellent lesson for FIFA in order that it is not
repeated again," said Peter Velappan, FIFA coordinator for the
2002 World Cup organizing committee.

Chancellor Gordon Brown has forecast that the UK's economic
growth will slow down significantly in 1999 and the Bank of England
will cut the interest rates by 0.5 percent on Thursday in an

<HEADLINE> Japan Shows Interest in Projects in Nepal: Nepali PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala said here Sunday that despite recession at home,
Japan shows interest in a number of projects in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
He told the press at the airport upon return from an official
visit to Japan that these projects include the second-phase radar
installment at the Tribhuvan International Airport, Kulekhani-3
hydropower project in Makwanpur district of central Nepal, road
construction in Kathmandu and the Melamchi drinking water project
which aims to improve the water supply in the capital.
</P>
<P>
He described his five-day visit to Japan, the biggest donor to
Nepal, as "very successful and very significant."
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan has deep trust and friendship toward Nepal.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce
and Industry and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce had signed a
memorandum of understanding on promoting joint investment in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Japanese side asked Nepal to open more
flights to Japan to promote tourism in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
At present, there is a twice-a-week Kathmandu-Osaka flight,
bringing in some 25,000 Japanese tourists in 1995 and 28,920 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government "expresses satisfaction that the visit
has enhanced the already strong relations of friendship, goodwill
and understanding between Nepal and Japan to a new height," the
Nepali Foreign Ministry said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of visa requirement for Nepalese visitors to Hong
Kong, Prime Minister Koirala said that during his stopover in Hong
Kong, he raised the issue with Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Immigration Department had announced that from
October 28, Nepalese visitors to Hong Kong need to apply for visa
instead of the previous visa-free arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Koirala said that many Nepalese went to Hong Kong "in the wrong
way." He stressed that the facilities should not be misused.
</P>
<P>
Discussions will be held again on the issue between the two
sides, he added.

<HEADLINE> 15 Sentenced to Death in Bangladeshi Murder Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The District and Session Judge
Court of Dhaka Sunday gave death sentences to 15 of the 19 persons
accused in the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman murder case, the
official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The sentences will be executed in open firing square. The news
agency did not mention when the execution would be carried out.
</P>
<P>
The court acquitted four of the accused on benefit of doubt.
</P>
<P>
Mujibur Rahman, the first prime minister of independent
Bangladesh and father of incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,
and most of his family members were assassinated in a plot on
August 15, 1975.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 people were killed in the 1975 assassination,
including 11 gunned down at the residence of Mujibur Rahman at
Dhanmondi in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
According to prosecution witnesses, Mujibur Rahman, his wife,
his brother and three sons were among those killed at his
residence. His two daughters, Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana,
survived the massacre as they were abroad at the time.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the case formally began in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Before the Hasina-led Awami League came to power in June 1996,
no action was taken against those involved in the killing case.
The Bangladeshi parliament scrapped the Indemnity Law in November
1996, which had been previously enacted and later incorporated in
the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Iran Repatriates Over 30,000 Afghan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official has
said that more than 30,000 Afghan refugees have voluntarily
returned home from Iran since the beginning of the current Iranian
year (starting from March 21), a local daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Abdolreza Haji Arab, deputy director general of Iranian
Interior Ministry, told the Persian-language daily Iran that the
repatriation was carried out in accordance with relevant
international laws.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present, about 1.5 million Afghan refugees
living in Iran have refugee identity cards, but a large number of
Afghan refugees are living in Iran illegally.
</P>
<P>
As Afghanistan run into civil wars, more than 3 million
Afghans fled into Iran during the past two decades. Over 1 million
of them were repatriated during recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, many Afghan people entered Iran illegally after the
Taliban militia took control of most parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> India's Oldest Biological Fossils Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Fossils of
three-billion-year-old algae, the oldest biological fossils in
India, have been discovered at Kashia region of Orissa state in
northeastern India, Press Trust of India (PTI) said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists of the Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleobotany (BSIP)
in Lucknow, 497 km southeast of New Delhi, have found remains of
photosynthetic blue green algae, estimated to be 3.2 billion years
old and belonging to the Archean era.
</P>
<P>
The world's oldest fossil record is that of a 3.5-billion-year
old specimen from Australia.
</P>
<P>
The discovery promises to be very important as the oldest rocks
in the country are 3.2 billion years old, said Deputy Director of
BSIP P. K. Maithy.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the fossils in Orissa explains the presence of
rich iron ore deposits in the state as the algae remains indicated
that they released enough oxygen to help natural deposition of
iron, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Launch Non-Governmental News Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran's first non-governmental
news agency, Fars News Agency (FNA), will be launched by the end
of 1998, the Hamshahri daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the FNA Saeed Noubari said in an
interview with Hamshahri that the agency has obtained permission
from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.
</P>
<P>
He said that the FNA would launch its activities in three
stages: covering domestic affairs, building an internet website
and establishing bureaus in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Noubari refused to mention the financial sources of his news
agency, but said the FNA's establishment was warmly welcomed by
different groups and figures in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed the suggestion that the FNA was established
by the powerful conservatives, which dominates the country's
legislative and judiciary bodies, to confront the pro-moderate
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Basing on the guidance of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, he said, genuineness, accuracy and speed would be the
characteristics of the FNA.
</P>
<P>
Noubari, a history graduate from Beheshti University, was an
IRNA employee years ago and serves at present as head of the
public relations office of Tehran provincial judicial department.

<HEADLINE> Liberalization Not Single Solution to All Problems: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A Malaysian analyst said
Sunday trade liberalization is generally good for a country's
economic development, but it may not necessarily be the best thing
for every economy.
</P>
<P>
"The idea that 'if you have problem, then you liberalize' is
unrealistic and ludicrous," said Noordin Sopiee, chairman and
chief executive officer of the Institute of Strategic and
International Studies (ISIS) at a press conference here to brief
reporters on the forthcoming APEC Business Summit to be held here
next week.
</P>
<P>
ISIS is one of the organizers of the forthcoming APEC business
Summit which will be held here from November 14 to 16 in
conjunction with the informal meeting of APEC Leaders which is
scheduled for November 17 and 18 here.
</P>
<P>
Noordin said that in APEC, people will get fed-up with hanging
only to one solution for one problem, and particularly at a time
of financial crisis, it would be difficult for certain economies
facing economic crisis to opt for a single solution such as
liberalization for each of their problems.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue with trade liberalization for our own good,
but sometimes we have to do other things other than liberalize,
liberalize, liberalize," he said, adding such thought that
economies should only stick to a specific solution is "politically
naive and uncaring."
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming APEC business Summit, Noordin said the
business summit will seek a consensus among prominent corporate
figures from all business sectors to the meeting on various issues
to shape a new APEC to meet the opportunities and challenges of
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
He said the business summit will discuss the relevance and
contribution of APEC in the current economic crisis, as well as
seek smart partnerships among businesses in the following sectors:
e-commerce, telecommunications, financial services, infrastructure
development, transportation, small and medium-scale enterprises,
education, agro-based industries, energy and environment.
</P>
<P>
A session of the summit will also look at ways to reform the
international monetary system, he said.
</P>
<P>
To a question on the reform of global monetary system, Noordin
said, "There will be many issues such as e-commerce, and small and
medium industries (to be discussed at the summit) but obviously,
monetary system reform will be a very central part of the agenda."
</P>
<P>
This is because businessmen are now looking forward to
stability and they are "very angry" with hedge funds which had
largely contributed to fluctuations in the regional currencies, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Framework Group Holds 3rd Meeting in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The third meeting of the
Manila Framework Group was held in Malaysia on November 7 and 8
with a call for urgent action by financial crisis-affected
countries to strengthen and accelerate social programs to mitigate
the impact of the crisis on the poor and vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
Finance and Central Bank deputies from 14 economies noted
several positive developments during their discussions on regional
surveillance, and at the same time recognized several risks
remain, according to a press statement issued at the end of the
two-day meeting here Sunday which was read out by Malaysia's
Treasury Secretary-General Aris Othman at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The positive developments noted included some signs of
stability and strengthening in financial markets; reduction in
interest rates in industrialized countries; progress made towards
providing additional resources to the International Monetary Fund
(IMF); exchange rate stability in the countries most-affected by
the crisis which have allowed a lowering of interest rates to
support the process of economic recovery; and determined
implementation of on-going economic and financial reforms, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the risks which remain included the implications of the
deterioration in the external financing environment following
developments in Russia, the risks of slower global growth, and the
challenges in implementing financial and corporate restructuring
in the crisis countries.
</P>
<P>
The participants discussed at the meeting progress in reforming
the international financial system in the light of the proposals
endorsed by the IMF's Interim Committee and by the meeting of
finance ministers and central bank governors from 26 economies in
Washington in October and those included in the recent statement
of finance ministers and central bank governors of the G-7.
</P>
<P>
They considered rapid implementation of these proposals
essential to improve the outlook for sustainable growth across the
region and to strengthen the capacity to prevent future financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The participants called for active involvement of regional
economies in advancing this work.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that in discussing the policy responses of
individual countries to the crisis, the deputies noted that
Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand have made solid progress in
implementing reform programs supported by the IMF, the World Bank
and Asian Development Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
It said Japan stressed its commitment to providing a sustained
boost to domestic demand and stated its intention to implement
comprehensive banking reforms "swiftly and effectively," including
the recapitalization of banks with appropriate conditions.
</P>
<P>
In China, interest rates have been eased and an expansionary
fiscal package is being implemented to further stimulate economic
growth, it said.
</P>
<P>
Maintenance of the Renminbi exchange rate has provided an
important anchor to help secure regional financial stability, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The participants stressed the specific measures necessary to
strengthen private financing and official capital flows,
acknowledging continued pursuit of appropriate macroeconomic and
structural policies to promote an environment conducive to foreign
investment would facilitate this process, it said.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the importance of broadening and deepening
domestic financial markets to ensure greater efficiency in the
intermediation of savings within the region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed on the need for greater transparency and
openness in both public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The participating economies at the Kuala Lumpur meeting were

<P>
MANILA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
lend 300 million pesos (about 7.5 million U.S. dollars) to farmers
and low-income people as part of its efforts to spur economic
activity and raise the living standards of the rural folk.
</P>
<P>
According to a Philippine News Agency report Sunday, the amount
will come from the National Livelihood Support Fund (NLSF), which
is administered by the Land Bank of the Philippines to establish
livelihood projects in agrarian reform communities and other areas
in the country's 20 poorest provinces.
</P>
<P>
The NLSF initially earmarked 100 million pesos (2.5 million
dollars) for the program but increased it to 300 million pesos to
allow more farmers and small entrepreneurs to benefit from its
1998 budget, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Amid the hardship and low productivity brought about by the
economic crisis, it becomes even more necessary for the NLSF to
provide additional loan funds to create livelihood opportunities
in the grassroots to counter the financial woes that the country
is experiencing," NLSF Executive Director Jose Escartin was quoted
by the agency as saying in the report.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Joseph Estrada ordered the release of 900
million pesos (25 million dollars) for a credit program to give
women and small-scale businessmen access to soft loans through the
government-run People's Credit and Finance Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the credit program aims to reach one million women
entrepreneurs and small-scale businessmen by the year 2000.

HARARE, November 8 (xinhua) -- Zimbabwean soccer champions
Dynamos made history Saturday night at the Harare National Sports
Stadium by becoming the first local team to reach the final of
the African Champions League despite losing by a single goal to G
hana's Hearts of Oak in their Group A match.
</P>
<P>
Although the victory enabled Hearts of the Oak to finish with
10 points, the same as Dynamos, the Zimbabwean champions cruised
through to the final because of a superior goal difference.
</P>
<P>
In a match played at a fast pace, the Ghanians dominated the
first half but they either failed to convert their advantage into
goals or were denied by a solid Dynamos defence.
</P>
<P>
However, Hearts managed to score late in the second half when
mid-fielder Joe Fameyeh struck in the 87th minute following a
blunder by the otherwise dependable Dynamos goalkeeper Ernest
Chirambadare.
</P>
<P>
But the goal did count for nothing as the Ghanians needed to
win by a two-goal margin to enter the final.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very tough match but I knew if we managed to hold on
we would make it. I want to thank the supporters for cheering us
all the way through," said Dynamos assistant manager Peter
Fanwell.

He was speaking after a briefing with military leaders on the

</P>
<P>
Responding to Rwandan military strongman Major-General Paul
Kagame's long-solicited confession of his country's involvement
in the DRC or Congo (K), Mugabe said the confession was long
overdue, the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
"That's the truth that should have been told long, long ago
and we were waiting for the truth," Mugabe said. "We knew from
our operations and from soldiers who have been captured and
identified as Rwandans."
</P>
<P>
"It's the truth of an invasion, the truth of agrssion, the
truth of undermining a sovereign state," he said. "They must
start retracing because they have invaded without reason to do
so."
</P>
<P>
He said the assertion by Rwanda and Uganda that they were in
Congo (K) to protect their interests was unfounded and baseless.
They would not have gone as far as Kitona or Kinshasa if this was
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
"They have to say we have been guilty of an act of aggression,
let's relent and go back the way we came," said the Zimbabwean
president.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe left for Ouagadougou Saturday morning to mediate in the
volatile border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea as part of
initiatives of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to bring
peace to the warring Horn of Africa neighbors.

<P>
BEIRUT, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese student was wounded
in south Lebanon on Saturday night during an Israeli bombardment,
the Orient radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old student was wounded when shells fired by
Israeli artillery troops landed near his school at Barashit in
the western sector of the Israeli-occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The attack raised to 56 the number of Lebanese civilians
wounded in south Lebanon since the start of this year. Another 19
were killed over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
dislodge Israeli occupying forces and its proxy South Lebanon Army
out of the country.

LOS ANGELES -- Although the U.S. economy has started to lose
some momentum, it is expected to continue to grow during 1999,
according to an economic and housing forecast presented at an
ongoing national conference.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the country's GDP in 1999 will be about half of
this year's growth rate, estimated to be 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Association of Realtors (NAR) annual
convention and trade exposition in Anaheim, California, NAR's
consulting economist John Tuccillo said existing-home sales in
1999 will slide to 4.2 million or 4.3 million units from this
year's expected record of 4.75 million units. This year's resales
will be about 13 percent above the previous record in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tuccillo cited economic growth, long-term growth in the stock
market, favorable demographic factors, low interest rates and

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 100 Injured in Bangladesh Ruling, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and at
least 100 others were injured in clashes involving supporters of
the ruling and opposition parties, and the police, in the capital
city on Saturday, just one day ahead of the scheduled announcement
of the verdict of the killing case of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman, the first prime minister of independent Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 people were admitted to the Dhaka Medical College
Hospital, and at least 16 vehicles were torched and over two
dozens damaged during the violence in which rivals fought with
sticks, rocks, home-made bombs and guns, press reports here said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 51 people on charges of arson and rioting.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Awami League claimed the dead as their activist and
blamed the major opposition the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
for gunning him down. But a report in The Daily Star quoted
hospital sources as saying that the body of the dead bore only
stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party mobilized its workers on the street to observe
its "Freedom Fighters-Soldiers Killing Day" on Saturday,
confronting the opposition's program to mark its "National
Solidarity and Revolution Day."
</P>
<P>
The violence centered around Paltan Maidan, where the BNP
organized a public meeting in the afternoon to observer the
"National Solidarity and Revolution Day," but the meeting was
foiled halfway when police fired tear-gas shells at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Panic-gripped people ran in all directions as smoke filled the
meeting place.
</P>
<P>
Police lobbed tear-gas shells directly aiming at the podium
where BNP chief Kaleda Zia was about to address the gathering, The
Independent daily newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Tear-gas shells fell right in front of the dais when Zia had
just began her speech, and the rally was abandoned later,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the violence at one place erupted when a
procession led by BNP workers confronted the police who blocked
the way by putting barbed wire barricade. The procession tried to
force their way towards Paltan Maidan and started pelting stones
while the police lobbed tear-gas shells and used batons to
disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Activists of the ruling party were also trying to block the BNP
meeting-bound processions at some other places, leading to
clashes, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Saturday evening, the BNP chairperson
accused the government of making a "well-planned attempt" to foil
her public meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Awami League government "let loose a reign of terror across
the country to cover up its misdeeds, its failure to run the
country, particularly to tackle the recent catastrophic flood,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She announced countrywide demonstrations on Sunday, and a
protest program of non-stop 48-hour countrywide hartal beginning
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The BNP and its alliance would lead a march at the parliament
building on November 16, and stage a mass hunger strike on
November 23, according to Zia, who is also Leader of the
Opposition in Parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- After a subdued spell,
Pivotals rallied during the week on the Bombay Stock Exchange
(BSE) market on fresh support of foreign funds coupled with local
short covering.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index declined from the opening level of
2,820.23 to 2,774.11 but recovered thereafter to finish at
2,884.37 with a modest gain of 71.88 points compared with the
previous week's level of 2,812.49.
</P>
<P>
The national index also gained 22.44 points to 1,283.22 from
the previous close of 1,260.78.
</P>
<P>
The sentiment was easy on Monday, but Tuesday gave a thumbs
down to the green signal for share buy-back ordinance.
</P>
<P>
The buy-back will not help in sustaining the growth in the
stock market in view of the liquidity crunch faced by industry.
Unless there is a revival of the Indian economy and market demand
is generated, such measures may not yield results as expected by
the government in the near future, brokers said.

<HEADLINE> Rubber Output Falls in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Rubber production in Sri Lanka
fell sharply in the first seven months of this year as a result of
lower prices, too much rain and a shortage of labor, according to
a recent research report from stock brokers.
</P>
<P>
Rubber output fell almost 12 percent to 59 million kg in the
period compared to last year. Rubber prices have fallen by 21
percent over the same period because of over-supply following the
Asian economic crisis, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The continuous rains experienced in most parts of the country,
particularly since May this year, have also hindered tapping.
</P>
<P>
The report forecasts a rubber output of 95 million kg for this
year, 10 percent lower than in last year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Sugar Industry Tasting Bitter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China's sugar industry is
suffering from some bitterly low prices because of over production
and smuggling, according to a recent issue of Information Daily.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province, one of China's major sugar producers, was
hit hard when a ton of sugar started selling at a record low 2,800
yuan for part of this year. The price has risen to 3,400 yuan a
ton but that is still more than 600 yuan below cost.
</P>
<P>
A reasonable profit can be made only when a ton of sugar is
selling for 4,500 yuan, the paper reports. Guangdong's sugar
industry has had losses of one billion yuan for the recently ended
production year.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that China produced 8.13 million tons of sugar
this year, an increase of 1.33 million tons over last year, but
the market capacity remained at 7.1 million tons, the same as last
year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the overproduction, imports and smuggling have
dealt a severe blow to China's sugar industry, which charges 1,000
yuan more a ton than foreign sugar producers. Sugar sells for
about 280 U.S. dollars, or 2,400 yuan a ton on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
The paper suggests that China's sugar industry not look for
anything above the current price for the next two or three years
because Chinese sugar prices will inevitably merge with
international prices. The paper says that the only way for Chinese
sugar producers to move out of the red and into the black is to
try to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission has ordered Guangdong
and two other major producers, Guangxi and Yunnan, to increase
sugar reserve to help out sugar companies.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Expects Over 40 Billion U.S. Dollars in Foreign Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A financial agreement
under negotiation between Brazil and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) could mean an assistance of 40 billion to 45 billion
U.S. dollars in the next three years, the Jornal do Brazil
newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a government official as saying that the
amount might vary a little, either upward or downward, but it
would always be between those parameters.
</P>
<P>
The IMF would contribute between 15 billion and 18 billion
dollars, the World Bank approximately four billion dollars, and
the Interamerican Development Bank a similar amount, while the
balance could come from the Group of Seven (G-7) nations.
</P>
<P>
The assistance plan, to start in December, would depend on
whether the Brazilian government could significantly cut its
budget deficit by the year 2001, as targeted in a budget
adjustment program now being discussed in the Congress.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment program, which was accepted by the IMF, must be
approved by the Congress before its implementation. Despite
criticism, the government is confident that the parliament will
give a go ahead for its execution.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Alternative Steps Effective in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Impatient with the slow cure of
austerity programs, Southeast Asian countries are taking
alternative steps to spur an economic rally, including cutting
interest rates, increasing spending and reviving government role
in the economy.
</P>
<P>
But can the alternative medicine cure the serious illness
suffered by Southeast Asian countries? This is the question which
has been raised by some economists.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of the regional financial crisis in July
1997, most Southeast Asian countries have undertaken their
economic readjustment with the austerity prescription of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). They, among other measures, had
cut government expenditure, delayed or abandoned construction
projects, and limited imports of non-essential products.
</P>
<P>
However, the austerity programs have not changed the region's
economic picture. Instead, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand have fallen into serious economic recession.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank estimated last month that the
regional economy would fall 7.8 percent this year, and would
likely shrink 1.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to make their economies turn around, Southeast
Asian countries have taken some alternative steps to boost the
economy. With the continuous rise of regional currencies,
Southeast Asian countries cut sharply interest rates in the past
two months.
</P>
<P>
Interbank rates are as low as 7 percent in Malaysia now. Since
July, South Korea's interest rates fallen by eight percentage
points to 8.6 percent, and Thailand's tumbled from 22 percent to
9.2 percent. In the Philippines, the central bank slashed its
overnight borrowing rates to 13.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate cut, the key step taken by Southeast Asian
countries to stimulate the economy, has, until now, proved
effective, as it has not weakened the position of regional
currencies as some economists feared before, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
During the past month, a stronger Japanese yen and the interest
rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board have prompted a sharp
rebound of Southeast Asian currencies, which have climbed up by 3
percent to 25 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
If the interest rate reduction has already proved successful, a
fiscal stimulus, or expanding spending, by Southeast Asian
countries to boost their economy, has remained under debate among
economists.
</P>
<P>
With the IMF approval, Southeast Asian countries have thrown
off some austerity measures and increased public spending by
increasing their budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
In September, the IMF approved budget deficit at 3 percent of
the gross domestic product (GDP) for Thailand this year, 4 percent
for South Korea and 8.5 percent for Indonesia. The Philippines
will also increase its budget deficit from 40 billion pesos (one
billion U.S. dollars) to 50 billion peso (1.2 billion dollars) for
this year.
</P>
<P>
But some economists say that such a step will not work as the
size of these deficits will not be sufficient for badly needed
bank capitalization and social safety measures.
</P>
<P>
What is more, they said, governments will fall too far into the
red.
</P>
<P>
As another policy shift, Southeast Asian countries recently
revived government role in the economy.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Southeast Asian governments had intervened in the
economy. But by 1990s', many of them decided to swear off their
interventionist practices, allowing markets to determine the
economic winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
But since so many private banks and companies are heavily in
debts now, only governments could save them from bankruptcy. In
South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand, the governments are taking
over banks or becoming major shareholders of banks.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, the government is reportedly using money from
state agencies to bail out some business, while in Indonesia,
government officials are dictating prices of agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
Although the revival of the government role in the economy
received criticism by some economists, many economists say
interventionist measures may be necessary to deal with issues
ranged from foreign debts to economies in crisis and volatile
markets.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia's Industrial Output Value Up 6.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia's industrial output
value rose 6.2 percent in the first nine months this year over the
same period of 1997 to 451.2 billion korunas (about 13.3 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to lastest statistics released by the Slovak National
Statistic Bureau, the industrial performances in the first three
quarters of 1998 were the best over the past three years, with the
production of high value added products like motor vehicles
jumping 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Slovakia's industrial production started to improve
thanks to a series of government policies to stimulate economic
development. It rose 4.9 percent from the negative 13.5 percent
growth in 1993 when the country declared independence.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, industrial growth reached a record high of 8.3
percent, and was maintained at 3.5 percent in 1996 and 4 percent
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But the country is still faced with many pressing problems such
as industrial restructuring and high unemployment which has soared
to 13 percent, according to official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Industry Cartels Criticized for "Hampering Reform" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The move by certain ministries
to encourage the formation of industrial cartels to fix prices is
"a violation of the Pricing Law", today's China Daily quoted an
official from the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The outcome of price controls is to protect the backward and
frustrate the advanced, and to hold up the structural adjustment
of industries, said the SDPC official.
</P>
<P>
The government should enact laws to regulate dumping, but it is
"unreasonable" to require all enterprises to be subject to price
floors in line with artificially set administrative orders, said
the official.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the Pricing Law is to ensure fair competition
in a market-driven economy, but the "process is being impeded,"
said the SDPC official.
</P>
<P>
Some economists have warned of a number of inherent dangers in
collusion to fix prices: a prolonged slack market from a stifled
normal competition, slowed-down structural adjustments in
industries due to administrative interference; and increased
transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
SDPC drafted a regulation in September aimed at prohibiting
dumping, and sought opinions from economists, legal experts,
officials and representatives of certain enterprises. The
regulation has been submitted to the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) for approval.
</P>
<P>
Since July when the first price cartel was formed in setting a
price floor for flat-glass manufacturers, similar actions have
been taken by associations of major enterprises in at least eight
sectors, with support from some state administrations.
</P>
<P>
Losses incurred by enterprises as a result of price wars, a
sharp decline in taxes collected by the central government, as
well as a fall in state investment, are main reasons behind the
encouraged implementation of the so-called "self-disciplinary
prices".
</P>
<P>
Management according to the law is an important principle for
government agencies following the institutional restructuring,
said the official.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Upgrade Aviation Computer Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to invest up to
200 million US dollars in the next two years to upgrade its
national civil aviation computer information network, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to play a key role in promoting the
competitive potency of the civil aviation sector, which has been
greatly challenged by other means of transportation in recent
years, the paper quoted Yang Jun, director of the China Civil
Aviation Computer Information Network Center as saying.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, the center has joined the Fast &AMP; Convenient
Hotel Reservation Network Trade Center Co. Ltd to develop a new
hotel reservation computer system to go with its current
air-ticket booking system.
</P>
<P>
The new system is in line with popular practice in
international civil aviation circles, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the new system, China's air passengers can enjoy
convenience and favorable prices to make advance hotel bookings
when reserving or buying air tickets.
</P>
<P>
Around 50 hotels in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou and
Shenzhen have been connected with the system, according to Peng
Li, general manager of Fast &AMP; Convenient.
</P>
<P>
The system is ready to connect with hundreds of hotels all
around the country, Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the united advantages of Fast &AMP; Convenient and the
information network center, the system is expected to raise the
profitability of hotels, she said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the network center is negotiating with several
insurance companies to launch life insurance service for
passengers through the network, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The center is also prepared to co-operate with several
commercial banks to help passengers use credit cards to buy
tickets.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1985, the China Civil Aviation Computer
Information Center is mainly responsible for providing information
services for air companies. It was listed as one of nine key
information construction projects in the Eight Five Year Plan
(1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six domestic air companies use the national information
network sponsored by the center.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 air companies abroad are also connected with the
network, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The network covers over 7,000 air-ticket agencies in more than
300 cities nationwide and over 70 cities abroad.

<HEADLINE> MPR to Include Bill on Probe into Indonesian Former </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian House of
Representatives (DPR) Speaker Harmoko has said the agenda of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)'s may include bill on probe
into former president Soeharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said on Saturday that the number of the MPR's draft
decrees to be tabled at MPR special session will not be limited.
</P>
<P>
"We will leave that matter to the different factions which will
discuss the bills for passage into MPR decrees," Harmoko was
quoted by national newspapers Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The special MPR session, from November 10 to 13, is expected to
adopt a timetable for the implementation of general elections and
a general session of MPR next year.
</P>
<P>
According to Harmoko, the holding of the MPR special session is
to meet the decision of DPR's plenary session on June 29, 1998, on
the holding of the special session with the general election on
its agenda to meet the people's aspirations.
</P>
<P>
After hearing and absorbing the people's aspirations, the MPR
working committee produced 12 draft decrees and draft decisions to
be taken up at the special session.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker said the number of the bills may increase during
the special session in accordance with the people's aspirations.
</P>
<P>
"The different factions in the committee may propose additional
bills as the deliberations cover more other issues," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian legislators have warned that the government must
move quickly to investigate Soeharto's wealth, allegedly stashed
in bank accounts abroad, or face the possibility that it will lose
the remainder of its battered credibility.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib heads a government team
charged with the task of investigating Soeharto's wealth, which
many allege was illegally amassed during his 32 years in power.
Soeharto stepped down amid mounting public pressure on May 21 this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, many people doubt the government's seriousness to
investigate Soeharto. Some have charged that the government was
dragging its feet on the matter.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, thousands of students rallied in separate protests
in Jakarta to demand that Soeharto, his family and cronies be
brought to trial. They insisted MPR take action against Soeharto
for his "political and economic crimes," as well as human rights
abuses.

<HEADLINE> GM Confident in China Market Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- An executive of U.S.-based
General Motors expressed full confidence in keeping up with the
schedule of opening its car joint venture in Shanghai and
capturing a significant market share with its Buick car in China.
</P>
<P>
Larry Zahner, president of GM China Group, said recently that
the first Buick car will roll off production line in Shanghai as
scheduled in December. GM holds half of stakes in the
1.5-billion-US-dollar joint venture.
</P>
<P>
He said that localization of the Buick car is proceeding
smoothly, with the first car to have 47 percent of its parts and
components produced locally.
</P>
<P>
He said that strikes at GM factories in the United States will
not affect the opening of its Shanghai joint venture as expected,
because the American factories are now working overtime to meet
orders of parts and components for overseas market.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai joint venture is expected to buy 1.6 billion US
dollars worth of parts and services from the U.S. in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Zahner said that the on-going reform of free car system for the
Chinese Government will really have some impact on market capacity
of the Buick car, which is designed to meet the demand of business
car market in China.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that GM still believes that Buick has very
large market potential in the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that even if the Chinese Government stopped providing
free cars for its officials, the officials still need decent cars
to travel in. On the other hand, he said that economic growth and
opening to the outside world will increase demands for business
cars in China.
</P>
<P>
"We will have a plan to deal the challenge posed by changing
policies (of China)," Zahner said.
</P>
<P>
GM focuses on five aspects of operation in China, namely parts
and components, exchange of technology, production for global
market, localization of products and other mutually beneficial
cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
According to GM's plan, the Shanghai joint venture will produce
50,000 Buick cars in 2000, accounting for over 40 percent of
luxury car market in China. In the same year, the joint venture
will export six percent of its products to overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
According to GM sources, the company's sales in Asia was down
in 1997 due to the impact of Asian financial crisis. However, its
sales in China increased by three percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Zahner predicts that sales in China market will continue to
grow by three to four percent in 1998. After the Shanghai joint
venture starts operation, the sales will grow further next
year.
</P>
<P>
He said that GM will have more resources to put into China
market after major restructuring of its global business. The
separation of the auto parts supplier Delphi from the company will
enable GM to purchase more products from local suppliers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Argonne Lab Forms Biochip Development Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Argonne National Laboratory
of the U.S. Department of Energy has formed partnership with two
U.S. companies -- Motorola Inc. and Packard Instrument Company --
to develop biochip that is expected to accelerate the process of
decoding genes by a thousand times.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Frontier issued by Argonne, similar to
computer chips performing millions of mathematical operations a
second, biochips can perform thousands of biological reactions
such as decoding genes in a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being faster than conventional gene sequencing
methods, the biochips provide a three-dimensional platform that
allows greater sensitivity and accuracy in assaying proteins --
RNA and DNA.
</P>
<P>
A biochip only one-centimeter square may contain 20,000 to
30,000 separate elements, each of which precisely locates and
identifies a specific part of DNA. Instead of reading DNA one
letter or word at a time, the biochip reads whole phrases and
sentences at a time.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Motorola and Packard will contribute a
total of 19 million U.S. dollars over five years to support the
joint-research project.
</P>
<P>
Motorola will develop processes to mass-produce biochips, and
Packard will develop the analytical instruments to process and
analyze the biochips.
</P>
<P>
Argonne's contribution, in conjunction with a team of
scientists from Russia, is intellectual property in the form of 19
inventions related to biological microchips.

<HEADLINE> Steel Imports to Revive, Exports to Remain in Doldrums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China's steel imports are
likely to move up slowly in the rest of the year, while the
falling momentum of steel exports is unlikely to be reversed.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quoted an official with China Chamber of
Commerce for Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters
as saying that the country still needs to import those varieties it
cannot produce by itself, though the domestic market is plagued by
a glut of steel products.
</P>
<P>
The country's reconstruction after this year's serious flooding
and the government's massive infrastructure investment plan are
strong incentives to a rise in steel imports, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has issued 100 billion yuan worth of
special treasury bonds to raise capital for the infrastructure
sector. A huge amount of matching funds from banks, local
government and enterprises are espected to go with the T-bonds.
</P>
<P>
The demand for steel products has gone up and many steel
producers have increased their production. Imports of steel
products dropped 10.2 percent from a year ago to 8.65 million tons
during the first three quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
But the slide of steel prices on the domestic market is
unlikely to be affected by the expected rise of imports, said the
official, explaining one important factor is the most
types of steel products can be produced domestically and are in
oversupply.
</P>
<P>
The official predicted a continued poor performance by steel
product exports in the short run. From January to September,
exports of steel products fell 38.1 percent from the same period
of last year to 3.64 million tons, according to Chinese customs
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The plunge was mainly triggered by the Asian financial turmoil,
and currency devaluations in many Asian countries, which have made
Chinese steel products less competitive than those of other Asian
steel producers like Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
To help steel exports counter the negative impact of the Asian
financial turmoil, the Chinese Government raised the export rebate
rates for steel products from nine percent to 11 percent beginning
from July 1 this year.

HARBIN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers in Harbin,
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, recently confiscated
nine fossilized rocks dating back well over 140 million years from
a leaving Korean national.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified passenger from the Republic of Korea told
officials he purchased the fossils in Beijing for less than 1,000
yuan (126 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Specialists said the rocks bear the fossilized remains of an
ancient fish species which lived in fresh water lakes in northeast
China some 140 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
They added that fossils of the ancient fish are often
associated with the presence of oil resources. They added that the
rare items are highly valuable for studies of the ancient
geography and climate.
</P>
<P>
Chinese law clearly prohibits the removal of ancient fossils
from the country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Vows to Act Against Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie has vowed to take stern measures against any people found
guilty of abusing the human rights of citizens.
</P>
<P>
"The people have been waiting to hear more about these cases
for a long time," Habibie told participants of the Indonesian
Muslim Congress at the State Palace here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The human rights violations and oppression cases referred by
the president included Aceh killing, Tanjung Priok incident and
Banyuwangi killing.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 2,000 people were killed in military
operations in the country's westernmost province of Aceh between
1989 and 1992, and hundreds of people are believed to have been
shot dead by the security forces in the 1984 Tanjung Priok
incident in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The Bangyuwangi killing spree in East Java province, which
began in August this year and has since spread to Central Java and
West Java provinces, has claimed the lives of 142 people. The
targeted victims had been those believed to be "black magic
practitioners" and Muslim preachers.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked security officials to increase their vigilance in
facing any threats that disturb people's daily life," the
president was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Muslim Congress, the second only in more than
five decades, ended here Saturday with a declaration urging the
government to settle human rights violations and cases of
oppression which in the past claimed the lives of many of the
country's Muslims.
</P>
<P>
"The government should settle the slaughter and torture cases
in Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta, as well as the slaughter of
ulemas and Islamic clerics in East Java and other regions in the
name of black magic," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
Other cases of human rights violations and oppression that the
Muslim congress urged the government to settle included those in
Aceh and the May 14-15 riots in Jakarta which killed nearly 1,300
people.
</P>
<P>
The five-day gathering organized by the Indonesian Ulemas
Council also expressed regret over the slow investigation process
by the Attorney General into the widespread corruption cases from
the central government down to local administrations.
</P>
<P>
The congress urged the government to set up an independent
commission to help speed up the investigation.

WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will restore development and military-training programs that were
suspended in India and Pakistan after they conducted nuclear
tests, the White House said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The White House announced that Clinton would restore in India

</P>
<P>
Clinton also lifted restrictions on activities of U.S. banks in
the two nations and resumption of military education and training
assistance, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have announced moratoriums on further nuclear
testing and promised to adhere to the Comprehensive Test Ban

</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that the two countries have committed themselves
to strengthening export controls on nuclear and missile technology.
</P>
<P>
"In response to these steps and to encourage greater progress
in the future, the president -- after consultations with the

authority in a limited, targeted way," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congress recently granted Clinton authority to waive
sanctions if he believed the waiver would advance U.S. goals of

<HEADLINE> Italian President to Visit Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro's visit to Australia is now slated to begin in early
December, the presidential office announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro has accepted the invitation of Australian Governor
General Sir William Deane to visit the country from December 5 to
11, according to a communique released by the Quirinale
presidential office.
</P>
<P>
The Italian head of state is expected to visit Sydney,
Canberra, the federal capital, and Melbourne and will probably
make a stopover in Perth in western Australia.
</P>
<P>
The week-long visit was originally set for October 25 to 31,
but was delayed when Scalfaro was forced to respond to the
collapse of Prime Minister Romano Prodi's coalition on October 9.
</P>
<P>
After Prodi failed a second time to secure a governing
coalition, Scalfaro gave a new mandate to the Left Democrat leader
Massimo D'Alema whose new center-left government was sworn in on
October 21.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Cholera and other epidemic
diseases have become a new threat to Guatemalans, as the official
death toll caused by hurricane Mitch rose to 253 in the country,
according to information reaching here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At least six people have died of cholera so far in communities
of Alta Verapaz and Chimaltenango, while the Health Ministry
confirmed other cases in Guatemala City and in the Pacific
littoral in south of the country.
</P>
<P>
The excess of humidity could increase the cases of respiratory
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Marco Tulio Sosa said that 14 cases of classic
dengue have been registered in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Epidemics, including respiratory diseases, malaria, asthma,
cardiac affections and other diseases, affect thousands of those
lodged in refuges in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Health teams and volunteers are reportedly visiting the refuges
to make sure that health problems of children and women are cared
for.
</P>
<P>
Corpses in advanced state of decay are buried in common graves,
while others are incinerated.
</P>
<P>
Throughout Central America, the storm killed an estimated
10,000. In Honduras, more than 6,000 people were killed by the
hurricane and hundreds of thousands were left homeless.

LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Striker Dion Dublin had a
brilliant debut for Aston Villa with two goals as his new team
defeated Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 at the English Premier League on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Villa had four points clear at the top of
the team standings.
</P>
<P>
Dublin, who joined Villa for 5.75 million pounds (9.5 million
U.S. dollars) from Coventry on Thursday, took advantage of two
defensive lapses to score after 31 and 35 minutes. Stan Collymore
put Villa 3-0 ahead after 48 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham came back strongly in the later stages with goals
from Darren Anderton (65 penalty) and Swiss substitute Ramon Vega
(76).
</P>
<P>
Villa, bouncing back from successive Cup defeats to Chelsea
and Celta Vigo, moved on to 25 points from 11 matches, four clear
of Manchester United, who play Newcastle on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Derby County beat inconsistent Liverpool 2-1 for their first
win at Anfield since 1970 and there were also away victories for
Wimbledon, who won 1-0 at Nottingham Forest, and Coventry, who
won 2-1 at Blackburn.
</P>
<P>
Bottom club Southampton drew 3-3 with nine-man Middlesbrough
who equalised through Italian Gianluca Festa in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough had Robbie Mustoe and Phil Stamp sent off in the
second half.

48 percent of the GDP for that period.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales amounted to 100 billion yuan between January and
September, an increase of 15 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade has grown faster than was originally expected,
with exports totaling 12.3 billion U.S. dollars in the first

year, Xu says, and overseas direct investment in Shanghai was up
21 percent from a year ago, with Europe and North America
accounting for more than a third of that.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica's Inflation Over 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's inflation rate in
the first 10 months of this year reached 10.07 percent, up from
the 8.44 percent for the same period of 1997, according to data
released by the Economy Ministry on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
October's consumer price index (CPI) was 0.31 percent, an
increase of 0.14 percent from the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The Economy Ministry attributed the inflation hike to rising
prices of food, drinks, tobacco, clothing and footwear.
</P>
<P>
Major goods registering price rises include coriander -- 22.72
percent, cigarettes -- 20.67 percent, tomatoes -- 16.80 percent
and potatoes -- 10.23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Products with lower prices include electric energy -- 13.55
percent, onions -- 23.50 percent and sweet potatoes -- 19.20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Local economists predicted this month's CPI could increase due
to effects of hurricane Mitch that hit this Central American
country in recent days.

The meeting will be attended by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen, National Security

The meeting at the presidential hideaway "will be to brief on

have been going on with allies in Europe and in the region, said
White House spokesman David Leavy.

Clinton was not expected to make final decisions on the options

JERUSALEM -- The radical group of Islamic Jihad of Palestine
Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide car bombing in
Jerusalem Friday.

"This heroic operation is not the first and not going to be the
last," the group said in a leaflet faxed to news organizations.
"We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the
Zionist enemy."
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, a car loaded with explosives blasted at the
entrance of Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, killing two and
injuring 25.
</P>
<P>
The two killed in the blasts were identified by Israeli police
as the assailants. Shortly after the blasts, the Palestinian
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) also claimed responsibility
for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Friday's bombing caused another blow to the peace process. The
Israeli cabinet suspended indefinitely its ratification of the
peace accord signed last month in Washington with the
Palestinians and urged the Palestinians to do more to fight
terrorism. (Israel-Jihad-Bombing)

BONN -- Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Saturday
installed Wolfgang Schaeuble as the party's new leader to replace
former chancellor and party leader Helmut Kohl, who was defeated
by the Social Democrats (SPD) in the general elections a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble, a long designated successor to Kohl, was elected CDU
chairman by an overwhelming majority at the party's convention in
Bonn on Saturday. He will continue to hold his current post as the
CDU parliamentary leader.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who had been CDU leader for 25 years, offered to step
down after the election defeat on September 27 to take personal
responsibility. However, he was still elected CDU's honorary
chairman on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With Schaeuble now at the helm, the CDU formally ushered in a
new era to play its still unfamiliar new role as Germany's main
opposition party after having been the main ruling party for the
past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
The unbearably high unemployment of over four million and a
widespread voters' desire for political change have been widely
blamed for the party's election defeat in September.

<HEADLINE> Animal Husbandry Development In Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, November 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Inner Mongolia, one of
its major pastoral areas, now has 73.87 million head of livestock,
3 million more than for last year.
</P>
<P>
This is the 14th successive year of growth in the number of
livestock there, says Liu Mingzu, a regional government official
who attributes the growth to three developments of the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
The first change occurred in 1983 when a contract system was
introduced and state-owned livestock were sold to each household
for breeding.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the region led the country in signing grazing land
contract agreements with herdsmen, the second big change.
</P>
<P>
The third was in 1996 with a sustained development program for
planting grass on 1.59 million ha, bringing the amount of
grassland in the region to 30 million ha and better livestock was
produced by importing stock from abroad.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Law Against Illegal Arms Deals in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Saturday sent to the nation a signal of tightening gun control
by outlawing illegal gun-shows around the nation.
</P>
<P>
"We are one stop closer to shutting them down," Clinton
declared in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
The President ordered the Treasury and Justice departments to
recommend executive actions within 60 days that will close a
loophole in the Brady gun-control law.
</P>
<P>
The Brady law requires five-day waiting periods and background
checks when any one is purchasing a gun. But the law does not
currently apply to gun-show purchases.
</P>
<P>
The government estimates that five million people a year attend
gun shows, typically held in convention centers, school gymnasiums
or fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Florida voters overwhelmingly approved an initiative
to let counties require background checks or impose five-day
waiting periods for the purchase of firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, the federal government should now follow suit and
require a so-called "Insta-Check" of the buyer's criminal history.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this should be the law of the land: no background
check, no gun, no exceptions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted that gun shows are often the first place parents
teach their children how to handle firearms safely. "But at too
many gun shows, a different, dangerous trend is emerging," he
added. "Some of these gun shows have become illegal arms bazaars
for criminals and gun traffickers to buy and sell guns on a
cash-and-carry, no-questions-asked basis."
</P>
<P>
On November 30 the Justice Department is to implement the
National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which will give
law enforcement officials access to a wider array of records than
is now available.
</P>
<P>
Also as of November 30, the background checks will apply not
only to handguns but also to rifles and shotguns and firearm
transfers at pawn shops. With that system in place, the number of
background checks for gun purchases will increase from an
estimated 4 million a year to 12 million, Clinton said.
