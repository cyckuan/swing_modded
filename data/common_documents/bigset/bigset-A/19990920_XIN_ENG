<HEADLINE> Istanbul Mayor Begins Visit to Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of Istanbul, Ali
Mufit Gurduna, arrived here Sunday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival at the Athens International airport,
Gurduna said that he carried to Athens the regard and the
condulences of the people of Istanbul, referring to the Athens
earth quake on September 7 which killed 139 people.
</P>
<P>
He said that although this visit was symbolic, he believed that
it would create a bridge of love and friendship between the
peoples of the two countries, particularly the peoples of Athens
and Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the mayor of Athens, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said
that if people took into consideration the messages that the
citizens of both countries were sending to their political leaders
these days, Gurduna's visit to Athens would also have substantial
consequences.
</P>
<P>
The Istanbul mayor is repaying a similarly historic visit paid
to his city by his Athenian counterpart Avramopoulos, who visited
Istanbul a week after the devastating earthquake on August 1 7.
</P>
<P>
During his visit here, Gurduna will visit the quake-stricken
areas and meet with Athens municipal officials and Greek President
Costis Stephanopoulos.

<HEADLINE> China Makes its First Helical Computer Topography Scanner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SHENYANG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese medical equipment
company has succeeded in making the country's first helical
computer topography scanner.
</P>
<P>
This makes China become the fourth country, following the
United States, Germany and Japan, to produce the hi-tech medical
apparatus.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese device can scan all organs of a patient in just
one minute, moving alongside the patient's bed -- which the other
countries' scanners can't do, explained Liu Jiren, president of
the Shenyang Neu-Alpine Digital Medical System Company, based in
northeast China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the scanner's high-speed, high-precision data
collecting system can continuously scan for 90 seconds, covering a
length of 90 centimeters. It can also provide three-dimensional
imaging information.
</P>
<P>
The new product, which is less expensive than that of foreign
countries, will appear on the market in May of 2000, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Stick to CPC Leadership: Austrian-Chinese (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- It is not surprising to hear
a Chinese chant the slogan "stick to the leadership of the
Communist Party of China," but it's unexpected from an Austrian-
born westerner.
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of former Austrian Communist Party member Fu Lai,
however, the CPC leadership is the main cause for China's economic
progress.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who came to China 60 years ago, experienced the War of
Resistance against Japan (1937-1945) and the War of Liberation (
1945-1949), participated in the socialist construction and
witnessed the changes that followed the reforms and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
He was the director for information research at the Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences before his retirement.
</P>
<P>
"Revolution is not as easy as inviting somebody over for a
snack. It's a remarkable accomplishment to transform a country,
over half of whose population is illiterate, into the modern China
it is today," Fu said, calling the achievements "unprecedented."
</P>
<P>
"It's true that new China has followed a tortuous path since
its founding, but whatever changes take place, it is unthinkable
that China should not adhere to the CPC leadership and the path of
socialism," insisted Fu.
</P>
<P>
Despite his years, Fu has never missed a party activity despite
his seniority.
</P>
<P>
In 1939, Fu, then a 19-year-old Austrian blacklisted by Hitler,
was forced into exile and finally landed in China, a country he
first got to know in Edgar Snow's novel about China.
</P>
<P>
"My life has been spared twice. First, when I escaped from the
concentration camp and second, when I avoided being thrown into
prison by the Japanese, thanks to the Chinese people," Fu said. (

<TEXT>
<P>
China's War of Resistance against Japan was at its peak when Fu
arrived in Shanghai. He then went to the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei
revolutionary base in central north China, where he launched his
teaching career in a local medical school. Meanwhile, he tended to
wounded soldiers of the CPC-led Eighth Route Army.
</P>
<P>
At that time, contagious diseases such as malaria spread
through the base, which had a shortage of medicine due to an enemy
blockade. Fu applied traditional Chinese acupuncture techniques to
provide a cure that effectively contained the spread of the
disease in the area. For that, Fu was praised by then Chinese
leader Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
After the war, Fu concocted a rough form of penicillin out of
the limited materials at hand, thus easing the tension in the
supply of medicines for external use.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the extremely hard situation, despite being harshly
persecuted by the Japanese, the ordinary Chinese were still
willing to sacrifice everything to support the Eighth Route Army
in their fight against Japanese invaders," recalled Fu.
</P>
<P>
"That's probably the most precious experience of my life,
because of that I came to know what the 'people's strength' is in
China," he added, his eyes shining.
</P>
<P>
After witnessing the wars in China, Fu came to believe that "
there must be a new China built under the CPC leadership."
</P>
<P>
Fu joined the Chinese nationality at the same time the People's
Republic of China was founded, and has since been devoted to
medical research.

<P>
Fu was impressed with the progress China made over the years in
medical science. "The first noticeable achievement scored was the
realization of widespread vaccination, the second was the
elimination of tetanus in newborns," he remembered. "Today, all
major infectious diseases have been wiped out while the minor ones
have been put under effective control. Hospitals and other medical
accommodations are scattered throughout the country, and the
average life span of Chinese has doubled to 71."
</P>
<P>
Though only 29 when new China was established, Fu chose to
settle here. "The proletariat have no motherland," he said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
"Here started a career of mine -- the socialist cause under the
CPC leadership," explained Fu, adding that "the comrades should
still work hard, since the revolution is yet to succeed."
</P>
<P>
In his apartment in north Beijing, Fu reviewed his life in
China with the fluent tones of a native Beijinger. He attributed
his skill with language to his hard work as a young man, when he
had to spend eight hours on average preparing for a single hour's
lesson.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the 21st century, Fu believed that "China will be
victorious and some problems as corruption can be properly handled.
"
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence, because I am convinced in Communism," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,500 troops of the
United Nations multinational force will arrive in Dili, capital of
East Timor, on Monday, an Indonesian military officer said.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the deployment of the first batch of the force

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Rejects Further Weapon Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's National Assembly
(parliament) on Sunday stressed that Iraq will reject any attempt
to resume weapons inspections in the country.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the assembly said in a statement that the
U.S. is trying to send weapons inspectors back to Iraq after they
were found out to have carried out espionage activities for the
Central Intelligence Agency and Mossad (Israeli intelligence).
</P>
<P>
Referring to a report sent by the White House to the U.S.
Congress accusing Iraq of continuing to develop weapons of mass
destruction, the spokesman said the report aims to create pretexts
to prolong aggressive sanctions and mislead public opinion.
</P>
<P>
He said that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
said in its reports in the past years to the U.N. Security
Council that there were no signs that Iraq continues to develop
banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
He added that even reports of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) confirmed, despite some disinformation, that the
substantial components of Iraq's banned weapons have been
completely destroyed and that all the secondary issues have been
put under long term monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stance against the international law and legitimacy
has made this administration lose balance and repeat lies, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
On the no-fly zones, the spokesman said that the U.S. has no
authorization from the U.N. Security Council, rather it is a
unilateral decision.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S. and Britain
in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War, with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.S. is launching a political and media
campaign against Iraq in order to press for the adoption of the
British-Dutch proposal on the Iraqi issue, which has been rejected
by Russia, China and France.
</P>
<P>
This proposal recommends a temporary suspension of the
restrictions on Iraq's oil sales if Iraq fully cooperates with an
enlarged body of weapons inspections which will replace UNSCOM,
and agrees to put its oil proceeds under U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
Iraq rejected the plan outright, insisting that it would not
accept nothing less than a total lifting of the embargo in place
since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Display New Surface-to-Surface Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Revolution Guards
Corps (IRGC) of Iran will display a newly-manufactured
surface-to-surface missile later this month, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier-General Gholam-Hossein Gheibparvar, head of
headquarters in charge of military parade to mark the "Sacred
Defense Week," said the IRGC had conducted a four-and-a-half-year
research to manufacture the Zelzal missile and would put it on
display in the parade, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
But no details about the new missile were given by the news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The "Sacred Defense Week" is celebrated on September 22-28 to
commemorate the Iranians killed in the 1980-1988 war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, Iran successfully tested Shahab-3 (Meteor-3)
missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers, which meant it can hit
targets in Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States bases in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder's SPD Suffers Fourth Defeat in German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Germany's governing Social
Democratic Party (SPD) led by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder Sunday
was crushed in the election of Sachsony state, the fourth
successive loss in one month.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's conservative opposite in Berlin parliament, the
Christian Democrats (CDU), won an absolute majority in Sachsony
with about 60 percent of the vote, according to poll projections
by German television networks ARD and ZDF.
</P>
<P>
The CDU, headed by popular state premier Kurt Biedenkopf, will
seize 80 of 120 seats in the state parliament and solely rule the
eastern state in following 4 years.
</P>
<P>
Coming from west Germany and having managed Saxony for 9 years,
Biedenkopf has achieved the fourth best result in Germany's
post-war electoral history.
</P>
<P>
"It was an overwhelming vote of trust, I am so satisfied," said
Biedenkopf, who is nicknamed "king Kurt" in Saxony.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, the SPD was hit by its worst-of-all election
result since 1945. The party was degraded to an insignificant role
in Saxony with no more than 10 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
The successor to former East Germany's Communist Party, the
Democratic Socialism Party (PDS), was borne out to be a major
player in eastern states. Scoring about 21 percent of the vote,
the PDS became the second largest party in Saxony parliament.
</P>
<P>
"It's a bitter defeat," acknowledged Franz Muentefering, the
designated SPD secretary-general, in television while knowing the
debacle of his party.

Top SPD candidate in Saxony Karl-Heinz Kunckel accused
Schroeder's unwelcome austerity package to have caused his defeat.
Many SPD voters were attracted to the CDU simply because of their
worry over the future, Kunckel said.
</P>
<P>
"We must tell the people when the time of sparing will be
over," Kunckel told his stunned party members after the election.
He then decided to resign.
</P>
<P>
The austerity package aimed to lower Germany's budget by 160
billion marks (90 billion U.S. dollars) in four years by cutting
or restricting social welfare spending.
</P>
<P>
The SPD has been defeated in five states and has lost sole
control of a sixth since it won the federal election last
September. Only in one year it has become minority in the upper
chamber of German parliament, the Bundesrat, which is composed of
delegates from 16 states.
</P>
<P>
Along in this month, the SPD has been defeated in Saarland,
Thuringia, and Saxony state elections and North Rhine-Westphalia
municipal elections.

<HEADLINE> Botswanan President to Lead Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Botswanan President
Festus Mogae will lead the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP)
in presidential and general elections on October 16.
</P>
<P>
With the endorsement of his nomination by the African country's
Chief Justice Julian Nganunu late Saturday, Mogae is believed to
have an upper hand over other candidates, including his nearest
rival, leader of the main opposition Botswana Congress Party
(BCP), Michael Dingake.
</P>
<P>
The BDP is tipped for a landslide victory in the country
bordering fellow Southern African Development Community (SADC)
members South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Botswanan Alliance Movement (BAM) candidate Lepetu
Setshwaelo and Kenneth Koma of the Botswanan National Front (BNF)
have each scraped up the requisite nominations of 1,000 supporters
and will be the other two candidates, South African Press
Association reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Widespread voter apathy has marred the run-up to the polls,
with only 51 percent -- some 460,000 -- of the estimated 900,000
eligible voters registering.
</P>
<P>
Mogae, 61, has ruled the country since April last year when he
took over from Ketumile Masire who voluntarily stepped down after
18 years as head of state.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, with a population of around 1.5 million, gained
independence from Britain in 1966.

<HEADLINE> Mass Pullout From COMESA Not Possible: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) has dismissed reports that other
countries will also pull out of the regional grouping if Tanzania
finally withdraws.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of COMESA Council of Ministers Joseph Sefu said here
Sunday that Tanzania's decision will not lead to a mass pullout of
other member countries because they are very committed to the
objectives of the 21- member grouping.
</P>
<P>
Countries like Kenya will never pull out of it because they
know the benefit a member country can enjoy in such a regional
grouping, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sefu criticized Tanzania's plan to pull out of COMESA, saying
that the country has benefited more from it.
</P>
<P>
The reasons given by Tanzania are not good enough and "we hope
they will rescind their decision", he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania announced recently that it will withdraw from COMESA
on the ground that given its uncompetitive industrial base, it
will not benefit from the free trade area COMESA will establish
next year.

BONN September 20 (Xinhua)--The last first lady of former
Soviet Union, Raisa Gorbachev, died at 67 on early Monday morning
in Muenster, Germany, after losing her 8-week battle against
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
Her death at 2:55 in the Muenster University clinic was a
result of circulation shock and advanced leukemia, said Professor
Thomas Buchner, Gorbachev's doctor.
</P>
<P>
She had been treated in the clinic since July 25 in order to
recover from a heart attack. Ten days later, initial examination
revealed that she was suffering from an advanced leukemia, reports
of the clinic said.
</P>
<P>
After about two weeks of chemotherapy, doctors found out Raisa
Gorbachev had been too weak to undergo bone marrow transplant,
which might have saved her life. Because of a fatal infection, she
had been in a coma for more a week before the death.
</P>
<P>
Michail Gorbachev, former president of Soviet Union and Raisa's
husband, had been constantly at her beside until the last minute
together with their daughter, sister and grand children, the
clinic said.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his predecessor Helmut
Kohl, Russian president Boris Yeltsin, former British prime
minister Margaret Thatcher, and the Pope John Paul II, both sent
condolence messages to Gorbachev.
</P>

"We Germans remember in heart of your wife's nature charm and
her significant personality...we will never forget her,"said
Schroeder in his condolence letter.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Suspends All Activities in S. Somalia for 5 </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOGADISHU, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Monday announced its suspension of all
its activities in southern Somalia, effective immediately and for
five consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following the death of Ayub Sheikh Yarow,
UNICEF's highest health and nutrition official in southern
Somalia, who was murdered by armed gangs on the Mogadishu-Jowhar
road last week.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF said in its press release that all operations
including its supplies of the badly-needed highly nutritious
biscuits, water, education assistance, vehicles hires and other
activities will be suspended.
</P>
<P>
The press release also said that similarly, all contacts
including the public relations will be brought to a halt until
Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNICEF, which is among the very few United Nations
agencies still operating in southern Somalia, said that it will of
course not stop assisting what is termed as the absolutely
emergency case.
</P>
<P>
Other aid agencies seem to have adopted similar decisions in
showing solidarity with the UNICEF at a time when the humanitarian
situation in southern Somalia is deteriorating to its worst in
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
During the aid suspension, large rallies will be organized to
support UNICEF offices throughout southern Somalia in protest
against the killing of the aid worker and the demand for peace and
justice.
</P>
<P>
Raging conflicts and insufficient rainfalls accompanied by
killer diseases are claiming lives at high rates compared to
previous years.
</P>
<P>
Reports received through the VHF radios indicated that at least
10 people died for hunger and its related-diseases everyday in
Bakol region of southwestern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the region Aden Mohamed Soransor told reporters on
the VHF radio that more than 30 villages surrounding regional
capital Huddor town are now facing severe water shortage after the

<HEADLINE> OPEC Cutback Deal May Be Extended: Kuwaiti Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti oil official
said here on Monday that members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) could extend their output reduction
agreement which will expire next March.
</P>
<P>
"The OPEC agreement is not final, because it could be extended
if everyone agrees on this," said Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud
Nasser Al-Sabah before leaving for Vienna to attend OPEC
ministerial meeting due on September 21.
</P>
<P>
OPEC countries signed a one-year agreement last March to slash
their output by 1.7 million barrels per day, in a bid to drive up
the sagging oil prices in the world market.
</P>
<P>
"Any change in production rates would negatively affect the
stability of oil prices," Sheikh Saud said.
</P>
<P>
He said the most dangerous thing that could happen is to raise
production levels before summer ends, when sales usually drop.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saud's statement, however, contrasted with the latest
collective position of the Gulf Arab states. Oil ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states agreed during their meeting
in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Saturday to keep their oil
production cutbacks until March 2000.

The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Calls for Families' Part in Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tehran, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani has called for serious and comprehensive
contribution of families in the nationwide anti-drug fight.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, who is now chief of the powerful State Expediency
Council, made the call Monday in meeting officials and members of
the Society for Campaign Against Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking and addition have become a severe social
problem in Iran despite harsh punishments. The government vowed
continued efforts to fight drugs.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said it is a global threat that narcotics are so
widespread across the world and those colonialists who once used
addiction to dominate nations are now facing the same menace.
</P>
<P>
Based on its fruitful experiences in the fight against drugs,
Iran believes there is no option but to combat this ominous
phenomenon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking has been rampant in the area overlapping parts
of Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan despite anti-drug campaigns.
Drugs are being shipped from the so-called Gold Crescent to world
markets via Iran and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani encouraged participation and contribution of
families, especially the woman members, who suffer most from the
effects of drug addiction, saying the society can take better
steps in its fight against drug with the help of the women.
</P>
<P>
He added that those women whose husbands or relatives are
addicted to narcotics and who are exposed to harsh mental and
social damage are ready to join the combat against narcotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that saving even one person from the trap of
addiction is the best social and religious task and one should not
wait for moves from government.

DHAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh made the
biggest-ever haul of heroin Monday as a special squad of the
Department of Narcotics Control (DNC) arrested three Pakistani
nationals with more than 24 kilograms of drug at a city hotel at
Kakrail.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh News Agency quoted DNC officials as saying that
Alek Jan and Ibrahim from Peshawar and Rais Khan from Karachi were
arrested at Razmoni Isa Khan hotel.
</P>
<P>
According to DNC sources, the DNC tracked the smugglers on
secret information received from international sources following
the arrival of Alek Jan by a Pakistan International Airlines
flight last week.
The smugglers are suspected to be members of an international drug
smuggling racket.
</P>
<P>
Director General of DNC Modabbir Hossain Chowdhury said, "It is
assumed that Bangladesh is being used as a mid-trafficking station
to European and other cities which consume a high volume of
heroin, as the local market is very small."

<HEADLINE> McCann Sells Celtic Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Celtic Football Club
chief executive Fergus McCann has put his 51% share in the
Scottish Premier League side up for sale.
</P>
<P>
The disposal, which has been underwritten on the Stock Exchange
for 40 million pounds, will give current shareholders an
opportunity to increase shares as well as allowing season ticket
holders and staff at the Parkhead club to buy.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the club said the sale of the 14,4000,000
ordinary shares fulfilled McCann's promise to sell his controlling
stake following his departure from the club in April.
</P>
<P>
Priority for sale of the shares, which were conditionally
valued at 280 pence each, would be given to shareholders and after
that season ticket holders in the UK and the Republic of Ireland
would have the option to buy.
</P>
<P>
Current shareholders would be able to buy one new share for
every three currently held, allowing the Irish businessman Dermot
Desmond to emerge as the largest single shareholder with around 20%
of the shares.
</P>
<P>
The terms of the agreement would also allow the club's football
director, Kenny Dalglish, to take a stake and McCann has agreed to
gift part of the profit to help fund a Celtic football academy.
</P>
<P>
A successful sale would see McCann secure a profit of around 40
million pounds on a nine million pounds investment five years ago.
</P>
<P>
In that time, the club said turnover had risen by 385% to 33.8
million pounds and operating profits had risen from 282,000 to 6.7
million pounds.

<HEADLINE> Fans to Get Own Piece of Wembley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Soccer fans may have their own
way to commemorate Wembley when the English national stadium is
rebuilt next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reuters report on Monday, Wembley National
Stadium want to carve up the old venue, famous for its twin towers,
and auction off the pieces.
</P>
<P>
Chris Palmer, Wembley's head of communications, said he hoped
about five million pounds would be raised by the sell-off, which
would include seats, segments of the pitch, the red carpet rolled
out for dignitaries and even phones from the press box.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to raise some money to go into the new venue while
distributing parts of the stadium as widely as possible, to make
sure as many football fans as possible get a piece of Wembley,
whether they have 100 pounds or one pound.
</P>
<P>
"We have one-and-half million visitors who attend events here
each year -- Wembley is all about memories and the idea is to let
people take those memories home with them."
</P>
<P>
Not everything, however, will be up for grabs. Palmer said
certain items, such as the Olympic flame and the crossbar which
Geoff Hurst hit on his way to his 1966 World Cup-winning hat-trick,
would be retained for the stadium museum.
</P>
<P>
"I doubt if the Queen's seat from the royal box will be sold
either," Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
Work on replacing Wembley, built in 1923, with a new 475-
million-pound stadium is expected to begin next September. The
twin towers will make way for four 130-meter masts.
</P>
<P>
The new stadium, with its retractable roof, will open in 2003
and England are making it the centerpiece of their bid to stage
the 2006 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Palmer said no contract had yet been signed for the auction but
that it could be carried out through an internet-based company.
</P>
<P>
"The number of lots should go into the hundreds of thousand,"
he said. "There are 80,000 seats to start with."
</P>
<P>
The towers, however, which are still the subject of planning
permission, will not be included.
</P>
<P>
Architects have already said saving them and moving them to
another site would be too costly.
</P>
<P>
Palmer said that the towers were made of reinforced concrete
and could not be dismantled. Initial estimates, he said, put the
cost of moving them a mere 40 metres at 20 million pounds.

LONDON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Leicester skipper Matt Elliott
could face a Football Association misconduct charge over his
challenge on Liverpool striker Michael Owen in a Premier League
football match on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The FA are so concerned that they have asked referee Uriah
Rennie to study a video of the incident in which Elliott appeared
to strike Owen on the head with an elbow during the second half.
</P>
<P>
Owen was knocked unconscious by the challenge but Rennie took
no action against the Scotland international central defender -
even though he was positioned barely a yard away from the incident
at Filbert Street.
</P>
<P>
Now Lancaster Gate want the official to take a second look and
decide whether he was wrong not to punish Elliott for what
appeared to be violent conduct.
</P>
<P>
If Rennie, who did send off Frank Sinclair and David Thompson
during the game, admits he should have taken action then there is
every likelihood that Elliott will be in the FA dock.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Steve Double said: "We have asked Uriah Rennie to
have a look at the match video regarding the incident involving
Matt Elliott and Michael Owen."
</P>
<P>
If Elliott is charged then it is likely to spark an angry
reaction from Leicester and their manager Martin O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
The Foxes were incensed when Newcastle striker Alan Shearer was
not charged when he appeared to kick midfielder Neil Lennon in the
head during a match at Filbert Street 19 months ago.
</P>
<P>
They are already at loggerheads with the FA over 25 players and
officials being charged - including Elliott - for allegedly
failing to co-operate with a probe into the Worthington Cup final
ticket row.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier confirmed that Owen was still
dizzy after the match and that he will not be playing in Tuesday's
Worthington Cup second round second leg against Hull at Anfield.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore, Chile and New
Zealand have decided to set up a joint study group to explore
free-trade agreement among the three countries, the Singapore
Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
MTI said in a press release that the move is taken in order to
deepen the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) between
Chile and New Zealand and in view of the ongoing negotiations
between Singapore and New Zealand on the bilateral Free Trade
Agreement (FTA) and earlier agreement between Singapore and Chile
to explore the possibility of a bilateral FTA.
</P>
<P>
MTI said the objectives of setting up the group are to enhance
cooperation and exchange of information on WTO matters between
the three countries, especially with regard to the forthcoming New
Round and to WTO work on regional trading agreements, to share
information with each other on the progress of their FTA
negotiations and to undertake an examination of the benefits from
and potential obstacles to a comprehensive, WTO-consistent FTA
among Singapore, Chile and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
According to the MTI, the study group will meet regularly with
the first meeting to be held before the end of February 2000 and a
progress report to be made by the end of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The three countries have agreed that the membership of the
study group and information generated by it will be open to other
economies, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and New Zealand Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley agreed to start negotiations on an FTA with
a view to spur regional liberalization when they met on the
sidelines of the Informal Meeting of the APEC Economic Leaders at
Auckland earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Goh said after his meeting with Shipley that the bilateral
pact is expected to be finalized in a few months and will be
consistent with WTO rules and open to other economies in the
region.

MOSCOW, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin said Monday that recent rumors of his dismissal do
not stand in the way of his work.

"If fate has arranged itself in such a way that I have been
honored with the task of resolving the complicated questions
facing Russia today, then I will do this the only way I know,
which is by putting all my strength into it, until the president
decides otherwise," he said after a meeting with President Boris
Yeltsin, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin was named prime minister August 9 when Yeltsin abruptly
dismissed Sergei Stepashin, the second premier to lose his job

Russian media has reported rumors recently that Yeltsin will

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Research on health done in
Africa has benefited the international community more than the
African continent itself, a Zimbabwean minister said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on African health research for
development, the minister of Health and Child Welfare, Timothy
Stamps, said the African continent has become the research
laboratory for the world in which there are few ethical
consideration for the researched.
</P>
<P>
"African research is dedicated to interests outside Africa and
this must be redirected to benefit local communities," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Stamps asked the participants at the conference to resolve how
policy and decision makers could exploit the intellectual social
capital on the African continent to benefit local communities.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference was attended by more than 150 delegates
 from various African countries, non-governmental organizations
and donor agencies, as well as regional and international
institutions. It would examine the linkages between health
research program and policy formulation.
</P>
<P>
Stamps asked the participants to come up with Africa-based
journals that were accessible to policy makers and program
managers so as to enhance the impact of research on health
development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, a lot of high quality research work has
remained on the shelves or only available in excellent
international journals not readily available in Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference was an opportune moment for the African region
to prepare for a good African representation for the year 2000
Bangkok international conference, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the total investment for health research
in the world amounted to 56 billion U.S. dollars a year. Of which,
nearly 90 percent is spent on research into problems that concerns
only 10 percent of the world's population.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Hold Annual Apparel, Textile Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The annual apparel show of the
Bangladesh Garment Manufactures and Exporters Association (BGMEA)
will begin here on October 31, the BSS news agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Bangladesh Apparel and Textile Exposition
(BATEXPO), which has been held annually to promote the export of
the country's apparel and textiles products since 1986, will be
opened by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
The fair, the largest exposition of the country's apparel and
textile industry which has been playing a significant role in
market expansion of Bangladeshi garment products, will give
special focus on developing the country's backward apparel- and
textile-related industries, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
The show will offer 42 stalls for BGMEA members, 18 for textile
industries and 14 for foreign organizations. During the show,
there would be three seminars on different issues concerning the
garment industry, and a fashion show will be held on November 1,
followed by a BGMEA night of cultural programs, sources at the
National Management Committee said.
</P>
<P>
Chamber bodies from across the world, potential foreign buyers
and their representatives have been invited to attend the fair,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ready-made garments, growing at an annual rate of more than 20
percent over the past few years, have become the country's largest
foreign exchange earner, which along with the textile industry
contribute about 70 percent of the country's foreign exchange
earnings.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2,700 garment manufacturers and exporters
in Bangladesh, employing nearly 1.5 million workers.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Have a New Life Since Peaceful Liberation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Had Tibetans continued to live
under the system of serfdom as they did five decades ago, what
would they now have become?
</P>
<P>
Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme knows.
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s, the former Kaloon, a top-ranking official
assisting the Dalai Lama with administrative affairs, talked with
some of his most intimate friends on the lingering crises in old
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"We came to the conclusion that the Tibetan ethnic group was
going to be completely destroyed if the old system continued,"
recalls the former leader of the Tibet local government, who is
now a vice-chairman of China's top advisory body, the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Tibet was ruled over by "Three Lords", government
officials, aristocrats, and upper-class monks, who accounted for
merely five percent of the total population but owned everything,
including serfs.
</P>
<P>
Old Tibet looked like a Hell, with the lower class, the
majority of the Tibetan population, suffering from absolute
poverty, illiteracy, and epidemic diseases. The life expectancy of
Tibetans then was as short as 36 years.
</P>
<P>
Epidemics killed, but even more lethal was the old Tibetan
ruler. In 1925, an outbreak of smallpox killed over 7,000 Tibetans,
including many who were driven into remote mountains by government
troops to wait for death.
</P>
<P>
In the old days, the female half of the Tibetan population was
deprived of all rights. Under the old law, Tibetan women were
banned from participating in state affairs and none of them held
any official posts.
</P>
<P>
All this began to change on May 23, 1951, when central
government led by the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Tibet
local government signed a 17-article agreement on the peaceful
liberation of Tibet. Since then, the Tibetan ethnic group has been
revived.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Have a New Life Since Peaceful Liberation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By comparing the official statistics of different periods, one
can easily understand this:
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey, the Tibetan population topped 2.5 million,
compared with 941,200 in 1736, a figure complied by the government
of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and one million in 1953, which
was reported by the local government led by the Dalai Lama (who
remained in power until March 1959, when he fled to India after a
failed rebellion).
</P>
<P>
Since 1950, the life expectancy of Tibetans has more than
doubled to stand at 67 years, while their illiteracy rate has
declined by 41 percent from the 95 percent rate before 1950.
</P>
<P>
Tibet, which had only a few schools for children of the "Three
Lords" in the old days, now boasts more than 800 government-funded
primary schools and over 3,000 village-run primary schools, 90
middle schools, 16 secondary technical schools, and four
universities. Since the 1980s, many inland middle schools have
offered "Tibetan Classes," special classes for Tibetan students.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays in the Tibet Autonomous Region, where over 95 percent
of the population is ethnic Tibetan, all people are enjoying equal
and full rights. Nearly 75 percent of the more than 51,000 local
officials in this autonomous region are Tibetans or people from
other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Women also account for 30 percent of the officials in Tibet,
something unimaginable five decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans attribute these changes to the leadership of the CPC,
which has made Tibet an ethnic autonomous region, implemented
social reforms, and made every effort for development in the
political, economic, cultural and scientific and technological
fields in the plateau area.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five decades, Tibetans have had their living
standards improved to a point equal with that of the Han people,
the majority of the Chinese people, and other ethnic groups in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Strikes Harmful to Nigeria's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Undue strikes in a nascent
democracy are an act of sabotage that must be discouraged if the
nation will register speedy economic revival, Nigerian Minister of
Agriculture and Rural Development, Alhaji Daura has said.
</P>
<P>
On an inspection tour of the southwest Nigeria Sunday, Daura
frowned at the alleged unwillingness of many Nigerians to
sacrifice for the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"I know something is being done to take into account the
general welfare of workers in the country," the minister said,
urging the people to sacrifice in a bid to rebuild "this bruised
nation."
</P>
<P>
A nationwide strike by college teachers had entered the seventh
day, only one month after the nationwide strike of secondary
school teachers, the Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the faculty and staff of the Agricultural Research
Management Training Institute, Daura appealed to his listeners not
to join in any industrial action at this time.
</P>
<P>
No country can get up in terms of social and economic
development without substantial education and college teachers
should know this, the minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government is reportedly holding talks with
officials of the Academic Staff Union of Nigerian Universities,
with a view to resolving the current crisis caused by the
teachers' strike.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A report released by the Egyptian Council of Ministers
has revealed a 17.9-billion-pounds (5.2 billion U.S. dollars)
deficit in the balance of trade during the first five months of
1999, up from 17.3 billion pounds (5 billion dollars) during the
corresponding period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The volume of imports during the same period rose to 22.7
billion pounds (6.6 billion dollars), as compared to 21.7 billion
pounds (6.3 billion dollars) the previous year.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Sources of the Egyptian-Lebanese businessmen
association anticipate that Lebanese investments in Egypt over the
coming two years will rise to 6 billion pounds (1.7 billion
dollars) as compared to 3 billion pounds (about 870 million
dollars) at present.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Arab-language newspaper Alam Al Yom quoted Badran
Kamel, chairman of the association, as saying that many Lebanese
businessmen are attracted by the contemporary investment climate
in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
KHARTOUM -- The Sudanese government has announced that it has
prepared several integrated projects to be financed by a recent
Saudi grant of 6.4 billion Sudanese dinars (about 32 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Local press reports Monday quoted the Director of the Sudanese
States Consolidation Fund Ibrahim Al Dalil as saying that this
grant will be used as from November in improving services as well
as the education and health sectors.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi "Tohama Advertising and Public Relations"
company has won a renewed five-year advertising contract with the
Egyptian space TV channel for 150 million Saudi rials (40 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Monday's Arab daily Al Hayat quoted the media manager of the
company Amin Abdul Rahman as saying that "Tohama" has won the
contract, considered one of the biggest advertising contacts in
the region, in a fierce competition with Arab and Gulf advertising
companies.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Contingency Plans Urged for Philippine Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Monday that all the country's businesses should have
in-place contingency plans in preparation for the Y2K problem or
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The message was read by Transportation and Communications
Secretary Vicente Rivera before the Y2K Risk Management Summit
held in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Estrada stated that while the government is confident that near
100 percent readiness will be attained, there is still no
guarantee that the country is 100 percent safe and protected from
the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
"We all have to be prepared for eventualities that may arise in
case of malfunctions, systems failure, or interruptions in our
supply and distribution chains," Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
He said the contingency plans that business companies are
preparing will allow enough time to repair everything that has yet
to be fixed after the year 2000 as part of the normal technology
upgrading cycle.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Rivera said, "we must empower the fellow
Filipinos, especially those with easy access to information,
through a massive Y2K information, education and communications
campaign."
</P>
<P>
Based on the report submitted by the Presidential Commission on
Year 2000, Y2K compliance of seven critical sectors
(telecommunications, transportation, utilities, finance, health
care, manufacturing and government services) is already nearing
completion.
</P>
<P>
However, Rivera said the government's self-imposed Y2K deadline
on September 30 is no mean feat, considering time and budgetary
constraints.
</P>
<P>
"I encourage the very critical sectors to get a third party
auditor to examine and validate their work. For those who have not
completed the Y2K work, I urge you to push ahead," Rivera said.

LAUSANNE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The European soccer's
governing body UEFA said on Monday that the result of the UEFA Cup
match between Lausanne and Spanish club Celta Vigo last week will

</P>
<P>
English referee Gary Willard cautioned Lausanne's Eduardo
Magnin for foul play in the 41st and 66th minutes of the first-
round, first-leg match Thursday. But he failed to send Magnin off
after the second caution. Lausanne won the game 3-2.
</P>
<P>
UEFA's control and disciplinary body rejected a protest by
Lausanne against the validity of the result because the error was
not to Lausanne's disadvantage.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Asks for U.S. Help in Recovering Stolen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has formally made request to U.S. President Bill Clinton
for assistance in recovering Nigeria's stolen state assets
allegedly mounting up to 2.20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Clinton, the second since he came to office on
May 29, Obasanjo said that the stolen funds were transferred into
foreign accounts opened in the names of companies belonging to
late General Abacha's children and their close associates, The
Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader had reportedly written to the highest
authorities in Britain, Switzerland, France and Belgium to
specifically pursue charges of criminal conspiracy, large-scale
misappropriation of public funds, corrupt enrichment and stealing
involving large sums money belonging to the Federal Government.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government seems to be stepping up its efforts in
retrieving the looted money recently.
</P>
<P>
In one of the significant developments, Maryam Abacha, wife of
the former military ruler, was summoned to capital Abuja and
interrogated last week.
</P>
<P>
Government sources were quoted as saying that she and her son,
some of her husband's former cabinet members and the former fist
family's business linkmen are under intensive investigation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a special Nigerian police team is believed to have
initiated a joint inquiry with the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) to track the Nigerian state assets allegedly
stolen by Abacha and his family between 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
A trip to the U.S. at the weekend by Nigeria's National
Security Adviser Aliyu Gusau was said to be connected with the
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a letter earlier this month, Clinton had promised the
cooperation of all American official agencies in Nigeria's efforts
to recover ill-acquired wealth stashed in American banks.
</P>
<P>
Presidential sources said that the U.S. president's promise to
involve the FBI in tracing the whereabouts of the stolen money in
the U.S. had sufficiently "strengthened" the on-going loot
recovery efforts.

</P>
<P>
The 16.3-km line starts from Zhongshan Park in the west and
goes across the Huangpu River to end in Longyang Road, connecting
downtown Shanghai with Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
New equipment and technology was used to build the new line,

</P>
<P>
The new line will be put into trial operation in the middle of
next year, but tickets will soon be available for citizens who
want a look at the new system, local officials said.

<HEADLINE> Wetland Protection Project on Yangtze River Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A major wetland and
environmental protection project on the Yangtze River, the
longest in China, was initiated today in this capital city of
central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The "Yangtze Wetland Project" is jointly sponsored by the World
Fund for Nature (WFN) and the China Youth Development Foundation (
CYDF) with the aim of rescuing the marsh land of the river area
within 25 years.
</P>
<P>
An official with the WFN, the world's largest foundation for
nature protection, said that more than two million U.S. dollars
will be invested in the next two years to set up three wetland-
restoring demonstration zones in the Dongting Lake area in Hunan
Province and the Jianghan Plain area in neighboring Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Each zone will cover 1,000 hectares and a series of training
programs will also be presented for local farmers on establishing
a reasonable agricultural structure and farming system.
</P>
<P>
After the restoration of lake and wetland areas from current
farming land, the river's water-storage and flood-control capacity
will be greatly increased, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Based on successful experiences of water-control projects on
the Rhine and Danube rivers in Europe, and the Mississippi River
in the United States, the fund is confident of success on the
Yangtze, he added.
</P>
<P>
The CYDF, as the initiator of the Hope Project -- a nationwide
educational drive to help dropouts resume schooling, has raised
more than 20 million yuan for the protection of the river.
</P>
<P>
The drainage basin of the Yangtze River is the country's most
important economic development region. It is also one of the world
's major areas of diversified plant and animal life.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the shrinking lake area and growing
environmental pollution associated with the Yangtze have become
serious problems, resulting in severe floods in the past two
summers, which killed more than 1,000 people and caused 200
billion yuan in economic losses.

<HEADLINE> British POWs Held by Wartime Japan Seek Government Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- British veterans who were held
as prisoners of war (POWs) by the Japanese during World War II,
urged the government on Monday to give them a special one-off
payment to repay a debt of honour before they all die.
</P>
<P>
The British Legion veterans association, which had campaigned
through the Japanese courts for reparations for ill-treatment they
suffered during the war, but failed, said they had won both
parliamentary and public support for their campaign.
</P>
<P>
"The survivors, many of whom are disabled both physically and
psychologically, have fought for justice through the Japanese
courts since the 1960s," Ian Townsend, secretary general of the
legion, said.
</P>
<P>
"Because this route has so far been unsuccessful, we are now
seeking to break the stalemate by asking the government to make an
ex-gratia payment in recognition of hardship and brutality they
suffered in the service of their country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said some 25 percent of FEPOWs (Far East prisoners of war)
held by the Japanese were killed or died in captivity.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,000 former POWs held by japan still alive in
Britain. After failed to get compensation from Japan, they now
turned to the British government for special payment.
</P>
<P>
The British Legion cited the case of Canada, which last
December gave ex-prisoners held by the Japanese a payment of 10,
000 pounds (about 16,000 U.S. dollars) in recognition of " their
suffering and to repay a debt of honor," to back its campaign.
</P>
<P>
In May last year, when Japan's Emperor Akihito, on a state
visit to London, was driving to Buckingham Palace for lunch with
Queen Elizabeth, hundreds of labor camp survivors and civilian
internees turned their backs on him, shouting "Go home" and "
Compensation overdue."

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Fertilizer Output in 1998/99 Slightly Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced 130,647 tons
of chemical fertilizer in fiscal 1998-99 which ended in March, 6
percent up from the previous year's 123,148 tons, according to the
latest figures of the Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has only three fertilizer plants, which produce
annually a total of 120,000 tons of urea.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar needs a total of 800,000 tons of chemical fertilizer
annually and its domestic production is far from meeting the
demand. So the country has to import 680,000 tons of fertilizer
annually, which amounts to 85 percent of the total demand.
</P>
<P>
Since January this year, Myanmar has reclaimed over 400,000
hectares of vacant, virgin, fallow and wet lands in the country.
With the continuous increase of cultivated area, the demand for
chemical fertilizer also grows, hence the increased need for
imports.
</P>
<P>
To develop agriculture, the Myanmar government has exempted
import duties on agricultural materials including chemical
fertilizer.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Monday that it has sent out over one hundred questionnaires to
parties involved in the motor vehicle distribution trade in bid to
assess price differentials and service quality for consumers.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive said all the parties,
including consumer associations, dealers, independent importer-
repairers, independent importers, spare-part producers, firms
which sell through the Internet and motor vehicles manufacturers,
will be informed about the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey is intended to provide the Commission with the
information it needs for an assessment report, which must be
completed by the end of the year 2000, the EU executive said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The assessment report will take particular account of the
impact of the authorized distribution system on product price
differentials between EU member states and on the quality of
service to final consumers.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission therefore needs to know the facts and the
actual economic context in which motor vehicle distribution takes
place," said the European Commission, the EU's acting branch for
enforcing regulations to promote European integration.

<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The railways still play a key
role in China's transport system, but its market share has started
to decline.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics show that the
sector's proportion in the country's gross cargo turnover has
dropped from 54.4 percent in 1978 to 32.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Gross passengers turnover has also gone down from 62.7 percent
in 1978 to 35.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that with the steady increase of transport
volume over the past 50 years, China is also gradually perfecting
its communications industrial structure, according to some
transportation experts.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the rapid development of other means of
transportation handling capacities has also relieved the heavy
burden the railways have shouldered for so long.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the highways now account for
56.3 percent of the nation's passenger transportation, up from 29.
9 percent in 1978.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Reject Any UN Resolution Short of Lifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi leadership on
Monday announced that Iraq will reject any U.N. resolution short
of lifting the nine-year-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by a government spokesman after
President Saddam Hussein chaired a joint meeting of the most
powerful Revolution Command Council and the command of the ruling
Baath Party early in the day.
</P>
<P>
At the joint meeting, the Iraqi leadership discussed the
activities and deliberations held at the United Nations Security
Council on the Iraqi issue, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Any proposal, resolution or results, if any, should be based
on international law, not double standards, if they were to win
Iraq's consideration," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq will not be concerned with any meeting in which it has no
active participation or which falls short of responding to Iraq's
legitimate demands for condemning and halting the on-going
aggression against the country and lifting the unjust
comprehensive sanctions imposed under U.S. pressure," he added.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the five permanent members of the Security
Council, namely Britain, China, France, the United States and
Russia, held a meeting last Wednesday in London to discuss the
Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that they will hold more meetings in New York to
try to reach consensus on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have been reportedly pressing for the
adoption of a British-Dutch proposal on Iraq, which recommends a
temporary suspension of the restrictions on Iraq's oil sales if
Baghdad fully cooperates with a new weapons inspections system and
agrees to put its oil production under U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad rejected the plan outright, insisting that it would
accept nothing less than a total lifting of the embargo in place
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long called for the lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed
on it following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, arguing that it has
fulfilled all its commitments to relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad also demands the abolition of the no-fly zones imposed
on northern and southern Iraq by the U.S. and Britain, which it
argues have no authorization of the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Bank Assets to Hit $9.5Bln by December: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The assets of Nigerian banks
are projected to hit 950 billion naira (about 9.5 billion U.S.
dollars) by December 31 this year, according to a rating report
issued by leading finance and investment firms in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that Nigeria's banking industry has
maintained the main source of the country's economic growth over
the past 10 years and will remain so for many years to come, the
Daily Times newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, there has been unprecedented growth in
assets, earnings, profits and capitalization in Nigeria's banking
industry which is set for further growth as foreign banks such as
Barclays Bank and Standard Bank of London will soon begin full
operations in Nigeria, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that proposed privatization of government utilities,
trade financing, energy development, investment financing and
venture capital demand will further ensure the growth of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Computerization and enhanced information technology system now
in place has further improved services delivery of the industry.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that though there are about 89 banks
operating in the west African country, Nigeria's economy has the
capacity to support more banks.
</P>
<P>
Following this year's rating, the top 10 banks by total assets
in the country are as follows: Union Bank, First Bank, UBA,
Afribank, Citibank, Zenith International Bank, Guaranty Trust
Bank, Diamond bank, Wema Bank and Nig International Merchant Bank.

<HEADLINE> Visitors to Philippines Up 3.05 Pct in First Half-year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals to the
Philippines totaled 1,078,547 for the first semester of 1999, up
3.05 percent from last year's 1,046,611 arrivals for the same
period, an official report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Department of Tourism said that the East Asian
Region contributed the bulk of visitor traffic with a 39.01
percent share, representing 420,795 arrivals which is 5.43 percent
higher than that of the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among the countries in the region, South Korea posted the
biggest gain of 54.75 percent while Japan continued to be the
largest contributor of arrivals of 180,297.
</P>
<P>
The North American region, composed of Canada, Mexico and the
United States, had an aggregate total of 281,409 to comprise the
second biggest group of visitors with a share of 26.09 percent to
total arrivals.
</P>
<P>
The region grew by 23.22 percent over its 272,630 arrivals for
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, visitors from Western Europe went down 0.27 percent
from the 69,638 arrivals last year. Northern Europe, with a 5.99
percent share of the total arrivals, also went down by 8.26
percent from 70,438 last year.
</P>
<P>
Visitors from countries belonging to the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations totaled 68,338, up 1.07 percent from
67,612 the previous year. This region contributed 6.34 percent to
the aggregate.
</P>
<P>
South America registered the biggest growth rate of 12.94
percent to 1,912 from 1,693 last year. In contrast, the deepest
plunge was registered by Eastern Europe at 35.14 percent to 1,770
from 2,729 last year.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, a total of 168,318 visitors came to the
Philippines in June, 6,748 more than last year's total of 161,1570
and registering a growth of 4.18 percent.
</P>
<P>
The improving economic conditions of the country's major source
markets of Asia led to the sustained positive growth of arrivals
for the Philippines since the start of this year, said the report.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Urges Industrial Countries to Work for Balanced Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has called on the industrial
countries to work harder for balanced development in the era of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Closer integration of developing countries into the global
trading and financial system is not bringing faster growth but
increased external deficits and instability," said the UNCTAD in
its annual Trade and Development Report released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency said in the report that "in the present era,
when the world economy is more integrated than at any time in its
recent history, developing countries depend even more on external
resources to achieve rates of growth sufficient to address the
deep-rooted problems of poverty and underdevelopment."
</P>
<P>
Developing countries have been striving hard, often at
considerable cost, to integrate more closely into the world
economy, but protectionism in the developed countries has
prevented them from fully exploiting their existing or potential
competitive advantage, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Governments in the North should work harder to convince a
sometimes skeptical public that there are direct benefits, in
terms of more jobs and rising incomes, from expanding trade with
the South," said UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens Ricupero in his
overview of the report.
</P>
<P>
"They must also recognize that a more stable international
financial system free from hot money and recurrent crisis in
emerging markets is in their longer-term interests," said Ricupero.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Rate in Vietnam's Ethnic Minority Region Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The poverty rate in most of
Vietnam's provinces with mountainous land and ethnic minority
population has dropped to under 30 percent, Vietnam News Agency
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced at a conference held in the central province
of Dac Lac from September 16-18 by Vietnam's National Assembly's
Council of Nationalities to review a survey on living conditions
of a number of ethnic groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which covered almost 4,000 households of 20 ethnic
groups in 13 provinces representing all regions in the country,
said the drop has helped bring the national poverty rate to 15.7
percent from 20.4 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the findings also revealed large gaps in living
standards between mountainous and plain regions, between
mountainous areas, and even between different ethnic groups
inhabiting the same area.
</P>
<P>
The proportions of poor households in the northern mountainous
and central highland regions, at 18.98 percent and 19.68 percent,
respectively, are more than two times higher than that in the Red
River Delta (7.22 percent) and the Mekong Delta (9.93 percent).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the proportions in the two northern mountainous
provinces of Cao Bang and Lai Chau, at 30.8 percent and 35
percent, respectively, are much higher than the regional average
of around 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Social-economic infrastructure in most provinces having
mountainous land and ethnic minority groups lags behind than in
the plain regions, in spite of significant progress over the past
years.
</P>
<P>
There are around 24 million people living in mountainous areas
in the country which has 54 nationalities with the population of
more than 76 million.

when New China was founded, and 50 years later that number has
risen to 937 kwh.
</P>
<P>
A saying prevailing 50 years ago described an ideal life as "
living in a house with electric lights upstairs and downstairs,"
while now, not only electric lights, but many other household
appliances have become commonplace for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
To date 99.2 percent of Chinese townships and 98.1 percent of
villages are equipped with electricity. However, most villagers
did not even know of electricity in 1949, except those living in
the suburbs of Shanghai, one of a few modern cities at that time.
</P>
<P>
And rural electricity consumption topped 459.9 billion kwh in
1998, accounting for 40.53 percent of the country's total,
according to the China State Power Corporation (CSPC).
</P>
<P>
Total installed capacity of China's electricity facilities
reached 270 million kw in 1998 when the country produced 1.16
trillion kwh of electricity, both ranking second in the world, as
compared with the 1.85 million kw and 4.3 billion kwh in 1949,
ranking 21st and 25th in the world at that time.
</P>
<P>
A CSPC source said that the country took only seven years to
raise its power-generating capacity from 100 million kw to 200
million kw, as compared to the 38 years it took to go from 1.85
million kw to 100 million kw.

<P>
China has established five large power grids in east, northeast,
central, north, and northwest parts of the country, as well as a
cooperative power grid spanning four provinces in south China
providing electricity for all cities and most villages.
</P>
<P>
A CSPC expert noted that 1,130 grams of coal produced one kwh
of electricity in 1949, with 22.3 percent of the electricity
wasted in transmission; but today, it takes only 404 grams of coal
to produce one kwh, and waste has been reduced to 8.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China's water resources rank first in the
world, but the hydroelectric power generating capacity merely
accounted for 8.8 percent of the total in 1949. Nowadays,
hydropower generating capacity of the country stands at 63 million
kw, accounting for 23.5 percent of the nation's total power
generating capacity and ranking third in the world.
</P>
<P>
China began construction of the mammoth Three Gorges Power
Station in 1994, which will be the world's largest hydroelectric
power plant with generating capacity topping 18.2 million kw.
</P>
<P>
China is also involved in other energy sources such as nuclear,
geothermal, and solar resources, as well as wind and tides, the
CSPC source said.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the China-constructed Qinshan nuclear power
plant was put into operation along with the Daya Bay nuclear power
plant jointly built by China and France, and the country's wind-
power generating capacity reached 223,000 kw last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's power sector has attracted total overseas
investments of 20.7 billion U.S. dollars since 1984 when a World
Bank loan was first used to build a hydropower station in Yunnan
province, southwest China, contracted by a foreign company.
</P>
<P>
China has now overcome the nationwide electricity shortage
which has been the bottleneck for its economic development since
the early 1970s, the CSPC expert said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian State Urged to Adjust to Digital Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Sarawak State
Industrial Development Minister Abang Johari Tun Openg Monday
urged the state to leapfrog into the digital society to compete in
the global market.
</P>
<P>
When launching the Science and Technology Week in the state
capital of Kuching, the minister said that the state needs to
adjust itself to a knowledge-driven economy or face being left
behind in the rapidly changing world which is entering the
information technology age.
</P>
<P>
By using the latest technological input, intellectual capital
could create services and products in the new global market,
Bernama news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian national leaders have stressed that knowledge is a
central component of the country's economic growth and Malaysia
should be geared towards a developed society using the digital
network by 2020, he said.
</P>
<P>
As such, Sarawak needs to follow the rules of the game in the
global economy which are respected by others, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Developed countries are already in the post-industrial era but
we have to bypass it to compete with developed nations. Otherwise,
we will still be under the term of a developing society and
lagging behind," the official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the students in the state to master the skills
required in the information, communication and technology age, and
be exposed to the changes taking place now so that by the next
century they will be able to play their role.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD: World Economy Performance in 1999 to Remain Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Although the worst fears of
global recession have subsided, the prospect that the world
economy in 1999 will simply repeat last year's poor performance is
discouraging, the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The world economy is estimated to have grown by 2.0 percent in
1998 and much the same performance is expected this year,
according to the UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
"Neither a return to stability in the buffeted Asian economies,
nor the apparent containment of the Brazilian crisis to its
neighbors should hide the immediate downside risks facing the
global economy over the near future," said the U.N. agency in its
Trade and Development Report 1999.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD report warned that stabilization of conditions in
emerging markets does not mean that the underlying problems have
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
"There is no ground for complacency, since the systemic forces
responsible for the recent turmoil are still present," the UNCTAD
said.
</P>
<P>
The continued dependence of many developing countries on highly
volatile capital inflows is a major cause for concern, the UNCTAD
said, adding that there are also question marks about the ability
of the U.S. economy to bring about a smooth adjustment toward a
more sustainable rate of growth, and of the European Union and
Japan to achieve stable recovery.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD stated that Asia's performance continues to depend
on how the crisis and its aftermath are managed, and the speed and
sustainability of recoveries are varied and uncertain.
</P>
<P>
"For the region much will depend on developments in China and
Japan," it said, adding that the gradual slowdown in China is
giving rise to concern.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, the UNCTAD said, despite the continued
pursuit of structural reforms, the region has suffered a serious
setback since growth peaked in 1997 at 5.4 percent and all the
major economies have been affected.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, the much-hoped-for take-off has not happened,
according to the UNCTAD. The growth rate in 1998 was well below
that in 1996 and hardly kept pace with population growth. The year
1999 is unlikely to see any significant improvement.
</P>
<P>
As for transition economies in Europe, after posting positive
growth for the first time in 1997, they were badly affected by the
Russian crisis in the second half of 1998, resulting in negative
growth for the region as a whole, said the UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
In the industrial countries, rapid growth in the U.S. has been
a bulwark against global recession, at around 4 percent over the
last three years, almost double what many had considered its long-
term potential, said the UNCTAD. Growth this year is expected to
drop closer to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. agency said, inflationary fears are on the
rise, and a tightening of monetary policy might trigger a large
equity market correction; given the role in the boom played by
private spending linked to equity prices, this could produce a
harder landing than desired, jeopardizing recovery elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The EU is unlikely to give much of a boost to the world economy
this year, the UNCTAD said. Growth in 1998 was short of the level
needed to make a dent in unemployment. In light of global
conditions, expectations are that growth will dip below 2 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
"Assessing the prospects has been made more complicated by the
introduction of the euro," said the UNCTAD. "Contrasting
performances between larger and smaller economies, and the
cyclical asymmetry with the United States, are posing policy
dilemmas to the European Central Bank. But in the end, economic
restructuring will determine the longer-term viability of the new
currency."
</P>
<P>
In Japan, negative growth is still the likely outcome this year,
said the UNCTAD. A surprise jump in consumer spending in early
1999 is not likely to persist, and a fiscal package set for the
autumn of 1999 is still required if the official growth target of
0.5 percent for the current fiscal year is to stand any chance of
being achieved.

<HEADLINE> PLA Official Meets Columbia Commander-in-Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, met here
today with visiting Commander-in-Chief of the Colombian Armed
Forces Fernando Tapias.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Colombian relationship, including that between the two
armed forces, has proceeded smoothly since the establishment of
diplomatic ties in 1980, said Fu, also a member of the Central
Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the he hope that the relationship between the two
armies will continue its sound and healthy development on many
levels and in many fields along with high-level exchange of visits.
</P>
<P>
As developing countries, China and Colombia share wide
consensus regarding international issues and have been supporting
and helping each other on the international stage, said Fu, who
also expressed his appreciation for the Colombian government's
adherence to the "one China" policy and its support of China on
such issues as human rights.
</P>
<P>
Tapias said he was excited to be in China, and added that China,
as a great country, "should remain unified," and that Colombia has
always advocated one China.
</P>
<P>
Tapias and his party arrived here Sunday at the invitation of
Fu.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD: Developing Countries Must Defend Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries must
better defend their interests when new global trade negotiations
start next year, said the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its annual Trade and Development Report 1999, the UN agency
stressed that market access to the developed countries must form
the centerpiece of a "positive trade agenda" in the new round of
trade talks.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD also called for the dismantling of subsidies to OECD
(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries'
agriculture, which, at 350 billion U.S. dollars, amount to twice
the value of developing countries exports.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD said that developing countries should confront anti-
dumping procedures which have been abused by developed countries
as a means of controlling imports on the excuse of health and
safety standards.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the UNCTAD report noted that competitive
industries in the developing countries are needed, both to reduce
their ballooning imports and to boost exports, adding that "biases
in the international trading system are working against developing
country interests."

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Hold Dance Festival to Welcome New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia will stage a
grand traditional dance festival at Angkor Wat to usher in the new
millennium and show that peace has really come to the country.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said the three-day festival will be held
from December 30, 1999 to January 1, 2000 in front of Angkor Wat,
the symbol of Khmer art and civilization.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 Buddhist monks will bless the festival and about
1,000 dancers will perform traditional dances. "Cambodia wants to
celebrate the new millennium with the world," a government
official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The festival will be attended by King Norodom Sihanouk and
Queen Norodom Monineath Sihanouk, Senate President Chea Sim,
President of the National Assembly Prince Norodom Ranariddh and
the entire government, including Prime Minister Hun Sen and other
government officials, as well as thousands of visitors and local
people.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose is to show the world that Cambodia has gained
full peace, and to help people understand the "real Khmer identity
from the Ankor era" as well as to attract more tourists and
investors.
</P>
<P>
The event is estimated to cost about 500,000 U.S. dollars, most
of which will come from outside funds. The organizers are
depending on investors, businessmen and other private sectors to
donate money to ensure the success of the millennium celebration.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Widens Trade Deficits of Developing Economies: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries'
closer integration into the global trading and financial system is
not bringing faster growth but increasing external deficits, a UN
report said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In almost half the developing countries examined, the trend was
one of widening trade deficits, with falling or stagnant growth,
according to the "United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) Report, 1999" presented here Monday by Martin
Khor, director of Third World Network.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD identified three main reasons why deficits had been
increasing faster than income in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The first reason is that the "big-bang" liberalization has
produced an import surge in the developing countries, while
exports have not been able to keep pace; the second reason is the
slowdown in the industrial economies since the early 1970s, which
has added an additional percentage point to trade deficits in the
developing nations; and the third is that the terms-of-trade
declined constantly eating into the purchasing power of exports of
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Against this background, developing countries had been forced
to chase external private capital to support trade liberalization
efforts. But capital flows liberalization has actually made
matters worse by leading to exchange rate appreciations and
instability, thereby undermining trade performance," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNCTAD report, "Developing countries need to
improve the management of their exchange rates if they are to
benefit from greater integration into the trading system."
</P>
<P>
The report said that capital controls would need to be an
integral part of the policy arsenal available to developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The report also stressed that reform of the financial
architecture needs to recognize the limits of private capital
markets to provide development finance, Khor said.

<HEADLINE> Elf Chief Denies Huge Compensation for Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The president and executive
officer of the French oil group Elf-Aquitaine, Pilippe Jaffre,
denied on Monday that he will be compensated with hundreds of
millions of francs for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Elf and Total-Fina struck a deal last week on "friendly merger"
after two months of merger battle.
</P>
<P>
The local media has reported that Jaffre will be paid between
200 million and 250 million francs (33 million to 42 million U.S.
dollars) for leaving his post, part of sum in the form of shares.
</P>
<P>
"These are absurdities. Let the jealous people, the foolish
people talk about," Jaffre told Radio-Television Luxembourg. "The
figure of my compensations is decided by my council of
administration and myself."
</P>
<P>
The Elf chief noted that during his presidency, Elf's stock
value tripled.
</P>
<P>
"So those who trusted me to carry out the privatization (of Elf)
are now three times as rich," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jaffre has promised to resign once Total completes its take-
over process over Elf.
</P>
<P>
His rival, Total-Fina President Thierry Desmarest, will lead

<HEADLINE> Burundian Factions to Further Negotiate for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A week-long session of
Burundi peace talks ended Sunday without clinching a peace deal to
end the bloody conflicts in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
But delegates have agreed to meet again in late October, a key
mediator said.
</P>
<P>
Judge Mark Bomani of the Nyerere Foundation, told Xinhua over
telephone Monday that during the talks in Tanzania's northern town
of Arusha, delegates had made significant progress in issues like
election system, security situation, refugees, among others.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot give details completely," said Bomani, representative
of international peace facilitator Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, former Tanzanian President and a veteran African
statesman, is currently in London for medical treatment of an
undisclosed illness. But Bomani revealed that Nyerere will come
back to attend the next round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Progress in Burundi peace talks has been slow since they began
in June last year because of mistrust between different factions
over a conflict in which more than 150,000 people have died since
October 1993.
</P>
<P>
Violence has escalated recently as Hutu rebels have stepped up
attacks against the Tutsi-led army of Major Pierre Buyoya, who
seized the power in Burundi in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation has been going on between the Burundian
government, rebels and political leaders, which are divided into
18 factions.
</P>
<P>
Donors have spent nearly eight million U.S. dollars on the
peace process since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bomani urged delegates of all parties to utilize the recess to
consult among themselves so that they can reach a peace deal when
they meet again.

<HEADLINE> Modern Transport Network Spurs Economic Development in Xinjiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A modernized transport network
has given impetus to economic growth in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The region has built 32,000 kilometers of asphalt highways and
3,000 kilometers of railways, which have basically eliminated an
economic development bottleneck.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang now has 14 airports providing 56 air routes -- the "
Silk Roads" of the air, which link the region with the rest of the
world. Xinjiang was once an important part of the ancient "Silk
Road," a corridor for the trade of silk and cultures more than 1,
000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
As the largest area inhabited by ethnic minorities in China,
Xinjiang borders eight countries. The region now has 15 ports of
entry and more than 60 cities and counties opened to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
An advanced telecommunication network has brought Xinjiang
closer to the rest of the world, and in recent years the region
has invested more than five billion yuan for a program-controled
telephone network accommodating two million telephones, and the
number of mobile phones there now has reached nearly 400,000. In
addition, part of a Eurasian fiber optic communications line runs
through Xinjiang.

<HEADLINE> Modern Transport Network Spurs Economic Development in Xinjiang (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xinjiang is still an economically less-advantaged region, but
an increasing number of foreign business people have shown
enthusiasm for development of the region since Xinjiang has
abundant resources such as cotton and oil. It has become even more
appealing to overseas investors now that a modern transportation
network is being formed.
</P>
<P>
Convenient transportation also has brought a tourism boom to
the region, and Xinjiang has become one of the most popular
tourist destinations in China.
</P>
<P>
Business people from a dozen countries have set up more than
500 enterprises in Xinjiang, involving actual foreign investment
of more than 2.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other provinces have also invested 7.8 billion yuan in more
than 1,000 projects in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The landlocked region has emerged once again as an
international commercial center. One example is that the eight
Urumqi Foreign Trade and Economic Fairs reported a combined
transaction volume of 11.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the Eighth Urumqi Foreign Trade and Economic Fair held
earlier this month, Li Qilong, a businessman from east China's
Shandong Province, told Xinhua that Xinjiang looked quite
different from a decade ago, with wider roads and more high
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The region's border-trade volume rose to 870 million US dollars
last year, ranking second in the country, from only 320 million US
dollars in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang's gross domestic product (GDP) reached 111.7 billion
yuan last year, representing an annual increase of nearly ten
percent on average for the past five years.

<HEADLINE> China, EU to Resume WTO Talks: Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China and the European Union
will resume talks on China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) soon, said Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign
trade and economic cooperation, here today.
</P>
<P>
Shi said while meeting with Francois Huwart, secretary of state
for external trade of France, that relevant departments of his
ministry are now contacting the EU to make concrete arrangements
for the talks.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that China has not changed its position
toward joining the WTO, and believes that, as a worldwide
organization, the WTO is incomplete without China, and that China
should enter the WTO as a developing country, with its rights and
obligations balanced.
</P>
<P>
China's bid to enter the multi-lateral trade body and its
predecessor has lasted for 13 years. Bilateral talks between China
and the United States as well as the EU virtually ceased following
the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, the United States has asked for a
resumption of talks through various channels. During the recent
informal summit meeting of APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation)
leaders in Auckland, New Zealand, President Jiang Zemin and
President Bill Clinton decided to resume the talks.

<HEADLINE> UAE Commercial Vehicles Market Slumps 15 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The commercial vehicles
sales in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) dropped at least 15
percent during the first half of 1999 from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said the market for passenger car and sports
utility category also slumped by as much as 20-25 percent during
the same period, according to a report carried by Gulf News on
Monday
</P>
<P>
Shipments of commercial vehicles to the UAE in the first six
months are estimated at 8,000-9,000 units, 5000 of which are from
Japan.
</P>
<P>
But market sources suggest that actual sales might be much
lower than what the shipment figures show.
</P>
<P>
During the whole of 1998, imports of commercial vehicles were
18,000 units, 13,000 of which were from Japan.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Mobilize Police for MPR Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
will mobilize 21,000 police from the Jakarta Police Headquarters
to safeguard the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) session next
month, Commander of Indonesian Military (TNI) Gen. Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Wiranto added, the government had been preparing other
reserves units from TNI and potential reserves to back up the
police.
</P>
<P>
"TNI has prepared such reserve forces," Wiranto told the House
Commission I for law, security and foreign affairs here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The general also said he had persuaded any political elites not
to provoke people for their own potential interest sake, to stage
protest while general session proceeding.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who is also Minister of Defense and Security, forecast
the MPR session would go smoothly and without any violence.
</P>
<P>
"But if politicians or political elites don't respect (the
session) and use people to fight for their own interest sake,
there would be clashes between people and security officials," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
The two-stage General Session of the MPR is to begin on October
1, when 700 new House of Representatives (DPR) and MPR members
will be sworn in to choose the new leaders of the two bodies. The
final part of the session, the presidential election, is scheduled
in November.
</P>
<P>
The new DPR/MPR would then form a working group and factions,
after which they would deliberate on outlining the state's broad
guidelines and amending the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, demands to move forward the MPR session keep
mounting due to the political uncertainty as many reformation
agenda remain uncompleted, such as probe into Soeharto's hidden
wealth, the Bank Bali scandal in which top government officials
are allegedly involved and East Timor issues.
</P>
<P>
General Chairman of the ruling Golkar Party Akbar Tanjung has
said he wants the presidential election to be moved ahead by two
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Former Official Confident For China's Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China will finally be
reunified no matter whatever difficulties and torturous road ahead,
said Yang Side, former head of the Office For Taiwan Affairs Under
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old man, who was in charge of the central
leadership's Taiwan affairs for eight years, told Xinhua that the
reunification of the motherland is a historical mission for the
entire Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said that "great progress has been made in the reunifying
process since the founding of the People's Republic of China a
half century ago."
</P>
<P>
"China successfully resumed the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong in mid 1997, and Macao will return to the motherland in
this December," the former official said, "and both are very
important events in the Chinese history."
</P>
<P>
He recalled that in the past two decades, as a result of joint
efforts made by the mainland and people from both sides of the
Taiwan Straits, more dialogues have taken place, and closer
economic and cultural connections have been established.
</P>
<P>
"Only under the one China principle can the relations across
the Taiwan Straits be improved and long-term stability in the
Taiwan Straits can be maintained," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past half century, China has successfully thwarted a
number of attempts to split the motherland," he noted, "and the
country's determination to achieve national reunification has
never changed and wavered in the least."
</P>
<P>
"After Macao's return to the motherland, China will certainly
make every effort to settle the Taiwan issue," he said, expressing
the belief that by giving scope to the wisdom of the Chinese
people across the Taiwan Straits, the way to the settlement can
certainly be found and the complete reunification of the
motherland will eventually be accomplished.

<P>
TOKYO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose sharply in
Tokyo on Monday, boosted by the yen's fall against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First

traders said, adding that a rise in Nikkei index futures prices
last Friday in Chicago also prompted investors in Tokyo to buy
stocks.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China City Reopens War Criminal Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The famous Fushun Prison for
War Criminals in northeast China's Liaoning Province has reopened
for exhibition after a three-month renovation.
</P>
<P>
The refurbished prison has been expanded to two exhibition
halls and several sites including the prisoner's former cells,
bathrooms and barber shops, and there are now many more historical
photos, documents and articles used by the prisoners, including
those of the last Chinese emperor, Puyi, on display.
</P>
<P>
Clothes, suitcases, books and manuscripts of former Japanese
prisoners collected by Japan's Association of the Japanese
Returned from China are also on exhibit.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory telegram message, the association says that
the prison serves as a place where "Japanese invaders could find
their consciences."
</P>
<P>
The prison was originally built by the Japanese invaders in
1936 to hold Chinese anti-Japanese fighters. It was taken over by
the then Chinese authorities after Japan surrendered in 1945.
</P>
<P>
In 1950, the government of New China rebuilt the prison to
reform war criminals including Puyi, Japanese army officers
captured during their invasion of China, and some generals of the
Kuomintang captured during the war of liberation.
</P>
<P>
The site was transformed into a base for patriotic education
and tourism in the late 1960s. However, there was serious damage
to the buildings and related facilities due to lack of repairs and
reconstruction.

<P>
MACAO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Diana W. I. Iong, a certified
public auditor in Macao, was chosen to be a lawmaker of the future
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) here today.
</P>
<P>
Four candidates were vying for a vacancy in the First
Legislative Council of the Macao SAR at the plenary meeting of a
Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee is composed of 199 Macao residents.
Among them, 190 participated in the by-election and four abstained
from voting.
</P>
<P>
As the votes were counted, Diana won the most number of 71
votes. The other three candidates, Chou Ion Choi, Lao Ngai Leong
and Tam Man Kuen, obtained 19 votes, 60 votes and 36 votes
respectively.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore Foreign Trade Increases 8.2 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SINGAPORE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade
increased by 8.2 percent year-on-year in August 1999, extending
into its fourth month of expansion, the Singapore Trade
Development Board (TDB) said in a press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
The TDB attributed the hefty hike to the growth of certain
product segments as well as the continued improvement in the
crisis-hit Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
It said that non-oil domestic exports (NODX) grew by 9.3
percent, the fifth consecutive month of expansion. Non-oil
re-exports shrank by 3.7 percent, the fourth consecutive month of
less severe single-digit contractions. The non-oil imports posted
a 13.4 percent growth, signaling general healthy manufacturing
activities in the month ahead.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, Singapore's total trade volume
in August 1999 was 32,466 million Singapore dollars (about 19,325
million U.S. dollars) with exports worth 16,159 million Singapore
dollars (about 9,619 million U.S. dollars), re-exports worth 6,420
million Singapore dollars (about 3,421 million U.S. dollars) and
imports valued at 16,508 million Singapore dollars (about 9,826
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The TDB said the 5.2 percent increase in domestic exports of
electronic products in August 1999 contributed to the expansion of
non-oil domestic exports of the month although domestic exports of
disc drives dipped by 5.2 percent mainly due to the restructuring
of major disc drives manufacturers in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
It noted that domestic exports of non-electronic products
increased by 18.1 percent, continuing into the sixth consecutive
month of expansion, and the increase continued to come from the
strong growth in the domestic exports of pharmaceuticals and
intermediate compounds to the EU and disc media products to Japan.
</P>
<P>
The 13.4 percent growth in the month's non-oil imports were
mainly due to the strong increase in imports of ICs, parts of
semiconductors, capacitors, printed circuits, parts of CTVs and
radios, cellular phones and radio phones as well as parts of
aircraft, TDB said, adding that imports of disc drives, disc media
products, DC motors and parts of VCRs fell during the month.
</P>
<P>
The data showed that NODX to the four of Singapore's top five
markets, viz U.S., EU, Malaysia and Japan, continued to expand
during the month while NODX to Hong Kong contracted by a less
severe 6.0 percent as compared to the double digit declines in the
preceding months.
</P>
<P>
NODX to Japan continued to surge by a hefty 43.7 percent in
August and it was followed by Malaysia market that grew by 7.0
percent. NODX to U.S. and EU increased by 3.5 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
NODX to emerging markets recorded a moderate growth of 4.2
percent in the month with Mexico and India markets continuing to
register double-digit growth and China market having a slower rate
of 4.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Won't Make Hasty Decision on Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- It is not the time to decide
a plan to boycott the Olympic Games which is set to be held in
Sydney, Australia, on September 15 to October 1, said Wismoyo
Arismunandar Chairman of the National Sports Committee (KONI).
</P>
<P>
"We, even have to look for a way out to make the relation
between the two countries keeps on steady, and this could be done
through sports," he said after officiating the Indonesian Football
Association congress here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He sees sports is one of the means to strengthen and restore
the relation among the nations, including the relation between
Indonesia and Australia which has begun to row tense due to the
East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government last week canceled a security pact
with Australia, denouncing Australia's attitude and actions on the
East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Australia sentiment has grown stronger all over Indonesia
with demonstrators taking to the streets everyday slamming
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Wismoyo said the process of the relation between Indonesia and
Australia is still going on, thus it is better for the sports
society not to make a hasty decision, including a decision to
boycott next year's games.
</P>
<P>
"If the Australian attitude is getting unfriendly, it is not
necessary for us to send our athletes there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wismoyo said the government has not yet issued any decision to
boycott the Olympic Games.  "Meanwhile, the preparation to the
international event should be done as usual," he said.
</P>
<P>
But, if the proposed boycott is really implemented, he
expressed a wish that the athletes won't be disappointed and
accept this with a bravery.

<HEADLINE> Interview: China's Education Achievement Tremendous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The schooling made
available universally to a high degree is a tremendous achievement
of China in the past 50 years, says an American scholar
specializing in Chinese studies.
</P>
<P>
"The task of educating 1.2 billion people can make any country
nervous, but China has done very well in creating availability of
schooling in a society with a high level of illiteracy," said John
Charles Jamieson, director of Yale-in-China Chinese Center of the
Chinese University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As a scholar of Chinese studies, Jamieson, 66, has made
frequent trips to China's mainland for extensive academic
exchanges with Chinese counterparts since 1973.
</P>
<P>
Talking about China's education achievements, he attributed
them to the high value of education placed in society, saying the
government and the people are both aware of the importance of
education.
</P>
<P>
"China's school system is essentially very strong. The society
encourages young people to educate themselves. This value is part
of the Chinese society," Jamieson told Xinhua in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
Since the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949,
especially in the past two decades, China's education development
has impressed him a great deal and has enabled China to become
strong in the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
When he first visited China in 1973, he said, Chinese scholars
were isolated internationally and they were insecure and uncertain
of themselves.
</P>
<P>
"As China restored contacts internationally, specialists began
to review for themselves and they began to regain confidence in a
very short time," said Jamieson.
</P>
<P>
"In the 1980s, cooperation with Chinese colleagues was very
natural and fruitful for both sides," he said. "Chinese
scholarship, in certain fields, has moved to the top position
internationally, (and) such a flow of exchanges out of China to
Japan, Europe and the United States helped boost China's
development."
</P>
<P>
"Since China is rich in human resources and talents, China will
make stronger and stronger contributions to the science in any
field, from literature to astronomy," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jamieson said the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping adopted a
very realistic view in permitting scholars to travel abroad and
opening the doors to students to study abroad.
</P>
<P>
As China develops, more and more students studying abroad have
returned to China, and they are playing a significant role in many
fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jamieson has been working in the Chinese University of Hong
Kong for eight years and has been involved in extensive academic
exchanges with universities in China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is unique within China with a free flow of
information. Its infrastructure is of the international class, and
no other place in China is equivalent to Hong Kong in this regard,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong returned to China in 1997, more and more
graduate students from the mainland have come for further study in
Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has material resources and atmosphere, and the
mainland has strong talents. Both sides will benefit by combining
the advantages of themselves," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Earmarks $1.5M to Aid Tanzanian University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Sweden has earmarked
some 12 billion shillings (1.5 million U.S. dollars) to assist the
University of Dar es Salaam in carrying out researches and reform
programs in the largest university in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Ambassador to Tanzania Sten Rylander announced the aid
plan in Dar es Salaam at the weekend during the closing ceremony
of the sixth annual consultative workshop on the university's
transformation program.
</P>
<P>
The main components in the aid program include collaborative
researches between the Swedish and Tanzanian researchers, basic
and applied research conducted by the university researchers alone
or in collaboration with other institutions, the Swedish envoy
said.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Monday quoted Rylander as saying that
the new Swedish policy on Africa gave special attention to the
obvious risk that parts of Africa would be marginalized in a world
with the information technology (IT) emerging.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that those who have developed the capacity to
generate, access and process information will control the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that his country will provide further
assistance to the Dar es Salaam university in the dynamic pursuit
of the IT revolution.
</P>
<P>
Rylander commended the university as a respected actor on the
international academic arena and hailed its active role in linking
Tanzania to the international information centers and super
highways.

<HEADLINE> Early Man of Taiwan Comes From Chinese Mainland (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists believe
that the present-day Taiwan Straits used to be connected with the
mainland, and that early man on Taiwan Island came from the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
They back this conclusion with recent findings from a seabed
find of a human humerus bone fossil, and fossils of a great number
of animals belonging to temperate zones.
</P>
<P>
The fossils, as well as one piece of bone and the lower
jawbones of mammals bearing many artificial engravings, were
netted by a group of fishermen from Xiangzhi Village in east China
's Fujian Province, from traditional fishing grounds in the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
Cai Baoquan, an associate professor at Xiamen University and a
fossil specialist, said the human fossil is the right humerus of a
male dating back 11,000 to 26,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The brownish human fossil, 311 mm long, is well preserved and
bears traces of adhesion by marine invertebrates, according to Cai.
</P>
<P>
Characteristics of the find show that these animals used to
live together with human beings in the same region, Professor Cai
explained.
</P>
<P>
Except for the human fossil which is being kept at Cai's
university, the other finds from this seabed of the Taiwan Straits
are all stored at a local museum.
</P>
<P>
"At the height of the last ice age of the late Pleistocene, the
sea level fell drastically as a result of low temperatures, and
the Yellow Sea and East China Sea, including most of the Taiwan
Straits, became land, joining Taiwan Island and the Chinese
mainland so human beings and animals could freely walk to and fro,
" Cai explained.

<HEADLINE> Four Tigers Die in 4 Weeks in Bangladeshi Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Four tigers have died in the
Mirpur National Zoo in the northern part of the Bangladeshi
capital Dhaka within four weeks, newspapers here reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sharmila, a 14-month-old tiger, fell victim to trypanosomiasis,
a deadly protozoan disease, on Sunday, despite all precautionary
measures to save her life, raising the number of fatalities of
tigers at the zoo to four in less than four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Sharmila lost her mother Mamata on August 27 and father Arjun a
day later. Her brother Badsha became the first victim of the
tragedy when he died on August 24.
</P>
<P>
And experts had also found traces of the parasite in blood
samples of Sharmila's cage mate, Raja, which was fighting for life
till Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians said trypanosomiasis, a protozoan disease of
African origin, was the curse of the ruined cat family.
</P>
<P>
But experts were confused at the incidents, pondering how the
carriers of the disease -- the biting tsetse flies -- could take
such a long journey from Africa to the zoo to inflict their germs
on the tigers, an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Director of Lahore Zoo Dr. Arshad Haroon Toosey oversaw the
treatment of Sharmila, official sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Toosey, The Daily Star newspaper said the parasite
might have been brought from the African continent, and it might
have been spread at the zoo through biting flies or through beef
given to the tigers as feed.
</P>
<P>
The Initial autopsy report presumed that Sharmila died of
trypanosoma, but sources said more test would be conducted to
determine what had really endangered the entire cat family,
according the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
An emergency medical squad was constituted on August 29, a day
after Arjun's death, following directives from Fisheries and
Livestock Minister A.S.M. Abdur Rob to provide medical care to the
zoo population along with the permanent medical facility there,
and a seven-member probe body was also formed to probe into the
incident.
</P>
<P>
"The disease is controllable by extensive and advanced medical
care and all zoo guests including tigers, bears, elephants, horses
and lions should be given preventive medicines every two months,"
an official handout said.

<HEADLINE> Grand Exhibition Opens in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A grand exhibition of China's
achievements over the past 50 years opened at the Beijing
Exhibition Center here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao presided over the opening
ceremony for the exhibit, the largest of its kind ever in China.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji spoke at the ceremony, calling the
exhibition an epitome of the country's achievements over the past
half century.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China 50 years ago, the country has
witnessed sea changes, the premier recalled.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party
of China (CPC), united, and struggled hard to turn a poor country
into a prosperous and thriving one, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the outstanding economic, political and cultural
achievements, especially over the past 20 years during which the
country opened itself to the outside world and launched reforms in
all sectors.

extraordinary road that the Chinese people have taken over the
past 50 years, and the brightest chapter in the entire history of
China," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that these achievements are the great victory
of Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory, which
have fully demonstrated the tremendous superiority and great
vitality of the Chinese socialist system.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, he also spoke highly of the hundreds of millions
of Chinese people from all walks of life for their contributions
to the country over the past five decades.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rebels' Massacre Mars Peace Efforts in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- As scores of Sinhalese
civilians killed by Tamil rebels were buried in eastern Sri Lanka
on Sunday, the Sinhalese nationalist sentiments are prevailing in
the war-torn island country, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They said the sentiments are destined to stall the ongoing
peace efforts by influential businessmen and peace organizations.
</P>
<P>
In the early hours of last Saturday, Tamil rebels of Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) stormed three hamlets in Amparai
District, 350 kilometers by road east of Colombo, hacking to death
54 villagers, including 17 women and 10 children.
</P>
<P>
A mass funeral was held on Sunday evening at government expense
for 43 of the victims at which more than 10,000 persons were
present and religious rites were performed by 200 Buddhist monks.
</P>
<P>
Local people harangued visiting government officials over what
they called a lapse in security by government troops.
</P>
<P>
The Sinhalese hard-liners again raised their cry for military
solution to the 16-year-old civil war fought between the Sinhalese
majority government and Tamil rebels who demands a separate
homeland for minority Tamils in the north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
"There is no solution to this (ethnic) problem until and unless
the Tigers are completely wiped out which could be done only
through war and not through any other means," said the National
Movement Against Terrorism in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's slaughter, the worst ever attack on civilians in
four years, is considered a tit-for-tat revenge to an air strike
by the Sri Lanka Air Force last Wednesday on a crowded marketplace
in northeastern Mulaitivu district where 22 Tamil civilians were
killed and 41 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross has expressed deep
concern at the alarming increase in the number of civilian
casualties. It condemned the LTTE attack and called on both the
LTTE and the government to comply with international humanitarian
law.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga condemned the attack as inhuman
and brutal and assured the government would do everything possible
for the surviving families.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Defense General Anuruddha Ratwatte has
ordered the security units to set up new army camps in the
affected area and to strengthen the security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Less than a month ago, the Sarvodaya Movement or All People's
Prosperous Movement organized a massive peace march and rally in
Colombo. It even proposed a march of 1 million people from the
south to the war-torn north this month to press for an end to the
prolonged ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
Under a businessmen's initiative, the ruling People's Alliance
(PA) and the main opposition United National Party (UNP) have to
work towards a mutually acceptable peace proposal by the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
Then an influential business leader, Lalith Kottelawala, is
expected to meet the LTTE leader in the first week of October to
broker peace for the war-ravaged nation.
</P>
<P>
However, the businessmen's initiative suffered double blow this
month. One is the sudden death of A.C. Hameed, leader of the UNP
group to the bipartisan talks who died of a heart attack on
September 3, the other is the Saturday's massacre.
</P>
<P>
The future of the country's long-running ethnic war becomes
more uncertain given the public sentiments and the forthcoming
national elections which is expected to be held early next year,
said analysts.
</P>
<P>
However, just as Mr. Hameed said a few days before his demise,
the businessmen's initiative would not collapse as the search for
peace was bound to go on.

China's achievements and progress have also benefited from the
great work of compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas,
as well as from foreign experts and friends who worked and

</P>
<P>
The forthcoming century is an era full of opportunities and
challenges, Zhu said. He called on the people of all ethnic groups
across the country to rally around the CPC Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at its core, uphold the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory,
work with one heart and one mind, dedicate themselves to reform,
and strive for the modernization and great revitalization of the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The large exhibition is sponsored jointly by the State
Development Planning Commission, the Publicity Department of the
CPC Central Committee, the State Economic and Trade Commission,
the Ministry of Finance, the State Statistics Bureau, and Beijing
Municipality.
</P>
<P>
It was prepared and will be participated in by related agencies,
the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the governments of every
province, autonomous region, and municipality, and the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is divided into five parts, including a general
introduction, comprehensive exhibition, sector exhibition,
regional exhibition, and outlook, featuring successes in various
fields throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
It will last until October 18, and some one million people are
expected to visit the exhibition, the exhibit organizers said.

<HEADLINE> AIDS to Erode Kenya's GDP: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The fast spread of AIDS will
reduce Kenya's per capita income by 10 percent in the next five
years, Kenya's National AIDS and STDs (Sexually Transmitted
Diseases) Control Program has said.
</P>
<P>
The organization said in its latest report that the disease
will contract Kenya's projected gross domestic product (GDP) by
14.5 percent and erode savings by 15 percent, the East African
weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the organization, AIDS will especially lead to a
shrinkage in productivity in the manufacturing and agricultural
sectors, and also high health care costs.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS and STDs control unit said that so far, at least 1.9
million Kenyans are infected with HIV, the virus causing AIDS,
with the prevalence rate being high for people aged between 15 and
49.
</P>
<P>
It added that by June this year the country's health services
had recorded 87,070 cases of full-blown AIDS and another 760,000
people are suspected to have developed AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The experts from the anti-AIDS unit also noted that HIV/AIDS
will have negative impact on agriculture, which accounts for 30
percent of Kenya's GDP and 70 percent of the export earnings. The
sector employs about 50 percent of the Kenyan work force.

follow international fashion trends as quickly as they come into
vogue.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, several international fashion shows and model
contests organized by the local authorities provide up-to-date
fashion information to the people of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) in Shanghai has now

<HEADLINE> State Firms in NE China Profitable After Four-Year Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- State-owned industrial
enterprises in northeast China's Liaoning Province showed profits
in June and July, the first time after four years of losses,
according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Net profits for June were 280 million yuan (33.6 million U.S.
dollars), and for July 155 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"Though the rise is only a sign of recovery, it means that the
state-owned enterprises are now taking a turn for the better, and
it is likely that these firms will all show profits in three years
' time," said Yang Xihuai, assistant to the director of the
Liaoning Provincial Trade and Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
By now, he said, about 40 percent of the province's large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises have been transformed into
companies, 26 listed companies have acquired 13.8 billion yuan of
capital by issuing stocks, and some one-third of these enterprises
are now out of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
The large and medium-sized enterprises in the province, one of
the oldest industrial bases in China, account for one-tenth of the
country's total, and their recovery will undoubtedly, to some
degree, improve the operational quality of state-owned enterprises
throughout the country, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that profits for state-owned enterprises and
state holding companies all over the country were 24.31 billion
yuan for the first half of this year, 2.8 times more than that of
the corresponding period last year.

<HEADLINE> Facts &AMP; Figures On China's Science, Technology and Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's technology and education have scored remarkable
achievements since the founding of the People's Republic of China
in 1949, especially since the country adopted its reform and
opening policy in the late 1970s, as indicated by the following
facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
When the country was founded in 1949, there were no more than
50,000 people working in 30 scientific research institutions in
China. In sharp contrast, those figures rose to 2.81 million and
21,700, respectively, by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The money spent on technological innovation totaled 112.9
billion yuan in 1998, including 46.7 billion yuan of government
financial allocation.
</P>
<P>
There have been 465,000 items of technological fruits since
1981, most of which were up to international standards.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, more than 35,000 discourses written by Chinese
scholars were published internationally, ranking ninth in the
world.
</P>
<P>
China has handled 860,000 patent applications and granted 430,
000 patents to domestic and overseas applicants since 1985 when
China introduced the Patent Law.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, China had established 53 state-level hi-tech
development zones embracing more than 16,000 hi-tech companies and
1.74 million employees. The hi-tech sector registered an output
value of 430 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
From 1949 to 1998, a total of 13 million graduates and 500,000
post graduates were educated in China's universities and colleges,
and about 180 million students were trained in secondary technical
schools.
</P>
<P>
There were 15.8 million teaching and administrative staff in
Chinese institutions of education, including 12 million full-time
teachers.
</P>
<P>
Out of each 1,000 Chinese, 25 have college degrees, 95 are up
to the level of a high school education, and 268 are above middle
school level.
</P>
<P>
Illiterates or semi-illiterates in the 15-45 age group
accounted for some 5.5 percent of the country's total population
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> China's "Thousand Lakes" Province to Lead Economic Development in Inland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- As China's economic development
begins to shift toward the western region of the country, Hubei in
the central region, a province known for its many lakes, is
expected to become a leading industrial power, said Jia Zhijie,
the provincial Party leader.
</P>
<P>
Known as the "traffic hub" for inland China, the province
connects the eastern and western regions. In the 1960s and 1970s,
it was one of the country's leading heavy-industry centers with a
number of national "model" companies, such as Wuhan Steel Co. and
the No. 2 Automobile Plant, said Jia, secretary of the Chinese
Communist Party Provincial Committee.
</P>
<P>
But the economic boom along the eastern coast in the 1980s,
boosted by an export-oriented economy, has now taken over the
limelight.
</P>
<P>
"Hubei lost quite a few development opportunities because of
rooted ideologies left over from the planned economy period," said
Jia.
</P>
<P>
However, with the central government paying increasingly
greater attention to the development in the west to bridge the
wide gap between the eastern and western China, Hubei, with its
geographic advantages, rich natural resources and a large
contingent of talents, is placed in a position to lead the
economic boom in the inland areas, Jia said.
</P>
<P>
The inland provinces and autonomous regions have 89 percent of
the country's land and 64 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
The province has sustained high economic growth since 1993,
higher than the national average, securing 10.3 percent of GDP
growth rate last year, despite great losses from the floods on the
Yangtze River in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the latest wave of China's infrastructure construction,
Hubei gained a large number of important projects, worth 30
billion yuan, including the world's largest hydro-power facility
at the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale infrastructure construction will effectively boost
the economy of the region, economists say. Central China provinces
like Hubei which have enjoyed rapid economic development for years
running, are expected to become a pillar sustaining the country's
rapid economic development.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Urged to Combat Drug Abuse Among Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti has called upon all Kenyans to strongly combat drug abuse
among juveniles as it may ruin the future of the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president also pledged at the weekend that the
government would take all the measures to make Kenya a drug-free
country.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times newspaper Monday quoted Saitoti as saying that
all efforts should be made to ensure that children keep off drugs
and concentrate on their studies.
</P>
<P>
He noted that drug abuse undermined education and threatened to
throw the country into a bleak future due to lacking of skilled
manpower.
</P>
<P>
"Parents must instill in our children the capacity to resist
wayward individuals who try to lure them into drug abuse and other
destructive practices," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though there are no official figures available about how many
school children take drugs, drug use among youths has reportedly
become a serious social problem in Kenya, which leads to rising
school violence.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Multinational Force Arrives in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of four military
aircraft carrying the United Nations multinational force troops
arrived in Dili, capital of East Timor on Monday morning, Antara
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The first plane carrying 75 Australian troops arrived in Dili
at 06:45 local time (2245 GMT Sunday). When the soldiers went out
from the aircraft, they quickly secured the Comoro airfield
perimeter for a shuttle of following C-130s.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five minutes later, another three military aircraft
landed in the airfield.
</P>
<P>
According to the Indonesian Commander of the Restoration of Law
and Peace in East Timor, Major General Kiki Syahnakri, the 2,500
of an estimated 8,000 multinational force from some 20 countries
would arrive in 37 groups from Darwin, Australia, by military air
transport on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kiki and Australian Major General Peter Cosgrove, Commander of
the International Force for East Timor (Interfet), pledged mutual
cooperation in a meeting held in Dili on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached a level of mutual understanding and a
shared vision of the direction in which to proceed, Kiki was
quoted by The Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent attempt to cool increasing resentment toward the
Australian-led multinational force, Cosgrove pledged that Interfet
would maintain a cooperative spirit with the Indonesian Military.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely hope that the people can see that we're able to
cooperate and this will rebuild our relationship which undoubtedly
has suffered some damage," he said, referring to flagging
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Since the Indonesian government agreed to accept foreign
peacekeepers to quell the violence in East Timor, there has been
an upsurge in anti-Australian sentiment due to the perception that
Canberra's efforts in the East Timorese crisis verge on meddling
in Indonesian affairs.
</P>
<P>
Some East Timorese and segments of Indonesian society have also
accused Australia of backing pro-independence factions.
</P>
<P>
Kiki said he expected to hand over control of the territory at
the earliest five days after the arrival of the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove said the mission would likely last several months
before making way for a probable follow-up U.N. peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the situation in Dili was generally calm
on Sunday but commercial activities appear to have ceased
completely along with the devastation in the city.

<HEADLINE> Thai Telecom Authority Eager to Expand Mobile Phone Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The communication Authority
of Thailand (CAT) wants to spend at least five billion baht (125
million U.S. dollars) to revive an ailing mobile phone network and
expand the service nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of Communications Minister Suthep Thueksuban's
drive to force existing mobile-phone operators into lowering
charges that he claims are too high, the Bangkok Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
If the key planning agency, the National Economic and Social
Development Board (NESDB), and the cabinet agree, the service will
be expanded from serving only Bangkok and 21 central and eastern
province.
</P>
<P>
The CAT plans to spend 1.2 billion baht (30 million dollars) to
expand the network using CDMA (code division multiple access)
technology to 41 percent coverage of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the plans had been approved by the NESDB last
month and were now awaiting cabinet backing.
</P>
<P>
If the cabinet agreed to that step, the CAT planned to ask for
approval to install more than 300 CDMA base stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The CAT is already looking for offshore loans for the projects
as it wants to have the network fully in place to compete with
others when the industry is liberalized.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Works Out Organic Farming Guidelines Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's first draft of
proposed guidelines for organic farming has been completed, which
is expected to further promote Thai farm products worldwide, the
Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A public hearing will be held to gather the reaction of
interest groups, especially farmers, before the draft takes
effect, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the standards set by International Federation of
Organic Agriculture Movements, the guidelines will be used to
promote Thai farm products in the world market.
</P>
<P>
State agencies and private-sector partners in Thailand are
growing organic asparagus and baby corn on a trial basis, while
exports of organic rice and bananas are under way to the European
Union and Japan, the newspaper quoted Agriculture Ministry
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Selecting crops and other products for inclusion in the organic
program will be the next step, while a national agency will be set
up later to certify the products by testing all products for
chemical residue, ensuring their worldwide acceptance.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft, land for organic production must be free from
chemicals for at least the three preceding years, while water must
be non-toxic.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks See Deposits Up, Lending Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Bank deposits in Thailand
continue to rise steadily within the financial system, despite
interest rates falling to their lowest point in a generation, a
Bank of Thailand report available here Monday said.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, bank deposits in July totaled
4.63 trillion baht (115.7 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of
four percent over the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Large individual deposits, meaning those of five million baht
(125,000 dollars) and up, and corporate depositors represent the
majority of the overall deposit base, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, bank lending has continued to fall, totaling
5.37 billion baht (134.3 million dollars) in July, down 6.1
percent from a year earlier, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The decline of lending was mainly attributed to the huge amount
of non-performing loans (NPLs), which has strained the resources
of local banks to clamp down on delinquent borrowers, as priority
is given on restructuring the largest corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
Some experts estimated that strategic NPLs, where borrowers
have the ability to pay but refuse to do so, comprise as much as
one-third of the total 2.7 trillion baht (67.5 billion dollars) in
bad loans in the system.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that deposit level will remain high until
economic conditions improve further and the relative risks of
other assets, such as stocks and property, decline.
</P>
<P>
Weak consumer sentiment and strong sense of job insecurities
have also encouraged people to save money as a safety net.

<HEADLINE> Furniture Imports Forecast to Increase in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai companies looking for
better quality office furniture are likely to have a wider choice
next year when import tax is reduced to between zero and five
percent, the Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free
Trade Area's (AFTA) fast-track program, tax is to be cut on
certain products by January 1 next year. Furniture, currently
taxed at 20 percent in Thailand, is included.
</P>
<P>
More foreign manufacturers will probably then enter Thailand to
open their own factories or form joint ventures, according to
Patana Usanachitt, vice-president of the office furniture division
of Modernform Group PLC, a leading furniture company in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The office furniture sector is the most attractive one because
it has the highest growth and will pick up from the economic
crisis first, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sales of office furniture are currently worth 2.5 billion baht
(62.5 million U.S. dollars) a year in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Demand for office furniture has been rising because more
foreign investors come to form joint business ventures with Thais
and the improved Thai economy prompted many local firms to
reorganize their operations and hire more staff.

MADRID, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Juan Carlos Ferrero
rallied from one set down to beat second seed Alex Corretja 2-6, 7-
5, 6-3 to win the 500,000 U.S. dollars Mallorca Open in Palma De
Mallorca and claim his first ATP Tour title.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero, 19, in his first pro season, ranked 68th by the ATP
Tour but with this victory will jump into the top 50.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero made a nervous start against his compatriot Corretja,
twice losing his serve in a one-sided first set. But Corretja
missed the chance to finish off his opponent in the second set,
failing to take advantage of a break point at 5-5 that would have
left him on the brink of victory.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero showed great character to hold on and then break
Corretja in the next game to take the match into a deciding set.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero broke twice in the third and set up the one match point
he needed with a fine whipped forehand cross-court that just
clipped the line.

<HEADLINE> Fires Still Burning Near San Francisco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Wildfires continued to
rage on Sunday near San Francisco, the largest metropolis in
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Forest Service said some 3,200 firefighters were
battling lightning-sparked blazes that have scorched more than 24,
000 acres in the Los Padres National Forest, about 150 miles south
of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
The wildfires, which have been burning since September 8, are
especially difficult to control because steep terrain has made it
hard for firefighters to approach, according to the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were using controlled burns to slow the blazes,
but officials could not predict when the wildfires would be under
control.
</P>
<P>
Last month, wildfires burned hundreds of thousands of acres of
woods, bush and grass across California within a week. Four
counties in the state have been declared as disaster areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Angel Air plans to
expand its routes to Indochina next year, the Bangkok Post

City, and Cambodia, according to Somchai.
</P>
<P>
Angel Air would discuss with PB Air an alliance covering
marketing and operations to strengthen their networks and save
costs, Somchai said.
</P>
<P>
Angel Air has two Boeing 737-400s and PB Air is buying three
Fokker 28 aircraft. The latter can carry 75 passengers each.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Montreal Hails Erection of Chinese Gateways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Montreal citizens
gathered at the China Town Sunday to enjoy the lion dance
performance in celebration of the completion of two traditional
Chinese gateways.
</P>
<P>
In the procession were Montreal Mayor Pierre Bourque, Quebec
Secretary for Linguistic Policy, Chinese Ambassador to Canada Mei
Ping and Montreal Chinese Chamber of Commerce Chairwoman Sukwei Ho.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bourque told the ceremony that the installation of "
pailou," or the decorated gateways, symbolized the openness of
Montreal to world culture and friendship. He wished good fortune
and prosperity to China Town as well as the whole city of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Mei Ping said the completion of the project
had shown great potential of the cooperation between Montreal and
Shanghai as sister cities.
</P>
<P>
As a token of friendship, the Chinese State Department also
presented two pairs of stone lions to be installed at the "pailou"
gateways, the Chinese ambassador said, wishing happiness, luck and
wealth to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
"Pailou", as an increasingly popular symbol of China Town in
north America, was taken into account as an important joint
venture by Shanghai and Montreal in June 1998. Montreal workers
finalized the design by engineers of Shanghai just a few days
before the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China.

<HEADLINE> China's Replication Industry Taking Shape: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua)-- China will adjust and optimize
the optical replication industry to meet the requirements of the
information society and knowledge-based economy, today's China
Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The nation will support the development of large-scale optical
technology enterprises and speed up the system reform towards
intensive operation, the paper quotes Kou Xiaowei, an official
with the State Press and Publication Administration (SPPA), as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Kou also encouraged foreign investors to cooperate with
domestic manufacturers to develop the Chinese optical
manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
Though the Chinese optical manufacturing industry began later
than that of Western developed countries, as one of the pillars of
the IT industry it has seen dramatic growth over the past decade,
the paper says.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the memory capacity of a compact disc (
CD) has increased by 26 times with a yearly average of 1.5 times.
New products include the CD-R (recordable cds), CD-RW (rewritable
cds) and DVDs (digital video discs).
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Longma Optical Technology Co, the largest compact
producer of recordable CDs, now is capable of producing 12 million
discs per year, 4 million of which are exported to Eastman Kodak
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, the dispersed production pattern of the replication
industry suffers from low efficiency, which made it unable to cope
with consumer demand with the yearly output of about 500 million
CD products, the paper reports.
</P>
<P>
"We will encourage the enterprises to take on reform by
adopting joint stock, amalgamation and annexation, and we will put
emphasis on the large-scale enterprises engaged in the production,
publication, replication, distribution and selling," Kou says.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Fight against Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua)-- The Ministry of Water
Resources (MWR) of China has urged provincial governments to
devote more energy and new technology to fighting the damage
caused by serious drought, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this summer, precipitation in north and
northwest China, and along the Yellow and Huaihe rivers, has
decreased by 50 to 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lack of moisture, coupled with high summer temperatures,
has done great damage and hindered the planting of winter wheat in
those regions.
</P>
<P>
The battle against drought must include developing irrigation
works, utilizing surface water and taking advantage of underground
water supplies, MWR officials was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In dry areas and developed regions, low-pressure water
transmitting technologies, sprinkling, dripping and saturation
irrigation should be expanded to increase efficiency, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
In underdeveloped regions, the utilization rate of water should
be increased through leveling of fields and compacting farming
areas.
</P>
<P>
The MWR called on local governments to improve their management
of farmland water uses, rationalize the allotment of water as well
as encourage farmers to use water-saving irrigation technologies.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also urged that agriculture department should
provide high-quality dry land seeds and financial agencies must
raise more money for drought prevention.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' First-Half BOP Surplus Highest This Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' overall
balance of payments (BOP) for the first half of this year yielded
a surplus of 2.877 billion U.S. dollars, the highest level
recorded this decade, the Business World said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a statement of the Central Bank of the
Philippines as saying that the amount is equivalent to 7.5 percent
of the country's first-half gross national product (GNP), compared
with only 4.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The BOP surplus also represented an increase of 84.5 percent
from the 1.559 billion dollars posted in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The BOP systematically records the transactions of the country
with the rest of the world. It is what is left after deducting
foreign exchange liabilities from dollar earnings and is a
barometer of the performance of the external sector.
</P>
<P>
"The improvement came mainly from the bigger surplus in the
current account," said the statement, adding that the latest
account and overall BOP positions are now close to the external
targets for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The full-year overall BOP surplus is projected at 3.16 billion
dollars. This leaves only 283 million dollars or 8.9 percent of
the target to be covered for the second half.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 BOP surplus target is the level set by the
International Monetary Fund under its standby loan program.
</P>
<P>
The current account target of 1.665 billion dollars, on the
other hand, is already exceeded by 33.8 percent at the first
half's level of 2.228 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure was a dramatic increase from the 12 million dollars
reported during the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Has Great Opportunity in China:Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China offers a broad range of
opportunities for overseas investment, such as state-owned
enterprises reform, hi-tech industries, central and western China
development, infrastructure construction, and service industry,
said a foreign trade official.
</P>
<P>
Xu Bingjin, assistant to the minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, said at the recent "Dalian - 21st Century
Economic Forum" in northeast China's Liaoning Province that the
central Government will further encourage overseas funding in
central and western areas by offering preferential tax policy and
easing restrictions on registration .
</P>
<P>
The population in the central and western China accounts for
over 60 percent of the country's total, while overseas investment
in the area is only about 12 percent of the state's total.
Although the investment environment there is not as good as that
of the coastal area, the area has great market potential and
abundant natural and labor resources, said Xu.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August the country had approved 335,000 overseas-
funded enterprises, with a total contractual investment of 597.86
billion U.S. dollars, of which 292.2 billion dollars were actually
used, according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
At the just concluded Dalian fair on economic and technological
cooperation, Dalian signed 12 contracts involving nearly 1.3
billion U.S. dollars of overseas investment with businesses from
the United States, Switzerland, Denmark, Japan, the Republic of
Korea, Australia, setting a new record in the city's use of
overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
Xu said China will need at least 100 billion U.S. dollars of
investment in the infrastructure construction in the next decade,
and around 40 percent of the funding remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
China will at the same time make effective use of its resources

<HEADLINE> Cegya, Tibetan Centenarian Who Enjoys Longevity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Had my father lived up to see the peaceful liberation of Tibet
(in 1951), things would have been much better," the centenarian
says. "Now we needn't worry about food and clothing, and we can do
anything we like, therefore we can live a much longer life than
our forefathers."
</P>
<P>
Cegya's family used to live by depending on land and housing
leased by the landlord, and they were often expelled when they
failed to pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
Enormous changes have taken place in Tibet, and for Cegya as
well. The aged Tibetan woman now lives with Gyasang, her youngest
daughter, Qunjue, her son-in-law, and the couple's three children.
The couple manage one hectare of farmland and run a drugstore.
</P>
<P>
They live in a new house furnished with a TV set, sofas and a
ghee-stirring machine. Cegya married at 18 and gave birth to seven
children, and four of them have survived the years of poverty. Her
four-generation family boasts a total of 36 people.
</P>
<P>
The aged woman, who leads a simple life and is overwhelmed by
the enjoyment of her present life, attributes all her fortune to
the ruling Communist Party of China which has led Tibetans to
topple serfdom and take the road of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Tibet, at an average altitude of 4,000 meters, is considered
one of the least habitable places in the world, but to the
surprise of many, there are nearly 100 centenarian there, out of a
total population of 2.5 million in this southwest China autonomous
region.
</P>
<P>
Now, the life expectancy of Tibetans is 67 years, compared with
a mere 36 years before 1951, when the region's population stood at
around one million.
</P>
<P>
This longer life expectancy is proof of the remarkable
improvement of Tibetans' living standards.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the average per-capita income
has reached 5,410 yuan for urbanites in Tibet, and 1,150 yuan for
the rural population.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Progress in Post-doctoral Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua)-- China has made progress in its
post-doctoral education, China Daily reported today as part of its
series commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of New
China.
</P>
<P>
China has established a post-doctoral training system to cope
with challenges caused by the rapidly developing knowledge-based
economy, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, the country will have trained 9,707
students beyond doctoral degrees in 450 special mobile stations
scattered among its universities, institutes and large enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 5,584 people have graduated and become the
backbones of State-level science and technology projects.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that the "post-doctor" Program began in 1985,
when famous physician Tsung-dao Lee suggested that China set up a
system to train high-level talented people.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee the establishment of such a system, the
central government has made a series of preferential policies and
issued more than 50 regulation documents, including wages, welfare
and family provisions.
</P>
<P>
Through international cooperation and exchanges, China has also
set up a pool of talented people who returned from overseas after
earning their doctorates.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last April, a total of 1,088 doctors who studied
overseas returned to China and became "post-doctors."
</P>
<P>
China's post-doctoral degree system has also attracted overseas
doctors and scholars to study in the country, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Multinational Force Starts Deployment to East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The international
peacekeeping force started its deployment in East Timor on Monday
morning, APP reported.
</P>
<P>
The first wave of Australian troops have been flown to East
Timor from three military bases in the northern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the AAP report, about 2,000 Australian troops
would be sent to East Timor Monday.
</P>
<P>
Australia has promised to contribute 4,500 troops to the
U.N.-authorized peacekeeping force which is up to 7,500 from more
than a dozen countries.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, two fleets of nine warships had left Darwin, the
Australian northern harbor, to deploy off the East Timor territory
to support Monday's troop deployment.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the multinational force, Major General Peter
Cosgrove, flew to Dili for talks with the leaders of the
Indonesian martial law command in East Timor. He was accompanied
by his Thai deputy Major General Songkitti Jaggabatra and chief of
the U.N. assistance mission to East Timor Ian Martin.
</P>
<P>
"What we have done is go through out broad plan and be
transparent to each other," Cosgrove said at a press conference
after back to Darwin.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to be as open as possible with the Indonesians to
avoid any "accidents or incidents" when thousands of troops pour
into Dili, the commander was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The operation was described Sunday evening by Australian Prime
Minister John Howard in his TV address to the nation as the
Australia's "largest military involvement for more than 30 years".

<P>
WELLINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's endangered
native parrot, the kakapo, could be given Viagra-type treatment in
an attempt to keep the species safe from extinction.
</P>
<P>
According to the New Zealand Conservation Department,
scientists with the Massey University, based in Palmerston North
on North Island, are experimenting with quails to encourage
out-of-season mating.
</P>
<P>
"Should that prove successful, the trial would be extended to
other species such as the kea. And if that proved successful, the
techniques could be applied to the kakapo, department kakapo-team
scientist Graeme Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
So far the results are encouraging, he said, though it could be
five or 10 years before the treatment could be risked on kakapo.
</P>

There are only 62 kakapos in existence.
