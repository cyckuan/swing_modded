contender who is rousing voters' passions, for better or for worse,
is Sen. John McCain. ``If George Bush were out here giving free

UCLA IMPROVING AT PERFECT TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA Bruins had plenty of explanations for
their masterful upset of No. 1 Stanford. Big men Jerome Moiso and
Dan Gadzuric dominated. Point guard Earl Watson was almost
flawless. JaRon Rush and Jason Kapono hit crucial jump shots. They
played with patience and poise in a raucous environment.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked why it took 28 games for a performance of this
caliber, the Bruins struggled for specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could they explain how a team that wins in Maples Pavilion
could lose at Arizona State by 29 points two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we got back from Arizona, we did a little
soul-searching,'' junior forward Rico Hines said. ``We didn't have
any team meetings, but everybody soul-searched. We've taken a
different approach to practice and a different approach to games.
We're preparing so much better. You can sense it as soon as you
walk in the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``(In Arizona), when we got behind, we self-destructed. But the
last two games, when we've gotten down we've kept fighting and
gotten back in the games. Now, the sky's the limit for this team.
We've got JaRon back, and we're just starting to scratch the
surface of what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late. UCLA (17-11, 8-8) is one victory from
attaining the 18 required for an NCAA Tournament berth. (That
should come Thursday against last-place Washington State in Pauley
Pavilion.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Bruins are peaking at the perfect time. The
NCAA selection committee values strong finishes above all when it
picks the 64-team field; the Bruins have won four in a row and
beaten the No.1 team on its home floor.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have contributed to the turnaround:
</P>
<P>
   --Watson's emergence.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight games since Ryan Bailey joined the starting lineup
and reduced Watson's ballhandling responsibilities, Watson has 47
assists, 20 turnovers and is playing as well as any point guard in
the conference. Even when Bailey doesn't play, Watson seems more at
ease with his role than he did earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has taken time for me to learn the point guard spot,'' said
Watson, who played off-guard in 1998-99 while Baron Davis ran the
team. ``I can honestly say I wasn't a point guard at the beginning
of the season. It's been on-the-job training.''
</P>
<P>
   --Frontline improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric and Moiso have dominated at various points in their
careers, but never at the same time - until now.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric had 22 points and 16 rebounds at Cal while Moiso
provided solid support (nine and six). Saturday, with Gadzuric in
foul trouble, Moiso had 17 points and 12 rebounds and controlled
the game in the final minutes of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate to be able to make some big shots,'' Moiso
said. ``That's something I should do, but I don't do it
consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   --Improved ballhandling.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better gauge of UCLA's success (and failure) than
turnovers. The Bruins committed 45 in two games in Arizona and lost
by 44 points. But they committed just 27 in two games against the
Oregon schools and won both.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 12 minutes against Cal, they committed 10 turnovers
and fell behind 31-12. In the final 28 minutes, they committed only
seven turnovers and outscored the Bears by 40 points.
</P>
<P>
   They committed five turnovers in five minutes against Stanford
and fell behind 19-4. They committed just nine turnovers in the
final 35 minutes and outscored the Cardinal by 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   --Rush's return.
</P>
<P>
   It's not about the 19 points he scored against Stanford,
although the Bruins aren't complaining. But what they covet most is
Rush's energy, his tenacity, his rebounding, his versatility, his
defense and his five fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes the pressure off every other player,'' coach Steve
Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   With his performance Saturday, Rush also took enormous pressure
off the embattled coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time for their performance review with athletic
director Peter Dalis, the coaches can claim - with the Stanford
game as evidence - that Rush's suspension cost them four or five
victories this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rush beat the No. 1 team, catapulted UCLA into the tournament
and possibly secured the staff's future. That's a pretty good
afternoon.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It wasn't Jean Van de Velde at last year's British Open.
It wasn't Scott Hoch at the '95 Shell Houston Open. It wasn't even
Greg Norman at, oh, any tournament any year.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Langham isn't the most famous pro golfer to suffer
fatal self-inflicted wounds, just the most recent.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about a pro golfer suffering from gag reflex
that brings out a certain amount of sympathy. But in Langham's
case, the blame for his losing the Doral-Ryder Open doesn't fall
completely on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Almost. But not completely.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Furyk's sizzling back nine Sunday at Doral's Blue Monster
helped him beat Langham by eight shots over the final seven holes,
giving Furyk an unexpected two-shot win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really put myself in a hole,'' Furyk said. ``And I should
feel real fortunate that I won the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Furyk helped his own cause tremendously. He fired a dandy 30 on
the final nine, ending up with a 7-under-par 65, and his 23-under
265 total tied the tournament record set by Norman in 1993. Furyk's
fifth PGA Tour win was his first east of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   For Langham, who shot 2-under 70, he will have to live down the
fact he lost a six-shot lead in the final seven holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know that,'' he said of his huge lead. ``As soon
as you start thinking about that, you are setting yourself up for
failure. I didn't do anything that was crazy or dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not. The old line about South Florida _ it's not the
heat, it's the stupidity _ didn't necessarily apply to his demise.
But Langham did do plenty wrong. For the fourth consecutive day,
the pros tore into the tame Monster, which was defenseless in calm
conditions. But Langham shot 2-over 38 on the final nine, which
overshadowed a wonderful birdie-birdie-birdie start to his round.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were only a couple of guys who could have caught me with
a round of 65, and Jim was one of them,'' Langham said. ``I gave
him a little bit of light, and he took advantage of it. For one
reason or another, it wasn't my turn.''
</P>
<P>
   For 11 holes, it looked like it was very much Langham's turn. He
had played wonderful, bogey-free golf as his lead doubled from the
three-stroke cushion with which he started the day.
</P>
<P>
   But Furyk did all he could, then relied on some help from
Langham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my caddie, let's go shoot a 30 on the back nine and
maybe we'll have a chance,'' Furyk said.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Langham had shot himself in the foot and just about
everywhere else coming into the 18th. Three bogeys in five holes
had done plenty to give Furyk the momentum, not to mention a
one-stroke lead after 71 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Furyk clinched the tournament when his approach on 18 nestled
eight feet from the hole. Langham tried his best to recover when
his 8-iron stopped 10 feet away. But his putt slipped by the edge,
and Furyk put an exclamation point on his back nine by making his
birdie for the two-shot final margin.
</P>
<P>
   Langham was cruising along without a care through the 11th hole,
on which he chipped in for birdie. He was 5-under for the day to
that point, 24-under for the tournament and six shots ahead of
Furyk. Nobody else had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, Furyk shouldn't have had one, either.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the blink of an eye, Langham's lead was down to a
single stroke as he lost at least one shot to Furyk on four
consecutive holes.
</P>
<P>
   Furyk birdied the par-5 12th, then Langham showed signs of
muscle tightening with back-to-back bogeys, including a missed
four-footer for par on the par-4 14th.
</P>
<P>
   Furyk birdied the 13th, then reached 21-under for the tournament
when he knocked a 7-iron within two feet at the par-3 15th. That
made it a one-shot deficit with three to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13th definitely was a turning point,'' Furyk said. ``I
felt like a two-shot swing there might put some pressure on him.
Two holes earlier, it was a six-shot lead. Now, it's down to
three.''
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of routine pars on the 16th, Langham continued to
self-destruct. His drive dribbled into the left rough on the 17th,
then he hit a horrible approach about 20 yards right of the green,
leaving himself with an ugly chip. He left his first flop shot
short of the green, then chipped again to within a foot. But the
damage was done. And it was compounded when Furyk canned a 20-foot
birdie putt. The two-stroke swing put Furyk one shot up with only
the long, perilous 18th to play.

HOT LAKERS BEAT THE HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At some point Sunday, Laker legs turned to mush,
jumpers lost their juice and the NBA's winningest team suddenly
lost all ability to do much of anything.
</P>
<P>
   Anything except win.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that even their worst days are better than most teams'
best, the Los Angeles Lakers misplaced their offense for three
quarters and still dominated the East's second-best team, dealing
the Miami Heat a 93-80 loss at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Lakers' most unaesthetic showing in weeks, as they
shot 39.5 percent from the field, and just 26.8 percent (15 of 56)
after the first quarter. And it didn't matter in the least.
</P>
<P>
   On perhaps momentum alone, they won their 15th in a row, and
only the Clippers stand in the way of matching the incredible
16-game streak they posted earlier this season. The Lakers are only
the third team in NBA history to have two streaks of at least 15
games in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any of this made the game more palatable to coach Phil
Jackson, who on Sunday saw more similarities to the Lakers'
late-January swoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get sucked up into any optimistic feel that we
can play this way and continue,'' Jackson said. ``This is
reminiscent of something that happened about six weeks ago to us
(when the Lakers went 3-6)....
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to be a little sharper, a little tighter,
get some more practice time. We haven't had much. It's good that we
have a day off after we play the Clippers, but until that time,
we're going to have to maintain what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is plenty, even on a bad day. Glen Rice snapped out of a
three-game funk to carry the Lakers with 23 points on 8-of-16
shooting and added a season-high 10 rebounds for his first
double-double of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That helped balance out a listless day from the Lakers' top
scorers. Shaquille O'Neal made just 5 of 17 shots from the field,
finishing with 17 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. Kobe
Bryant had 15 points and seven rebounds but was 5 for 12.
</P>
<P>
   The role players did the rest - Ron Harper scoring 14 points,
Robert Horry pitching in 10 points and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of weapons on this team,'' O'Neal said. ``As
long as me, Kobe and Glen can maintain what we've been doing and
guys step off the bench and contribute a lot, we're going to be a
hard team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Or catch. In winning their ninth consecutive home game, the
Lakers extended their lead over idle Portland to two games.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a rough few games for O'Neal, whose shooting
percentage is on a steady decline, and Jackson observed, ``Shaq
looked very tired.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, outscored by Alonzo Mourning (21 points), thought
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get tired,'' he said. ``I'm more beat up than tired.
I'm always beat up. A lot of chopping. But I don't get tired....
When they need me to hit those shots I'll hit them. Every time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers led by as many as 18 points, and the Heat never got
closer than 11 in the second half against a stiff defensive stand.
All the Lakers' offense came in the first quarter, when they rode
Rice's 13-point outburst to a 37-23 lead that never withered.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning and P.J. Brown both fell victim to foul trouble, and
the Heat got a mere 11 points from their aging backcourt of Tim
Hardaway and Dan Majerle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams ground to a rather enigmatic halt in the second
half,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The victory capped a six-day span in which the Lakers - the
NBA's leaders at 49-11 - knocked off the other top team in the West
(Portland, 46-12) and the top two teams in the East (Indiana at
39-19, Miami at 37-22).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a huge statement,'' Rice said. ``In the last
couple of days we've played the one and two that's in the East and
pretty much were able to go out there and handle them. I just think
it's a sign of this team really growing and maturing and going out
and playing together.... We've always had the confidence that we
could pretty much beat any team.''

WHERE DID IT ALL GO WRONG FOR USC?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's almost hard to believe that as recently as
Feb. 3, USC was tied for first place in the Pacific-10 Conference
with a 6-1 record, and seemingly on pace for an NCAA Tournament
bid.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were already without forward Sam Clancy (broken
right foot) and forward Jarvis Turner (broken left ankle), but
seemed to have enough left to win five of their final 11 games, the
number necessary to earn a tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   So where did things go wrong? Forward Brian Scalabrine thinks
the problem began when USC upset then No. 2-ranked Arizona 80-72 on
Jan. 22 in their first game after the injuries to Clancy and
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually thought we'd be worse (than we are) without Sam,''
Scalabrine said. ``But then we beat Arizona and you know what we
did? We fooled ourselves into thinking we were a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   USC went 3-7 without Clancy. The Trojans (14-14, 7-9) have lost
eight of their past nine games and may be reeling, but they still
believe they will earn a bid to the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably get the two Washington (schools) this week and
go to the NIT,'' Clancy said.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of frustration: It might just be the result of a prolonged
slump, but patience is beginning to wear for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   After Jeff Trepagnier missed a layup against Cal, USC coach
Henry Bibby immediately motioned reserve Nate Hair to check into
the game. Trepagnier saw Hair head toward the scorer's table, and
threw his hands in the air while asking Bibby why he was coming
out.
</P>
<P>
   The two then had an animated discussion - all during the game -
over why Trepagnier was being removed. ``I just asked what I did
wrong, and he told me I had to make those shots,'' Trepagnier said.
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier and Scalabrine also chastised teammates on the court
against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Staying positive: With the season winding down, Bibby is trying
to remain upbeat instead of criticizing after losses.
</P>
<P>
   He praised the Trojans repeatedly following their 83-71 loss to
Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played hard. Brian played on one leg. Sam is just
getting back,'' Bibby said. ``But they haven't thrown the towel in.
I'm proud of the guys. We're building things and we have a solid
foundation in this program.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy update: Clancy reported feeling better after the Cal game
than he did in his return against Stanford on Thursday, after
missing six weeks with a broken foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little sore but not much,'' Clancy said. ``I got tired
a little bit but overall I felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy played 31 minutes, nearly twice as much as Bibby planned
to use him going into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Two records: Point guard Brandon Granville already set a
single-season record for assists, and Saturday at Cal he set a
school-record for most turnovers (112) in a season. Granville is
only six turnovers ahead of Scalabrine.
</P>
<P>
   On the mark: Forward David Bluthenthal has made 25 consecutive
free throws. The school record is 37 by John Block in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Not welcome: Cal honored several former football coaches at
halftime Saturday, but when former Golden Bears and current San
Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci was introduced, the crowd of
more than 12,000 booed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee ... tough crowd,'' the Cal public-address announcer said.

PEPPERDINE FALLS TO SAN DIEGO
</HEADLINE>
 DIEGO-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ With about a minute left Sunday,
Pepperdine's Damaris Hinojosa sat on the bench, wrapped a towel
around her head and leaned forward.
</P>
<P>
   Hinojosa, the Waves super freshmen forward, couldn't bear to
watch the last few seconds tick away in a stunning 61-58 loss to
San Diego in the West Coast Conference tournament final,
Pepperdine's second consecutive setback in the WCC championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   On the other sideline, an eerily similar scene was unfolding.
San Diego coach Kathy Marpe sat down, hid her face in a towel and
began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Such similar reactions, but for such different reasons. Hinojosa
was trying to put a disaster in perspective. For Marpe, it was a
wonderful dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (21-9) had come to the WCC tournament fully expecting
to leave with the school's first NCAA Tournament bid. Instead, the
Waves played their worst game of the season at the most inopportune
time, falling apart in the second half and losing to a team it
easily handled twice this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Waves have to hope for an at-large berth into the NCAA
Tournament. More likely, they'll settle for the Women's NIT.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly what they were hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   Hinojosa was at Moorpark High last season when the Waves fell in
the WCC title game to St. Mary's. That loss hurt. Sunday's setback
was more painful because this was Pepperdine's year to break
through. The Waves were the WCC regular-season champions. They'd
won 11 consecutive games heading into Sunday, 19 of their last 22.
San Diego (17-12), the fourth seed, wasn't even supposed to be in
the final, let alone !ital!beat!off! Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   But it's San Diego who will go dancing later this month, not the
Waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to hand it to San Diego, they played with great
heart and tremendous hustle and they were determined not to lose,''
said Hinojosa, the WCC Freshmen of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Hinojosa finished with 11 points, but made just 3 of 12 shots.
Pepperdine's other star Rasheeda Clark - had only nine points on 4
of 14 shooting. Clark, the conference Player of the Year, did not
score in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego concluded a brilliant run here this weekend. The
Toreros beat Loyola Marymount, host Santa Clara and top-seeded
Pepperdine to earn their second trip to the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emotional win,'' Marpe said afterward, fighting back
tears. ``We weren't going to leave anything out there on the floor.
We've practiced so hard this year, because (winning the tournament)
was what our goal was.''
</P>
<P>
   The key was a devastating stretch midway through the second
half, when the Toreros broke open a close game by outscoring
Pepperdine 9-0, overcoming a 45-41 deficit to take a 50-45 lead.
They immediately tacked on a 10-2 run to go ahead 60-47 with two
minutes left, effectively ending Pepperdine's hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time all year we didn't answer a run with a
run,'' Hinojosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Gray had 15 points and 12 rebounds to lead San Diego.
Maria Perez-Barris and Susie Erpelding added 14. The Toreros also
got 11 points from Kerri Nakamoto and eight from Melissa
Glazebrook, two role players who weren't factors in the previous
meetings between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   The future is still bright for the Waves, who return a majority
of their team, including stars Clark and Hinojosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do is try to get back to the final,'' Pepperdine
coach Mark Trakh said.

LET THE P-I STIR YOUR SYNAPSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Welcome, disgruntled former readers of Seattle Times
sports. Good to have you with the Post-Intelligencer after your
years of wandering the world without the P-I as your beacon of
morning enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I has prepared this little quiz of the current sports
scene to stimulate the synaptic responses dulled by years of
reading afternoon sports.
</P>
<P>
   You're welcome. Answers at the end.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, Ken Griffey Jr. was to the Mariners as:
</P>
<P>
   a) The Road Runner was to Wile E. Coyote.
</P>
<P>
   b) Eddie was to Beaver.
</P>
<P>
   c) Lucy was to Charlie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   d) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdome is being destroyed because:
</P>
<P>
   a) As the biggest SOB in the valley, Paul Allen gets his way.
Every time.
</P>
<P>
   b) His Experience Music Project can't win the Ugliest Building
in Creation Award with such formidable hometown competition.
</P>
<P>
   c) Allen can't stand the fact that the Sonics won more
championships in the building than he has won with his NBA team in
Portland's Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   d) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have flailed about almost helplessly in this
off-season's free agent market because:
</P>
<P>
   a) Former front office exec Randy Mueller and former coach
Dennis Erickson furiously spent all the Seahawks' money under the
salary cap in what was a futile bid to save their jobs in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   b) Word is out among free agents about what November and
December life will be like at Husky Stadium the next two years, and
decided it would be better to sign with the Chechnya Rebels.
</P>
<P>
   c) Without more quarterbacks coming from the traditional and
once-formidable Milton College/Central Washington pipeline, the
chance for a winning season seems remote.
</P>
<P>
   d) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to watch good college basketball in this state:
</P>
<P>
   a) Move to Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   b) Walk over to the little school on the canal at Nickerson.
</P>
<P>
   c) Get cable or a satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   d) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   For the men's and women's basketball programs at the University
of Washington, this has been the worst combined season since:
</P>
<P>
   a) Clarence E. ``Hec'' Edmundson changed his nickname from the
politically incorrect ``Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   b) The movie ``One Million B.C.'' with Raquel Welch in that
sabertooth-tiger outfit.
</P>
<P>
   c) The Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   d) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a respectable won-loss record, the Sonics suddenly have
one of the NBA's worst home-court attendance marks because:
</P>
<P>
   a) Shawn Kemp's kids refuse to go.
</P>
<P>
   b) Even in this hot real estate market, it takes awhile to get
the actual proceeds from a home sale in order to buy a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   c) The period between the heydey of the '96 Finals and now is so
vast that there is no known unit of measure in our time-space
continuum to allow the sports fan to connect the events.
</P>
<P>
   d) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   The fairest, most reasonable justification for the posture of
oppression that is annually adopted by Mariners ownership to
justify its latest pursuit of public subsidy is:
</P>
<P>
   a) Our wealth is just on paper.
</P>
<P>
   b) Do you have any idea how many shares of Microsoft we had to
sell to pay Bobby Ayala $1.8 million to pitch in Montreal last
year?
</P>
<P>
   c) Hey, you try to run a business that's answerable to Bud
Selig.
</P>
<P>
   d) None of the above. None exist.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' opening night next month at the new ballpark will:
</P>
<P>
   a) Be colder than a wink from Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   b) Provoke a virulent epidemic of wistfulness for the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   c) Cause a renewal, inspired by the events around the WTO, of
the latest Seattle cultural tradition: Dumpster fires.
</P>
<P>
   d) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Borrell is:
</P>
<P>
   a) A new video game.
</P>
<P>
   b) A rappelling technique invented on the climbing rock at REI.
</P>
<P>
   c) An NCAA recruiting violation.
</P>
<P>
   d) A Sonics forward.
</P>
<P>
   Kazu Sasaki:
</P>
<P>
   a) Is, after eight years, a payoff for the Mariners being owned
by Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   b) Maybe the coolest Japanese contribution to Seattle since
Uwajimaya.
</P>
<P>
   c) Will be first relief pitcher in years to come out of the
Seattle bullpen that won't provoke hysterical laughter and
high-fives in the opposing dugout.
</P>
<P>
   d) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   In sports, the term ``fantasy'' refers generally to a variety of
gambling games involving the drafting of athletes whose seasonal
achievements earn points toward cash prizes for the fantasy general
manager. The term can also mean:
</P>
<P>
   a) Believing that Barry Henthorn is merely a benevolent
philanthropist helping oppressed youngsters survive, as Sports
Illustrated described in its latest issue, the ``urban killing
fields'' of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   b) Optimism that Alex Rodriguez will re-up with the Mariners
without having first won the World Series, Super Bowl, NBA Finals
and Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   c) An expression of hope by a Sonics fan about a potential
first-round playoff matchup against either the Lakers or Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   d) A column in the Times by Michael Fancher.
</P>
<P>
   Because of some confusion surrounding the joint operating
agreement between the Times and P-I, the best way to distinguish
the newspaper rivals is:
</P>
<P>
   a) If the paper isn't being delivered properly, it's the
responsibility of the Times.
</P>
<P>
   b) If your copy looks out of register or otherwise funky, it's
the responsibility of the Times.
</P>
<P>
   c) If it's a quality sports section, as it says on the big
globe: It's in the P-I.
</P>
<P>
   d) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   For choosing any answer other than d) well, that's why we're
here _ to sharpen your sports knowledge.

LAKERS COMING TO THEIR OWN DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You don't have to have an elephant's memory to
recall the days when the Los Angeles Lakers were at their defensive
best after the game clock had expired. They'd ward off questions
about their lethargic rotation on defense, swat away concerns about
team chemistry and intercept any inquiry headed toward
introspection or accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Lakers so closely guarded their egos last season, it
was chilling.
</P>
<P>
   This year their focus is on passing muster with Phil Jackson,
not passing the buck, and the results have been nothing short of
breathtaking. The chip the Lakers once carried on their collective
shoulder has become a veritable bowling ball they're throwing at
opponents lined up like pins.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers completed the NBA equivalent of a 7-10 split on
Sunday, knocking off the Miami Heat 93-80, two days after toppling
the Indiana Pacers. The Lakers, who are on a 15-win roll, never
trailed against the Eastern Conference's two top-ranked
heavyweights and won by a combined 28 points.
</P>
<P>
   More impressive than what the Lakers pulled off on this first
weekend of March was how they did it. They relied heavily on their
defense, which is sort of like Evander Holyfield, who was among the
Staples Center sellout crowd, out-finessing an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   It probably was of little solace to fire-breathing Heat coach
Pat Riley, but his players put forth a commendable effort on both
ends of the floor. The Heat outshot the Lakers, 41.7 percent to
39.5 percent and held them to 76 field-goal attempts, seven below
their season average.
</P>
<P>
   And yet ...
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice burned the Heat like a melted candle in the first
quarter, collecting 13 of his 23 points on 5-of-7 shooting to help
the Lakers to a 14-point lead after 12 minutes. All of the Lakers
were on fire; Ron Harper made 4 of 5 shots, Kobe was a perfect 3
for 3 and Shaquille O'Neal made 3 of 5.
</P>
<P>
   After converting 15 of their first 20 shots, the Lakers made
only 15 of their final 56 attempts. In the final three quarters
O'Neal had five assists against just two baskets, Bryant managed
only two field goals and Rice missed 6 of 9 shots.
</P>
<P>
   And yet ...
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' lead never fell below seven points in that span and
they never led by fewer than 11 over the final 24 minutes. Not
coincidentally, O'Neal had two blocked shots in that time and
Bryant had two steals. Miami's P.J. Brown logged as many personal
fouls (three) in the second half as he did points and Heat center
Alonzo Mourning was outscored in that span by Rice and Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, under Jackson, their first-year coach, have
developed brass knuckles to go along with their eye-candy offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny,'' Bryant mused. ``We used to rely on our
offense to win. Now we're relying on our defense. In the past we'd
get a big lead and relax on defense. Now we relax on offense and
our offense gets real sloppy and our defense is what carries us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about time, Robert Horry said. On many a night last year
the reserve forward felt like he was the only one who cared what
happened when the Lakers didn't have the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, guys are starting to take pride in their defense,''
Horry said.
</P>
<P>
   The wonderful thing about defense is it's impervious to bad
bounces, capricious rims or uncooperative backboards. It requires
no Midas touch to dominate on the defensive end, no journeys to the
Zone such as the one the Lakers took the first 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is desire.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, neither Del Harris nor his replacement, Kurt Rambis,
could coax a dependable defensive effort out of the Lakers last
year. The difference a coach can make was borne out with four
minutes left in the second quarter Sunday, when O'Neal took a
charge that saddled the 6-foot-10, 261-pound Mourning with his
third foul.
</P>
<P>
   When their two bodies collided, it was a small wonder it didn't
register on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable that Shaq took a charge,'' said Harper,
shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, Harper had recounted a conversation he and
Jackson had when they both were with Chicago. The Bulls were
playing the Lakers and Jackson asked Harper to double down on
O'Neal in an effort to slow him. Harper's response? ``I said,
`You're crazy! I said I'm not taking a charge on him. I have two
kids. I need to see them.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal wasn't thinking Sunday of the child he has, just the
championship rings he is missing. NBA titles may not be won in
March, but messages can be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just beat him to the spot because I knew where he was
going,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year an abdominal injury that was slow to heal made it hard
for O'Neal to slide-step to where he needed to be. It says a lot
about O'Neal, and by extension, the Lakers, that his health no
longer is his only defense.

   CHINA-SMUGGLING (Shantou, China) _ After years of tolerance,
China is waging a desperate war on the smuggling and corruption
that have long helped enriched country's prosperous southern
provinces at the expense of central government coffers. But the
anti-smuggling campaign, designed to increase revenues and to clean
up the government's badly tarnished image, has already proved to be
an exceedingly delicate balancing act, both because important
regional economies are intertwined with smuggling, and also because
zealous pursuit of the crime often, embarrassingly, ends up at the
Communist Party's own door. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

   RUSSIA-PUTIN (Moscow) _ Acting President Vladimir Putin, in his
first interview with a Western news organization, said that Russia
must be a ``strong, powerful state'' that sheds confrontational
Cold War politics, avoids isolation from the West and remains
willing to seek ``more profound integration'' with NATO even by
joining it so long as Russia ``is regarded as an equal partner.''

   CHILE-PINOCHET (Santiago, Chile) _ President-elect Ricardo Lagos
has launched into a harsh public criticism of the hero's welcome
staged by the armed forces for Gen. Augusto Pinochet's return to
Chile last Friday _ kindling a controversy that is testing Lagos'
relationship with the still-powerful military less than a week
before he takes power. By Clifford Krauss.

   PARIS-GRAFFITI (Paris) _ Ten years ago, some of France's most
prominent politicians defending graffiti writers as artists of the
pop culture. One Paris museum even displayed a subway car covered
with graffiti, along with videos of young spray painters explaining
just how they do it. No more. These days, Parisians have had it
with this particular form of art. By Suzanne Daley.

<P>
   PAKISTAN-U.S. (Islamabad, Pakistan) _ The euphoria that greeted
a military coup here almost five months ago _ and the hope that a
no-nonsense general could quickly turn this corrupt, virtually
bankrupt country around _ have given way to a weary sense that
little has changed, and to fears that Pakistan could be drifting
toward more war with India. By Celia W. Dugger.

   ABANDONED-INFANTS (Calimesa, Calif.) _ Simple white crosses mark
the graves of 38 children buried in a cemetery here. Abandoned in
life, in death they were cared for by a stranger, Debi Faris, who
was so touched by the story of an infant found dead in a duffel bag
that she convinced the coroner to let her give the child a proper
burial. So began the Garden of Angels, a burial place for
unidentified abandoned children. Now Faris has become their
advocate in another way: She is pushing for legislation that would
offer legal protection to parents who abandon their babies in safe
places. By Barbara Whitaker.

   INTERNET-DOCTORS (Undated) _ Doctors and patients say the
Internet has profoundly changed their relationships. With an
estimated 100,000 medical Web sites, patients can look up any
disease, drug or medical condition in seconds. When a doctor so
much as mentions a possible diagnosis, many patients rush to their
computers to learn more about it. When a doctor suggests a drug,
patients go online to find its side effects. And when they arrive
at their doctor's office, more and more patients are bearing pages
of information printed from Web sites. By Gina Kolata.

   CUBAN-BOY (Miami) _ On the distant edges of the storm that has
whipped around Elian Gonzalez, another, similar child custody case
here has been quietly and quickly decided. In both cases, the
mothers of the children left a foreign country for sanctuary in the
United States without, allegedly, the fathers' knowledge, and in
both cases the fathers have demanded their sons' return. One,
2-year-old Khalil Shanti, of Jordan, has been ordered home. The
other, 6-year-old Elian, of Cuba, remains here. The difference, say
experts on immigration and Miami politics, is one of flags,
passions and power. By Rick Bragg.

they will also decide whether to make radical changes in the law
that would make California the strictest state in the nation on
juvenile crime and punishment. By Evelyn Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   GORE-BACKSTAGE (JACKSONVILLE, Fla.) _ Like all presidential
candidates, Al Gore accomplishes most of the work of running for
office offstage, out of the public view. He spends far less time
speechifying or debating his Democratic rival, Bill Bradley, than
he does on the phone massaging supporters. Or going over the
details that are only minor when you get them right. On a recent
campaign day, Gore allowed a reporter to watch the way he and his
top campaign aides spent a few of those hours in between public

   INTERNET-PAPER-USE (Undated) _ G. Christopher Hargett, president

used Mimeo.com, one of several new print-and-deliver companies, to
convert a 28-page black-and-white report from electronic form to
print, and to send three copies to an out-of-town client. It cost
around $30. ``I don't even know if it cost me more or less than
going to Kinko's, but it meant I didn't have to leave my desk,'' he
said. So much for the internet replacing paper with electrons.
Every study shows that e-mail, web pages and such are generating

make obsolete. By Claudia Deutsch.

   ECOMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ The E-Commerce column: Privacy
advocates were relieved last week when DoubleClick, Inc., the
Internet's biggest supplier of banner advertising, announced that
it would put a hold on its plan to link personal identities and
other information to anonymous data it collects about Internet
users. Some of DoubleClick's competitors were just as relieved. As
privacy groups and legislators began to look past DoubleClick and
into the broader business of companies that serve ads on behalf of
Web site publishers, those competitors had been bracing for more
intense scrutiny of their own data-gathering practices. By Bob

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LOU Savarese was wearing his cell phone Sunday, knowing that at any
minute his lawyer would be calling to say he had received a signed
contract from Mike Tyson, America's antihero.
</P>
<P>
   Having pretty much worn out his welcome in the colonies, Tyson
took his last fight to jolly old England, where the Brits, a
contrarian nation, embraced him. His match with Savarese is
scheduled for April 8 in Milan, Italy, where Lou is expected to
enjoy the home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about Italians,'' he reminds you, ``they are pretty
animated. At fights, they get excited like soccer fans. If they get
behind me, that would be a big plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Although everyone who opposes Tyson can expect his popularity to
rise, Savarese offers a contrast even sharper than usual. Big Lou
is a whistle-while-you-work kind of guy _ friendly, open,
unguarded, sensible.
</P>
<P>
   In the other corner is Iron Mike, who, if there was a quiz show
that had a category called ``Bad Choices,'' he would be a
multimillionaire. Oh, we forget, he is, or was, a multimillionaire.
When Tyson stopped to smell the flowers, the flowers wilted.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, Lou is trying to make the biggest leap in boxing, from
journeyman to headliner. Tyson is merely trying to live down his
reputation as a calamity waiting to happen, a tornado looking for a
trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy had it all,'' sums up Lou. ``He made $200 million,
literally, but it didn't make him happy. When he was with Cus
D'Amato and Jimmy Jacobs, they did a great job of marketing him. I
remember they took the press back to his old neighborhood and
showed him feeding the pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had every physical attribute, strength and speed. He was
tough-minded. He had endorsements and was doing well. Then he
signed with Don King, and everything went downhill. He had some
terrible people around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the guy still commands so much attention. You saw it in
London _ they sold out the arena in two days, and they compared him
to the Beatles, the crowds he drew in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   A true odd couple, the two won't need any introductions, but
they haven't exactly spent quality time chilling together. ``We run
in different circles,'' says Savarese, in what must qualify as a
major understatement. ``I run into him at fights; we say hello. I
followed his career because we're both from the same part of the
country. I went to a lot of his early fights in the Catskills.''
</P>
<P>
   Lou Savarese was part of a bold experiment that brought a wave
of young gladiators to Houston in the mid- to late 1980s. They were
recruited by Josephine Abercrombie, a lovely lady from a prominent
family who tried to bring to boxing a new system based on honesty,
trust and fair dealings.
</P>
<P>
   It was like trying to spray a dumpster with Air Wick. The
program didn't cause a sudden rush of wealthy idealists to the
sport, but Savarese was one of those who stayed. He has never had
it all, but he almost always had enough, while winning 39 fights
out of 42.
</P>
<P>
   He demolished Buster Douglas in one round, Tim Puller in two,
and scored a TKO over Buster Mathis Jr. in seven on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he spent most of his career waiting for the kind of
exposure he figures to get from his bout with Tyson, which will be
seen around the globe on Showtime. He lost a split decision in 1997
to George Foreman, who once employed him as a sparring partner.
Last summer he picked a bad night to have a letdown and lost to
Michael Grant in New York, but it was a nice payday, a million or
so, and Savarese has invested his money wisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came from a real humble family in upstate New York,'' he
confides. ``I'm living a dream now. It sounds corny, but it's true.
It's a terrible business, but I love boxing. I love the characters,
the craziness, the fact that it attracts all walks of life. You go
to Vegas, it's a whole different scene from the crowds at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a long line of hard-nosed guys, from a real
blue-collar town where everybody has a great work ethic. A lot of
my friends work in construction. I had a card in the plumbers'
union. When I walked by a construction site in New York, I'd start
jogging.''
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time he thought his way out of the 9-to-5 world
would be through baseball. At 6-5 and 240 pounds, he was a high
school outfielder who could run and hit with power, and the Mets
gave him a tryout. A prospect in the same camp was a future Atlanta
Braves shortstop named Walt Weiss, whose glove kept the Astros from
winning a playoff series in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had put the same dedication into baseball that I did in
boxing,'' says Savarese, ``I might have made it. But at 18, the
last thing a kid is thinking about is dedication.''

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
WACO _ Some people might think what Tevis Stukes has done this
season to turn around his basketball career is proof he could
overcome the biggest obstacle of his life. It isn't even close.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growing up in the projects in New Orleans taught Stukes some
hard lessons that were more important than basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in with a bad crowd as a kid,'' Stukes said. ``I
couldn't continue to hang with those people. With the path I was
on, I was going to end up one of two places _ in jail or in a
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Stukes, a 5-11 senior guard, will end his college career this
week as the leading scorer on a Baylor team from which he walked
away last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was through,'' Stukes said. ``I thought I was
gone. But most of my life, I've been in situations where I had to
make a choice. This time I made the right choice and took advantage
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Stukes was a junior-college transfer who left the
team at midseason after a disagreement with former Baylor coach
Harry Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people looked at me last year like I was a bad person
who didn't want to listen to anybody,'' Stukes said. ``That wasn't
the case. Coach Miller had no problems with me on the court. He
would tell me I was one of the hardest-working players he had on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing but respect for coach Miller. But I was having
problems at home, and then coach Miller and I started having
difficulties. It was better for me and the team to just walk away.
It was hard times for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Stukes left the team, but he didn't leave Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really understood the whole story and all the aspects
of the disagreement Tevis had last season,'' said Baylor coach Dave
Bliss, who was hired to replace Miller last spring. ``But the one
thing we admired that Tevis did was keep his eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's highly unusual. A lot of times they drop out of school
and go back home in a situation like that. Then they have no
opportunity. In Tevis' case, his clock would have run out before he
had a chance to play again. But he had the presence to stay in
school, and that comes from within. That speaks to me a great deal
about the type of person he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Stukes admits he came close to leaving, but he decided to stay
after talking to his mother, Dorothy, and meeting with Baylor
athletic director Tom Stanton and associate AD Jim Trego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked for my release papers from Mr. Stanton and Mr.
Trego,'' Stukes said. ``They told me they thought it was the wrong
thing for me to do, and I listened to them. I really didn't want to
leave. It was just the anger I had built up inside. I've had that
feeling before.''
</P>
<P>
   Stukes often had that feeling while growing up in the ghetto. He
admits that before he was a teen-ager he already was involved in
selling drugs to try to earn money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all you have around you at a young age is drugs, it's hard
to say no to that money,'' Stukes said. ``You want to make that
fast money, especially when you live in a single-parent home and
you are the youngest of four kids. I wanted a lot of things my mom
couldn't get for me, and that pushed me toward the streets. I fell
in that trap.''
</P>
<P>
   But basketball was the one good thing in Stukes' life. It was
clear early on that he had a gift for shooting. Coaches were
watching Stukes as a young teen-ager, along with forward Lester
Earl, both of whom were trying to overcome their environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lester and I have been playing basketball against each other
since we were 12 years old,'' Stukes said. ``Lester knows how rough
it was. There were times when we were supposed to play in
tournaments together but I couldn't go because I was in trouble.
The coach wouldn't take me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lester has seen the projects I grew up in. It was hard. Every
night somebody was dying, getting shot or going to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl, a senior at Kansas, has gone through a troubled college
career that began with a payoff scandal at LSU. Stukes might never
have made it to college if not for a decision by his mother to move
to Lake Charles, La., before Stukes' senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big turning point in my life,'' Stukes said. ``It
couldn't have come at a better time. She wanted me to get out of
the environment I was in. If we had not moved to Lake Charles, I
probably wouldn't be here right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Stukes is today would have been hard to imagine one year
ago. He ranks among the top five in scoring in the Big 12
Conference, averaging 17.8 points a game, and he leads the league
in 3-point shots made with 94.
</P>
<P>
   ``God gave me a talent to shoot, and he wants me to use it,''
Stukes said. ``So I try to give it all I have every time I step on
the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Most fans would say the weakness of his game is that Stukes
takes too many bad shots, which shows in his .362 shooting
percentage. But Bliss said Stukes' shot selection is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times Tevis is forced to take a bad shot because we
don't have other people to protect him,'' Bliss said. ``That causes
him to take some shots he doesn't need to take and makes his
percentage look lower than it normally would be. But I appreciate
the fact that he knows how much he's needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stukes has helped lead the Bears back to respectability with a
13-14 record going into the Big 12 tournament in Kansas City, Mo.
Baylor lost every conference game last season en route to a 6-24
mark. But the team won four league games this year and was
competitive in several others.

   ``Coach Bliss has a tremendous coaching philosophy, and all his
assistants know what they're doing,'' Stukes said. ``Coach Bliss is
going to turn this program around, believe me. He will have Ferrell
Center rocking in a couple of years. I just wish I had another year
to play with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss is happy he had Stukes around for his first year with the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cupboard here wasn't bare, but it certainly was thin,''
Bliss said. ``Tevis gave us something to work with. I marvel at how
he has improved through the course of the Big 12 season. He really
has picked up of late. The chance to coach him this year and watch
him improve has been very enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   Stukes knew that his second chance also would be his last chance
as a college player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to me to show people that I could take
advantage of my opportunity,'' Stukes said. ``Coach Bliss didn't
worry about what happened last year. He just wanted to know that I
still was interested in going to school here and playing basketball
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stukes said he wanted to show people more than his
basketball skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I showed everyone at this university that I wanted to
be here by staying in school and going to class,'' Stukes said. ``I
kept working out on my own and kept doing the things I needed to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of motivation because there were days when I
didn't want to get up and go to class, but I did it. I was
determined to show people I wasn't who they thought I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Stukes knows people saw him in an unfavorable light after what
happened last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People judge unfairly, but I've been dealing with that all my
life,'' he said. ``They see how I wear my chains, my earrings, my
gold teeth and my tattoos, and they think I'm a thug.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people who know me know I'm one of the most respectful
guys around here. I respect my elders. I want people here to say
that Tevis is a respectful young man who looked up to people and
never disrespected anybody. I want everyone to see that I took the
right path.''

<P>
   WILMINGTON, Ohio _ After the most tumultuous week of his
campaign, Sen. John McCain is still clinging to the hope that
Tuesday's critical set of primaries will give him some rationale to
keep his insurgency alive.
</P>
<P>
   For months, as the Arizona senator rose from being a small blip
on the political radar to a national phenomenon, McCain had
declared that the nomination battle would be decided on Tuesday,
when 13 states, including the powerhouses of New York and
California, vote in what amounts to a national primary.
</P>
<P>
   Now he says, ``I don't know if it's decisive or not,'' and
points to the mercurial and competitive nature of this season's
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had the momentum, we'd still be in the game,'' McCain
said on his campaign bus this weekend, where more and more of his
family and senior staff members are gathering for these critical
days of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But just what can count as momentum was the question facing the
campaign Sunday as it hopscotched frantically from rallies in New
York to Ohio to California. With an ever-more rebellious soundtrack
blaring behind him _ Sunday it was ``Born to Be Wild'' surging from
loudspeakers in an airport rally in Buffalo _ McCain continued to
assail Gov. George W. Bush of Texas over attack ads that were
financed by what he called ``Governor Bush's cronies.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush seemed to be playing it safe, promoting his
tax cut plan and his educational priorities in appearances from
Northern to Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's top advisers admit they have all but given up hope of
winning California's 162 Republican delegates, because of Bush's
strength among the state's Republicans. Instead, the McCain camp is
pulling for an alternative scenario that would allow him to claim a
mandate to carry his struggle for the Republican nomination further
into the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   It would start with sweeping New England, where 102 delegates
are chosen, and winning a clear majority of New York's 101
delegates. McCain's aides said he would also have to rack up a
decent number of delegates in Ohio _ whose primary is open to
Democrats or independents _ or a victory in the popular vote in
California, which would allow him to make the case with new force
that he would be his party's best candidate in November.
</P>
<P>
   Such a split decision in California is possible because the
primary is open to all parties, but the state's 162 delegates are
allotted based only on the Republican votes, and the winner gets
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain wins the popular vote in California and Bush loses
it, I think it destroys what final shred of credibility the
argument had that Bush can be elected president in the fall,'' said
Mike Murphy, McCain's senior strategist Sunday. ``We're getting to
the point now where a vote for Bush is a vote for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   But even his supporters concede that this whole scenario is a
long shot. With the exception of New England, the polls this
weekend showed Bush in the lead in most states _ no matter that
McCain scored such upsets as winning the endorsement of the five
daily newspapers in New York City and Long Island, which rarely
back the same candidate.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 days, McCain's always improvisational campaign
has lurched in contradictory fashion from tactic to tactic, trying
to find a way to victory. First, McCain tried to renew his appeal
to Republicans, linking himself to Ronald Reagan and imploring,
``Don't fear this campaign, my fellow Republicans _ join it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, he tacked again, taking a huge gamble with a
blistering speech that assailed two leaders of the Christian right,
Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, as ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was intended to energize moderates and independents
across the Northeast and the West Coast, but it gave the Republican
Party's social conservatives new incentive to vote against McCain.
It also left some of his supporters in the Christian right, like
Gary Bauer, in a terrible position. Terry Haskins, one of McCain's
co-chairmen in South Carolina, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the senator began attacking Bush over the
revelation that big financial backers of Bush had purchased $2.5
million worth of attack ads against him. McCain accused Bush of
running a ``shameful campaign'' and of taking the same path that
had led to President Clinton's fund-raising abuses four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's cronies in Texas are doing exactly what
President Clinton and Al Gore did in 1996,'' he thundered Sunday to
a crowd in Buffalo. ``It's a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides keep insisting that the senator won Michigan when
few thought a rebound from his South Carolina defeat was possible.
And the candidate himself has veered from steely optimism to black
humor. Asked what he might do if he lost the nomination, the former
prisoner of war said he was ``thinking about going back to Hanoi.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if McCain survives on Tuesday, the following Tuesday brings
primaries in Bush's home state of Texas and in Florida, where
Bush's brother Jeb is governor. Beyond trying to win some delegates
in Florida, McCain's aides say they would seek to minimize the
importance of that primary and turn their attention to Illinois,
which votes on March 21, and is another open contest not limited to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The confounding problem for McCain is the dynamic that started
setting in in South Carolina and was firmly established y when he
lost Virginia, North Dakota and Washington state last week. The
senator has not been able to rally a majority of Republicans in any
state, and instead has become the candidate of a third force in
politics made up of moderate Republicans, independents and
conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCain still draws huge crowds. More than 1,000 people poured
into a town hall meeting in Syracuse to see him late Saturday
afternoon, and more than 2,000 came to see him in Cleveland on
Sunday. But some of the questions from the audience on Saturday
captured the peculiar problem facing this son of Arizona who still
insists that he is a ``proud Reagan conservative.''.
</P>
<P>
   One woman told him she wanted him to be president. Then she
started to cry as she said that Reagan had cut disability benefits
and brought wrenching pain to her family and disabled father.
Sobbing, she implored McCain, ``I wish you wouldn't have to lump
yourself in with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Whole sections of the audience applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later another woman rose and confessed she was a
registered Democrat. She begged the senator to win the Republican
nomination because he was the man she wanted to vote for in
November. She also said she was nervous, being surrounded by so
many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have any Republican friends?'' McCain asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ex-husband,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This is the conundrum that has sent the McCain campaign on its
starkly different tacks over the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   His aides still insist that his speech attacking Robertson and
Falwell was not a mistake, but that it was a moment when the
seat-of-the-pants nature of their campaign _ sometimes its strength
_ worked against them. McCain did not do enough beforehand to lay
the groundwork for the speech, they say. Nor did he make clear
enough that he saw a distinction between the Christian right
leaders and rank-and-file social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   He compounded the problem the next day when, in talking to
reporters on his bus, called the two men ``forces of evil.'' With
his campaign in turmoil he apologized and said he had been joking.
</P>
<P>
   Because the McCain staff is small and made up of people who
enjoy rocking the Republican establishment, it has largely been a
cohesive, even playful group. But last week, the divisions and
backbiting that are usually signs of a losing campaign began to
show.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain decided to skip a debate in California, his
communications director, Daniel Schnur, publicly denounced the
decision as a mistake. Other senior aides told reporters that
Schnur had been fired. McCain himself summoned Schnur and told him
he was not, but he was clearly isolated within the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's revelation that big campaign contributors to Bush
had spent $2.5 million for attack advertisements against the
senator has brought McCain full circle to his original theme of
cleaning up the campaign finance system. Pointing to the
advertisements, McCain told a crowd in Buffalo: It's not the kind
of politics we will accept in New York, Ohio and California. Go
back. Go back to Texas with your dirty money.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain promised Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that he would
support Bush should he become the Republican nominee, but he added
a proviso. ``I expect Governor Bush to change,'' he said. ``I
expect him to run a different kind of campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked on his campaign bus Saturday whether he still considered
the governor a friend, he lapsed into a long and telling silence,
then spat out, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   A little later he volunteered: ``I didn't say I'd talk to him.
There are all kinds of friends in this world.''

HISPANIC VOTE (undated) _ John McCain's inability to speak Spanish
does not automatically mean that George W. Bush's comparative
fluency in the language will give him a decisive edge on Super
Tuesday, according to those who follow Latino politics. ``Speaking
Spanish is an important symbolism,'' said Arturo Vargas, executive
director of the National Association of Latino Elected and
Appointed Officials, a group that monitors elections. ``But Latinos
know it is just symbolism. We want substance.'' By ELVIA DIAZ.

AFTER SLUMP, RICE HEATS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Glen Rice didn't hide his frustration. He had
sputtered on offense for three consecutive games and set out to
stop the trend quickly Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long, as Rice made 5 of 7 shots for 13 points in
the first quarter against his former team, the Miami Heat. He
finished with 23 points, nearly matching his total for the prior
three games combined (27 points).
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether or not we're winning, I always get down
when I go out there and I don't play up to my potential,'' Rice
said.
</P>
<P>
   He's found his groove in the Los Angeles Lakers' triangle
offense at times, only to see it periodically slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does at times,'' he said, ``but I can't let that happen.
I've got to go out there and just play basketball. I can't worry
about anything but going out there and doing my job. I'm always
putting a lot of pressure on myself when I'm not going out there
and playing up to my capabilities and not hitting the shots that I
know I can hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you're thankful that you have guys like Shaq
(O'Neal), Kobe (Bryant), Robert (Horry) and those guys playing very
well, where the slack has been taken up. And I owe it to myself to
go out there and play the way I know I'm capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said he saw the resurgence coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen told me before the game, he said, `Yo, Kobe, I'm ready to
go, man.' So I knew he was going to come out and do his thing,''
Bryant said. ``He was just able to find his spots a little bit
better. I think he's just starting to get his rhythm back in this
offense a little bit. It's on him to be more aggressive, not to be
as passive as he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Foul mood: Miami's Tim Hardaway was impressed by the Lakers
after the Heat's 93-80 loss, but he said they had help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the referees are scared to call fouls against them,''
Hardaway said after the Heat was called for 29 fouls to the Lakers'
22. ``I think they're afraid of the Lakers and (coach) Phil
Jackson. As a team, we feel we don't get calls as an elite team. We
feel that the referees hate us and we have to overcome every game.
... I'm not saying they're not a good team, but give us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had a different take: ``I think the league, they owe me
those calls. I admit I got away with one or two. Shoot, I'm
supposed to. I'm at home. If I'm on the road, I expect not to get
those calls. ... Like I said, the league owes me those calls. I get
fouled every time down, period, no questions asked.''

Santa Clara in the semifinals of the West Coast Conference
tournament Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves, the WCC regular-season champions, move into tonight's
final against Gonzaga, an 80-70 winner over San Diego in the
earlier game. Pepperdine (24-7) split its two games against the
Bulldogs this year.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament champion gets an automatic bid to the NCAA
Tournament. Last season, Gonzaga won the WCC title and advanced to
the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   Archie missed two free throws with six seconds left after Santa
Clara's Darrell Teat missed on a 3-pointer seconds before. But
Broncos guard Brian Vaka misfired on a last-second 3-pointer to
give the Waves the win.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Armstrong had 15 points for Pepperdine while Tommie
Prince added 13.
</P>
<P>
   Prince put the Waves ahead 56-55 with 43 seconds left on a pair
of free throws. On Santa Clara's next possession, Nick Sheppard
stepped in front of Teat to force a charging call, giving the ball
back to Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves led 47-41 with six minutes left, but Santa Clara
(19-12) chipped away, outscoring the Waves 13-5 over the next four
minutes to go ahead 54-52 on Nathan Fast's steal and breakaway dunk
with 2:16 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine survived a sloppy start to lead 28-24 at halftime.
The Broncos scored the first six points of the game and led 20-12
at one point.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse, but the Waves' defense, a strength all
year, kept things close.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine got it rolling over the last seven minutes, forcing
11 consecutive Santa Clara misses to spark an 11-0 run to go ahead
23-20.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had seven points at the half to lead Pepperdine. Lewis
added six.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, who shot 36.7 percent from the field, got 10 points
from Jaime Fields.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves won both meetings against Santa Clara during the
regular season, limiting the Broncos to 59.2 points per game on
just 39 percent shooting from the floor.

DUCKS HOLD ON FOR VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Mighty Ducks' offense generated
little more than hockey's version of a passed ball Sunday night,
but that was plenty as Guy Hebert pitched a shutout and Anaheim
defeated Nashville 1-0 in front of 13,601 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert stopped all 33 shots he faced, and Johann Davidsson, a
forgotten man in Cincinnati most of the year, scored on a
harmless-looking wrist shot at 17:10 of the second period to help
the Ducks end a losing streak at two games.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly artistic, but Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg dared
anybody to put an ugly face on a victory that moved the Ducks
(28-29-10-1) within two points of Calgary and San Jose in the
battle for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't like the game?'' he said when asked if the Ducks
were happy to just win and move on. ``We just came off a tough week
(1-2 on a three-game trip) and our team showed some character. It
found a way to win and that's all that mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of two periods it didn't look as if either
team was going to find the back of the net. Both Hebert and
Nashville goalie Tomas Vokun were solid, if not spectacular.
Quality scoring chances were rare.
</P>
<P>
   But finally the Ducks broke through with a goal from an unlikely
source on an unlikely play.
</P>
<P>
   Davidsson, recalled from Cincinnati on Saturday, took advantage
of solid forechecking by Mike Leclerc and Ladislav Kohn and decided
to wrist a shot toward the Nashville net. The puck got through a
maze of players in front of Vokun, including Leclerc, and dipped
between the Nashville goalie's legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was the result of good pressure,'' said Hartsburg.
``And in these types of games those are usually the type that
decide them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had seen plenty of those goals go against them this
season, so they were thrilled to get one going their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed somebody to be lucky and I was the lucky guy,'' said
Davidsson, who has spent the majority of the year in the minors
after playing the entire 1998-99 season in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth goal of Davidsson's brief NHL career (69 games)
seemed to surprise the Swedish forward as much as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `Oh my God, I think it's going,''' he said with a big
smile. ``It's funny how things work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert also had a big smile after posting his fourth shutout of
the season and first since Dec. 17, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `He (Vokun) is never seeing that one,''' said Hebert of
Davidsson's shot. ``There's no sympathy at all. I was thinking `All
right, that might be enough to win this game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And it was, thanks to Hebert, who was especially sharp in the
early moments of the first and second periods. He stopped three
shots from close range at the 30-second mark of the second period,
but perhaps the biggest saves he made came in the opening 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim goalie stopped 14 Nashville shots, including three
in succession early in the game. After stopping Mark Mowers twice
from the base of the left circle, Hebert slid across the crease to
deny Tom Fitzgerald's bid from the right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working hard on that, trying to beat the pass to
player,'' said Hebert, referring to his recent workouts with goalie
consultant Francois Allaire. ``That (the saves) set me into a good
rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert now wants to see the entire team get into a good rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win more than our fair share of the last 15 to make
(the playoffs,'' he said. ``There's going to be a lot of scoreboard
watching over the next few weeks, but if we take care of business
we won't have to watch as much.''

NORTHRIDGE HOPES PARRIS WILL RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When they needed a big basket, he was there. A big
rebound, he was there. A hustle play? Jeff Parris was there.
</P>
<P>
   Parris almost single-handedly kept the Cal State Northridge
men's basketball team from a potentially embarrassing loss Saturday
night against Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 23 points, grabbed 10 rebounds (including six
offensive) and had four steals as the Matadors closed out their
most successful season in Division I with an 81-57 win over the
Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Parris keyed a late 20-0 run with offensive rebounds, slam dunks
and put-backs. He also was 9 of 13 from the free-throw line in the
game, well above his 55 percent season average.
</P>
<P>
   The CSUN coaches and players hope they haven't seen the last of
Parris at Matador Gym.
</P>
<P>
   Parris is a senior, but he's played only three seasons in
Northridge; he lost his freshman season as a non-academic
qualifier. Through academic achievement - Parris is going to
graduate in May with a degree in psychology - he's earned the right
to be granted an additional season of eligibility by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate anything different than (Parris) coming
back,'' CSUN coach Bobby Braswell said. ``I know his parents want
him back (playing). He came in here and he got his degree in four
years. I'm very, very proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the game, Parris was included in a tribute to the
team's senior class, which included Andre Larry and Hewitt Rolle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to talk it over with my close friends and family
members and my coaches and see what I can do,'' he said. ``I had a
good career here. Just in case I didn't come back, I wanted to have
that senior night experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it ...: Montana's 77-75 upset of Eastern
Washington on Saturday night meant both the Big Sky Conference
men's and women's tournaments will be held in Missoula.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, the Big Sky announced a rough sketch of
this week's tournament schedule. Four games will be played
Wednesday the two men's and women's quarterfinals. The fifth-seeded
Northridge men (18-9, 10-6) play fourth-seeded Weber State in the
final game of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Matadors women (17-9, 11-5) play one of the
quarterfinal winners Thursday in the women's semifinals. The men's
semifinals are Friday and both championship games are Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Flying high: Four CSUN track and field athletes - Brandi Prieto,
Annetta Wells, Clinte Motley and Billy Bush - competed Friday and
Saturday in the prestigious USA Indoor Nationals at the Georgia
Dome in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a CSUN assistant coach - Dominique Arnold - who had
the best meet. Arnold was nipped at the wire by South Carolina's
Terrence Trammell in the 60-meter hurdles final. Both men had the
same time: 7.57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a senior at Northridge, was fifth in the shot put with a
mark of 60 feet, 1 inches. He won the Big Sky indoor title with a
throw of 61-9, qualifying him provisionally for the NCAA indoor
championships this week in Fayetteville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Prieto, a senior, was eighth in the women's triple jump with a
mark of 41 feet, 11 inches. She's a provisional NCAA indoor
qualifier in both the triple jump (42-7) and the 55-meter hurdles
(7.95).
</P>
<P>
   Wells, a junior, competed but didn't qualify for the 200 and 400
finals. She won both events - the 200 in 24:32 and the 400 in 54.67
- at the Big Sky indoor meet.
</P>
<P>
   Motley, a junior, competed in the triple jump but didn't make
the final. He was the conference champion with a mark of 52-9.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, Motley and Jennifer Capeheart, who won the Big Sky pole
vault with a mark of 11-11, are all provisional qualifiers for the
NCAA championships.
</P>
<P>
   Losing bodies: Three offensive linemen quit the football team in
February, including Joe Bergman, a sophomore who started the
Matadors' first two games before injuries ended his season.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, a 6-foot-5, 290-pound guard from Bakersfield, had a
concussion and torn ACL last year. Another guard, sophomore Geoff
Watson (6-3, 285) also quit, as did Ernie Fierro (6-4, 300), one of
CSUN's top transfers last year.

   LOS ANGELES _ A punishment that Major League Baseball
commissioner Bud Selig failed to sock to Atlanta Braves pitcher
John Rocker - a one-month regular-season suspension was cut in half
by an arbitrator - has not only been upheld by an on-line fantasy
league but taken further.
</P>
<P>
   FantasySportsnet.com has suspended Rocker for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Company CEO Darrell C. Lerner, however, said they would review
Rocker's situation before the All-Star break, and ``if there have
been no further transgressions, and his ERA is below 3.00 and he's
accumulated 15 saves, he might be reinstated for selection by FSN
subscribers.''
</P>
<P>
   Way to take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, a statement released by the New York-based site
noted: ``The announcement was made in a blatantly transparent
attempt to gain publicity for the new Web venture.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider it done.
</P>
<P>
   --Although it deals mostly with selling trading cards and
autographed stuff, a site called RealLegends.com has added a spot
for new books and movies for sale.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not buying, you can at least see pretty much every
trading card produced since 1948.
</P>

   --With a Java chessboard to illustrate all the right moves, the
U.S. Chess Federation site (www.uschess.org) is offering members
coverage of the Linares 2000 Super Tournament, which is referred to
as the unofficial world championship. It runs through Saturday.

BOURQUE DEAL COULD COME TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ Ray Bourque wasn't at practice Sunday at the
Ristuccia Center but his future employment status was the only
subject on anyone's mind nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins captain, who has asked to be traded, was home
awaiting word on what club he would be moving to after nearly 21
years in black and gold. One thing seems certain, he's played his
last game in a Bruins uniform. The club hosts Ottawa at the
FleetCenter Monday night but president/general manager Harry Sinden
said he didn't see the sense in Bourque being in the lineup given
the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said it might be better if you don't,'' said Sinden,
who spoke with Bourque Sunday. ``You have to really take into
account injury because he won't get what he wants, the team that
wants him won't get what they want, and we won't get anything,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   It's likely Bourque and the Bruins will see a resolution soon,
perhaps as early as this morning. Sinden said they were awaiting a
proposal from one of the teams in the running for Bourque's
services. Once that comes in, it's going to be a short time before
his fate is decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of teams who have expressed an interest,''
said Sinden. ``They all haven't checked in with their voting
returns. We've told them we'd wait until they had an equal chance
at this and we're going to do that. We're close, there's only one
team left. We've heard from all the others. We have to hear from
this team because we said we wouldn't do anything until we heard
from all the teams who had expressed an interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the field, as of Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, hadn't narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention is to get back to all of them with a
counterproposal and they may or may not accept our counterproposal
and we won't go any further than that,'' he said. ``We'll take all
the final proposals and put them together and determine what we
should do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said it hasn't gotten to the point where the Bruins are
making demands. It's at the stage where teams are telling him what
they're willing to part with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked about anything, we've just taken what they
think they can live with,'' he said. ``We haven't come back to any
of them. We're going to put (other teams' proposals) side by side
and we're going to go back to them and say, `Would you go a little
further?' They might say no and I understand. We'll just keep them
where they are right now and another club might move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the sticky wicket is balancing the interests of
Bourque as well as the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get the best deal for the Bruins while keeping Ray
in mind,'' said Sinden, who added that Bourque only wants to go to
a legitimate Cup contender. ``The worst playoff team in the bunch
could win the Stanley Cup so you don't know for sure but you have
to start somewhere. It seems to me that all he wants is to have a
chance with a Stanley Cup team, that's what he keeps telling
everybody. We're going to try to keep it limited to that. A team
that's eighth or 10th in the standings right now maybe could win
the Stanley Cup but we don't think they can and neither does Ray
and we're not going to bother talking to them. We're going to limit
it to the top half-dozen or so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Flyers, believed to have the inside track, are
awaiting a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to Boston,'' said Flyers general manager Bob Clarke.
``They're committed to trading him. We're interested in him but
it's up to Harry right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a trying time for everyone involved, not just Bourque.
Sinden said it's been awfully hard to do this, given his history
with the player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been preparing myself for it whether he retired or not,''
said Sinden. ``You know, retirement, life without Ray. It just came
upon me a little bit earlier. I'm not very happy about the
prospects of seeing him in another uniform, I'll tell you that. Not
at all, but hey, it's what might satisfy him to have a run at it
and for that reason, why not? I just won't watch the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it may be a better solution for me to see him get a
shot at something than retire and just say, `Well, I'll go home
now.' All the teams we're talking to are bona fide contenders. That
seems to be all he wants. They all have a good chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bourque departing, it will mean a shift in leadership with
that role going to the next generation of NHL players.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jason Allison, who is out for the season because of
tendon transplant surgery on his right wrist, said he believes the
changing of the guard will be a very positive one for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the leadership role on this team has got to change
even if he were to leave at the end of the year,'' said Allison,
referring to talk of Bourque's likely retirement were he to have
stayed on in Boston. ``Next year, it's going to have to be a lot of
guys stepping up. It can't be one guy or two guys. It's got to be
more of a group leadership effort. I think that's good, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said with Bourque such a dominant presence, it was
difficult for the young players to make their mark in terms of
leadership. He said it was no knock on Bourque, it was just a fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put everything on my shoulders or Kyle (McLaren) or
Anson (Carter) or Joe (Thornton),'' said Allison. ``It's going to
have to be seven or eight guys. I think that's a little something
we lacked this year, to be honest with you. I think that's been our
problem this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray has obviously been the guy he's been and there's been this
gap between him and the younger guys. Sometimes it's hard to feel
comfortable being in that role because of his stature, standing up
and saying stuff or trying to take control of a situation. It's
tough for a young guy with Ray around. Not that Ray makes it tough,
he actually tries to help if you say something, he tries to
reiterate what you're saying and help you out. It's still a tough
situation, especially when you're not winning and everything is not
going well and you don't think you're playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said everyone in the dressing room understands why
Bourque is doing what he's doing. He said they all know that if the
Bruins had a chance at making the playoffs, Bourque would still be
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're in a playoff spot, there's no way he goes somewhere
else to win a championship,'' said Allison. ``He wouldn't leave and
I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching this team from the press box, he said it isn't really
the Bruins' team it was supposed to be either in terms of results
or personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally understand if he does want to go,'' said Allison.
``What's he going to do here? He's not going to have fun. The team
is not really our team right now. There are a lot of guys who were
never here that are playing a ton. Obviously, it's got to be
depressing and not a very happy situation for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he goes somewhere, he'll get a second life and be excited
again and not have to be the guy every night and win something.
That's great for him. That would be an awesome thing. I just think
we were close to be able to do something this year and one thing
after the other kind of tore it apart and tore everybody on this
team apart.''

BRUINS WANT VALUE FOR ICON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The shopping of Ray Bourque continued Sunday, with
sources here and around the league believing with each passing hour
that the Bruins captain will be traded to the Flyers sometime this
week _ perhaps as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   From the Bruins' side, it all comes down to value. They don't
want to swap their 39-year-old icon for anything less than a young
player, and probably a draft pick who has a strong chance of
developing into a true NHL contributor as well.
</P>
<P>
   From Bourque's side, it comes down to balancing opportunity
(i.e. a reasonable chance to win a Cup) with lifestyle, making sure
that a life-altering move at this point of his career not only
satisfies his Stanley Cup aspirations, but also fits comfortably
for everyone in his family.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing geography and opportunity doesn't necessarily mean
Bourque will be in Philly, but failing an 11th-hour bid from, say,
the Devils, this marriage of Bourque and opportunity appears
destined for the First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   A source connected with the Flyers organization said Sunday that
the Bruins over the weekend provided Philly GM Bob Clarke with a
list of players they would consider in a Bourque swap. It was then
left for Clarke and his management team to cross any names off that
list they were unwilling to sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   The first name removed, said the source, was Simon Gagne, the
speedy 20-year-old pivot whom the Flyers believe could develop into
a superstar. The Bruins also listed 18-year-old goalie Maxime
Ouellet, a standout on the recent Canadian national junior squad.
The source was not sure if Ouellet, the 22d pick overall in last
June's draft, remained on the list that Clarke returned to Boston
boss Harry Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   However, the source confirmed that the Flyers did not cross off
21-year-old Mark Eaton, a 6-foot-3-inch defenseman who signed with
the team as a free agent in the summer of '98, following his
freshman year playing for ex-Bruin Dave Poulin at Notre Dame.
Eaton, now with the Philly Phantoms (AHL), is skilled, but some
scouts question whether he can stand up to the day-to-day banging
that comes with the position.
</P>
<P>
   Another source said that Detroit, the other club keenly
interested in acquiring Bourque, has offered Mathieu Dandenault, a
24-year-old who already has his name on two Stanley Cups with the
Winged Wheels. Dandenault, the 49th pick in the '94 draft, has
spent most of his five seasons in Detroit flipping between right
wing and defense, depending on a number of things, including the
injury list and coach Scott Bowman's mood.
</P>
<P>
   According to the source, the Wings also would send 21-year-old
defenseman Jesse Wallin to the Bruins. A former first-round pick
(No. 26, '96), the 6-2 Wallin projects as a top four defenseman.
Wallin is now a second-year pro, playing for Cincinnati (AHL).
</P>
<P>
   The key to something getting done here quickly could be Ouellet,
the Flyers' sensational netminding prospect. He was nothing short
of dazzling in the World Junior Tournament over the holidays, his
play the only reason Canada was able to salvage a bronze medal. A
Quebec kid whose style mirrors Patrick Roy's butterfly stops,
Ouellet takes the job seriously, arriving at the arena three or
four hours before faceoff, psyching himself up for the game.
</P>
<P>
   If the Flyers are willing to throw him into the deal, Bourque
almost certainly will be a Broad Streeter. He's exactly the kind of
prospect the Bruins need to acquire in a swap of this magnitude, a
kid with true potential to be a No. 1 goalie. Junior hockey and the
minor professional leagues are littered with sure shots, the
overwhelming percentage of whom never see the NHL, but Ouellet is
widely considered many cuts above the mere wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   A move to Philadelphia would reunite Bourque with ex-Bruin Wayne
Cashman, the failed head coach who is now assisting Craig Ramsey
behind the bench, and Reggie Lemelin, the club's goaltending
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   A move to Detroit could be a better chance to win a Cup. Bourque
would be surrounded by a much more skilled defense. But he would be
that many more miles away from his new home here in the 'burbs _
just being completed _ and he wouldn't have ex-Black 'n' Gold
brothers Cashman and Lemelin by his side.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Freyer, Bourque's longtime friend and agent, said the
player is now eager to find out his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me,'' said Freyer, adding that Bourque would not be
available to the media, ``that he's anxious to find out the answer,
whatever's going to happen. His words to me were, `Let's get it
done.' ''

SKINNER STILL BELIEVES BC CAN REACH HEIGHTS? 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-SKINNER-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two bookcases sit behind Al Skinner's desk in his
second-floor office at Boston College's Conte Forum.
</P>
<P>
   One has the usual assortment of pictures, basketballs, and
memorabilia. The other is virtually empty, unusual for a coach
finishing up his third season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got some old stuff (from his days at Rhode Island),''
Skinner says with a soft laugh. ``But I will be patient and wait.
And hopefully there will be enough new stuff to fill those shelves.
That's a little goal for myself: To fill it up with all BC stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearing what could be the final game of the 1999-2000 season _
the 13th-seeded Eagles will face fourth seed Connecticut Wednesday
in an opening-round Big East tournament game _ Skinner was talking
about the past, present, and future of BC basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Eagles' 11-17 record this season, coupled with
the 15-16 and 6-21 marks of the two previous campaigns, Skinner, in
charge of rebuilding the Eagles program, was remarkably upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, we're ahead of schedule,'' said Skinner, who
never had had three consecutive losing seasons. ``I didn't think
this was going to happen until next year or the year after.''
</P>
<P>
   A strange statement from a coach whose team lost 14 of its last
16 games, although Saturday night's win over Villanova made Skinner
happy entering the contest against UConn.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner considers games as more than wins and losses. He
measures progress in effort, competitiveness, hustle. He has little
choice, of course.
</P>
<P>
   He is in a marathon, not a sprint, three years into a seven-year
contract. He believes it may take that long before the Eagles reach
the goal of being truly competitive in the Big East, and thus
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   To understand where Skinner and BC want to travel, you have to
understand where they have been.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, who grew up in New York, attended the University of
Massachusetts, played two seasons in the American Basketball
Association and three in the National Basketball Association before
starting a coaching career that included nine seasons and four
postseason appearances at Rhode Island, believes he is in the right
place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   He may also be the perfect person to guide BC after the NCAA
Tournament-quality program that Jim O'Brien spent a decade building
was ruined when O'Brien left in a swirl of acrimony and discord
over admissions standards.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner's public demeanor suggests calmness. He is a players'
coach, with patience.
</P>
<P>
   His troops have noticed. ``It's like my dad told me,'' said
senior Michael Cotton, who has watched Skinner deal with the early
stages of rebuilding. ``The best ability is dependability. That's
him. He lets you play, lets you be yourself. It's never too high,
never too low.''
</P>
<P>
   That belies what churns inside, however. ``Al plays in these
pickup games at lunchtime,'' says associate head coach Tim O'Shea
with a laugh and a shake of his head. ``And he's got that killer
instinct. It's like he still playing for a paycheck. When it comes
down to crunch time, it doesn't matter who he's playing _ teachers,
the postman, his mother _ he'll go after you.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner doesn't deny his competitiveness. He says it is part of
his upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out of New York,'' he says. ``I wasn't even close to
being one of the best players. All I knew was that I wanted to
compete and if I wasn't good enough, I had to work at it. So that's
what I did on a daily basis. I worked to get myself better. If I'm
not good enough right now, it's up to me to take that energy and
work and get myself better. That's what I try and relate to my
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet a man must know his limitations and Skinner understands that
the dawn-to-midnight schedule some coaches of losing programs might
follow during the season is not his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take it home,'' he says. ``That's the one thing I
don't do. If I need to do work, I do it here. Once I arrive home,
that's for my family. It would be unfair for them for me to bring
my woes home.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for me it has to be on a daily basis. I go home and have
some quality time with my family. If I don't, I'm not living the
quality of life I want.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to work at my best every day. My biggest goal is how I
can work at that every day. It's a known fact that you need a
certain amount of rest. You need certain peace of mind. Some guys
get too overworked and they can't give their best. If you're tired
and stressed out, you can't think clearly and the mental part of
this game is probably the most important.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coming from Rhode Island, where Skinner built a team that came
within a heartbeat of reaching the Final Four in the season after
he left, to Boston College, was a mental challenge of the first
order.
</P>
<P>
   How not only to rebuild a program, but the reputation of a
school that had been battered by not only changes in coaching, but
of a betting scandal in football, muted references to racism in the
academic process, and total chaos in the athletic department until
athletic director Gene DeFilippo came in. He figuratively opened
some windows that allowed fresh air to flow through the department
and let people feel good about their jobs and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a difficult job,'' said Skinner. ``The
academic requirements and reputation of this school will always
make it that way. The pool of student athletes to draw from is much
smaller than what I could draw from at Rhode Island.''
</P>
<P>
   There is more. ``Let's face it,'' he said. ``The city of Boston
has had its share of problems as far as minority students are
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my first year here. I spoke to a couple of key
people on the West Coast. All they could remember was the Boston of
the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dealing with guys my age whose sons are playing. They
said, `Al, you're a good guy. But Boston?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner acknowledges the changes in attitude, which have
resulted in people like former Celtics great Bill Russell coming
back and embracing the city again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize the evolution the city has made,'' he said. ``But
that still lingers. Those are the things you deal with. It's not
just BC. But the city of Boston has to take some responsibility for
what exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner remembers a year ago going hard after a player who lived
in Alabama. ``We brought him in here and he loved the place,'' said
Skinner. ``But his dad says, `I can't see my son in Boston.' What
are you going to do about those things? You get a kid to say yes,
and his dad says what he said. Those are the realities you deal
with.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that type of thinking that Skinner says has kept BC behind
Big East schools such as Rutgers and Seton Hall, who also made
coaching changes three years ago but are much farther along in the
rebuilding process than the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner says he is looking for the right attitude as much as
ability. ``As long as I know I'm working hard at it and my players
are working hard at it, I have to take some satisfaction. All I ask
is that they give 100 percent. I don't believe in that 110 percent.
That's non-existent. I believe in the work ethic, as corny as that
is. I have certain beliefs that drive me. I'm not saying I don't
get sidetracked. But eventually I come back and keep my eye on the
prize. That is who I am. I ask this of my players. You have to play
with passion, with desire. That's the only way I know how to
play.'''
</P>
<P>
   His players playing or practicing without passion raises
Skinner's temperature gauge to a dangerous level. ``If he's going
to lose it,'' says O'Shea, who has been with Skinner for 12
seasons, ``someone is going down. People are scared. He has trouble
with people who don't play aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skinner and his staff face the same hurdles that O'Brien and his
staff faced. He is required to compete at the Big East level, but
also bring in players who can also be successful students.
</P>
<P>
   It is a delicate balance. ``The last thing I want to do is bring
in someone and have him not succeed,'' Skinner said. ``I think
that's very unfair. I have a sense of responsibility for that. The
people I bring in have to have a certain amount of academic
success. It doesn't always mean graduate. But it does mean having
some achievement. I don't want people playing for me that don't
have a commitment to that.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, it's a hollow feeling for me because I don't
enjoy it because I feel like I have taken advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner says the foundation is in place. Guard Troy Bell, a
leading contender for Big East Freshman of the Year, and forward
Uka Agbai could be the starting point.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago players of that caliber wouldn't even listen to
Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting into homes now and people are allowing us to
sit down and talk to them and let us tell them how they can help
make us better,'' he said. ``I don't think we could have done that
two years ago or a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we're making progress. Unfortunately it may not show up
on the scoreboard. But I know the hurdles we had to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to reach a certain level where at least I have a
chance to see if I can do what I'm paid to do and to do it well. I
have in the past. But that's the past. We're looking ahead to the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Skinner will have a couple of more years to
fix what is broken.
</P>
<P>
   When he came from Rhode Island he knew what he faced and how
long it would take to make it right. He asked for the seven-year
contract. ``I don't think anyone has accused me of being stupid,''
Skinner said. ``I know it's going to take some time. I also know
how to build a program.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeFilippo says he is more than willing to give Skinner the time
because he has liked what he has seen thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a coach,'' DeFilippo says. ``I know what it takes to
win, to build a program. At the end of five years, we'll know
better and he'll know better which direction this program is going.
I think Al is doing the right things. He's a wonderful person, a
great role model, and a heck of bench coach. I have all the
confidence in the world that he is going to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner has survived this season with what appears to be a
minimum of wear. Aside from the losing, he says things are just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few brushfires have broken out _ the latest being the
persistent rumor that Bell was unhappy and wanted to head back home
to Minnesota. Bell and Skinner say those rumors are without
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says no,'' said Skinner. ``But more important, his attitude
says no. He wasn't playing (before a recent season-ending knee
injury) like he wanted to get out of here. And he said he didn't. I
don't know many young people who can be that dishonest. When they
get to the professional level, yeah, they can be. But at this level
they haven't learned that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner says small steps need to come before big steps, but
there is no doubt in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in BC, I believe in the city,'' said Skinner. ``I
know where I want to go; I know what I want to accomplish. I have
my eye on the prize.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize is to make BC competitive in the Big East and
nationally. The prize is to restore respect to the program.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more than that for Al Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run,'' he says, ``relationships are the most
important thing. That's what it's all about for me in this
business. I still want to compete at the highest level. It
motivates me and drives me. But it's still about the relationships
I develop here with my players. In order for me to develop those, a
young person has to have some kind of success here. I have to
create an environment that's going to do that, both athletically
and academically. And that's what I'm trying to do.''

PITINO ADMITS HE COULD ENVISION LEAVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rick Pitino said he wasted no gray matter wondering
what kind of reaction he'd get Sunday at the FleetCenter. It was
his first home game since his memorable postgame rant five days
ago, but he said he didn't even think about how the crowd would
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, no,'' he said when asked if he thought about what
might happen in the building. Nothing much did. There was very
little cheering or booing when his name was announced before the
Celtics' 97-91 victory over the Orlando Magic in a festive
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   There was hardly any ``negativity'' whatsoever all game, just
some scattered boos when the Celtics missed their first 14 shots.
Then again, this was a matinee with a PG crowd more suited for
``Toy Story 2'' or ``My Dog Skip.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino expressed satisfaction with the crowd. ``Very few teams
are going to beat us with this type of atmosphere,'' he said. His
comments last Wednesday, he said, were directed at ``very few
people, probably less than 100 people. Because the people that
didn't like what I said, the guilty conscience needs no accuser.
They are negative people. People who are positive people, cheering
the hell out of the Celtics, that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   He then addressed comments attributed to him in Sunday's New
York Daily News. In the article, Pitino said he would leave at the
end of next season if things did not improve and gladly step aside
for Larry Bird if that's what he thought was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can go one more year and be realistic and say, `I'm
not getting it done,' and go out and hire somebody else,'' Pitino
said in the story. ``At that point, I might have to.'' He also
said, ``At the end of next season, I can say, `I gave it my best
shot' and move on and get somebody else to coach this team. Or, I
can decide to break this team up and rebuild, which I don't see
myself doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about those remarks Sunday, Pitino said he did not put any
time limit on his stay in Boston. But he did say that he would
remove himself from the equation if he saw things were not
improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was basically saying was, that if I'm not getting the
job done in my mind, then I'm not holding up (owner) Paul Gaston,''
Pitino said. ``That's not what I'm going to do. That's not the way
I am. Paul Gaston has been great to Rick Pitino. He gave him one of
the greatest jobs in all of coaching. But if I wasn't getting it
done, I would go to Paul and say, `Let's come to a mutual
agreement. You've given me the break. You need to make a decision.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want him coming to me,'' Pitino went on. ``I want to
make it easy. He's very happy with me. So is the organization. He's
not happy with the amount of wins we have. I'm sure he's ticked off
about that. But he knows how hard we're working and he also
believes we're not that far away. I believe that as well. But I
don't want to see this town negative. I don't want that. I've got
too much confidence in my ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he sometimes feels he should ``have a little more
Lou Holtz in me.'' Holtz, of course, doesn't think his team can win
anything (and this past season, at South Carolina, he was right).
Pitino is the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've never lost and I've never been that way,'' he said,
referring to the gloom-and-doom Holtz. ``So I'm the eternal
optimist. But this is a tough job. It's a bitch. It's much, much
tougher than I ever anticipated, much tougher, because youth is
very difficult in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was quoted in the News as saying, ``If I could,
tomorrow, bring in Larry Bird to be the coach here, I would step
aside in a second. Because I think this town loves Larry Bird.
Because I think this town would benefit. It would be very upbeat
and very positive.'' He also said the same would go for Bill
Russell in an executive role. But, he added, ``I don't think any of
those people will outwork me or outcoach me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he was talking about hypotheticals when he brought
up Bird's name. (Bird never would take the job anyway.) He said it
was merely an example of what he would do to see the Celtics
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm saying is, I'm for the Celtics winning,'' Pitino
said. ``And if I wasn't getting the job done, I'd bring in anybody,
it wouldn't matter who, if I felt that person could get the job
done. That's my only message. When it's all said and done, I'll
bring in anyone. The whole point was just about the Celtics
winning. It was, if somewhere down the road, if they want a Celtics
legend, I'll do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said if it doesn't work out here, he will try and get
another pro coaching job. ``I came to this level to win a
championship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And how long did he think he could stick around as an executive
after hiring his successor, if it came to that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll cross that bridge when I come to it,'' he said. ``But I
could (stay) for a year, maybe. But coaching is in my blood. That's
what I do. Right now, I don't even want to think about that. I want
to do what is best for the Boston Celtics. But I also have a
responsibility to do the best thing for the organization and if I
don't see improvement from the basketball team, I would not hold up
anybody. That is not my nature.''

LEWIS: COUNT ME IN 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-LEWIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ If you insist on measuring Darren Lewis by
the numbers, he suggests with just a trace of exasperation that you
take a look at this one.
</P>
<P>
   For the last seven seasons, beginning with a Giants team that
won 103 games in 1993, Lewis has played on teams that either went
to the playoffs or were in postseason contention well into
September.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the Red Sox, of course, who have won the wild card
in each of Lewis's two seasons as the starting center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   That's no coincidence, in Lewis's view. ``It's no secret that
the strongest part of my game is something that doesn't show up in
the box score,'' he said. ``There is no stat for my strengths. I
know I can say I helped this team win. Look at the last two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though he signed Lewis to a three-year deal immediately
after the 1998 season, Lewis's first with the club, Red Sox general
manager Dan Duquette has tried to upgrade the center field position
in each of the last two winters. He came very close to signing free
agent Bernie Williams last winter, and this winter landed Carl
Everett, whose offensive skills have him heralded as the best
center fielder the Sox have had since Fred Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Lewis played center and hit leadoff when the Sox lost,
11-6, to the Minnesota Twins at Hammond Stadium. But when the
season opens next month in Seattle, Everett will be the starting
center fielder, barring injury. Lewis will be on the bench as an
outfield reserve, unless he is in another uniform.
</P>
<P>
   One might tend to take that personally, and Lewis is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's natural to feel that way,'' he said. ``I leave
my heart and soul on the field. But it all comes down to what
continues to motivate me as a player, to prove them _ whoever
`they' are _ wrong. I'll try to fight my way back, make myself an
everyday player again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's definitely something special on this team. If
there wasn't something special, I'd be begging to get out of here.
But the grass isn't always greener somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Paint by the numbers, and Everett is a Monet, Lewis a coloring
book. Everett hit .325 last season, 85 percentage points higher
than Lewis's .240. He hit 25 home runs to Lewis's two, scored 86
runs to Lewis's 63, drove in 108 runs to Lewis's 40. Everett's is a
bat the Sox will feature in the No. 3 hole. Lewis's bat was one the
Red Sox often tried to hide.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis insists the numbers don't give the texture and
shadings any good portrait requires. They don't show the Gold
Glove-caliber defense, the willingness to give up an at-bat to move
a runner over, his ability to drop a bunt, his refusal to sit out
when hurt, the dedication and professionalism in a clubhouse that
sorely needed both when he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any team that would choose Lewis over Everett, who is
four years younger, comes close to being Lewis's equal afield, and
has a better arm? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   But is there a place for a player who brings what Lewis offers
to a team? Manager Jimy Williams says absolutely. ``Darren Lewis
belongs on this team,'' he says. ``He's a winner. Those guys are
not easy to find.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than two months, Lewis was bothered by a sore left
wrist he injured while sliding into second base in Toronto. But he
said little about the injury, even as his average plummeted. He hit
just .215 after the All-Star break, .180 after Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wrist got me in some bad habits,'' Lewis said. ``I was
swinging the bat long, trying to protect it. But I'm the type of
person not to use an injury as an excuse. Just go play ball. I'm
not the type to go on the DL with a nagging injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the numbers slip? Sure, they did. But I've got to play.
There's too many things I can do to help the team win. Some players
don't get a hit, they can't help the team win. I can go without a
hit and still help.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lewis is not certain whether he can accept being a Sox
extra after being a cast member for the last two years, especially
when it's hard for him to shake the feeling that his contribution
has been denigrated by the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that people have different views and different
philosophies,'' he said. ``Those things are out of my control. My
game is the same as it has been the last eight years. If you look
at my numbers, they're very similar every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has their philosophy changed? It looks that way. Have my goals
changed? No, they haven't. I still do the same things I've done
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis acknowledges that the best teams have good veteran players
on the bench, too. He cites the Yankees and Chad Curtis as an
example. Curtis didn't play much, but he still played a vital role
as a reserve and hit two home runs in Game 3 of the World Series
against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Lewis would like very much to remain part of the
mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be in one spot,'' he said. ``People know Darren
Lewis plays for the Boston Red Sox and that I make a difference on
this team. I'm happy with that at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Would there be a point, if the playing time doesn't come, where
he would be unhappy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I going to ask them to trade me?'' he said. ``Not at this
point. There may come a point where I have to think about myself
just like they think of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy where I'm at. I enjoy my teammates, I enjoy the city
of Boston. I'm on a team that has a chance to win. Am I going to
have some at-bats? Maybe, maybe not. When you look at the team on
paper right now, Darren Lewis is the fourth outfielder, but that's
not the way I approach it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody can get hurt, somebody may not be producing, and
they'll still have a guy who has worth to the ballclub. I've proved
that year in and year out.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the numbers say.

KELLY HAS SEEN TWO SIDES OF TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ God bless Tom Kelly. Ask him a question and
you're not going to get a diplomatic,
on-the-one-hand-but-on-the-other-hand response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this (Brad) Radke thing going to be a distraction?'' the
Twins manager asks. ``How can it not be? They usually are. Every
new city, someone's going to ask him about it. Someone's going to
ask me about it. It's a better story than asking about this
ballclub. He's going to be a target.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in case you're coming in late, 27-year-old Brad Radke is
Minnesota's best pitcher. He has entered the final year of his
contract, and so is now prime trade bait. He would, in theory,
enhance the title chances of many a contending club, the Red Sox
included. He is far and away the juiciest news topic on a
low-payroll team where even someone who regularly tapes ``Baseball
Tonight'' in order to watch it the next morning would find it a
major chore just to name five players on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly has been to the baseball mountaintop _ twice. He
managed the Twins to the World Series championship in both 1987 and
1991, before growing payroll imbalances systematically eliminated
the Milwaukees, the Pittsburghs, and the Minnesotas from any
practical hope of contention. The Twins had enough residual roster
strength to win 90 games and finish second in 1992, but the crash
came in a major way the following season (71-91), and in the last
seven years his teams have won 147 fewer games than they've lost.
That state of affairs will not change in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   So here sits Kelly, legs crossed, leaning on a bat,
acknowledging that, once again, what he's up to and what the likes
of Joe Torre, Johnny Oates, and even Jimy Williams are up to in the
upcoming season are two entirely different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little different here than it was a couple of years
ago,'' he says. ``We have made a commitment to play the younger
fellas. Our payroll is $17 million, give or take, and it's not
going to change. We're looking at a few older guys to give us a
little stability. We've got (pitcher) Bobby Ayala, but I don't know
if he'll make the team. We've got (third baseman/DH) Butch Huskey,
who's had success with a few teams (and who hit a home run against
the Red Sox Saturday). We're taking a look at (pitcher) Sean
Bergman. But mostly what we're trying to do is get it across to the
young guys that they've got to be more consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   As he speaks, there is a Minneapolis newspaper column in
circulation alleging that he has a difference of opinion with
general manager Terry Ryan over the quality of the youngsters in
question. This is one time when the truth may be a bit hard to come
by, since Kelly is publicly committed to staying the course in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Kelly professes to be excited about such young
players as first baseman David Ortiz, third baseman Corey Koskie,
and catcher Matt LeCroy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids need to get stronger mentally,'' he explains.
``They have to understand that this is a seven-day game. They play
well for two or three days a week, but that's not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins are off the radar screen for the average fan, but for
the aficionados Kelly holds an ongoing fascination because, as much
as any manager in the game, he is the clear public face of his
organization. Since 1986, you think ``Twins,'' you think ``Tom
Kelly,'' first in the early glory days when an unsmiling,
media-unfriendly Kelly scared away most inquisitors, and now in his
more avuncular phase, when he welcomes familiar media faces who
have come to commiserate over his now unchangeable role as
caretaker of a team that absolutely, positively cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   He does not ask for sympathy because he has brought this on
himself by reupping when there were chances to leave. But he likes
his life, both in the Twin Cities and down here (he owns some
greyhounds), and with the two rings he certainly doesn't have to
prove anything to anybody.
</P>
<P>
   He's still having fun. He tries to pitch batting practice every
day, for example. ``Keeps me away from the media,'' he says with a
laugh. ``And it gives me a little more personal approach, plus a
little exercise.'' He still loves the day-to-day swirl, and he
really does enjoy the idea of seeing kids improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I'm in for here,'' he says. ``I'm here because the
owner said, `Tom, we'd like you to stay. This is our program.' If I
had any doubts about it, I wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those World Series victories now seem like stories being told
around someone else's campfire. ``I don't think much about it,'' he
says, ``unless someone asks me. I'm more caught up in the
day-to-day, the process we're in now. With this team, I'm still
learning guys' names.''
</P>
<P>
   The championship rings are home in a drawer. ``I'm not a jewelry
guy,'' he says with a shrug. ``The only ring I wear is a wedding
ring. I had the same Timex watch I bought for something like 19
bucks for 19 years until it finally wore out this winter. Every
once in a while I bring out a ring for some occasion, and then I
wind up showing it to someone and I walk away and forget about it.
Finally, I said, `I can't keep doing this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He may not be especially reflective, but he is not stupid,
that's for sure. He has no worries. Say he decides he's given
enough to the Minnesota Twins when his contract runs out at the end
of this year. He won't turn 50 until August. He's got two
championships on his resume. He's known to be a good soldier.
Imagine what a manager like that would be worth on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of people to feel sorry for in this game, but
Tom Kelly isn't one of them.

ALLISON BACK BELEAGUERED COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Mass. _ With the departure of Ray Bourque imminent,
the question remains: What, if anything, will that mean for the
future of Bruins coach Pat Burns?
</P>
<P>
   Burns, in the third year of a four-year contract, was endorsed
by president/general manager Harry Sinden as being safe through the
season. But what then? Will Burns be forced to pay for the bizarre
circumstances that have brought down this club brick-by-brick? Will
he be held responsible for the key injuries, the lack of depth, the
meltdowns of Joe Murphy and Marty McSorley, the lack of centers?
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jason Allison, whose loss was the single biggest
disaster of the year in a season full of them, said it would be
devastating if Burns were to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anyone would be shocked after what they hear
but definitely disappointed and upset,'' said Allison. ``I'd almost
feel badly that we kind of did it. I just hope it doesn't come to
that. I don't think he deserves that for what he did the last two
years here.''
</P>
<P>
   As a coach, Burns is not a warm and fuzzy personality, although
he's certainly nicer than former Patriots coach Bill Parcells and
more down to earth than Celtics coach Rick Pitino. He can be
irascible, short, and irritable with his players and Allison said
that's all the more reason he should stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figure this out,'' said Allison. ``He's one of the tougher
coaches in the league, he's very strict and a pretty
defensive-minded guy. He can have tight reins sometimes and he's
not always going to pat you on the back, he'll let you have it. But
you ask around the room and every guy wants him back. That should
say something. If you have a guy everyone wants back because he's
soft and easy, you understand that, but obviously he's done more
than a good job here or they wouldn't all go to bat for him and
want him back because it cannot be fun sometimes when he's not in a
good mood. You don't see that (kind of support) very often.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Bruins didn't make the playoffs, in '97,
players were carping publicly and privately about management,
then-coach Steve Kasper, and everything else. Kasper didn't have
much to work with either, but he paid with his job anyway. It's
likely Burns will, too. Allison said if that's the case, it's
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's earned all the respect of the players in here,'' said
Allison. ``He's not an easy guy sometimes and everyone still wants
him back and thinks he deserves to be back so there should be not
even a thought of firing him. You can't honestly blame him for this
year. I'm sure he feels very frustrated like `What else can I do?'
He's been really hard on us, he's lightened up, he's tried
different systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we got to a certain point in the year when everything was
going bad, you saw there was no way things were going to turn
around and it snowballs. What do you want him to do? He can only
coach what he gets. The players have to play well and we have to
have the right group of players here and the right talent. I sure
hope he doesn't get punished for this. It was one thing after
another all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were overwhelmed, 3-0, Saturday in a game against the
Philadelphia Flyers, Bourque's likely destination. Goalie Rob
Tallas said he saw the footage of Burns's very brief news
conference and said he sensed just how upset his coach is about the
team's inability to compete against the league's best teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to be frustrated and rightfully so,'' said Tallas.
``Coaches dream of teams like the Red Wings where I don't think
there's a whole lot of coaching involved on that team. It's just
setting it up and watching the players perform and do things with
ease and with so much talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our team, we need to be coached and coached right through
a game. That's tough on him. He's been doing that all year. There
haven't been nights where Pat could just take off and let our
talent win games. A lot of people don't see that. Detroit can just
go out and play. It's been a very difficult season for him. Pat
took us from a bunch of talented young guys with something to prove
two years ago and made superstars out of some of them.
Unfortunately, they're hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallas said as much as he and his teammates have felt the
frustration Burns was feeling personally, the players all said he
hasn't ever taken it out on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach, he could easily come in here and explode and start
screaming at us and start passing on what management passes to him
but Pat doesn't do that,'' said Tallas. ``He's like a little bit of
a sponge; he absorbs most of it. He is a fiery coach, he does bring
some of it to us but I don't think he brings the management stuff
to us, he just brings our play to us and what we did wrong. He's
been real good at taking most of the heat for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he will try to keep his team focused Monday night
against Ottawa despite the circus atmosphere that has surrounded
the club all year. ``They're obviously a team that is not as big as
the team (Saturday),'' said Burns, referring to the mammoth Flyers
. . . Tallas will be in net Monday night . . . Anson Carter, out
for the season because of impending wrist surgery, will have his
ailing right shoulder looked at in the next day or so and expects
to undergo a test that will determine the damage since the rotator
cuff isn't getting any better and Carter said he has no strength in
the arm.

ENCOURAGING SIGNS FOR CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As the Celtics gathered around coach Rick Pitino before
the start of the fourth period, every face in the group smiled.
</P>
<P>
   There were hugs and high-fives. Pitino shouted instructions over
a boisterous crowd eagerly anticipating the first Boston win in a
week and a half. A man behind one baseline held up a neon green
sign that read, ``I still believe in Rick Pitino and these young
Celtics.'' A group of fans behind the Boston bench stood to applaud
the home team and their effort against the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in his first game back at the FleetCenter since comments
that faulted Bostonians for their impatience and poor attitude
concerning the Celtics, Pitino got the encouragement he asked for.
The sellout crowd of 18,624 cheered the Celtics, heckled the Magic,
and booed the referees. Orlando timeouts were filled with noise.
Each time the Magic took the ball down the floor, chants of
``De-fense, de-fense'' were heard. And with positive backing from
fans Pitino accused of negativity less than a week ago, Boston
snapped its four-game losing streak and defeated Orlando, 97-91.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very, very pleased with the crowd,'' said Pitino, who
received only a faint smattering of boos when he was introduced
during pregame ceremonies. ``We had a sellout today, a great crowd.
They helped us win this game. They forced us to play great defense,
and we are thankful for that crowd. It was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Celtics were looking to win over fans in the first
quarter, they certainly weren't in any hurry. Shooting poorly at
the start of the game, Boston quickly fell behind. A 17-foot jump
shot by Paul Pierce with 5:16 left in the opening stanza marked the
Celtics' first field goal of the afternoon. But Orlando failed to
capitalize as Boston stuggled, shooting 25 percent from the floor
(6 for 24) in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors opened up a 7-point lead on two occasions late in
the opening quarter, but they couldn't put any more distance
between them and the Celtics. Instead, the Celtics collected
themselves, kept up their defensive pressure, and staged a
comeback. A 7-0 run fueled by 3 points and a steal from Pierce tied
the game at 11 with 3:45 remaining in the quarter. Orlando took a
timeout and regained the lead, though Boston trailed by just 1
point as the teams entered the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get down on ourselves because we were playing tough
defense,'' said Kenny Anderson, who had 14 points, 5 assists, and 4
steals. ``You just have to keep playing and keep your head in it.''
</P>
<P>
   After a Danny Fortson free throw tied the game at 29, the
Celtics took the lead for good when Adrian Griffin hit a 16-foot
jumper with 5:53 left in the first half. A combination of
aggressive defense and improved shooting helped the Celtics stay
ahead of the Magic, who are the fifth-highest-scoring team in the
league. Boston attacked Orlando's half-court trap, collected an
impressive 16 steals, and forced 26 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you turn the ball over 26 times, you're not going to win
a game,'' said Orlando coach Doc Rivers. ``I thought it was an
extremely winnable game, but not because of their record.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston entered haltime ahead, 45-40, after it doubled its field
goal accuracy to 50 percent. Antoine Walker found his range,
scoring 11 of his 18 points in the second quarter, while Fortson
dropped all 6 of his points before halftime after making his third
consecutive start.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' lead reached a game-high 15 when Anderson hit a
3-pointer with 29.9 seconds left in the third. Orlando spent the
quarter trying to keep Boston's lead below double digits, but
leaving Eric Williams (8 points) wide open at the 3-point arc and
letting Griffin (15 points, 11 rebounds) drive to the basket didn't
help the visitors in their push for the playoffs. The Magic, their
two-game win streak snapped, remain in ninth place in the Eastern
Conference behind Milwaukee and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Celtics struggled to make shots early in the fourth
and the Magic surged to close within 5 in the final minute, the
home team didn't let its hard work and the crowd's enthusiasm go to
waste.
</P>
<P>
   As they continue their four-game homestand, the players let it
be known they appreciated the support. They were not in their usual
rush to leave the floor or the locker room. Pierce, who led the
team with 19 points before fouling out in the fourth, stayed behind
to sign autographs. Postgame, it was not the same dispirited team
that showed up after recent disappointing losses to Dallas and
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big victory for us to get off that skid and get back
on the positive side,'' said Walker. ``Hopefully, the fans
appreciate our effort because we're going to continue to work very
hard. It was a real lively crowd that was real into it. It's huge
(to have a supportive crowd), especially when you've been
struggling like we have, being up and down. It's a lift emotionally
and it keeps guys into it.''

EAGLES GET BALL ROLLING

 COLLEGE-GEORGETOWN_BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ The Boston College women's basketball team
wasn't happy with its No. 4 seed in the Big East tournament, but
after the first two games, the Eagles could be forgiven if they're
wondering when the competition starts.
</P>
<P>
   BC led virtually the entire way and defeated Georgetown, 74-52,
in the quarterfinals before a crowd of 10,027 at Gampel Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   As for the competition, well, that starts Monday night when the
No. 19 Eagles face the top-ranked University of Connecticut, which
trounced St. John's, 85-41.
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown (17-12, 9-7) opened the game with a 3-pointer by
junior guard Dani Illic, and BC started the game 0 for 4 from the
field. But a layup by forward Alissa Murphy, followed by another
from Kim Mackie, put the Eagles up, 4-3, and marked the beginning
of a 10-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first of many runs for BC (25-7, 12-4) as it
opened a 20-point lead at 30-10 with 3:27 to go in the half before
settling for a 32-18 halftime advantage.
</P>
<P>
   BC shot a less-than-stellar 36 percent, as it made 11 of 31
shots. But Georgetown shot even worse, 32 percent (7 for 22), and
committed 15 turnovers in the half.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if the Hoyas might close the gap in the second
half, thanks mainly to junior guard Katie Smrcka-Duffy, who
exploded for 15 of her game-high 20 points. But Georgetown couldn't
come any closer than 11 (47-36) with 8:10 to play.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the three stars of the game went to work as Cal
Bouchard hit two free throws and a 3-pointer, Murphy sank a layup
and a free throw, and Becky Gottstein had two layups to give the
Eagles a 14-point lead with 5:29 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to loosen things up, and played better the second
half,'' said Georgetown coach Pat Knapp. ``Our kids played hard,
but we didn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgetown's biggest threat is Smrcka-Duffy, who leads the
conference with an average of 18.6 points per game. The trouble is,
she's the Hoyas' only threat, and the only Georgetown player to
average double figures. Forward Nok Duany had 13 points, but only
three other Hoyas scored.
</P>
<P>
   BC, meanwhile, had plenty of ammunition. Murphy scored a
team-high 19 points, Bouchard had 18, including four 3-pointers,
and Gottstein added 18 points and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The win was especially gratifying for Gottstein. She was on
crutches during last year's quarterfinal loss to Georgetown after
she sprained her ankle in the first-round win. Plus, Gottstein
returned to the lineup Saturday after being sidelined for six weeks
with a stress fracture in her ankle.
</P>
<P>
   BC coach Cathy Inglese took Gottstein's heroics in stride,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I expect it? No,'' Inglese said. ``Am I surprised? No. She
finds a way to get it done.''

<P>
   NEWARK, Del. _ The player at the end of the Maine bench hurt the
Black Bears most Sunday in the America East tournament semifinals
against Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Maine point guard Andy Bedard, a transfer from Boston College,
had no points, no shots, no assists. He was sitting out, having
broken his left wrist against Hartford Saturday. So Maine, which
had defeated Delaware twice during the regular season, was not the
same team.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware, before a packed house of 5,086 at the Bob Carpenter
Center, went on to wreck Maine, 68-46.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware visits top seed Hofstra Saturday in the league final.
</P>
<P>
   Maine connected on just 27.6 percent (8 of 29) of its tries in
the first half while Delaware, with eight wins in a row, hit 18 of
32 for 56.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, there were horrible moments for the Black Bears,
who had come in as the tournament's No. 2 seed (Delaware was No.
3).
</P>
<P>
   Maine committed turnovers its first two times down the court,
prompting coach John Giannini to signal two timeouts in the first
3:24.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a much different basketball team with Andy Bedard,''
said Delaware coach Mike Brey, his team 24-6 overall and 15-4 in
the league. ``He's a great player and to lose him and have to
regroup without a practice is very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a huge loss, he's a great player,'' Brey added. ``He's
one of the reasons why they didn't shoot as well. Bedard delivers
the ball to those guys when they're wide open and at the right
place; he's amazing the way he controls the game. He's a heck of a
player and he's also beaten us a lot _ that's why I respect him.''
</P>
<P>
   Delaware, with 21 points and 10 rebounds from Mike Pegues, was
ahead, 14-10, before going on a tear, with senior forward Madou
Diouf hitting 6 of 7 on his way to 13 points. Delaware got 9 of the
last 12 points for a 40-22 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kestutis Marciulionis added 14 points for Delaware. Nate Fox
paced Maine with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``About everything bad that could happen did happen,'' said
Giannini, his team ending its season at 24-7, 15-3. ``I was very
confident even without a great player like Andy, but without having
any time to really prepare, it made it difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what's made it even more difficult was playing on the road
against an outstanding team in a wild arena. We did not execute
very well in the first half because we couldn't even hear our
calls. I thought we missed layups and free throws that we normally
make. It definitely snowballed against us.''

MANHATTAN'S POMPEY SETS SIGHTS HIGHER 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Aliann Pompey doesn't usually enter the 500-meter run.
But she did Sunday at the ECAC Division 1 Indoor Track Championship
at the Reggie Lewis Center. One thing is for sure: It was a nice
change of pace.
</P>
<P>
   Pompey not only won the 500-meter ECAC championship, she also
ran the fastest 500-meter race by a collegian.
</P>
<P>
   The Ghana-born New Yorker blistered the oval in 1 minute 9.23
seconds, breaking the NCAA mark of 1:09.38 set by Cathy Tattray of
Tennessee in 1984. This is just a prelude. The Manhattan College
graduate student has her sights set higher.
</P>
<P>
   She will travel to Fayetteville, Ark., this week to compete in
the NCAA Division 1 Championships, but she won't run in the 500.
Why? There is no 500-meter event in the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually run the 400. My coach wanted me to run the 500 to
prepare for next week's NCAAs,'' said Pompey. She should do well in
the 400. She is seeded second in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   If the 500-meter run did anything, it certainly boosted Pompey's
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we came up for the ECACs, I had my heart set on
breaking the 500 record,'' said Pompey, who has set many school and
meet records during her career at Manhattan. This is her first NCAA
record. Although she is a graduate student, she is considered a
fifth-year senior because she was a medical redshirt last season.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, she didn't even post the best time in Saturday's
preliminary heats. ``I wasn't trying to run fast on Saturday,''
said Pompey. ``I was just trying to qualify for the championship
race.'' She won her qualifying heat in 1:11.48. Sunday, her closest
competitor was Chantee Earl of Pitt, who finished two seconds
behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a runner who is competing out of her regular event
and coming back from a knee injury that sidelined her for an entire
season.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 14, 1998, Pompey cut in front of a runner, got bumped,
and fell. ``I ran for the next couple of weeks, but the pain in my
knee wouldn't go away. So I had an MRI and they saw that I broke
it,'' said Pompey.
</P>
<P>
   She had a stress fracture of the tibia. ``She's a terrific
runner,'' said Manhattan coach Joe Ryan. ``Not many runners can
come back from an injury like that. Not many will stay in shape
during a long rehabilitation like she went through. She deserves a
lot of credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Pompey bolted out of the blocks and never looked back.
It's something she has consistently done since she returned to the
track. She hasn't lost a race all year.
</P>
<P>
   Pompey, 21, is already committed to compete in the Sydney
Olympics for Ghana in the 400 and the 4 x 400 relay team. ``That's
one meet I'm really looking forward to running.''
</P>
<P>
   Some athletes didn't compete in the ECAC Championships,
including Harvard high jumper Dora Gyorffy. Villanova's top
distance runners _ Carrie Tollefson, Kristen Nicolini, and Ann
McGranaham _ qualified Saturday for Sunday's mile championship. But
when the finals began, they withdrew. This meet comes at a
precarious period in the schedule. With the NCAA Championship
looming just days away, some sat out to rest up for the big event.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't detract from this meet,'' said Cornell track
coach Lou Duesing. ``There are still plenty of talented competitors
looking for a chance to qualify for the NCAAs.''
</P>
<P>
   Another oddity at this championship was the absence of George
Mason. The school has won this meet for the last six years. But
veteran track coach Norm Gordon was dismissed after last season.
</P>
<P>
   The team championship went to Georgetown with 87 points. West
Virginia (78), Seton Hall (69), and Connecticut (41) followed. The
best performance by a Boston school was Northeastern, which
finished 12th with 19 points.

   TAKE-BOS  
 TEMPE, Ariz.: ... ``legend-padding.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senator John Kerry says he and McCain forged a bond as Vietnam
veterans and he respects him as a loyal friend. ``I enjoy his
company, John's a funny guy,'' the Massachusetts Democrat said.
``Most of the bad things you hear come from people he's put on the
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe said McCain got better at controlling his temper in the
wake of three unnerving and very personal events. One was the
Keating scandal, which he saw as an assault on his honor. A second
was the discovery that his wife had been addicted to prescription
painkillers from 1989 to 1992 and had stolen drugs from her
family's charitable foundation. A third was a 1993 diagnosis of
malignant melanoma, the most lethal type of skin cancer. McCain had
the cancerous mole removed from his shoulder, and no melanoma has
recurred, according to his medical records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things were pretty scary for him, and he really
refocused his life and realized what a blessing his family was to
him,'' Kolbe said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain blames himself for the breakup of his first marriage.
McCain wanted a fuller, faster life than he found back home with
his first wife. Carol Shepp McCain, who lives in the Washington
area, has spoken kindly of her former husband, says she supports
his candidacy, and attributes their divorce to ``John turning 40
and wanting to be 25 again.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain did what he believed was honorable: He provided
generously for Carol, who had been seriously injured in a car
accident during his captivity, and their three children, including
two adopted sons from her previous marriage. ``If you can ever have
an amicable divorce, this one was,'' said George ``Bud'' Day, a
lawyer and POW friend who drew up the papers in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the divorce, McCain married Cindy Hensley, 24, an
heiress to a Phoenix beer-distribution fortune, and part of a
politically well-connected family. They have four school-aged
children who McCain dotes on and disciplines in a way his own
father never did.
</P>
<P>
   The grown children from his first marriage _ Doug, Andy, and
Sydney Ann _ are campaigning for McCain, and Andy works for the
Hensley family's company in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sent leatherbound copies of his biography to Doug's
children, autographing them ``The Old Geezer.'' ``The kindergarten
teacher admonished my daughter to stop calling her grandfather
that,'' said Doug, a former Navy flier who is now a commercial
airline pilot in Virginia Beach, Va. ``She said, `but that's what
he likes to be called.'''
</P>
<P>
   For a geezer, McCain is as energized as a Boy Scout leader
around his children, camping, hiking, fishing, swimming, and
grilling the food at their weekend cabin near Sedona, Ariz. On the
campaign bus, the youngsters are either fighting McCain for the
last potato chip in the bag or giving him a hard time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pork-barrel spender!'' Jimmy McCain, 11, yells at Jack, his
13-year-old brother. Jimmy's not sure what the expression means,
but it sounds funny and besides, he's heard his candidate-father
bellow it hundreds of times.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Cuming, an old friend from Yuma, said the family lives in
Phoenix, not Washington, because McCain thinks the children of
elected officials get coddled, spoiled, and too often uprooted.
Sharon Harper, the McCain's neighbor in Phoenix, said McCain wants
to be president for a very personal reason: To restore honor to the
military before all or some of his children are old enough to
serve.
</P>
<P>
   McCain gets emotional at the mention of military families
needing food stamps or veterans lacking health care. The outrage
comes from inside: McCain's severe war injuries prevent him from
combing his hair, typing on a keyboard, or tying his shoes. Friends
marvel at McCain's encyclopedic knowledge of sports. He's an avid
fan _ Ted Williams is his hero _ but he can't raise his arm above
his shoulder to throw a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   After Vietnam, McCain had Ann Lawrence, a physical therapist,
help him regain flexibility in his leg, which had been frozen in an
extended position by a shattered knee. It was the only way he could
hope to resume his career as a Navy flier, but Lawrence said the
treatment, taken twice a week for six months, was excruciatingly
painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He endured it, he wouldn't settle for less,'' said Lawrence,
who rejoiced with McCain when he passed the Navy physical. ``I have
never seen such toughness and resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's determination was evident to Lawrence in another way.
During the therapy, he insisted his ``physical terrorist'' was the
perfect match for one of his POW buddies, William Lawrence. She
resisted, McCain persisted, and the Lawrences were married months
after McCain forced them to meet at his home over dinner.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says his campaign is ``a noble mission,'' and those close
to him believe he has brought to it the same character traits _
toughness, endurance, even risk-taking _ that Ann Lawrence observed
many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a zest for life that sometimes can drive the rest of us
nuts,'' said Cindy McCain, who reluctantly signed onto her
husband's presidential express last fall, not really expecting it
to become this runaway train. ``When we're exhausted, John says,
`There's more to the day _ let's go!' ''

MCCAIN CHARACTER LOYAL TO A FAULT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. Facing a threat that his homosexuality would be
exposed by Christian conservatives at a city council meeting, Mayor
Neil Giuliano did what he thought was nobody's business: He held a
press conference and declared, ``I happen to be gay.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of Arizona's senior senator, John McCain, was swift
and angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was the first to tell the religious right, `This doesn't
make a damned bit of difference,' '' Giuliano said, remembering how
McCain went out of his way to call him a good mayor and a great
friend. ``Politically in Arizona, McCain should have done just the
opposite. Instead, he came right to my defense. He's a loyal
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential candidate John McCain has a pattern of putting
his heart ahead of his head and even his political judgment. Peel
off the pretense of a cocky fighter pilot and a prickly politician,
those who know him well say, and what really shapes John McCain is
his loyalty to family and friends and a fierce sense of duty to
defend underdogs under attack.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was in hot water last week for his highly personal
lashing of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, who he said he believes
have dishonored him with their negative attacks. McCain was forced
to apologize after calling the two Christian conservative leaders
``forces of evil,'' and then he faced new questions about his
temperament to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it should be a source of worry,'' McCain said
during a candidates debate Thursday night, ``but anything is fair
game, as I've found out during this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   To admirers like Giuliano, McCain's sensitivity, generosity, and
loyalty are the hallmarks of his character. To targets of his
outrage, McCain's thin skin is his fatal flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``His greatest strength is also his greatest weakness,'' said
Mike Hellon of Tucson, a state GOP leader who has known McCain for
two decades. ``John is impatient with fools. Particularly if people
are acting improperly or in a self-serving fashion, he can be very
difficult. He puts loyalty first, even when it is not in his best
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona's superintendent of public
instruction, was close to McCain until she publicly called for the
resignation of Governor Fife Symington after he was indicted for
bank fraud in 1996. McCain, who stood by his friend Symington,
considered Keegan disloyal, told her so in no uncertain terms, and
shut her out of his political circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was right: I was disloyal, and I meant to be,'' said
Keegan, who is so sure McCain would be a good president that she
recently arranged a meeting in which both apologized for the
falling out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Keegan frequently travels with McCain's campaign and
advises him on education policy. ``He's never going to win the Miss
Congeniality award or take you to lunch, but he is always looking
to do the right thing.'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had values drilled into him by a father and grandfather
who were decorated Navy admirals and adhered to a rigid military
code of honor, duty, and country. He's a proud graduate of the
Naval Academy (though, McCain ruefully notes, he was a hell-raiser
who barely squeaked through). And he had a profound lesson in
allies and enemies as a tortured prisoner of war in Vietnam for 5
1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Merrill, the pollster in McCain's first congressional
campaign in 1982, said he respects and admires the senator's
compelling history. But like others who have been in combat with
McCain, Merrill has been awed by his ambition and alienated by his
self-righteous ``in your face, do it my way or you'll pay a hell of
a penalty'' style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very forceful, dynamic person, and in 30 years of
political consulting, I have never seen a candidate as driven as
John McCain,'' said Merrill, a professor at Arizona State
University in Tempe. ``He is a crusader, and the mythology that has
built up here _ that he divides the world into his camp or the
enemy camp _ is consistent with a crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain saw enemies challenging all his relationships _ friends,
family, fellow veterans _ during the bitter, losing primary fight
last month in South Carolina. There was Texas Governor George W.
Bush, failing to renounce a supporter who accused McCain of
disloyalty to veterans. There was Robertson, in a taped telephone
message, calling McCain's friend, the former New Hampshire Senator
Warren Rudman, ``a vicious bigot.'' And there were strident voices
all over the airwaves, spreading ugly stories about his wife and
children.
</P>
<P>
   Barreling down a South Carolina highway on the campaign bus,
aides showed McCain a flier filled with personal smears that had
been circulated at an event earlier in the day. McCain snatched the
leaflet before his wife, Cindy, could read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why upset her unnecessarily?'' McCain snapped. ``Like most
wives, she doesn't want to see those things said about her
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCains were deeply and personally offended by Bush's visit
to Bob Jones University, which bans interracial dating, and by
rumors about their ``black child.'' On a relief mission to
Bangladesh in 1991, Cindy McCain claimed an orphan who was so
severely disfigured by a cleft lip and palate that she was unable
to eat. She brought 2-month-old Bridget home to Phoenix, where the
McCains adopted the baby and nursed her through a dozen operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people miss about John is that behind the tough, fighter
facade is a deeply sensitive person, and things really hurt him,''
said Everett Alvarez Jr., who was a fellow POW in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Orson Swindle, McCain's neighbor in the Hanoi Hilton, blinked
back tears when he recalled McCain's reaction to winning the New
Hampshire primary last month. ``Amid all the electricity that
night, John got incredibly solemn,'' Swindle said. ``He came over
and looked me straight in the eye, as if to say, `My God, look how
far we have come and what we have done.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has never been comfortable as a war hero, honored and
greeted with adulation, Swindle said, when so many other Vietnam
combat veterans came home to no warm welcome at all. ``That wound
is still with a lot of us,'' said Swindle, adding that it probably
fuels McCain's strong sense of injustice.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's loyalties have at times blurred his political
judgment. At the request of Charles H. Keating Jr., a Phoenix
developer and political benefactor, McCain met in 1987 with federal
bank regulators who were closing in on Keating's shaky Lincoln
Savings &AMP; Loan Association. After an investigation of McCain and
four other senators, the Senate Ethics Committee reprimanded
McCain, though concluded he did not act improperly. Still, it
appeared McCain had catered to the kind of special interest he now
decries.
</P>
<P>
   Another strong and unlikely relationship was at work in 1992,
when McCain supported a Senate bill allowing fetal-tissue research.
His good friend and Democratic mentor, Representative Morris K.
Udall, was suffering from Parkinson's disease, and Udall's family
convinced McCain fetal tissue showed some promise as a cure.
Antiabortion activists still are attacking McCain for his vote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Jim Kolbe ran for the US House from separate Arizona
districts in 1982, but only McCain won. Two years later, when Kolbe
ran again, McCain ignored the political convention that you don't
campaign against an incumbent and went door-to-door for his friend
Kolbe until he was too exhausted to stand up straight. Kolbe won.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe called McCain first as he prepared in 1996 to disclose his
homosexuality. ``Before I got two words out, John said, `I know
what this is about, and it doesn't matter,' '' Kolbe said. ``He
wasn't shocked or offended.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain stands out as having one of the most loyal and
long-serving staffs on Capitol Hill. Aides say he doesn't
micromanage, but he does solicit their views, inquire about their
children, pummel them with smart-aleck insults, and work them to
the bone, the same way the 63-year-old McCain works himself.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the South Carolina primary, McCain telephoned Deb
Gullett, a longtime aide and his Arizona campaign manager, to tell
her he was losing that hard-fought contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called to ask me how I was doing, to make sure we were
fine, and I just wanted to cry,'' Gullett said. ``He also said, `By
the way, get your dead asses back to work,' and that is a direct
quote.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Salter, McCain's chief of staff, said his boss isn't cozy
with his Senate colleagues because he gores their sacred cows and
``won't treat them like movie stars, with exaggerated courtesy.''
Salter, who has worked for McCain for 11 years and coauthored his
best-selling biography, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' attributed reports
of the senator's hot temper to ``legend-padding.''

VOTING FOR CANDIDATES BASED ON THEIR LATE-NIGHT APPEARANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   During the 1960 presidential race,
New York Times political reporter James Reston wrote that the
campaign had come down to two basic tests: ``Who can stand up to
Nikita Khrushchev. And who can sit down with Jack Paar.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Times have changed. Nikita is gone, and television _ which was
just starting to assert itself in presidential politics 40 years
ago _ is now a main source of election coverage for three out of
four Americans.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the only thing that matters today is how well you do
with ``Paar'' _ or rather, with Jay Leno and David Letterman,
Paar's latter-night descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Think I'm kidding? Try this little test on your co-workers. Ask
them which Republican candidate was accused of writing negative
campaign brochures about his opponent in Michigan. Then ask them
which one was half an hour late to an interview with Leno last
week. (Answer to both: John McCain.)
</P>
<P>
   You'll immediately smoke out the political junkies in your
office with the first question. It's been a hot topic for weeks
among the Beltway insiders who show up on CNN, Fox News,
``NewsHour'' and other TV bull sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But to many of us who are going to vote today _ 16 states are
holding ``Super Tuesday'' primaries _ how the candidates performed
on late-night TV may be as important as how they fared on the news
and in televised debates.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that more than 11 million viewers last week caught
either McCain's tardy turn with Leno or George W. Bush's comically
inept satellite interview with David Letterman. That's about four
times the combined viewership for the two prime-time presidential
debates CNN aired last week.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just how many are watching, but who. Younger
viewers may flock to Leno and Letterman, but they tend to avoid
cable and network news. That's why candidates _ especially
underdogs looking for new blood _ try to get themselves booked on
late-night shows.
</P>
<P>
   It's what prompted candidate Bill Clinton in 1992 to blow his
own horn, literally, on ``The Arsenio Hall Show,'' and give Black
Entertainment Television's popular ``BET Tonight'' an interview the
day before the tough 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Bob Dole picked up that cue, making regular
appearances on any late-night show that would have him, including
``Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' and ``Saturday Night Live.''
(After his 1996 defeat, he did a sketch with Dole impersonator Norm
Macdonald.)
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley has made the circuit several times since the '96
election. He's paneled with Dave, Conan and Charlie Rose. Al Gore
hasn't been as prolific _ he made hay for years off his 1993 visit
to Letterman's show _ but early last month, as Bradley was mounting
a late surge, Gore finally darkened Leno's doorstep. (In the
``Tonight Show'' tradition, Leno flattered him with jokes, e.g.,
``Earlier today, computer hackers actually shut down Al Gore for
two hours.'')
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP race heating up, and public interest in the
candidates growing, bookers for the late-night shows got into the
fray. Letterman, issuing a typical caustic challenge, dared Bush to
come on his show and ``settle once and for all whether (he) is a
colossal boob or not.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the ``Late Show'' staff was trying to get Bush on
the show before the ``Tonight Show'' did. Suddenly the Texas
governor was being courted by both shows, like an A-list movie star
with a blockbuster to plug.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in their eagerness to get their man the maximum
exposure, Bush's handlers agreed to something they'd later regret.
Since Bush couldn't get to New York, Letterman interviewed him last
Wednesday via satellite from St. Louis (Bush was scheduled on the
``Tonight Show'' in California last night).
</P>
<P>
   Right away, Bush dug himself a hole, breaking one of the
Letterman show's cardinal rules, ``Thou shalt not be funny with
Dave.'' The host asked how he managed to look so youthful and
rested after all that campaigning. Bush grinned and said, ``Fake
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio audience tittered nervously, sensing what would come
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that pretty much how you plan to run the country?''
Letterman shot back, as the crowd roared its approval.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then tactlessly tried a couple of heart jokes, which were
further mangled because of the satellite delay. Finally, he tried
holding up a ``DWEEBS FOR BUSH'' T-shirt his staff had given to
him, even though Letterman hadn't called him a ``dweeb.'' Nobody
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   The segment went so badly that after the commercial, Bush's
advisers were on the phone with Letterman's producer, no doubt
pleading for mercy. But the show went on.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's televised pratfall, seen by 5 million viewers, appeared
not to hurt his poll numbers or his chances for wrapping up the GOP
nomination today.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that's because McCain didn't help his cause with Leno,
during which the senator delivered one of his trademark odd moments
of spontaneity. He emptied his pockets on Leno's desk, revealing
half a dozen different lucky trinkets, including a compass, a Hopi
tribal feather and a flattened penny (``so (my) campaign won't be
run over,'' he joked).
</P>
<P>
   McCain, surely sensing the drop in cabin pressure, added,
``Nothing wrong with being a little superstitious, is there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' said Leno. ``It's just a little (cough)
frightening.''  &LR; brk:``I'd say pick Leno''
</P>
<P>
   Why do candidates do this? Why do they risk tangling with
entertainers who can make them look like, well, colossal boobs?
</P>
<P>
   Again, the answer is youth. In January, the Pew Research Center
for People and the Press discovered that 80 percent of all voters
under 30 were getting their information about political candidates,
at least some of the time, from ``non-traditional sources'': MTV,
``Saturday Night Live'' and, yes, Jay and Dave. Nearly half of
young voters even said they ``occasionally learned something about
the campaign'' from late-night TV.
</P>
<P>
   At least one commentator thinks that's not such a bad thing. Bob
Somerby, a Washington political satirist, stand-up comedian and
frequent guest on Fox TV, has been chronicling the foibles of the
Washington press corps in his widely-read Internet column The Daily
Howler (dailyhowler.com).
</P>
<P>
   Somerby believes that journalists who cover the presidential
race are more concerned with their own celebrity than with breaking
real news. So they rarely if ever stray from the pack and often get
fixated on issues that voters couldn't care less about _ ``negative
campaigning,'' for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stupid,'' Somerby says. ``This idea that if you're
running for president you're not supposed to say anything critical
of your opponent _ what are we, in the second grade now? But that's
the theory of this whole campaign as it's been run by the press
corps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to pick one source of information,'' said Somerby,
``I'd say pick Leno.''

RESTORING HITCHCOCK MASTERPIECE A PAINSTAKING PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the film preservation business, Robert Harris is known as a
purist's purist. His goal in restoring a vintage film is nothing
less than re-creating with absolute authenticity the experience of
a movie's earliest audiences.
</P>
<P>
   How much of a purist?
</P>
<P>
   Well, in restoring Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1954 thriller
``Rear Window,'' Harris was greatly disturbed to find that the
colors in the original film had badly deteriorated. To make sure
the film's palette was perfectly reproduced, he tracked down
Georgine Darcy, who had played ``Miss Torso,'' the exhibitionist
dancer who kicked up her heels in the apartment across the court
from that of leading man James Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Darcy had kept the pink shorts she wore in ``Rear Window,''
storing them where they wouldn't fade. Harris was allowed to borrow
them so that he could use them as a reference to ensure that the
colors in the restored film matched those of the original clothing.
</P>
<P>
   And Harris doesn't rest once the restoration work is completed.
He even polices the theaters showing his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been having trouble with theaters trying to save 12
cents by cutting the amperage to the projector lamp,'' Harris said
in a recent phone interview from his Bedford Hills, N.Y.,
laboratory. ``Some theaters just don't have enough light.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Rear Window'' Harris faced a monumental task: While the
film had been shot in the three-strip Technicolor process _ the
best way to preserve a color film _ it had been stored in poor
conditions and had badly deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   With Technicolor, a beam splitter in the camera separates the
blue, red and green light waves of the color spectrum. Each is
recorded on a separate piece of black-and-white film. Black and
white doesn't fade over time, as color film does.
</P>
<P>
   To make a pristine new print, each of the three black-and-white
films are dyed the appropriate color _ red, blue or green _ and
then combined to create a full-color print.
</P>
<P>
   This three-strip process is time-consuming and expensive. By the
early '70s, Technicolor had been replaced with Eastman Color, a
single-negative color film like the film used in household cameras
to make color prints. But Eastman Color film fades with time;
three-strip Technicolor, because it's based on black-and-white
elements, should always produce true color.
</P>
<P>
   That's the theory anyway. In the case of ``Rear Window,'' the
original Technicolor elements were either missing or in bad shape,
forcing Harris to work backward. He took an old Eastman Color
negative used to make exhibition prints and then used a beam
splitter to break each frame down into separate blue, red and green
negatives.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time Technicolor's expensive three-dye process
had been employed since 1974's ``The Godfather Part II,'' the last
feature film to be shot in that process.
</P>
<P>
   But then even the best Eastman Color negative Harris could find
showed signs of fading, meaning every shot had to be adjusted to
bring back the film's original intense hues.
</P>
<P>
   So how was an acknowledged masterpiece like ``Rear Window''
allowed to deteriorate so badly?
</P>
<P>
   ``The rights to Hitchcock's films reverted to him in '67, and he
was ill-advised,'' Harris said. ``He was told to keep certain
elements and junk everything else, and that was really bad advice,
because it limited what we had to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as bad, these elements were stored not at the studio but
in a large commercial storage facility where the temperature was 55
at night and 110 during the day. That is precisely how you
shouldn't store film.''
</P>
<P>
   The original soundtrack to the film has been lost; the restored
``Rear Window'' uses the best sound elements from numerous 35mm
exhibition prints, which have been cleaned up digitally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using digital sound techniques, you can eliminate hiss and
pops,'' Harris said. ``But theater sound systems used when `Rear
Window' came out in '54 had been in place since the '30s. These old
systems weren't terribly reliable in producing perfect sound, but
they were adequate for that time. The trouble is that when you play
these old soundtracks on a modern theater system, you can detect
every little change in ambiance. It magnifies the old recordings'
inherent flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris and his partner, Jim Katz, take a lot of time on their
projects. In the last 14 years they've worked on only four other
restorations: ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' ``My Fair Lady,''
``Spartacus'' and ``Vertigo.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes their work involves sleuthing. For ``Lawrence'' and
``Spartacus,'' Harris tracked down scenes trimmed before those
epics went into general release.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who cut his teeth assisting in Kevin Brownlow's epic
restoration of Abel Gance's silent film ``Napoleon,'' seethes when
he considers that few movie studios take film preservation
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been lucky to work a lot with Universal, which is
probably the most restoration-conscious studio. After we'd done as
much to `Rear Window' as we could on our budget, they came up with
another $70,000 to make sure it was as good as it could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, then you've got Disney, which had a very good
preservation department but shut it down because of
belt-tightening. God forbid they should cut into Michael Eisner's
salary to save their movies for posterity.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Harris' big gripes is that many films are restored only
to the point where they look reasonably good for video release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Video hides a multitude of sins,'' Harris said. He described
this kind of thinking as, `` `We're not going to worry about it
now, and in 25 years it will be somebody else's problem.'
Meanwhile, you don't have a version of the film good enough to
project in a theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, it doesn't take that much money to save a
film.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently Harris is working to restore ``Williamsburg, the Story
of a Patriot,'' the short subject that has been playing
continuously for nearly 40 years at the visitors' center in
Colonial Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years they've made print after print of the negative,
which is now completely faded. We're trying to find enough money to
get the project going. I mean, 50 million people have seen this.
The problem is they need $1.8 million to do the job, and they've
raised only about $800,000.''
</P>
<P>
   So when does Harris think he'll be able to start work on the
project?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I've already started,'' he said. ``I've been at it 12 or
14 months, working pro bono so far.''

MICHAEL DOUGLAS ACTS UP A GENTLE STORM IN `WONDER BOYS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   Michael Douglas was in the middle of
costume fittings for ``Wonder Boys'' when it struck him that he
might be going out on a limb.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I was trying on the pink chenille woman's bathrobe I'd be
wearing for half the movie,'' he recalled in a recent phone
conversation, ``and it suddenly occurred to me, `Oh man, should I
be doing this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. For his work in ``Wonder Boys'' Douglas, 55, has
received some of the best reviews of his career. He portrays a
disheveled college professor and struggling novelist whose life
comes unwound over one crazy weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, ``Wonder Boys'' is a change of pace for the dynamic
Douglas, who in recent years has specialized in playing powerful
alpha males.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, this is one of the most vulnerable roles I've been
offered in a long while,'' said Douglas, an Oscar winner for his
ruthless tycoon in ``Wall Street.'' ``The last two screen images of
me audiences got was in `A Perfect Murder' and `The Game,' and
those were both pretty dominant characters. But at this point in my
career I figured it was time to do something different.''
</P>
<P>
   But how did a successful, powerful guy like Michael Douglas _ a
guy who, after all, can win the heart of a beauty like actress
Catherine Zeta-Jones _ get into the head of Grady Tripp, a loser
who once wrote a best-selling novel but now devotes himself to
chasing women and avoiding responsibility?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one similarity between me and Grady it's that I
know what it's like to peak early,'' Douglas said. ``I was only 30
when I won the Oscar for producing `One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest.' And I remember thinking at the time: `Well, it's all
downhill from here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Because as an actor I was a late bloomer. Through most of
college I never got around to declaring, and I finally reluctantly
got into acting because both my parents are actors and I figured
theater would be an easy major.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, later I got into it with a vengeance, did
off-Broadway shows and films and television. But I was never what
you'd call a gifted actor. I really had to fight to define my
craft.''
</P>
<P>
   What people forget, Douglas said, is that when he accepted a
role on the long-running TV series ``The Streets of San Francisco''
he was, in effect, declaring himself a TV actor. Today performers
can have both television and movie careers, but in the early '70s
the two worlds rarely met.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy to make the transition from TV back to feature
films,'' Douglas said. ``What I did after `Cuckoo's Nest' was to
produce films like `The China Syndrome' and `Romancing the Stone,'
and cast myself in them. But I also produced `Starman' and had
planned on starring in it. The reason Jeff Bridges ended up in that
role is that I wasn't approved by the studio making the movie. I
wasn't bankable enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really get much acknowledgement until `Wall Street'
in '86.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said he had plenty of reasons to do ``Wonder Boys.'' For
one thing, it was directed by Curtis Hanson, who was coming off the
success of ``L.A. Confidential.'' For another, he was crazy about
the supporting cast, which included Tobey Maguire
(``Pleasantville,'' ``Ride With the Devil,'' ``The Cider House
Rules'') as one of Grady's problem students, Oscar-winner Frances
McDormand as his love interest and Robert Downey Jr. as Grady's
flamboyant book editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was blessed with such a good script and such a good
director who has his own ideas of comic timing. One of the things I
love about this picture is that the laughter comes from the pauses
between dialogue. To get those laughs, to sit in a theater and hear
how they affect an audience, is a real joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said he's taking things easy these days, preparing for
his wedding to Zeta-Jones (his second, pending a divorce; her
first) and the birth of their child. And he spends lots of time
with his famous father, Kirk Douglas, who still is recovering from
the stroke he suffered two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad and I talk a lot. As fellow actors we can share and
commiserate a lot. He's very compassionate, always ready to share
his advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, during those years my career was in flux he was
giving lots of unsolicited advice.''

HANDICAPPING SUPER TUESDAY: HOW TO TELL WHO WON

   LOS ANGELES _ When the primaries or caucuses came one at a time
_ like Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan _ it was
easy to tell whether Gov. George W. Bush or Sen. John McCain was up
or down. And even when there were three contests last Tuesday,
figuring out who was up was easy because one candidate, Bush, swept
Virginia, Washington state and North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be so simple this Tuesday, with 13 Republican
contests. Tuesday is the biggest and most important single day of
the primary season. And, perhaps, the most confusing. Consider the
possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   Bush Triumph
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is the top Republican vote-getter in California, he will
capture all of that state's delegates _ the largest trove of any
state. He is well ahead in the polls there. If he also wins New
York, where he and McCain are neck and neck in the polls, Bush
would have won the two biggest prizes. If Bush wins Ohio, the third
big prize, he would be unstoppable in his march to the nomination.
The bonus would be if Bush also won Georgia and other states where
he leads in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   California Dreaming
</P>
<P>
   The dream scenario in Austin: Bush wins the states above but
also beats McCain in California's ``beauty contest'' _ surpassing
him in the popular vote among Republicans, independents and
Democrats. Only Republican votes count toward delegates, but if
McCain does not prevail with those other voters, he would be hard
pressed to make the case that he would be the most broadly
appealing nominee in the general election. McCain's advisers have
given up hope of winning the delegates in California. But they
argue that if McCain wins the popular vote _ especially finishing
ahead of Al Gore and Bill Bradley _ that would at least assure him
bragging rights for another week.
</P>
<P>
   McCain Triumph
</P>
<P>
   The one safe bet among McCain's advisers is that he will sweep
New England, where voters tend to be more moderate _ and more
disposed to an insurgent. His camp's best hope is that he could
claim victory by winning Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island and
Vermont plus New York and the beauty contest in California. If
McCain could rack up those victories, and also win in Ohio, the
senator would make it a real race. In Ohio, Democrats and
independents can vote in the Republican primary, but Democrats have
their own primary and many may not cross over to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed Verdict _ or the Big Muddle
</P>
<P>
   If Bush wins, say, the delegates in California, but McCain
triumphs in New York, they could each claim an important victory.
Then the candidate who captures Ohio could declare himself as
having the edge. But what if Bush wins California and New York, but
McCain triumphs in Ohio, Missouri and New England? Given McCain's
victory in Michigan, he could then claim that he was the only
vote-getter in the Midwest, a critical battleground in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Far-Fetched _ But You Never Know
</P>
<P>
   Pundits and pollsters have been confounded at every turn. So no
possibility can be dismissed. Take Georgia, the only Southern state
up for grabs. It is assumed to be another conservative fire wall
for Bush, as was South Carolina. But the race is open to all
voters. What if McCain's independent appeal stirs moderates? Bush
could always prevail in Connecticut, where he was born and where
his grandfather was a U.S. senator. But polls show that many voters
in that fairly moderate state find McCain most appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Race
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley are also on ballots in 16 states Tuesday.
Bradley insists that March 7 is his ``takeoff'' day. But polls show
him way down everywhere _ barely ahead of Alan Keyes in the popular
vote in California. The one state where Bradley may be a bit of a
factor is his childhood state of Missouri. The primary is open to
all registered voters, though Bush is well ahead in the polls. For
all the talk of taking off, what Bradley really is hoping for is a
miracle _ somewhere, anywhere.

FROM ITS BEGINNING, NEW YORK HAS BEEN SHAPED BY DIVERSITY

   NEW YORK _ Consider the class roster for History 284, which Leo
Hershkowitz has been teaching for 35 years at Queens College. The
last names of the undergraduates enrolled in this winter's course
on the history of New York State are Castillo, Demas, de la Garza,
DiPietro, Felley, Grossman, Guido, Lazzinnaro, Schultz, Sylecki and
Ting.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A half-hour away in Brooklyn, under a blue tarpaulin in the
shadow of the Williamsburg Bridge, was a clutch of strikers outside
one of the landmarks of industrial New York, the Domino Sugar
refinery. Huddled against the cold are Winston Jack, who was born
in Trinidad; John Houck, a mix of German, Irish and Native
American; and Tony Castillo, who is Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole country's here,'' said one of the strikers, Hernando
Gallego, who is of Colombian stock. ``You've got people from all
over the place right here. We get along. We're adults already.''
</P>
<P>
   From one end of the Empire State to the other, from the East
River in the south to the St. Lawrence in the north, from Grand
Island in the Niagara River to Long Island in the Atlantic Ocean,
from the Canadian border to the New Jersey line and back again, are
the hops of the most astonishing ethnic ale ever brewed _ the raw
materials of an astonishing, and raw, political culture.
</P>
<P>
   George Gershwin once called New York, which on Tuesday holds one
of the most critical tests in the presidential primary calendar,
``a rendezvous of the nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Diversity is the great virtue and verity of our national life,
and nowhere is diversity _ in all its manifestations _ on display
with the verve of New York State.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't talk about politics in New York State without
talking about ethnicity,'' said Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.
``Ethnicity is not part of every election in New York. It is every
election in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's politicians munch on knishes and kielbasa. They
attend lawn fetes in Buffalo and street fairs in Manhattan. They
wear Yankee hats and yarmulkes, they spar over St. Patrick's Day
parades.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have close to 200 ethnicities in the United States and
there is not any one of them that is not respectably and formidably
present in New York State,'' said the former governor, Mario M.
Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   The state is a place of spectacle (the Woodstock music festival
of 1969) and of spectacular engineering achievements (the Brooklyn
Bridge), of showmen (Florenz Ziegfeld) and showmanship (the 1927
New York Yankees), of homely ideas gone national (the Buffalo
chicken wing, invented in a tavern called the Anchor Bar) and of
local tastes assiduously cultivated (Saranac Root Beer, bottled in
Utica), of man's ability to improve on nature (Frederick Law
Olmsted's Central Park in New York and Delaware Park in Buffalo)
and of nature's ability to intoxicate man (Letchworth State Park,
which would be a tourist mecca if God hadn't carved the Grand
Canyon, and Niagara Falls, which would be a tourist attraction even
if God hadn't invented marriage), of soaring structures of great
beauty (the polished chrome steel atop the Chrysler Building) and
of soaring ideas of great beauty (the equality of women, born in
Seneca Falls), of great joy (the ticker-tape parade honoring
Charles Lindbergh in 1927) and of great despair (the wreckage of
Wall Street only two years later), the home of some of the greatest
schemers (the Drexel Burnham financiers who built a fortune in junk
bonds) and greatest dreamers (Robert Moses, who built the parks and
roads of modern New York) ever to stride the American continent,
the playground of character (Joe DiMaggio) and characters (former
Mayor Edward I. Koch).
</P>
<P>
   This is a place so big that even its small things (``The
Sidewalks of New York'') are the subject of song, and of legend.
This is a place so rich that an Upper West Side storefront called
Murray's Sturgeon Shop could become a celebrated power center and
that a Beef on Weck sandwich made of the cuttings of a center
steamship round and placed lovingly inside a Kimmelweck roll
(topped with pretzel salt and caraway seeds) could become a
cultural icon in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Together the people of New York State have produced one of the
most remarkable societies on earth, a culture that celebrates,
accentuates and luxuriates in the differences that, by miracle or
magic, make a mess of the mathematics of culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here the city orders you to come out and greet it, in a
thousand strident voices, with a million golden, beckoning
fingers,'' the late Bayard Still, who headed the New York
University history department, once wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And here the state orders its politicians to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Spitzer is part of a state government headed by
a governor, George E. Pataki, who is the son of an Italian mother
and a Hungarian father. The lieutenant governor, Mary O. Donohue,
is Irish. The comptroller, H. Carl McCall, is African American
(and, in 1998, the biggest vote-getter in the state). The speaker
of the state Assembly, Sheldon Silver, is an Orthodox Jew who lives
in the union-sponsored projects of the Lower East Side. The Senate
majority leader is Joe Bruno of Glens Falls, the son of an Italian
laborer who shoveled coal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers have raised the art of balancing a ticket to a
science, with masters in both parties. In 1961, the Republicans in
New York City put up a slate that included Louis Lefkowitz
(Jewish), Paul Fino (Italian) and John J. Gilhooley (Irish). Then
again, in 1949 the Democrats put up a slate that included William
O'Dwyer (Irish), Vincent R. Impelliteri (Italian) and Lazarus
Joseph (Jewish).
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between these two remarkable slates was the Albany
regency of W. Averill Harriman, a governor who didn't fit any of
these ethnic categories. He had the misfortune of running in 1958
against another member of his own peculiar group, old-line
millionaires, Nelson A. Rockefeller, who campaigned with a
Westchester assemblyman named Malcolm Wilson, who was Irish
American and a master of the ethnic geography of New York State.
</P>
<P>
   In the last century, three New Yorkers stand as classic symbols
of the way ethnicity crowded into politics in New York State.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Alfred E. Smith, the first Irish Catholic to win
major statewide office and, in 1928, the first Catholic
presidential nominee. What elected him to the governor's chair in
Albany in 1918 _ his ability to embody the immigrant experience _
defeated him for the presidency in 1928, which is itself testimony
to the notion that New York is different.
</P>
<P>
   The second was Fiorello La Guardia, elected mayor of New York in
1933. He thought of himself as a part-time Episcopalian, but he was
known for being half-Italian and half-Jewish, thus appealing to two
of the three predominant immigrant groups in the city. He won a
House seat in 1920 after he challenged his rival, an assimilated
Jewish Democrat put forward by Tammany Hall, to a debate conducted
entirely in Yiddish. He was a natural magnet for progressive voters
in a city whose newest citizens prided themselves not on the
squalor of their neighborhoods but on the excellence of the city
beyond their doors _ including a public-health system that was the
finest in the nation, a public-education system that propelled
immigrants into the professions and the mainstream of the nation,
and a public-transportation system that moved people, safely and
far.
</P>
<P>
   The third was Jacob K. Javits, a four-term senator who appealed
to Yankee farmers upstate because he was a Republican, to Jews in
New York because he was one of them, to suburbanites because he was
progressive, to Italians and Irish because he was the son of
immigrants and to Hispanics because of his ties to the
garment-worker unions. (He lost his reelection bid in 1980 to a
suburban Italian-American in a three-way race with a Jewish woman.)

SQUADS THAT TRIPPED UP WALKING THE BAD WALK 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   Several days into the 1992 Los Angeles riots, as exhausted
police officers on 12-hour shifts had just about restored order, a
patrol supervisor walked into the Rampart District station house
and encountered a scene that made him angry.
</P>
<P>
   Every member of the precinct's Crash unit, an elite and
secretive anti-gang squad of more than a dozen men, was playing
cards or working out. So he complained to his boss. Two days later
his tires were slashed, and someone confronted him about tattling
on the officers of Crash (the acronym for Community Resources
Against Street Hoodlums). The officer replaced the tires and they
were slashed again. The message, of course, was clear. Anyone who
meddled with this squad would pay a price.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was an example of the Crash culture that fostered
such widespread corruption that the Los Angeles Police Department
moved to disband all of the units last week.
</P>
<P>
   It came just a week after four New York City police officers
from a special squad called the Street Crime Unit were acquitted in
the death of Amadou Diallo, a 22-year-old street peddler killed in
a barrage of 41 bullets as he stood, unarmed, outside his apartment
building in the Bronx last year. Critics have accused the Street
Crime Unit of promoting a reckless, cowboy culture that is separate
from the rest of the New York Police Department. Its unofficial
slogan is ``We own the night.''
</P>
<P>
   But where the New York unit may have been reckless, the Crash
members at the Rampart precinct were almost certainly premeditated
criminals, according to a chilling 362-page report released last
week by the Los Angeles Police Department. They committed
widespread perjury, stole and dealt in illegal drugs. They even
shot a handcuffed and unarmed man in the head. When he survived,
they testified against him and he was sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that the Street Crime Unit was engaged in
any such lawlessness in New York City. Still, critics say that
these units frequently develop problems like those in Los Angeles
and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``These specialized units need very close supervision,'' said
Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of
Nebraska at Omaha. ``They're just a thousand disasters waiting to
happen. They loosen the bonds of supervision, and it's an
invitation to trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who has written a book on civilian oversight of police
departments that is to be published in the fall, said there is a
long history of problems with special units, ``whether it's vice
units in the old days, or street-crime units or gang units.''
Systemic corruption in New York City's vice squad, for instance,
was brought to light by Frank Serpico, an undercover detective, in
the 1970s, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current troubles in Los Angeles and New York are vastly
different in scale, but there is an important similarity, Walker
said. ``In both cases, the real problem is with the political
message they get: Get out there, get tough and get results, and
we're not gonna ask questions about how you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And in both cities, he said, the reactions of the mayors have
been weak. ``In New York and Los Angeles, there's sort of this
`drop dead' attitude _ `Go away. We don't have any problems.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Diallo shooting last year, the Street Crime Unit,
which had operated from a headquarters on Randall's Island, has
been reorganized and its members have been placed under the
supervision of local police commanders throughout the city. The
unit had been established in an attempt to combat the high rate of
violent crimes like rape, robbery and murder, and by all accounts
it did just that. But the drop in crime came at a price. Thousands
of innocent people, mostly minorities, were stopped and questioned,
frisked and even arrested by the unit's officers, who dressed
casually in street clothes and rode around in unmarked cars.
Officers joined the unit by volunteering, a practice that, some
critics say, can draw in less mature officers.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the Street Crime Unit last year, Police
Commissioner Howard Safir said that the ``unfortunate truth is that
communities of color are disproportionately victimized by violent
street crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles anti-gang units operated out of local police
stations, but they had little interaction with their colleagues.
The Crash officers at the Rampart Division even wore unique jackets
and had special patches; some of them got identical tattoos. They
were so exclusive and stand-offish that regular officers and
supervisors eventually avoided having much involvement with them,
even when calling for backup, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether the problems extend to the Crash
units outside the Rampart area, said Zev Yaroslavsky, a Los Angeles
County commissioner. But it is clear, he said, that the practices
of the Rampart Crash Unit were well known among many officers in
other locations. ``People all over the place were trying to get
into this unit,'' Yaroslavsky said. But officers could join only if
they were sponsored by someone already in the unit. ``To get into
Rampart Crash, you had to pledge like a fraternity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate result of the Crash scandal will be a serious
undermining of the criminal justice system in Los Angeles and
elsewhere, Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrick Bobb, a special counsel to Los Angeles County on police
matters, said last week's report indicates that the Rampart squad
was ``essentially a lawless unit.'' The problems in New York are
different, he said. But the combination of the Diallo shooting and
the attack on Abner Louima, who was assaulted by police officers in
a station house bathroom in New York, as well as the Rodney King
beating and the current scandal in Los Angeles, have ``revived
interest in the question of how we police and what the most
effective methods of civilian oversight are.''

 NEW YORK: ... Jewish woman.)  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But these are not the only groups that are prominent in New
York, and contemporary times are not the only moment when ethnic
diversity has marked New York. As early as 1646, Father Isaac
Jogues wrote in his ``Description of Novum Belgium'':
</P>
<P>
   ``On the island of Manhate, and in its environs, there may well
be four or five hundred men of different sects and nations: the
Director General told me that there were men of eighteen different
languages; they are scattered here and there on the river, above
and below, as the beauty and convenience of the spot has invited
each to settle.''
</P>
<P>
   Although only Calvinists were legally welcome in New York,
Catholics, English Puritans, Lutherans, Anabaptists and Mennonites
nonetheless turned up in the colony. By 1654, there were Jews, too.
New York State was the only place in the 13 colonies where the
founders were not English in origin. Because the settlement was
planted by the Dutch, it was separate _ and different. The Dutch
brought a special brand of tolerance, dating from the 1579 edict of
Utrecht, and an appreciation for diversity, growing out of the
Golden Age that produced the Dutch Empire and the painters
Rembrandt, Reubens and Hals.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, New York only grew to be more diverse, not less. The
Erie Canal, built by hand from Waterford to Buffalo by Irish
workers, took Poles, Germans and Ukranians to Amsterdam, Utica,
Syracuse, Rochester and Western New York. Louis C. Jones, a former
director of the New York State Historical Association, said that
the mules on the towpath brought the world to and through New York,
``the bloodstream of a nation flowing ever faster.''
</P>
<P>
   A map of New York City in 1920 shows distinct Chinese, Syrian,
Turkish, Greek, Russian, Czech, Hungarian, Finnish and black
enclaves. Harlem, predominantly German, Italian, Irish and Jewish
in 1900, grew progressively African-American. Large groups of
Dominicans became prominent in Washington Heights and areas of the
Bronx by the mid-1980s. Nearly half the immigrants to Manhattan and
Brooklyn now are from the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Today foreign-born residents account for more than a third of
the population of New York _ and more than half of the population
in Woodside, Queens. Today's New York has a larger percentage of
immigrants than at any time since 1910, at the peak of the great
movement through Ellis Island. At the other end of the historical
continuum, there are nine Native-American reservations in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   New York remains the home to more blacks than anyplace else in
the nation and African Americans play a critical role in the
state's politics; blacks account for nearly a quarter of registered
Democrats in the state and thus are essential to a winning
coalition in the struggle between Vice President Al Gore and former
senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The first blacks arrived as indentured servants in 1626. In the
20th century, the barriers to the professions forced many blacks to
work as caterers and in service industries. The Rev. Adam Clayton
Powell Sr., the father of the congressman, for example, was a
minister _ but even after he was ordained he worked as a waiter at
the Windsor Hotel in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even so, New York was more open to blacks than almost anyplace
in the country, which is why the tide of internal migration to New
York was so thick, especially to Harlem, which by 1930 had 165,000
black residents. The Harlem Renaissance gave a platform to Zora
Neal Hurston, a stage to Paul Robeson, a forum to Marcus Garvey and
an outlet to Duke Ellington, whose ``Take the A Train'' is about
the subway ride from 59th Street to 125th.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many experts believe that the survival and success of New
York is due in large measure to blacks. Richard P. Nathan, the
director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State
University of New York at Albany, points to the vibrancy of the
400,000 middle-class African-Americans of southeast Queens.
</P>
<P>
   New York has an inexhaustible ability to absorb and assimilate.
Great numbers of Puerto Ricans, spurred by cheap air
transportation, began flowing into New York in the late 1940s and
for many years were the poorest urban minority, in part because
language was a big impediment to social advancement. But Herman
Badillo developed a political base for Puerto Ricans in New York
and emerged as a prominent citywide reformer, finding allies like
Robert Abrams, later an attorney general and Senate candidate, and
Harrison J. Goldin, later comptroller of New York City, both
liberal Jews. Today, Badillo, who became the first Puerto Rican
member of the House with a vote, is a lawyer, a Republican and
chairman of the New York City Board of Higher Education, and two
Puerto Ricans have House seats from New York. But perhaps the
leading Puerto Rican figure in the state holds no elected office at
all. He is Dennis Rivera, a union leader who heads the major
hospital local in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Statue of Liberty opened the gates of the country to
the wretched refuse of other shores, the New York establishment,
though stubborn and resistant, eventually and always opened the
gates of power to the people who passed through. The antagonism
inherent in this process was heartbreaking and discouraging, but it
also created a spur _ a drive to overcome the barriers. In the end,
it was the barriers as much as the openness that made the city and
state of New York great.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the work of making the new country occurred at City
College, which has a special place in American history as a ladder
of social mobility. The college, the first public institution of
higher education in the United States, counts nine Nobel Prize
winners among its graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a college for the working class and the
immigrant poor,'' said Stanford A. Roman, interim president of City
College. ``The only thing that's changed is the composition of
these groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Education is only one of the state's resources, though New York
is the only place in the world with a school offering a bachelor of
science degree in cosmetics and fragrance marketing. It is also
home to 59 Fortune 500 headquarters, the most in the nation. The
New York Stock Exchange accounts for more than four-fifths of the
capitalization of the entire country. But there is also the New
York Coffee and Sugar Exchange and the commodity exchange composed
of the New York Hide Exchange, National Raw Silk Exchange and the
Rubber Exchange. The state has banks, brokerages and, retailers all
with folklores of their own, and there is a reliable reminder of
that every Christmas, when ``Miracle on 34th Street'' is aired.
</P>
<P>
   Its cabbage producers, concentrated south of Lake Ontario and in
Long Island, are the most prodigious in the nation, and the state
ranks second (to Washington) in apples and second (to Vermont) in
maple syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is iron, oil and salt mining, lumbering, the great
port of New York, huge quarries with limestone, marble and gypsum,
the incalculable resource of the Mohawk Valley and the Hudson _ the
``great streame,'' in the words of Henry Hudson, who piloted his
Half Moon into the river in 1609.
</P>
<P>
   But oddly enough, New York is not really rich in history;
Massachusetts and Virginia were the settings for far more momentous
events.
</P>
<P>
   Look in an index of an American history text and you'll find
almost nothing except for the Civil War draft riots, the Seneca
Falls convention, Boss Tweed and the assassination of President
William McKinley in Buffalo. Perhaps the most important event in
the state in the 20th century occurred on a Saturday afternoon in
1911, when a fire swept through the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. and in
a quarter of an hour killed 146 people, most of them Italian and
Jewish girls between the ages of 13 and 23. The fire led to the
passage of progressive labor laws, fire-safety codes and workers'
compensation plans.
</P>
<P>
   But none can rival New York's claim to preeminence in a
momentous, and deeply American, historic process: the assimilation
of new peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigration is what saved New York and is saving New York
now,'' said Judge Edward R. Korman, who several times a year
presides over the legal process that makes immigrants American
citizens. From the bench at the US District Court in Brooklyn his
eyes fasten on the eager and proud faces of ordinary people joining
a special people and, beyond them on the back wall, on oil murals
retrieved from the dining hall at Ellis Island, pictures of
Americans in factories and farms doing the back-breaking work of
making a country. ``You look out at these ceremonies and you get
goose bumps. You see the world.''

A PROPER BRITISH UPBRINGING: OH, THANK YOU. THAT HURT. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A very English debate broke out six years ago in the
letters page of The Times of London over the legacy of one Anthony
Chenevix-Trench, the headmaster of Eton College from 1964 to 1970.
When he was drunk, which was quite often, Chenevix-Trench had an
unpleasant habit of beating the students with a savagery unusual
even by Eton standards, and then sobbing penitentially afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, a number of his old pupils didn't seem to hold it
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hourmouzios, for example, reminisced to The Times
that the headmaster ``once flogged the living daylights out of me
with a strap on my bare backside'' and went on to beat all 21
students in a divinity class in a single afternoon. ``However, this
rather Victorian figure who believed in the value of corporal
punishment,'' Hourmouzios noted, ``was a fine teacher who taught me
Latin.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many European countries have wrestled with the
question of corporal punishment, with some even making it illegal
for parents to hit their children. Such proposals are heard here
too, without much chance of success. Although the British finally
outlawed the classic practice of caning, beating and flogging in
independent schools last year, the debate over hitting in the home
has been partly colored by the legacy of beatings some lawmakers
received during their school days _ at times from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Many Britons in public life today, for instance, have recalled
being flogged by Douglas Hurd, Margaret Thatcher's foreign
secretary, a notoriously avid doler-of-punishments who was known at
Eton as ``Hitler Hurd.'' Sometimes caning is almost mentioned as a
mark of pride, a rite of passage completed. It is not a coincidence
that the French call spanking among adults ``le vice Anglais,''
recognizing that it is one offshoot of a society where authority
and love were once linked with childhood violence, pain and
stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last century, no one seriously tried to change
the system. In the last 20 years, though, politicians began to
realize that the state could no longer sanction such behavior, at
least not in schools. In 1986, corporal punishment was outlawed in
state schools _ by just one vote in the House of Commons. In 1999,
after an impassioned debate in which a number of legislators
recalled how they had been beaten as schoolchildren, and quite
right, too, it was finally outlawed in private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has now shifted to corporal punishment in the home,
with the Labor government trying to rewrite the law to set out
exactly what constitutes acceptable hitting. The current law, which
dates back to Victorian times, was recently thrown into limbo when
the European Court of Human Rights ruled that it had failed to
protect a young British boy from ``inhuman or degrading
punishment'' by his stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Corporal punishment of children is now illegal in eight European
countries, including Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Latvia. But in
Britain, the Labor government says it will not take that road,
pointing to a number of surveys in which Britons have
overwhelmingly said they supported the right of parents to hit
their children. ``There is a common-sense distinction to be made
between the sort of mild physical rebuke which occurs in families
and which most loving parents consider acceptable, and the beating
of children,'' the government said in a position paper.
</P>
<P>
   But Children Are Unbeatable, a coalition of more than 200
organizations from children's charities to groups representing
adults who were beaten as children, vehemently disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying that everyone who hits a child is a bad
parent,'' said Elizabeth Garrett, a leader of Barnardo's, a
children's advocacy group. ``We're saying that everyone in society
has to consider how they may be condoning violence against children
if they insist on hitting their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The group faces an uphill battle, because many Britons believe
that the government should not interfere with parental discipline.
Some also agree with Baroness Park of Monmouth, who said last year
in the House of Lords, ``a spank and a kiss solves everything,
whereas cold-hearted treatment and reasoning leaves a much greater
mark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong strand in English culture that thinks this is
the best way of disciplining children,'' said Alexander Chancellor,
a columnist for The Guardian and The Times of London who said,
nonetheless, that it ``would never have occurred to me to hit my
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was at Eton in the 1950s, Chancellor said, he cunningly
avoided getting beaten, even as schoolmates like Auberon Waugh,
Evelyn Waugh's son, were flogged constantly for offenses like
stealing coal for the fireplaces in their freezing bedrooms.
``Luckily, I'm a bit weedy, whereas he was very rebellious and was
getting beaten all the time,'' Chancellor said of Waugh, now editor
of the Literary Review. ``You'd almost want to beat him now.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the former Etonians beaten by the thousands, many still
contemplate their experiences with a curiously nostalgic
resentment, as the letters in The Times revealed.
</P>
<P>
   One letter-writer told how he was sent to Chenevix-Trench's
study on several occasions for what was then called ``six of the
best,'' only to be pleasantly surprised by the headmaster's sudden
change of heart. ``After some discussion he would remove two sabres
from the wall, throw one at me, we would fence (he was an expert
swordsman) and the proposed beating would be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Matthew Thompson-Royds missed the Chenevix-Trench
era but didn't avoid being beaten. ``Mercifully, my punishment was
carried out by `Leggy' Lambert, the lower master,'' in the 1950s,
he wrote. Still, he seemed sorry to have lived before the era of
human-rights courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, I wonder, would the bill be if all who had been flogged
at Eton obtained full compensation?'' he asked.

IKE'S GRANDDAUGHTER IS NEW CEO OF KC-BASED ORGANIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA R. HOCKADAY  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Mary Eisenhower
remembers first hearing about People to People International around
the dinner table at her grandfather's farm near Gettysburg, Pa.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Granddad believed that people are born good and that if we
used the goodness in people to establish world relationships, we
could have a lasting peace,'' Eisenhower said. ``He learned that
philosophy from growing up in Abilene, Kan. He felt that people
didn't have problems, governments did. If there were a way to jump
over the governments and get straight to the people, we could
become friends, and friends would not want to fight each other.''
</P>
<P>
   As the new chief executive officer of the Kansas City-based
People to People, Eisenhower carries on the mission of her
grandfather Dwight D. Eisenhower, who founded the international
organization in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Eisenhower travels around the globe, chartering chapters,
speaking at worldwide conferences and developing ties between the
United States and other countries. She also oversees student and
professional exchange programs that allow U.S. citizens to live and
learn abroad, often while staying with host families. Other
programs bring people to the United States for three-week visits in
American homes.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower speaks modestly about her close ties with the World
War II five-star general who was the 34th president of the United
States (1952-1960) and was known and loved the world over as
``Ike.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1955, Mary Eisenhower was christened in the Blue Room of
the White House and attended family Christmas dinners in the State
Dining Room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to use a finger bowl at age 3,'' she said, laughing.
``In 1954, Granddad bought the farm near Gettysburg, Pa., and
retired there with my grandmother after leaving the White House. It
was only an hour-and-15-minute drive from Washington, so he could
get there easily, but when he'd say he was coming home from the
office, I never really thought about it being the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family and I lived next door to the farm, so we were there
all the time. I can remember Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle
and Nikita Khrushchev visiting at different times. Churchill was
drafted into changing the diapers for my sister's doll, and I
remember asking De Gaulle why his glasses were so thick.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridges of friendship
</P>
<P>
   Many years later at a People to People conference in California,
Mary Eisenhower met Sergei Khrushchev, son of the late Soviet
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergei and I were both speaking at the conference, when I
looked across the room and saw him,'' Eisenhower said. ``He looked
like his father, whom I'd met when I was very little. I was
introduced to Sergei, and he made a few jokes. I thought, `This is
a nice man.' At the time (1996) he was still a Russian citizen, but
he and his wife have since become U.S. citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Eisenhower's ability to communicate and make friends easily
is an asset for People to People, said Bill Jarvis, international
board president.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are drawn to her,'' Jarvis said. ``She is sincere,
down-to-earth, and she is a great speaker. I heard her at the
conference in Newport Beach, Calif., in 1996. She wants to carry on
the legacy her grandfather started and to keep his dream alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, assistant treasurer of Hallmark Cards Inc., helps
continue another legacy _ the invaluable partnership between People
to People and Hallmark. In the beginning, the State Department
operated People to People. Wanting to transform it from a
government to a private, nonprofit organization, Ike called on an
old friend, Joyce C. Hall, founder of Hallmark Cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather asked Joyce Hall if he would give the seed
money to enable People to People to go private,'' Mary Eisenhower
said. ``Joyce Hall said, `Yes, but I don't do anything outside of
Kansas City.' .MDBR/.MDNM/''
</P>
<P>
   So the headquarters moved to Kansas City in 1961, and the Hall
family has been a major benefactor ever since. Offices are housed
in a red brick mansion at 501 E. Armour Blvd. The living room,
filled with mementos from around the world, is known as the Joyce
C. Hall Room.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower arrived in Kansas City a year ago to work with People
to People. She had lived in Huntsville, Ala., where she owned and
operated an engineering firm with her former husband. They are now
divorced. Her son, Merrill Atwater, who turns 19 this month, is a
senior at Valley Forge Military Academy near Philadelphia. He plans
to attend Missouri Western State College in St. Joseph in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   International childhood
</P>
<P>
   Long before becoming involved with People to People, Mary
Eisenhower often met others from around the world. Her father, John
Eisenhower, who followed Ike to West Point and into the Army,
served from 1969 to 1971 as the U.S. Ambassador to Belgium.
Following the death of her husband in 1969, Mamie Eisenhower
visited her son and his family in Brussels for six months. It was a
joy for her granddaughter, Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother, whom I called Mimi, was my best friend,''
Eisenhower said. ``I could talk to her about anything. She had big
blue eyes, and they always had a sparkle. She was very feminine but
had a great belly laugh. She and Granddad both did. She said she
always wore bangs to cover up her high Carlson forehead (inherited
from a Swedish ancestor).''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Eisenhower accompanied her grandmother on the funeral train
in 1969 that bore Ike's body from Washington to his final resting
place at the Eisenhower Center in Abilene, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trip took five days,'' she said. ``There were droves of
people lined up on both sides of the track along the way. I
remember them holding signs that said: `I liked Ike.' I'll never
forget that.
</P>
<P>
   ``About two days into the trip, my grandmother said to me,
`Let's go back to see Granddad.' An honor guard was guarding the
casket. Mimi said a prayer, then got up and put her hand on the
shoulder of one of the guards and said, `Thank you for watching
over him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Mary Eisenhower was attending her grandmother's
funeral in Abilene. Mamie had had a stroke in September 1979 and
died Nov. 1, two weeks before her 83rd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had taken the cream- and gold-colored brocade gown with
her to the hospital that she'd worn to the golden wedding
anniversary party my parents had had for her and Granddad in
1966,'' Mary said. ``She wanted to be buried in it.''
</P>
<P>
   New spark
</P>
<P>
   Mary Eisenhower, with her charisma and skills, will inject new
life into People to People, believes board chairman Bill Dawson, a
native Kansas Citian who now lives in Long Beach, Calif. He and
fellow board members are counting on Eisenhower to revitalize the
organization, which has operated behind the headlines for many
years. She leaves in a week for South Africa, where she will
charter new chapters in Cape Town and Johannesburg, adding to the
more than 160 chapters in 38 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Of People to People's several exchange programs, the largest is
the Student Ambassador Program for middle and high school students.
Nearly 20,000 American youths are expected to travel to Europe and
Australia this summer for three weeks of study that includes brief
home stays with host families.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower, whose job is full of travel, has established a solid
base in Kansas City and relishes free time in her apartment on the
Country Club Plaza. It is a base, also, for any family member who
may visit. All live in the East. Her father and mother, who
divorced in 1984, have each remarried but maintain close family
ties. Older sisters Anne Eisenhower Flottl and Susan Eisenhower
Sagdeev live in New York and Pennsylvania, respectively. And
brother David and his wife, Julie Nixon Eisenhower, married 31
years and the parents of three children, are in the Philadelphia
area. David Eisenhower teaches at the Annenberg School of
Communications, University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The Eisenhower Center in Abilene, now easily accessible by car
for Mary, is a favorite destination for the youngest grandchild of
Ike and Mamie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go there to get my batteries recharged,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
   (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLICS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The GOP slugfest over
whether John McCain is baiting Catholics by painting George W. Bush
as anti-Catholic has freed a genie from a bottle corked 40 years
ago by John F. Kennedy. Democrats are rejoicing, for it was only
six years ago that the Gingrich-led House revolution showed that a
Catholic majority of voters had shifted for the first time in
decades from Democrats to Republicans on the House ballot. Before
that, Catholics split their ticket, as in voting for Ronald Reagan
but then returning to their old lunch-pail Democratic roots. By
Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   With sidebars, BOBJONES-REVIEW and MCCAIN-RELIGION-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   DARK-MATTER-REVIEW (Undated) _ Modern astronomy was supposed to
banish Aristotelian and mystical notions about the composition of
the universe, proving that everything above consists of no-nonsense
matter, that we live in a material world. But as was clear from
Dark Matter 2000, a conference held in February, the quest is only
progressing because of science's willingness to stretch the very
meaning of the word ``matter.'' This once-simple stuff is coming to
seem as ethereal as anyone could have imagined. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL-DIVIDE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The latest buzzphrase among
politicians and computer executives is the digital divide, the gulf
between those who have access to computers and the Internet and
those who do not. People in the latter category, the thinking goes,
are being shut out of the most important mode of gathering and
exchanging information in the new century. In fact, there is a
growing recognition among those dealing closely with the issue that
the term digital divide, while clever and provocative, has become a
catchall phrase for politicians with conspicuous agendas and that
the divide is a complex phenomenon that no amount of measurement
can fully explain. By Katie Hafner.
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In 1996, immigrant bashing was
in: Bob Dole, Pete Wilson and Pat Buchanan took positions that
could be seen as anti-immigrant. But what a difference four years
makes. In the 2000 campaign, nary a nasty word has been uttered
about immigrants. GOP strategists say Hispanic Americans will be to
this year's campaign what soccer moms were to the 1996 campaign.
Democratic and Republican strategists agree that Hispanics may
provide swing votes in California, New York, Texas and Florida _
which together account for half the electoral votes needed to win
the presidency. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERTUESDAY-SCENARIOS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ With the primary
and caucus schedule so far, it's been easy to keep track of whether
Gov. George W. Bush or Sen. John McCain is up or down. It may not
be so simple this Tuesday, with 13 contests. It is the biggest, and
most important single day of the primary season. And, perhaps, the
most confusing. Consider the possible scenarios. By Richard L.
Berke.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-HEELS-REVIEW (Undated) _ What's behind the comeback of high
heels? Professional women may have discovered that sex appeal is
power because it is a way to get people to do what you want. And
high heels are the prime symbol of erotic femininity, because they
inspire simultaneous fantasies of vulnerability (who can run in
them?) and of the heel as weapon. They are a gal's version of a guy
thing: the female power tool. By Elin Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.-POLICE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Scandals often require not
just scandalous facts but a trigger, a nettlesome event, to
activate public outrage. In Los Angles, for example, a police
corruption scandal in which officers brutalized, framed and shot
innocent people has suddenly erupted, after quietly simmering for
five months. At least one of the triggers, in this case, may have
been a proposed bond offering. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD-NYPD-ABUSES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A scathing report detailing
corruption and abuse in an elite-anti-crime unit of the Los Angeles
Police Department came just a week after four officers in a similar
squad in New York were acquitted in the death of an unarmed man
they shot 19 times. But where the New York officers may have been
reckless, the Los Angeles officers were almost certainly
premeditated criminals. Although there is no indication that the
New York unit has engaged in such lawlessness, critics say such
squads are risky ventures that frequently lead to problems. By Jane
Fritsch.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-SLUR-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The brush fire over John
McCain's use of the word ``gooks'' flared and faded quickly.
Asian-Americans may have wondered: Would McCain have gotten more
bad publicity from a slur against blacks or Hispanics? Some
excerpts, primarily from Internet e-mail forums directed at Asian
Americans, capture this and other sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   BRIT-CORPORAL-PUNISH-REVIEW (London) _ Britain has outlawed
corporal punishment in schools, and the debate has now shifted to
the home, with the Labor government trying to rewrite the law to
set out exactly what constitutes acceptable hitting. The current
law, which dates back to Victorian times, was recently thrown into
limbo when the European Court of Human Rights ruled that it had
failed to protect a young British boy from ``inhuman or degrading
punishment'' by his stepfather. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ U.S. agencies that worked with
Chile during the Pinochet era have been reviewing their files and
slowly revealing the degree of U.S. knowledge about the system that
killed democracy for a generation of Chileans. The full extent of
U.S. involvement with the Pinochet regime remains shrouded in
secrecy, but some facts have been coming into sharper focus. By
Diana Jean Schemo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The war on drugs, which is likely to get another
huge boost in funds, seems to be missing in action in the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' silence on drug policy, analysts say, may be
attributable to the lack of easy solutions. Or it may stem from a
widely shared belief that any position even hinting at reducing
penalties for drug use would be political suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The only headlines involving drugs in the presidential race have
been whether the candidates themselves used them _ not the uses of
the budget, which has jumped from $13.5 billion in 1996 to a
proposed $18.9 billion this year, and which includes a plan to
fight drugs in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Former senator Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore both have
admitted to using marijuana in their younger years, and Governor
George W. Bush of Texas is still trailed by unsubstantiated
allegations of cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   And while Senator John McCain says he never used illicit drugs,
his wife, Cindy, has admitted she once stole prescription drugs
from the charity she directed.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk is a major change from eight years ago, when Bill
Clinton, then a candidate, said he had smoked marijuana but had not
inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can now actually speak frankly about their past
marijuana use, and it doesn't damage them at all,'' said Michael
Massing, author of ``The Fix,'' a history of the war on drugs.
``You would think that would lead to more rational discussion about
drug policy, but it hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Massing said the refusal to discuss lesser penalties ``is
baffling in many ways because Americans have become more tolerant
on most issues. This campaign is encouraging to the fact that
anyone seen as imposing a narrow moral view has been rejected _
except on the drug issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the issue's obscurity, a 36-group coalition,
including the Young Women's Christian Association, the American
Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, has called on candidates to answer
10 questions on drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   The questions cover the candidates' stance on a $1.6 billion
Colombian aid bill; whether they support the means the United
States uses to fight drugs, with one-third of the budget going
toward treatment and prevention and two-thirds toward law
enforcement and supply interdiction; and whether the United States
should ``continue to rely so heavily on incarceration as a solution
to drug problems.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1.5 million people a year are arrested for drug
offenses. In federal prisons, 60 percent of the inmates are
sentenced for drug-related crimes, the overwhelming majority for
low-level offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug war is the biggest head-in-the-sand issue in American
policy, and we hope the candidates face up to it,'' said Kevin B.
Zeese, president of Common Sense for Drug Policy, a nonprofit group
based in Falls Church, Va. ``It's always been safe to do more of
the same, but now more of the same is getting to be absurdly
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a $20-billion-a-year project,'' Zeese said.
``We're only spending $600 million a year on after-school programs.
We say we're fighting the drug war to save our kids; I say we're
fighting it to rob our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The silence on the issue does not result from lack of knowledge.
In an unusual move, a White House official said, the US drug-policy
coordinator, Barry R. McCaffrey, told President Clinton last year
that he planned to be available to all campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey has conferred with Gore, and he met Bush for two hours
in Texas. McCaffrey has had a relationship with the Bush family
dating to the Gulf War, when Bush's father was president and
McCaffrey was a general in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four major candidates, McCain has expressed the most
hawkish positions on drug policy. He wants to increase penalties
for selling drugs, supports the death penalty for drug kingpins,
favors tightening security to stop the flow of drugs into the
country, and wants to restrict availability of methadone for heroin
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   In a policy address last month, he said the Clinton
administration was ``AWOL on the war on drugs'' and he would push
for more money and military assistance to drug-supplying nations
such as Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said little on the issue. A campaign spokesman, Scott
McClellan, said Saturday that the governor favors the Colombian
military package ``to make sure their military is well-trained and
well-equipped to fight the drug traffickers.''
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush favored tougher laws for drug offenders,
including signing legislation that allows judicial discretion to
sentence first-time offenders possessing less than one gram of
cocaine to a maximum of 180 days in jail. (Previously,
first-offenders received automatic probation.) Bush also is a
strong supporter of faith-based initiatives to fight addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore offer different solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking slightly with Clinton administration policy, Gore said
he supports giving doctors greater flexibility to prescribe
marijuana to relieve patients' pain. Otherwise, Gore closely
adheres to the framework of current policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would push for ``tougher drug penalties and
enforcement,'' would increase drug interdiction efforts, would
expand drug courts and would institute a $2 billion national media
campaign targeted at preventing youth from using drugs. He is
supportive of the Colombian plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley wants to spend more money on drug treatment. He says
that ``the more effective way to deal with the drug problem is to
tackle the demand side at home rather than at the supply side,''
said a campaign spokesman, Josh Galper.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Colombian plan, Bradley would ``give limited
assistance,'' Galper said. ``The important thing for him is that
the effort is not turned into a US war.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Weiner, spokesman for McCaffrey, said he believed drug
policy has been a non-issue because there was little disagreement
with current policy. ``We've worked hard to have this not be a
political football,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas J. Umberg, one of the architects of the Colombian aid
plan as deputy director of supply reduction in McCaffrey's office,
who recently left to rejoin his old law firm in Washington, said he
was surprised about the lack of debate.
</P>
<P>
   In polling done by his former office, he said, it was found that
``the drug issue is one of very high interest among voters, but
people's views were that we should do everything. We should
interdict, do prevention, do treatment, lock up criminals for a
long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions could squelch debate, he said, or it could
encourage candidates to make choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some large issues before policy makers now,'' Umberg
said. ``What is our international role in drug control? What should
the federal government do about treatment? What about prevention?
And how about state initiatives concerning decriminalization? You
would think there's enough to talk about.''

A PROPER BRITISH UPBRINGING: OH, THANK YOU. THAT HURT. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A very English debate broke out six years ago in the
letters page of The Times of London over the legacy of one Anthony
Chenevix-Trench, the headmaster of Eton College from 1964 to 1970.
When he was drunk, which was quite often, Chenevix-Trench had an
unpleasant habit of beating the students with a savagery unusual
even by Eton standards, and then sobbing penitentially afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, a number of his old pupils didn't seem to hold it
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Hourmouzios, for example, reminisced to The Times
that the headmaster ``once flogged the living daylights out of me
with a strap on my bare backside'' and went on to beat all 21
students in a divinity class in a single afternoon. ``However, this
rather Victorian figure who believed in the value of corporal
punishment,'' Hourmouzios noted, ``was a fine teacher who taught me
Latin.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many European countries have wrestled with the
question of corporal punishment, with some even making it illegal
for parents to hit their children. Such proposals are heard here
too, without much chance of success. Although the British finally
outlawed the classic practice of caning, beating and flogging in
independent schools last year, the debate over hitting in the home
has been partly colored by the legacy of beatings some lawmakers
received during their school days _ at times from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Many Britons in public life today, for instance, have recalled
being flogged by Douglas Hurd, Margaret Thatcher's foreign
secretary, a notoriously avid doler-of-punishments who was known at
Eton as ``Hitler Hurd.'' Sometimes caning is almost mentioned as a
mark of pride, a rite of passage completed. It is not a coincidence
that the French call spanking among adults ``le vice Anglais,''
recognizing that it is one offshoot of a society where authority
and love were once linked with childhood violence, pain and
stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last century, no one seriously tried to change
the system. In the last 20 years, though, politicians began to
realize that the state could no longer sanction such behavior, at
least not in schools. In 1986, corporal punishment was outlawed in
state schools _ by just one vote in the House of Commons. In 1999,
after an impassioned debate in which a number of legislators
recalled how they had been beaten as schoolchildren, and quite
right, too, it was finally outlawed in private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has now shifted to corporal punishment in the home,
with the Labor government trying to rewrite the law to set out
exactly what constitutes acceptable hitting. The current law, which
dates back to Victorian times, was recently thrown into limbo when
the European Court of Human Rights ruled that it had failed to
protect a young British boy from ``inhuman or degrading
punishment'' by his stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Corporal punishment of children is now illegal in eight European
countries, including Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Latvia. But in
Britain, the Labor government says it will not take that road,
pointing to a number of surveys in which Britons have
overwhelmingly said they supported the right of parents to hit
their children. ``There is a common-sense distinction to be made
between the sort of mild physical rebuke which occurs in families
and which most loving parents consider acceptable, and the beating
of children,'' the government said in a position paper.
</P>
<P>
   But Children Are Unbeatable, a coalition of more than 200
organizations from children's charities to groups representing
adults who were beaten as children, vehemently disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying that everyone who hits a child is a bad
parent,'' said Elizabeth Garrett, a leader of Barnardo's, a
children's advocacy group. ``We're saying that everyone in society
has to consider how they may be condoning violence against children
if they insist on hitting their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The group faces an uphill battle, because many Britons believe
that the government should not interfere with parental discipline.
Some also agree with Baroness Park of Monmouth, who said last year
in the House of Lords, ``a spank and a kiss solves everything,
whereas cold-hearted treatment and reasoning leaves a much greater
mark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong strand in English culture that thinks this is
the best way of disciplining children,'' said Alexander Chancellor,
a columnist for The Guardian and The Times of London who said,
nonetheless, that it ``would never have occurred to me to hit my
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was at Eton in the 1950s, Chancellor said, he cunningly
avoided getting beaten, even as schoolmates like Auberon Waugh,
Evelyn Waugh's son, were flogged constantly for offenses like
stealing coal for the fireplaces in their freezing bedrooms.
``Luckily, I'm a bit weedy, whereas he was very rebellious and was
getting beaten all the time,'' Chancellor said of Waugh, now editor
of the Literary Review. ``You'd almost want to beat him now.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the former Etonians beaten by the thousands, many still
contemplate their experiences with a curiously nostalgic
resentment, as the letters in The Times revealed.
</P>
<P>
   One letter-writer told how he was sent to Chenevix-Trench's
study on several occasions for what was then called ``six of the
best,'' only to be pleasantly surprised by the headmaster's sudden
change of heart. ``After some discussion he would remove two sabres
from the wall, throw one at me, we would fence (he was an expert
swordsman) and the proposed beating would be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Matthew Thompson-Royds missed the Chenevix-Trench
era but didn't avoid being beaten. ``Mercifully, my punishment was
carried out by `Leggy' Lambert, the lower master,'' in the 1950s,
he wrote. Still, he seemed sorry to have lived before the era of
human-rights courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, I wonder, would the bill be if all who had been flogged
at Eton obtained full compensation?'' he asked.

A WOMAN'S POWER TOOL: HIGH HEELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

 By ELIN SCHOEN BROCKMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   This is, in fashion parlance, a major shoe moment. There are
shoe refrigerator magnets, charm bracelets, earrings, key rings and
cards _ and that's in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art's
gift shops alone. Over the past three years, no fewer than a dozen
books on shoes have appeared. And most of the shoe effigies and
lore reflect what's afoot _ namely, high heels, the more risque the
better. Women are buying them as never before. And wearing them.
</P>
<P>
   In last month's Vogue, Marina Rust, a contributing editor,
described a pair of ``spiked'' sandals with black ankle feathers as
``Winged Victory, the disco version,'' and said she displayed one
on her hall table as art. ``After Marcel Duchamp's `ready-mades,'''
said Patricia Garland, conservator of paintings at the Yale Gallery
of Art, referring to Dadaists' iconization of shovels and urinals,
``anything could be art. Who's to say that a shoe is not a piece of
sculpture?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not the women who have made Manolo Blahnik's black
``halter back'' heels, nearly 3 inches high and $425 a pair, the
best-selling item on Nieman-Marcus' Web site. And 4-inch styles,
some even costlier, are selling briskly, too. Obviously, when price
is no object, heel height is no problem. One can be chauffeured.
But even women of a more pedestrian bent are buying the look. Mary
Trasko, director of public relations and special projects for the
mass market shoemaker Nina and author of ``Heavenly Soles''
(Abbeville Press, 1989), said, ``It's happening at the low price
point, too, in department stores all around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed desire of women from all walks of life to teeter
around in leather and steel structures that even a longtime shoe
maven like Garland can't relate to _ ``I'm not going to wear shoes
I have to squeeze my foot into like a wicked stepsister no matter
how much I love them,'' she said _ has as much to do with altitude
as attitude. When Hamlet, referring to the platform shoe of his
day, said to the Player-Queen, ``Your ladyship is nearer to heaven
than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine,'' he was
undoubtedly responding to the psychologically, as well as visually,
elevating effect.
</P>
<P>
   But if stature were the only issue, society would still be mired
in the 1990s platform moment. Professional women, it seems, have
discovered what customers of Frederick's of Hollywood have long
understood. ``Sexual appeal is power because it is a way to get
people to do what you want,'' said Valerie Steele, chief curator of
the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, who wrote
``Shoes: A Lexicon of Style'' (Rizzoli, 1999). ``And high heels are
the prime symbol of erotic femininity.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because they inspire simultaneous fantasies of
vulnerability (who can run in them?) and of the heel as weapon.
They are a gal's version of a guy thing: the female power tool. Or,
as Freud put it: ``The fetish-like reverence for the feminine foot
and shoe seems to take the foot only as a substitutive symbol for
the once revered and since then missed member of the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sort of power figures in the rise of the heel _ star
power. American culture anthropomorphizes certain products,
investing them with personality and charisma, which makes them more
marketable. The right designer's name, via word of mouth or
advertising, becomes synonymous with the object itself. The hip set
once went forth shod in their Guccis and wearing their Calvins. Now
the cognoscenti say ``Manolos.'' The persona of Blahnik, whose shoe
career embraced the stiletto in the 1970s, pervades his shoes, and
the objects transcend mere appareldom. Or as Diane von Furstenberg
said in last month's In Style, describing her relationship with her
400 pairs of shoes: ``The things in your closet are like friends.
You have old friends, new friends, friends you forget about,
friends you neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is doubtful that Manolos will rival Kleenex as a
catch-phrase. Fashion is nothing if not fickle. Christian
Louboutin, he of the irresistible soles (all of them red), has
arrived. ``A woman carries her clothes,'' Louboutin said, ``but
it's her shoes which carry the woman.'' To him, comfort is
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the kinder heel. The new power trip selling to women is
that they can now stride, as opposed to mince painfully along, in
glamorous shoes. The most popular Louboutin shoes are two and a
half to three inches high. Nina's ``Comfort Collection'' also
promises high style with lower heels. Embellishments like beading
make these shoes more romantic than seductive, more How to Make an
American Quilt than Story of O. ``It's all about femininity now,''
said Dana Christy, fashion director for accessories and intimate
apparel at Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   So it appears _ but not to Patricia Garland, who sees shoes,
regardless of how they're packaged, as a substitute for a car. ``I
don't know any women who get off on cars like men do,'' she said,
``so for women, shoes are a way to express your personality.'' Or
your various drives _ which even in this post-Freudian moment is
still basically what it's all about.

</P>
<P>
   CATHOLICS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The GOP slugfest over
whether John McCain is baiting Catholics by painting George W. Bush
as anti-Catholic has freed a genie from a bottle corked 40 years
ago by John F. Kennedy. Democrats are rejoicing, for it was only
six years ago that the Gingrich-led House revolution showed that a
Catholic majority of voters had shifted for the first time in
decades from Democrats to Republicans on the House ballot. Before
that, Catholics split their ticket, as in voting for Ronald Reagan
but then returning to their old lunch-pail Democratic roots. By
Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   With sidebars, BOBJONES-REVIEW and MCCAIN-RELIGION-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   DARK-MATTER-REVIEW (Undated) _ Modern astronomy was supposed to
banish Aristotelian and mystical notions about the composition of
the universe, proving that everything above consists of no-nonsense
matter, that we live in a material world. But as was clear from
Dark Matter 2000, a conference held in February, the quest is only
progressing because of science's willingness to stretch the very
meaning of the word ``matter.'' This once-simple stuff is coming to
seem as ethereal as anyone could have imagined. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL-DIVIDE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The latest buzzphrase among
politicians and computer executives is the digital divide, the gulf
between those who have access to computers and the Internet and
those who do not. People in the latter category, the thinking goes,
are being shut out of the most important mode of gathering and
exchanging information in the new century. In fact, there is a
growing recognition among those dealing closely with the issue that
the term digital divide, while clever and provocative, has become a
catchall phrase for politicians with conspicuous agendas and that
the divide is a complex phenomenon that no amount of measurement
can fully explain. By Katie Hafner.
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In 1996, immigrant bashing was
in: Bob Dole, Pete Wilson and Pat Buchanan took positions that
could be seen as anti-immigrant. But what a difference four years
makes. In the 2000 campaign, nary a nasty word has been uttered
about immigrants. GOP strategists say Hispanic Americans will be to
this year's campaign what soccer moms were to the 1996 campaign.
Democratic and Republican strategists agree that Hispanics may
provide swing votes in California, New York, Texas and Florida _
which together account for half the electoral votes needed to win
the presidency. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERTUESDAY-SCENARIOS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ With the primary
and caucus schedule so far, it's been easy to keep track of whether
Gov. George W. Bush or Sen. John McCain is up or down. It may not
be so simple this Tuesday, with 13 contests. It is the biggest, and
most important single day of the primary season. And, perhaps, the
most confusing. Consider the possible scenarios. By Richard L.
Berke.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH-HEELS-REVIEW (Undated) _ What's behind the comeback of high
heels? Professional women may have discovered that sex appeal is
power because it is a way to get people to do what you want. And
high heels are the prime symbol of erotic femininity, because they
inspire simultaneous fantasies of vulnerability (who can run in
them?) and of the heel as weapon. They are a gal's version of a guy
thing: the female power tool. By Elin Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   L.A.-POLICE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Scandals often require not
just scandalous facts but a trigger, a nettlesome event, to
activate public outrage. In Los Angles, for example, a police
corruption scandal in which officers brutalized, framed and shot
innocent people has suddenly erupted, after quietly simmering for
five months. At least one of the triggers, in this case, may have
been a proposed bond offering. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD-NYPD-ABUSES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A scathing report detailing
corruption and abuse in an elite-anti-crime unit of the Los Angeles
Police Department came just a week after four officers in a similar
squad in New York were acquitted in the death of an unarmed man
they shot 19 times. But where the New York officers may have been
reckless, the Los Angeles officers were almost certainly
premeditated criminals. Although there is no indication that the
New York unit has engaged in such lawlessness, critics say such
squads are risky ventures that frequently lead to problems. By Jane
Fritsch.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-SLUR-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The brush fire over John
McCain's use of the word ``gooks'' flared and faded quickly.
Asian-Americans may have wondered: Would McCain have gotten more
bad publicity from a slur against blacks or Hispanics? Some
excerpts, primarily from Internet e-mail forums directed at Asian
Americans, capture this and other sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   BRIT-CORPORAL-PUNISH-REVIEW (London) _ Britain has outlawed
corporal punishment in schools, and the debate has now shifted to
the home, with the Labor government trying to rewrite the law to
set out exactly what constitutes acceptable hitting. The current
law, which dates back to Victorian times, was recently thrown into
limbo when the European Court of Human Rights ruled that it had
failed to protect a young British boy from ``inhuman or degrading
punishment'' by his stepfather. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ U.S. agencies that worked with
Chile during the Pinochet era have been reviewing their files and
slowly revealing the degree of U.S. knowledge about the system that
killed democracy for a generation of Chileans. The full extent of
U.S. involvement with the Pinochet regime remains shrouded in
secrecy, but some facts have been coming into sharper focus. By

   It used to be you were what you ate. But in today's
market-driven _ and diet-conscious _ culture, we are as interested
in how people invest as in what they ingest.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the 2000 presidential hopefuls, personal
investments can be telling, not only about the wealth of those men
eager to trade in their homes for public housing in Washington. But
they also offer insights into the personalities of the contenders,
their lineages, their outlooks, their interests _ and their
willingness to take risks. As much as you might learn from leafing
through George W. Bush's position papers, for example, you can
learn far more by plowing through his personal financial disclosure
report. There, as on the stump, the governor of Texas emerges as a
chip off the old establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Just how blue a chip can be summarized easily: Procter &AMP; Gamble.
Warner Lambert. Wells Fargo. Disney. The more contemporary entries,
all in a trust established for the governor by his mother, Barbara,
are themselves popular conventional stocks like Lucent, MCI
WorldCom, and Microsoft, about as mainstream as you can get in the
high-tech world.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled throughout the mix, along with Kmart and ITT, are
standard money-market accounts, bond and stock funds. But there's
more than blue eyes and blue chips to Bush. His portfolio includes
at least $7 million in Treasury notes, and perhaps much more than
that, as federal law requires that only a range of values, not
specific numbers, be listed.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio also includes an intriguing assortment of oil,
gas, mining, and farming interests, which is about as close as a
member of the Bush family ever comes to living off the land.
Generally, the blue chips are in Mom's trust, the natural-resources
investments in her eldest son's own name.
</P>
<P>
   The big contrast with Bush the investor isn't in Senator John
McCain, his rival for the Republican nomination, but in Bill
Bradley, the bank president's son and former New Jersey senator who
is challenging Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic
nomination. Bradley's investments, though heavily weighted toward T
notes, BankAmerica stock, and conventional mutual funds and money
markets, are by far the most new-age of the candidates'. The man
who raised so much money on Wall Street has a portfolio stocked
with emerging software, e-commerce, and computer-related stocks
including Homegrocer.com, E-mail Shopper Inc., and Ecom2ecom Inc. _
edgy entries that would be out of place in the Bush safe-deposit
box.
</P>
<P>
   McCain may be a gambler on the stump but he's no risk-taker in
the market. Scion though he is of a prominent military family, he
owns no stocks. Indeed, most of the family wealth comes from his
wife, Cindy, whose family runs the second-biggest Anheuser-Busch
distributor in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain children's investments are predominantly in
traditional, widely diversified, large-cap mutual funds, a standard
politician's gambit to avert just the sort of press inquiries that
we so eagerly make. The McCain children also have investments in
equity index funds, municipal money markets, and Arizona municipal
bonds. ``It's a set of very conventional investments,'' says Robert
Delgado, who oversees the family's investments.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has a foundation account, dedicated to children's
charities and Native American philanthropies and underwritten in
part by proceeds from his best-selling book, ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' inside the $275 million Arizona Community Foundation. He
reaps no benefit from the growth of those investments.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Gore. He has income from the lease of a pasture he
owns in Tennessee, some mineral royalties, a bunch of Treasury
strips, a few savings accounts, and not much else.
</P>
<P>
   No bonds, no stock, except for less than $15,000 in Occidental
Petroleum in his father's estate. He's been on the government
payroll since 1977 and has an income of around $300,000, including
his federal salary ($175,400).
</P>
<P>
   But things may be improving for the vice president. He was able
to afford only $353 in charitable contributions in 1997. In 1998,
the most recent year for which tax returns have been completed,
Gore gave away $15,000. Onward and upward!

WHAT BECOMES A SCANDAL MOST

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Real scandals often require not just scandalous
facts, but a trigger, a nettlesome event, to activate public
outrage. In Los Angeles, for example, a police corruption scandal
in which officers brutalized, framed and, in at least two cases,
shot innocent people has suddenly erupted after quietly simmering
for five months.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the triggers, in this case, may have been a
proposed bond offering.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan is nothing if not fiscally responsible,
and so he broke his near silence on the police scandal three weeks
ago, not in response to more disclosures of abuse, but to announce
that he had a plan to cover its costs. Legal experts have warned
that civil suits by the victims could cost the city more than $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor suggested that the city take the money it expects as
its share of the national tobacco settlement _ more than $300
million over the next 25 years _ and use it to finance an offering
of bonds. This would net the city a little more than $90 million
right away. The problem was that the mayor had already proposed
that the windfall be used mostly to help the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's plan, which he offered at a press conference, was
intended to insure that the country's second-largest city would not
go bankrupt in a sea of lawsuits for monetary damages. But rather
than reassure people the announcement has catalyzed public outrage
against the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, the police officers union defied the
department's chief and demanded an independent investigation of the
widespread abuses, the FBI and the U.S. attorney announced separate
criminal investigations, and the City Council narrowly voted down a
motion to begin its own investigation of the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost issue began to really cause serious alarm among a lot
of people,'' said Joel Wachs, the city council member and mayoral
candidate who made the motion. ``Absolutely, that was the
catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramona Ripston, the executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union office here, had been advocating such an outside
investigation since September, and had little support until now.
The bonds, she said, sobered up people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor was more concerned with the money aspects of this
than the moral or ethical aspects, but suddenly when the city
realized this was going to cost so much, people finally began to
focus,'' Ripston said. ``We had no real supporters outside our
little group'' until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups for the disabled were outraged that financing
promised them would be taken away, but the mayor has since assured
them he will get the money from elsewhere. This only means, of
course, that someone else will have to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is going to lose their money and it doesn't seem
fair,'' said John Whitbread of the Westside Center for Independent
Living. ``Everybody's nervous.''

A WOMAN'S POWER TOOL: HIGH HEELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   This is, in fashion parlance, a major shoe moment. There are
shoe refrigerator magnets, charm bracelets, earrings, key rings and
cards _ and that's in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art's
gift shops alone. Over the past three years, no fewer than a dozen
books on shoes have appeared. And most of the shoe effigies and
lore reflect what's afoot _ namely, high heels, the more risque the
better. Women are buying them as never before. And wearing them.
</P>
<P>
   In last month's Vogue, Marina Rust, a contributing editor,
described a pair of ``spiked'' sandals with black ankle feathers as
``Winged Victory, the disco version,'' and said she displayed one
on her hall table as art. ``After Marcel Duchamp's `ready-mades,'''
said Patricia Garland, conservator of paintings at the Yale Gallery
of Art, referring to Dadaists' iconization of shovels and urinals,
``anything could be art. Who's to say that a shoe is not a piece of
sculpture?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not the women who have made Manolo Blahnik's black
``halter back'' heels, nearly 3 inches high and $425 a pair, the
best-selling item on Nieman-Marcus' Web site. And 4-inch styles,
some even costlier, are selling briskly, too. Obviously, when price
is no object, heel height is no problem. One can be chauffeured.
But even women of a more pedestrian bent are buying the look. Mary
Trasko, director of public relations and special projects for the
mass market shoemaker Nina and author of ``Heavenly Soles''
(Abbeville Press, 1989), said, ``It's happening at the low price
point, too, in department stores all around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed desire of women from all walks of life to teeter
around in leather and steel structures that even a longtime shoe
maven like Garland can't relate to _ ``I'm not going to wear shoes
I have to squeeze my foot into like a wicked stepsister no matter
how much I love them,'' she said _ has as much to do with altitude
as attitude. When Hamlet, referring to the platform shoe of his
day, said to the Player-Queen, ``Your ladyship is nearer to heaven
than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine,'' he was
undoubtedly responding to the psychologically, as well as visually,
elevating effect.
</P>
<P>
   But if stature were the only issue, society would still be mired
in the 1990s platform moment. Professional women, it seems, have
discovered what customers of Frederick's of Hollywood have long
understood. ``Sexual appeal is power because it is a way to get
people to do what you want,'' said Valerie Steele, chief curator of
the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, who wrote
``Shoes: A Lexicon of Style'' (Rizzoli, 1999). ``And high heels are
the prime symbol of erotic femininity.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because they inspire simultaneous fantasies of
vulnerability (who can run in them?) and of the heel as weapon.
They are a gal's version of a guy thing: the female power tool. Or,
as Freud put it: ``The fetish-like reverence for the feminine foot
and shoe seems to take the foot only as a substitutive symbol for
the once revered and since then missed member of the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sort of power figures in the rise of the heel _ star
power. American culture anthropomorphizes certain products,
investing them with personality and charisma, which makes them more
marketable. The right designer's name, via word of mouth or
advertising, becomes synonymous with the object itself. The hip set
once went forth shod in their Guccis and wearing their Calvins. Now
the cognoscenti say ``Manolos.'' The persona of Blahnik, whose shoe
career embraced the stiletto in the 1970s, pervades his shoes, and
the objects transcend mere appareldom. Or as Diane von Furstenberg
said in last month's In Style, describing her relationship with her
400 pairs of shoes: ``The things in your closet are like friends.
You have old friends, new friends, friends you forget about,
friends you neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is doubtful that Manolos will rival Kleenex as a
catch-phrase. Fashion is nothing if not fickle. Christian
Louboutin, he of the irresistible soles (all of them red), has
arrived. ``A woman carries her clothes,'' Louboutin said, ``but
it's her shoes which carry the woman.'' To him, comfort is
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the kinder heel. The new power trip selling to women is
that they can now stride, as opposed to mince painfully along, in
glamorous shoes. The most popular Louboutin shoes are two and a
half to three inches high. Nina's ``Comfort Collection'' also
promises high style with lower heels. Embellishments like beading
make these shoes more romantic than seductive, more How to Make an
American Quilt than Story of O. ``It's all about femininity now,''
said Dana Christy, fashion director for accessories and intimate
apparel at Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   So it appears _ but not to Patricia Garland, who sees shoes,
regardless of how they're packaged, as a substitute for a car. ``I
don't know any women who get off on cars like men do,'' she said,
``so for women, shoes are a way to express your personality.'' Or
your various drives _ which even in this post-Freudian moment is
still basically what it's all about.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Further holes in the Cuba embargo
 &HT;    (For release March 8, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Coincidentally (I presume), two stories in major
newspapers last Sunday disclosed how our four-decades-old economic
boycott of Cuba _ including the Helms-Burton Act _ is little more
than a mere annoyance en route to doing business with Fidel Castro.
Also, among the hard-line Cuban exiles parading angrily in Miami's
streets and banning entertainers and others who have performed for
Fidel, there are those clandestinely investing in Cuba, trying to
get a foot in the door for that day when Castro falls.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be business as usual, but it's approaching that
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, in a Sunday Business section piece, revealed
how foreign companies, notably in Canada, not only are doing
business with Cuba but how they evade crashing into the clauses of
Helms-Burton. Those edicts provide that any executive, from any
country, who does business on confiscated property in Cuba that was
owned by Americans pre-Castro, not be allowed to enter the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Times article disclosed that tons of American money is
pouring into Cuba through a sieve that allows Americans to invest
in foreign companies doing business with Cuba, so long as they do
not own a controlling interest in the company, or that the company
does not gain more than half its revenues in doing business on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day as the New York Times article, the Miami Herald
ran a front-page piece revealing that some Cuban-Americans, despite
the embargo and despite what was supposed to be overwhelming
contempt for the Castro regime, are doing business with him _ also
in anticipation of his mortality, which they seem to think will
turn Cuba into a democracy on the morning after the burial.
</P>
<P>
   The Herald article disclosed that business meetings have been
held in the arch anti-Castro Little Havana section of Miami between
Castro's diplomats and Cuban-Americans. Some in the
exile-controlled Cuban-American community are doing straight-up
business with their adversaries in Havana. This is in addition to
those already making personal visits to relatives on the island and
bringing food, medicine and money.
</P>
<P>
   The article reported that ``Cuban Americans have boasted of
selling hotel supplies, food, clothes and computers in Havana.
Others are said to be brokering oil deals for Havana and trying to
establish ice cream and shoe factories in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   What does this all say about the embargo? About Helms-Burton?
</P>
<P>
   It says that the embargo is little more than water plunging
through the openings in a colander. After 40 years, Americans (and
Cuban-Americans) can deal with Fidel Castro no matter what laws we
impose.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few decades, I have been of the opinion that the
stated embargo was the best thing that ever happened to Castro. He
has been able to blame all his failures on the embargo. Even when
companies in Spain, Canada and elsewhere began investing in Cuba,
putting up hotels and factories, Castro was able to fall back on
the embargo to implicate it for the overall deprivation on the
communist island.
</P>
<P>
   Since everyone seems to know a way around the embargo, including
Cuban-Americans, no less, there doesn't seem to be any real need to
continue it; or is it just to please a few dedicated anti-Castro
Miamians, their ages catching up with them just as is the
73-year-old Castro's?
</P>
<P>
   The embargo is a political position with declining economic
impact. Castro has weathered the storm. Investment in Cuba is a
reality. We may not like it _ I don't _ but it's real; particulars
staring up at us from the pages of our Sunday newspapers.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A fatal childhood
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The poet William Wordsworth had it that ``The child is father of
the man.'' What sort of man, then, will that 6-year-old in Michigan
rear _ the boy who shot a first-grade classmate dead?
</P>
<P>
   The boy's life and circumstances have been, officials say,
``chaotic.'' His father is in prison for parole violation on a
burglary charge. His mother has a history of drug addiction. The
hovel he was living in with relatives _ or with ``relatives'': the
relationships are iffy _ apparently was a crack house, with deals
going down and users in and out day and night.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the boy got the .32-caliber semi-automatic handgun.
It was, basically, just lying around _ when it wasn't being
twirled, Western-style, in casual little fillips of hoodlum
bravado. Police found another stolen firearm, a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother left him there after they had been evicted a
few weeks ago. Neighbors say police had raided that previous house
several times. In his new house _ ``home'' hardly seems right _ the
boy had no bed. He slept ... wherever. The yard was full of litter.
Old cars rotted in it.
</P>
<P>
   The boy told police he only meant to scare the little girl he
killed. Who knows? Either way, even case-hardened prosecutors count
the child himself as much victim as perp. There will be no criminal
charges. How could there be with one so young?
</P>
<P>
   Most of us can understand that. (Though one hair-trigger e-mail
correspondent gloated that children as young as 4 should know the
difference between right and wrong. She drew up just short of
toddler execution, but the hesitation felt only tactical.)
</P>
<P>
   What sort of man, then, will this childhood father? We needn't
guess. With differences that are only detailed, his progeny are
already myriad.
</P>
<P>
   They stare back at us from most _ in truth, from nearly all _ of
the 3,600-plus men and women on our death rows. Let's not be naive.
Most there have murdered despicably. Few are surely recoverable,
even if we allowed for that. Their totemization, as in those
misguided Benetton ads, is unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact remains that in nearly all, there is some version
of this 6-year-old. Childhoods of that sort are not self-healing.
The abused do not grow up improved by their abuse, nor the misled
wiser for their misdirection.
</P>
<P>
   We rightly raise the bar as children age, with increments of
responsibility. But rare indeed are the men and women who,
suffering childhoods like this boy's, can on their own make
character out of such chaos or who find, in the wild human lottery,
redemptive love.
</P>
<P>
   Our death rows cage some for whose acts finally a cold
heartlessness _ or evil, if you wish _ is the only explanation. But
for most there, death row is just the end hovel of the wretched,
the dim, the ill, the degraded and the confused. They await the
last rites of their fatal childhoods.

THERE'S STILL A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT THE PINOCHET YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as a jet whisked Gen. Augusto Pinochet home to Chile last
week from Britain, ending the prospect of his trial in a foreign
land, a determined alliance of human rights advocates and victims
of his military regime redoubled their efforts to gather new
details of atrocities committed when he ruled Chile in the 1970s
and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt goes on wherever his junta's victims are scattered _ in
Chile, the United States, Spain and elsewhere _ accelerated by the
Internet. The general's critics in Chile feel that large gaps still
exist in what is known about the Pinochet years, and that filling
them represents the key to achieving reconciliation and redemption
for their country's reconstituted democracy.
</P>
<P>
   With the general now home, each new fact to emerge also gives
hope to critics who want to place him in the dock in Chile; to do
that, they will have to get an appeals court to revoke an immunity
granted when he stepped down as president in 1990. For Americans,
the Chileans' quest does something else: it raises questions about
one of the largest gaps in knowledge, involving America's own role
in the Pinochet years.

   In Washington, President Clinton has launched an ambitious
project to declassify U.S. records relating to abuses during the
Pinochet era. For more than a year, U.S. government agencies that
worked with Chile have been reviewing their files and slowly
revealing the degree of U.S. knowledge about the contours and
gruesome details of the machinery that killed democracy for a
generation of Chileans. So far, 6,900 documents have been released
and can be seen on the Internet (www.state.gov/foia); thousands
more are due in June.
</P>
<P>
   The broad outlines of U.S. efforts to oust Chile's Socialist
president, Salvador Allende, emerged in Senate intelligence
committee hearings in the 1970s, but the full extent of U.S.
involvement with the junta that replaced him in a 1973 coup remains
shrouded in secrecy. A number of the documents now surfacing were
released in earlier years, but in a form so heavily censored that
their meanings were distorted.
</P>
<P>
   A handful describe Operation Condor, a plan by U.S.-backed
military regimes in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil and
Bolivia to track down and kill leftists, union organizers and
opposition figures. Others describe campaigns of state terror and
the arrest of thousands of political activists. One State
Department cable forwards a request from the Chilean military days
after it seized power, seeking somebody who could help set up
concentration camps for political prisoners. (Washington sent
blankets instead.)
</P>
<P>
   A declassified Defense Intelligence Agency report describes how
Chilean agents created public fear to win support for the junta's
brutality: intelligence agents took hostages and kidnapped an
extreme rightist, and a far-right group that once received funds
from the CIA planted bombs and blamed Marxists.
</P>
<P>
   Among these documents are two internal State Department
inquiries in 1976 that blame Chile's military for the deaths of two
Americans, Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi, who were arrested and
executed. The inquiries suggest a possible CIA role in the slaying
of Horman, which was dramatized in the 1982 movie ``Missing.'' The
CIA has not released its records on the killings, saying it will do
so in June, but strongly denies responsibility for Horman's death.
</P>
<P>
   Another document the State Department declassified, titled
``Declaration of an Agent of the DINA'' (the most feared branch of
the secret police), is a confession by a government killer, Juan
Rene Munoz Alarcon. It details the location of mass graves for
leftists _ 345 people at two spots in Santiago, another 112 at
Colonia Dignidad, a secretive German colony in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz also describes the workings of a death squad, naming the
artillery captain who heads it, and its cooperation with security
services in Argentina and Uruguay to hunt down leftist activists _
``all of it permitted by the president of the republic, who is the
direct chief of this entire area.'' He names CIA officials in
Santiago, saying they were ``very important.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his wrenching confession, Munoz says he knows his
honesty will cost him his life, and in a note at the bottom we
learn that he was indeed assassinated two months later.
</P>
<P>
   One 1978 memo from Robert Pastor, a National Security Council
official in the Carter administration, to Zbigniew Brzezinski, then
head of the National Security Council, involves an investigation
into the killing in 1976 of Chile's former defense minister,
Orlando Letelier, and Ronni Moffitt, his American aide, in
Washington in a three-country operation attributed to Condor.
</P>
<P>
   The memo quotes George Landau, then the U.S. ambassador to
Chile, as saying there was no way the colonel who orchestrated the
killing would have done so without informing Pinochet, ``with whom
he had breakfast almost every single day.''
</P>
<P>
   If such pages from Chile's grim past are important to Chile's
victims, they also hold lessons for Americans: Facing questions in
Congress about the assassinations, Pastor notes that Landau had
spoken to ``many people in the State Department'' and was
``prepared to offer a sanitized version of this to Senator ((Edward
M.)) Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the years, the secrecy suggested by Landau's offer to
``sanitize'' the truth has not completely ended. While the State
Department has been the most forthcoming in releasing its records,
other agencies have held out. Key files remain classified,
including CIA documents on Horman and the agency; FBI and Defense
Department documents on Teruggi, and many records about Letelier
case.
</P>
<P>
   Another gap in the public record involves Henry Kissinger, the
impresario of foreign policy in the Nixon and Ford years. He has
declared his papers personal and had them sealed until five years
after his death.
</P>
<P>
   The National Security Archive, a group that has pressed to open
the Chile files, has listed scores of documents not yet made public
on covert efforts to foment a coup while Allende was in office.
Hundreds more, including 175 cables sent from Santiago to
Washington the day after the coup in which Allende died, were sent
by President Richard M. Nixon's' library to the review panel, but
have not been made public. Peter Kornbluh of the National Security
Archive and others argue that given the long history of
Washington's support for Latin American militaries, Americans need
to understand what happened in Chile. ``It's really about the
American public's right to know what was done in their name,
without their knowledge,'' he said.

THERE'S STILL A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT THE PINOCHET YEARS

<P>
   Even as a jet whisked Gen. Augusto Pinochet home to Chile last
week from Britain, ending the prospect of his trial in a foreign
land, a determined alliance of human rights advocates and victims
of his military regime redoubled their efforts to gather new
details of atrocities committed when he ruled Chile in the 1970s
and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt goes on wherever his junta's victims are scattered _ in
Chile, the United States, Spain and elsewhere _ accelerated by the
Internet. The general's critics in Chile feel that large gaps still
exist in what is known about the Pinochet years, and that filling
them represents the key to achieving reconciliation and redemption
for their country's reconstituted democracy.
</P>
<P>
   With the general now home, each new fact to emerge also gives
hope to critics who want to place him in the dock in Chile; to do
that, they will have to get an appeals court to revoke an immunity
granted when he stepped down as president in 1990. For Americans,
the Chileans' quest does something else: it raises questions about
one of the largest gaps in knowledge, involving America's own role
in the Pinochet years.

MIXING GOD AND POLITICS AND GETTING BURNED

   WASHINGTON _ Forty years and 10 presidential elections ago, John
F. Kennedy felt compelled to journey to a hostile conference of
Protestant church leaders in Houston to plead that he would never
serve as a vassal of the pope if he were elected the nation's first
Catholic president.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ignominious moment for many of Kennedy's fellow
American Catholics as the candidate, a decorated war veteran, had
to pass Protestant muster and deal with the dregs of
anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic bigotry rooted in the nativist
prejudices of the 19th century Know-Nothing movement, when native
born Protestants demanded voting, citizenship and education curbs
on the alarming waves of Catholic immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In weathering the fire and winning the election, Kennedy gently
cautioned the nation to oppose any attempt to distort the
presidency by ``making it an instrument of one religious group.''
His words survive as a prescription for all the nimble campaigners
who have followed him through the risky, often treacherous field
where politics and religion overlap.
</P>
<P>
   This year, spurred by an unexpectedly contentious Republican
primary, the nation is witnessing a 180-degree turn on the historic
Kennedy confrontation. This time, it is a worried Protestant
candidate from Texas, Gov. George W. Bush, who is now daily seeking
out Catholic forums and photo ops, replete with church banners and
Roman-collared clerics, to assure one and all his presidency would
not be an instrument of a dominant religious group _ evangelical
Protestantism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that a neat little parallel _ a nervous George Bush
trying to reassure Catholics?'' observed Kate O'Beirne, the
Washington editor for The National Review. She is less amused by
Sen. John McCain's wielding of the religion issue in his
tooth-and-claw nomination struggle with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rare Catholic who even cares about Bob Jones
University,'' O'Beirne said of the South Carolina evangelical
college that McCain has strategically lambasted as an anti-Catholic
bastion happily visited by Bush. ``It's shameless Catholic
baiting,'' said O'Beirne, predicting a backlash of sorts against
McCain among the significant blocs of Catholic voters expected to
turn out this week in the mammoth Super Tuesday primary showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Whether McCain wins or loses, it is clear he has let a
red-white-and-blue genie out of the bottle and its recorking seems
unlikely during the general election campaign this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, fairly leering in delight, are recording every sling
and arrow exchanged in the Republican primary. And for good reason.
It was only six years ago that the Newt Gingrich revolution in the
House alarmed Democrats with the fact that a Catholic majority of
voters had shifted for the first time in decades from Democrats to
Republicans on the House ballot. Before that, Catholics had split
their ticket, voting, say, for President Ronald Reagan but then
returning to their lunch-pail party roots.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans' painful disarray over the role of the
religious right _ a bloc that Reagan first tucked masterfully into
the GOP fold _ is giving Capitol Hill Democrats new hope. In the
House, the McCain attack has caused Democrats to revive an earlier,
largely overlooked flap in which charges of anti-Catholicism marred
a bipartisan attempt to choose a new chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Democrats, hoping to sting Republicans in open
floor debate, quickly offered broadside resolutions condemning Bob
Jones University as segregationist and _ 40 years after Kennedy _
even anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one question of value that will outlast the
primaries,'' promised Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who runs his
party's Senate political operation. ``People are going to want to
be heard on this, the possible alienation of Catholics just when
many thought they were part of the Establishment,'' the senator
added, contending that Bush would be tarred with the issue into the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, think that McCain ``went one day too far'' with
his attack, in the words of Scott Appleby, a history professor at
Notre Dame University. He noted that McCain used the word ``evil''
in a follow-up attack on the Rev. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson,
two politico-evangelical stalwarts, but then quickly had to retract
it.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby, the director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of
American Catholicism, feels McCain ``is failing to tap into a
deeper level'' of Catholic fear that is more a relic of history
than descriptive of modern Catholics, who are not monolithic voters
unless faced by an appalling instance of anti-Catholic bigotry.
Bush just does not fill the bill, Appleby thinks.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted, too, that it was only after McCain was
defeated in South Carolina and headed for states with broader, more
diverse voter blocs, that he threw down the religious glove and
singled out Robertson and Falwell as ``agents of intolerance,''
betting that the muscle of the religious right has withered since
Reagan blended it into a coalition with post-Kennedy, blue-collar
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, McCain first denied, then confirmed that his
campaign phone-blitzed Catholic voters with reminders of Bush's Bob
Jones appearance and of the school's policy against interracial
dating, which it reversed Friday, and its history of anti-Catholic
polemics, including descriptions of the Vatican as running a
``Satanic system.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was, in some sense, merely stealing from the religious
attack playbook of the Bush campaign in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was some of the worst of American politics I've seen,'' the
political columnist Mark Shields said of attacks by pro-Bush
organizations on McCain, in which some observers sensed wisps of
anti-Semitism and other insults to pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   The key question is how the McCain initiative will play out
Tuesday in states like Ohio and New York, where there are
significant numbers of voters who consider themselves Catholic.
Will the bloc fears of the old post-immigration generation revive?

 &UR; BC-CATHOLICS-POLITICS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: generation revive? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, as other states, Catholics may be increasingly uneasy
about the Bob Jones reports, says John C. Green, director of the
Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. But
he emphasizes that Protestant evangelicals also see the issue as an
attack on them and not, as McCain insists, solely on two performers
on the nation's politico-religion circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, exit polls in Virginia and interviews with many voters
who identify themselves as religious conservatives suggest that
McCain's remarks are mobilizing support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the issue of religion, as ever in American history,
is putting as much fresh life into primary day as into the Bush
campaign. ``The running joke here,'' Green said, ``is whether
Governor Bush will join the Knights of Columbus by primary day.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Quinn, a veteran New York political speechwriter and
historical novelist, said: ``McCain is blowing on some old embers
and causing some smoke, but no real fire. I don't think George Bush
is seen as anti-Catholic.'' Still, Quinn admitted he was intrigued
by how much the Catholic vote might resonate Tuesday with Kennedy's
trial by dogma before the Protestant prelates.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect of McCain's attacks on the religious right were
``politically disastrous,'' in the view of Shields. ``He failed to
distinguish the followers from the leadership, implying they'd been
bamboozled,'' he said. ``And in politics you never blame the
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond questions of strategic advantage in the electoral wars,
there lies the large gray area where voters' impressions of
personal and civic morality overlap. There, the rancorous butting
of politics and religion itself can become an issue as much as a
spectacle for the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Green of the University of Akron sounded decidedly unalarmed
about this instance of boundary crossing. Whether in the year 2000
or 1900, ``this is what campaigns do: they look for appeals that
will work and look for groups that will move,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that this election cycle ``has an unusual amount of
explicit references to religion.'' He pointed to the early and
emphatic statements of Christian faith from Bush, Vice President Al
Gore and many of their rivals. He thinks this may be due to voters,
who are looking beyond the booming economy to wonder whether a
rapidly changing culture, regularly troubled by news of its own
lack of control, as seen in a lurid ongoing melange of shootings
and scandal-ridden leaders, demands more avowedly moral politics
and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly are out there now on the stump. They are talking
beliefs and charging hypocrisy, looking for advantage while
promising the high road to voters already sensing the risk, amid
the spectacle of once more mixing politics and religion.

   In Ohio, as other states, Catholics may be increasingly uneasy
about the Bob Jones reports, says John C. Green, director of the
Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. But
he emphasizes that Protestant evangelicals also see the issue as an
attack on them and not, as McCain insists, solely on two performers
on the nation's politico-religion circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, exit polls in Virginia and interviews with many voters
who identify themselves as religious conservatives suggest that
McCain's remarks are mobilizing support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the issue of religion, as ever in American history,
is putting as much fresh life into primary day as into the Bush
campaign. ``The running joke here,'' Green said, ``is whether
Governor Bush will join the Knights of Columbus by primary day.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Quinn, a veteran New York political speechwriter and
historical novelist, said: ``McCain is blowing on some old embers
and causing some smoke, but no real fire. I don't think George Bush
is seen as anti-Catholic.'' Still, Quinn admitted he was intrigued
by how much the Catholic vote might resonate Tuesday with Kennedy's
trial by dogma before the Protestant prelates.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect of McCain's attacks on the religious right were
``politically disastrous,'' in the view of Shields. ``He failed to
distinguish the followers from the leadership, implying they'd been
bamboozled,'' he said. ``And in politics you never blame the
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond questions of strategic advantage in the electoral wars,
there lies the large gray area where voters' impressions of
personal and civic morality overlap. There, the rancorous butting
of politics and religion itself can become an issue as much as a
spectacle for the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Green of the University of Akron sounded decidedly unalarmed
about this instance of boundary crossing. Whether in the year 2000
or 1900, ``this is what campaigns do: they look for appeals that
will work and look for groups that will move,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that this election cycle ``has an unusual amount of
explicit references to religion.'' He pointed to the early and
emphatic statements of Christian faith from Bush, Vice President Al
Gore and many of their rivals. He thinks this may be due to voters,
who are looking beyond the booming economy to wonder whether a
rapidly changing culture, regularly troubled by news of its own
lack of control, as seen in a lurid ongoing melange of shootings
and scandal-ridden leaders, demands more avowedly moral politics
and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly are out there now on the stump. They are talking
beliefs and charging hypocrisy, looking for advantage while
promising the high road to voters already sensing the risk, amid
the spectacle of once more mixing politics and religion.

FAULT LINE OF RELIGION SPLITS GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Roman Catholics vote in Tuesday's primaries,
they will redraw a political dynamic Republicans don't much like to
discuss: the persistent unease between the party's Catholic and
evangelical Christian factions.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush's appearance last month at Bob
Jones University, a fundamentalist college in South Carolina that
harbors anti-Catholic thought and teachings, has ripped the scar
tissue from a wound that Republican leaders are trying to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tension with the evangelicals is always there. We're not
supposed to talk about it. It's supposed to go away if we don't
mention it. But it is a lie to say that it isn't a problem,'' said
William Donahue, a conservative Catholic who heads the Catholic
League for Religious and Civil Rights here.
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Jones controversy comes on the heels of the flap in
Congress over the appointment of a House chaplain, with Democrats
and some Catholic Republicans claiming that a Catholic priest was
rejected for the post because the GOP wanted to appease its
evangelical allies.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic political fears ``are not at the surface; they are not
even just beneath the surface, but they are not deep,'' said
Republican pollster Frank Luntz. ``There has always been an uneasy
alliance between fundamentalist and born-again Christians on one
hand and religious Catholics on the other. They agree on so much
and yet there is distrust there.''
</P>
<P>
   In public calls for tolerance in recent days, Catholic political
leaders have played down the rift. New York's Democratic senator,
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, joined last week with the Republican
governor, George Pataki, to call for removing religion from
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator John McCain is counting on the possibility that
Catholics here and in New England will express their resentment in
the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   The usually unspoken distress of many Catholics in the Northeast
at the influence of the Christian right in politics was most
memorably voiced in recent years by Representative Peter King, a
Long Island Republican who supports McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of going for solid working people, people who work
hard, are patriotic and put their kids through school _ we are
driving them away,'' King said in a 1996 debate in Congress.
``We're going to turn ourselves into a party of barefoot
hillbillies who go to revival meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign is making thousands of phone calls to the
Catholics of New York state, who constitute some 50 percent of the
Republican electorate, reminding them that the senator has stood
firm against anti-Catholic bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   McCain appeared Friday night at Sacred Heart University in
Fairfield, Conn., a suburb of New York, and got an enthusiastic
welcome. In appearances on the ``Today'' show and ``Imus in the
Morning'' radio show, McCain continued to lambaste Pat Robertson
and Jerry Falwell, two leaders of the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt the fight has helped us with Catholic
voters,'' said McCain campaign manager Rick Davis. ``At its height
we were up 16 percent in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic vote is going to go to Senator McCain for a
number of reasons,'' said King. ``Bob Jones University is one, but
also because he represents their values of patriotism, character,
integrity. That is what it is all about, a question of character:
Are you willing to shake hands with bigots to get votes?''
</P>
<P>
   Political professionals aren't so sure. Pollster John Zogby's
surveys of New York showed the Catholic vote swinging wildly
between Bush and McCain last week. Bush continues to enjoy the
support of a majority of Catholic women, and it was in the hope of
maintaining that gender gap that he has made McCain's record on
breast cancer research the subject of negative advertising here.
This weekend the battle shifted to upstate New York, which casts a
formidable chunk of the Republican vote and has a higher percentage
of Protestant voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain faces the risk of overplaying his hand. ``Catholics don't
want to be singled out,'' said Luntz. ``It's in the privacy of
their home that religion has an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion became a mixed blessing for the GOP when millions of
Catholics and evangelical Protestants left the Democratic Party and
flocked to the Republican banner in the last 30 years, giving
Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan victories and helping
the party claim control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A mutual distaste for Democratic liberalism, especially on
social and family issues like abortion, gay rights, and the use of
vouchers for religious schools, gave the Catholic and evangelical
wings of the GOP something in common. So, too, in working class
precincts of both the North and South, did economic issues like
high taxes and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   This month's St. Patrick's Day parades in New York and South
Boston, which ban gay and lesbian groups, illustrate where Catholic
conservatives share the views of evangelical Christians in opposing
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The simmering antagonism between the two groups dates back to
the Protestant Reformation; to ethnic rivalries between Catholic
immigrants and Protestant elites in cities like Boston and New
York; to the anti-Catholic crusades of the Klu Klux Klan; and to
Protestant resistance to the presidential candidacies of Catholics
Alfred E. Smith and John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudinal and stylistic differences add to the unease. Bigoted
Protestants view Roman Catholic doctrine as medieval idolatry,
Donahue said, while their Catholic counterparts see Protestant
fundamentalism as a ``bizarre'' backwoods tent religion.
</P>
<P>
   In a general election, Catholics are one of the nation's premier
political swing groups. In years of tracking the Catholic working
class, pollster Stanley Greenburg has documented the Catholic
flight from the Democratic Party. But each time it seemed that
Catholics were ready to align themselves permanently with the GOP,
Greenburg said, concerns about the influence of the party's extreme
wing caused them to shy away.
</P>
<P>
   As Italian, Irish and Polish Catholics have assimilated and
grown more affluent over the years, religious differences have
faded. The Catholic community generally laughs at lampoons of
Catholic school days or sexual attitudes, and has shrugged off
fundamentalist extremism.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush did it all when he went to that Bob Jones school .
. . that calls Catholics a Satanic cult and the church a threat to
all and the pope a rat,'' wrote Newsday columnist Jimmy Breslin,
tongue-in-cheek, last week. ``This requires that Catholics up here
quell the inner fury and maintain moderation in the face of attacks
by these cheap, grubby Southern swine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take it too seriously because it doesn't affect us at
work or at school,'' said Donahue. ``Many Catholics don't want to
confront the culture. They want to be liked. There is a latent
insecurity among American Catholics. They want to keep ducking, to
not rock the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donahue and others think that the latent resentment of
Catholic voters will emerge in the primary. ``The case of Bob Jones
University will work on those who, though they were drawn to the
Republicans by disaffection with the Democrats, were always
uneasy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least on the surface, McCain's appearance at Sacred Heart
University seemed to prove the point. ``There is a lot of emotion
running through the campaign right now,'' said student government
president Jason Slattery, over the roar of the rally in the college
gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to pick up a lot of Catholic votes, and a
lot of the born-again Christians who are not as extreme as Falwell
and his buddy in Virginia,'' said Mario Falsani, a Catholic in the
crowd, referring to Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   New York's bruising brand of ethnic politics offers fertile soil
for such a controversy. ``McCain has pulled the pin on one of the
biggest rhetorical grenades I've seen in a political campaign in
generations, leaving George W. Bush on his knee before Catholic
voters,'' said Mark Green, the New York City official, who is a
Democrat. ``The Republican primary has turned into a religious
war.''

 THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT VS. McCAIN: IS IT ABOUT MONEY OR ABORTION?

<P>
   The bile between Sen. John McCain and the religious right
involves both God and Mammon.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition and the National Right to Life
Committee, which ran radio ads against McCain in New Hampshire and
South Carolina, tangled with the Arizona Republican before he began
his presidential bid. They battled over McCain's legislation to
overhaul campaign financing. Money, not abortion, is still the
religious right's real beef with him, McCain says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoyed a cordial relationship for many years until this,''
McCain said, referring to his campaign finance bill and his
anti-abortion voting record in the Congress. ``It's turned into a
jihad because they believe this will destroy their impact on the
political process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exclusively about money,'' agrees Sen. Russ Feingold,
D-Wis., McCain's co-sponsor of legislation that would ban the
unrestricted political donations known as soft money. ``John and I
have tried to turn off their money spigot and they find that very
threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   One provision of the McCain-Feingold bill would have placed
restrictions on issue advertising 60 days before an election, a
hindrance to the election-related activities of many ideological
groups, including the Christian Coalition and the National Right to
Life Committee. These groups and others spend millions of dollars
and flood the airwaves near election day with ads targeting foes or
friends on specific issues including abortion, the environment and
health care. Unlike candidates, parties and political action
committees, the groups can collect and spend unlimited amounts and
aren't required to disclose their contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Groups on the left, including the American Civil Liberties
Union, also opposed the provision as interfering with free speech.
Although the issue ad restrictions were stripped out of the Senate
bill voted on last year, a similar provision passed the House. And
the Senate bill's ban on soft money, the large, unrestricted
donations to the political parties, is also anathema to the
National Right to Life Committee and its allies. (Republican Party
committees have given lots of soft money to the group.)
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to
Life Committee, said his group's board decided to endorse Gov.
George W. Bush and run ads against McCain mainly because of
``substantive concerns about his record on right to life issues.''
He cited McCain's comments that he would not seek to repeal Roe vs.
Wade. But Johnson said McCain's campaign reform proposal was
certainly a factor, too. ``We are strongly opposed to certain
components of his proposal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fault lines between leaders of conservative groups and
anti-abortion lawmakers over the issue of political money were
exposed last year. As the House prepared to vote on its version of
McCain's bill, the Christian Coalition, the American Conservative
Union and the National Right to Life Committee warned anti-abortion
congressmen that their votes on campaign finance would be counted
against them in ratings compiled by conservative, anti-abortion
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Writing anti-abortion House colleagues, Gene Taylor, a
Mississippi Democrat, called the warning an ``obvious attempt to
target and intimidate those of us who believe that our campaign
system is in need of an overhaul.''

 McCAIN'S ETHNIC SLUR, GONE BUT NOT QUITE FORGOTTEN

<P>
   The brushfire over Sen. John McCain's use of the anti-Asian slur
``gooks'' flared and faded within a few days late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized for describing his North Vietnamese captors with the
racial epithet, McCain at first defended its use as justified when
applied to his jailers (though not other Asians), given the abuse
he and his fellow prisoners had suffered at their hands. On Feb.
18, however, perhaps with an eye to the California primary on
Tuesday, the Arizona Republican apologized and pledged never to
utter the word again.
</P>
<P>
   End of story. Indeed, voters got to hear or read little about
the episode. Some say that's only because by and large the media as
well as McCain have a tin ear when it comes to Asian-Americans and
their sensitivities. For it turned out that McCain had used the
slur repeatedly over several months while regaling reporters on his
campaign bus with harrowing recollections of his prisoner-of-war
days. And few had reported the fact.
</P>
<P>
   (The New York Times first reported his use of the slur at the
end of a news article on the presidential campaign on Feb. 18, and
noted his apology in a one-paragraph item on Feb. 25.)
</P>
<P>
   Asian-Americans were left to wonder, if only among themselves:
Would McCain have gotten more adverse publicity if he had uttered a
slur against blacks or Hispanics? The following excerpts, primarily
from Internet and e-mail forums directed at Asian Americans,
capture this and other sentiments.

   Perhaps the most striking example of the media's unwillingness
to challenge McCain's air of moral authority is when he shocks
listeners by casually calling the Vietnamese ``gooks.'' The racist
and disparaging term, popularized by GIs during the war, occurs
repeatedly in a 1973 U.S. News &AMP; World Report account penned by
McCain after his release from prison. ``The `gooks' were bombarding
us with anti-war quotes from people in high places back in
Washington,'' he wrote, referring to the propaganda that his
captors gave him. A quarter of a century later, while speaking with
reporters aboard the Straight Talk Express in October, McCain was
still calling Vietnamese ``gooks'' _ and according to a reporter
who was there, no one called him on it. It's enough to make you
wonder whether the reporters were thinking: Well, this guy spent
five years in a prison camp, so he can say anything he wants.

with such conviction? Or had he been a human rights worker tortured
in Guatemala, would he call his captors ``spics''? Seems to me the
real issue isn't McCain's racial beliefs, but the fact that
Asian-Americans as a voting group aren't formidable enough to make
McCain wary of offending them.

 McCAIN'S ETHNIC SLUR, GONE BUT NOT QUITE FORGOTTEN

<P>
   The brushfire over Sen. John McCain's use of the anti-Asian slur
``gooks'' flared and faded within a few days late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized for describing his North Vietnamese captors with the
racial epithet, McCain at first defended its use as justified when
applied to his jailers (though not other Asians), given the abuse
he and his fellow prisoners had suffered at their hands. On Feb.
18, however, perhaps with an eye to the California primary on
Tuesday, the Arizona Republican apologized and pledged never to
utter the word again.
</P>
<P>
   End of story. Indeed, voters got to hear or read little about
the episode. Some say that's only because by and large the media as
well as McCain have a tin ear when it comes to Asian-Americans and
their sensitivities. For it turned out that McCain had used the
slur repeatedly over several months while regaling reporters on his
campaign bus with harrowing recollections of his prisoner-of-war
days. And few had reported the fact.
</P>
<P>
   (The New York Times first reported his use of the slur at the
end of a news article on the presidential campaign on Feb. 18, and
noted his apology in a one-paragraph item on Feb. 25.)
</P>
<P>
   Asian-Americans were left to wonder, if only among themselves:
Would McCain have gotten more adverse publicity if he had uttered a
slur against blacks or Hispanics? The following excerpts, primarily
from Internet and e-mail forums directed at Asian Americans,
capture this and other sentiments.

   Keeping Up With the Joneses
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not hate Catholics, as charged,'' wrote Bob Jones III,
president of Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sunday every day last week on the Republican campaign
trail. Sen. John McCain made a speech Monday calling the
televangelist Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell ``agents of
intolerance,'' while Gov. George W. Bush told everyone that he was
not anti-Catholic, but that his opponent was playing dirty
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Bush clobbered his opponent in the Virginia and
Washington primaries, amid some evidence that McCain's attacks on
the religious right had energized support for his opponent, and
possibly annoyed the Catholics he was playing to. Bush also took
the North Dakota caucus.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles the Republican candidates, tuning up for the big
Super Tuesday primary there, featured Bush debating the televised
head of McCain, whose body was in St. Louis. The two men vigorously
blamed each other for lowering the tone of their contest, while
claiming that they preferred to deal with issues of substance.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 Republican primaries on March 7, including California,
New York and Ohio, are widely expected to decide the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, legendary for its own brand of ferocious politics,
the candidates squared off about campaign advertising. Bush
released ads charging McCain with opposing money for breast cancer
research, and appeared with breast cancer survivors to denounce him
at a panel discussion in Long Island, with an uneasy New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in tow. McCain called the ads a distortion
of his record, and the radio host Don Imus denounced them.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared as if it was McCain who had his back against the
wall, since he has been unable to make serious inroads against
Bush's core Republican support, especially in California.
Independents and Democrats will not win him the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats had a debate in Los Angeles, too. The encounter
between Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley was so
amicable it lent credence to the impression in political circles
that the race was pretty much all over, even the shouting.

   A Sticky Icon Turns 50
</P>
<P>
   It was some year, 1950: the first Club Med opened, Minute Rice
was introduced, Smokey the Bear and the slogan ``only you can
prevent forest fires'' were born and a newfangled copying machine
was perfected by a little company in upstate New York that soon
changed its name to Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another entry on the hit parade of popular-culture
icons from 1950: Silly Putty.
</P>
<P>
   The goofy substance celebrated its 50th anniversary last week by
being stretched, pounded and squished, the same as always. At the
factory in Easton, Pa., executives were talking about how people
had found uses the inventor (who never knew what to do with Silly
Putty anyway) never dreamed of: plugging leaks, stabilizing wobbly
furniture, cleaning computer keyboards, quitting smoking. Yes, some
stop-smoking programs tell smokers they need to knead Silly Putty
when they get the urge to light up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crosses generations, and you don't outgrow it,'' said
Tracey Muldoon Moran, a spokeswoman for Silly Putty. Of course,
there are those who wish they had, like the burglar who broke into
the company's Canadian office and stole a computer. It didn't take
a Joe Friday to catch the thief _ his fingerprints were all over
the Silly Putty he had played with before he made his getaway.
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-silly history of Silly Putty is that it was invented
by accident in a synthetic-rubber laboratory during World War II.
It languished until 1950, when a New Haven, Conn., toy store bought
the first batch. It quickly sold out. Soon baby boomers were
lifting backwards copies of comic-strip figures out of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed since the '50s. Now, Muldoon Moran said,
``We get phone calls from folks saying, `My putty isn't working.'''
We tell them, `Your putty is working, it's the printing process
that's changed.'''

   Eichmann's House: The Bureaucracy of Murder
</P>
<P>
   Last week Israel released the memoirs of Adolf Eichmann, whom it
executed for war crimes in 1962. The document, written in an
Israeli jail, was kept sealed for fear it would be used to distort
the history of the Holocaust. It was unsealed at the request of
lawyers for Deborah Lipstadt, an American professor being sued for
libel by David Irving, whom she has described in a book as ``a
dangerous spokesman for Holocaust denial.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the 1,100 handwritten pages, Eichmann, the architect of
Hitler's Final Solution, charted the Nazi hierarchy. Eichmann's
Jewish Office of the Gestapo _ B-4 _ is at the bottom, consistent
with his claim to have been a minor cog in the genocidal machine.
``I was one of the many horses pulling the wagon and couldn't
escape left or right because of the will of the driver,'' he wrote.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chart is literally accurate, and deeply misleading. Aaron
Breitbart, a senior researcher at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in
Los Angeles, notes that, from 1942 on, Eichmann had formal
authority for eliminating the Jews, to which Hitler had given the
highest priority, and he reported directly to the No. 2 officer in
the SS (which ran the concentration camps). ``The SS had much more
political power than the Army,'' Breitbart said, ``and Eichmann had
much more power than any general.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann even felt he could defy Heinrich Himmler, the SS
leader, Breitbart said. In 1944, with the end of the war in sight,
Himmler ordered Eichmann to stop gassing Jews. Eichmann ignored
him.

   Gore Fund-Raiser Convicted In 1996 Donation Scheme

   A federal jury convicted Maria Hsia, a longtime political
fund-raiser for Vice President Al Gore, on charges that she
masterminded a 1996 scheme to conceal illegal donations to the
Democratic Party, especially to the vice president. Some donations
came from Gore's much-criticized visit to a Buddhist temple in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict made Hsia, a previously obscure immigration
counselor from Los Angeles, the major catch in the Justice
Department's investigation of campaign finance abuses.

   Ending Social Security Curbs

   The House unanimously passed legislation that would allow people
to draw their full Social Security benefit even if they decide to
go on working past the age of 65. The bill would repeal a
Depression-era policy that cuts benefits for people 65 through 69
years old by $1 for every $3 earned above an annual limit,
currently $17,000. The Senate will take up the bill soon, and
President Clinton said he would sign it.

affluent people while doing nothing to shore up the retirement
system's precarious long-term finances.

   Testing for Pregnant Women
</P>
<P>
   When the crack epidemic was in full swing during the 1980s, the
plight of ``crack babies'' led to a vigorous debate over what to do
about pregnant women who use illegal drugs. South Carolina came up
with a singular answer: test their urine when they come to public
hospitals for prenatal care or delivery, and report positive finds
to the police. Several dozen women were arrested, some taken from
hospital beds in handcuffs or leg shackles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a case brought by 10 of the women, the Supreme
Court agreed to decide whether the urine tests were
unconstitutional searches or whether they were justified by the
health needs of fetuses and babies.

possibly annoyed the Catholics he was playing to. Bush also took
the North Dakota caucus.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles the Republican candidates, tuning up for the big
Super Tuesday primary there, featured Bush debating the televised
head of McCain, whose body was in St. Louis. The two men vigorously
blamed each other for lowering the tone of their contest, while
claiming that they preferred to deal with issues of substance.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 Republican primaries on March 7, including California,
New York and Ohio, are widely expected to decide the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, legendary for its own brand of ferocious politics,
the candidates squared off about campaign advertising. Bush
released ads charging McCain with opposing money for breast cancer
research, and appeared with breast cancer survivors to denounce him
at a panel discussion in Long Island, with an uneasy New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in tow. McCain called the ads a distortion
of his record, and the radio host Don Imus denounced them.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared as if it was McCain who had his back against the
wall, since he has been unable to make serious inroads against
Bush's core Republican support, especially in California.
Independents and Democrats will not win him the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats had a debate in Los Angeles, too. The encounter
between Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley was so
amicable it lent credence to the impression in political circles
that the race was pretty much all over, even the shouting.

   A Sticky Icon Turns 50
</P>
<P>
   It was some year, 1950: the first Club Med opened, Minute Rice
was introduced, Smokey the Bear and the slogan ``only you can
prevent forest fires'' were born and a newfangled copying machine
was perfected by a little company in upstate New York that soon
changed its name to Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   But there was another entry on the hit parade of popular-culture
icons from 1950: Silly Putty.
</P>
<P>
   The goofy substance celebrated its 50th anniversary last week by
being stretched, pounded and squished, the same as always. At the
factory in Easton, Pa., executives were talking about how people
had found uses the inventor (who never knew what to do with Silly
Putty anyway) never dreamed of: plugging leaks, stabilizing wobbly
furniture, cleaning computer keyboards, quitting smoking. Yes, some
stop-smoking programs tell smokers they need to knead Silly Putty
when they get the urge to light up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crosses generations, and you don't outgrow it,'' said
Tracey Muldoon Moran, a spokeswoman for Silly Putty. Of course,
there are those who wish they had, like the burglar who broke into
the company's Canadian office and stole a computer. It didn't take
a Joe Friday to catch the thief _ his fingerprints were all over
the Silly Putty he had played with before he made his getaway.
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-silly history of Silly Putty is that it was invented
by accident in a synthetic-rubber laboratory during World War II.
It languished until 1950, when a New Haven, Conn., toy store bought
the first batch. It quickly sold out. Soon baby boomers were
lifting backwards copies of comic-strip figures out of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed since the '50s. Now, Muldoon Moran said,
``We get phone calls from folks saying, `My putty isn't working.'''
We tell them, `Your putty is working, it's the printing process
that's changed.'''

   Eichmann's House: The Bureaucracy of Murder
</P>
<P>
   Last week Israel released the memoirs of Adolf Eichmann, whom it
executed for war crimes in 1962. The document, written in an
Israeli jail, was kept sealed for fear it would be used to distort
the history of the Holocaust. It was unsealed at the request of
lawyers for Deborah Lipstadt, an American professor being sued for
libel by David Irving, whom she has described in a book as ``a
dangerous spokesman for Holocaust denial.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the 1,100 handwritten pages, Eichmann, the architect of
Hitler's Final Solution, charted the Nazi hierarchy. Eichmann's
Jewish Office of the Gestapo _ B-4 _ is at the bottom, consistent
with his claim to have been a minor cog in the genocidal machine.
``I was one of the many horses pulling the wagon and couldn't
escape left or right because of the will of the driver,'' he wrote.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chart is literally accurate, and deeply misleading. Aaron
Breitbart, a senior researcher at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in
Los Angeles, notes that, from 1942 on, Eichmann had formal
authority for eliminating the Jews, to which Hitler had given the
highest priority, and he reported directly to the No. 2 officer in
the SS (which ran the concentration camps). ``The SS had much more
political power than the Army,'' Breitbart said, ``and Eichmann had
much more power than any general.''
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann even felt he could defy Heinrich Himmler, the SS
leader, Breitbart said. In 1944, with the end of the war in sight,
Himmler ordered Eichmann to stop gassing Jews. Eichmann ignored
him.

   Gore Fund-Raiser Convicted In 1996 Donation Scheme

   A federal jury convicted Maria Hsia, a longtime political
fund-raiser for Vice President Al Gore, on charges that she
masterminded a 1996 scheme to conceal illegal donations to the
Democratic Party, especially to the vice president. Some donations
came from Gore's much-criticized visit to a Buddhist temple in

   The House unanimously passed legislation that would allow people
to draw their full Social Security benefit even if they decide to
go on working past the age of 65. The bill would repeal a
Depression-era policy that cuts benefits for people 65 through 69
years old by $1 for every $3 earned above an annual limit,
currently $17,000. The Senate will take up the bill soon, and
President Clinton said he would sign it.

   Testing for Pregnant Women

<P>
   When the crack epidemic was in full swing during the 1980s, the
plight of ``crack babies'' led to a vigorous debate over what to do
about pregnant women who use illegal drugs. South Carolina came up
with a singular answer: test their urine when they come to public
hospitals for prenatal care or delivery, and report positive finds
to the police. Several dozen women were arrested, some taken from
hospital beds in handcuffs or leg shackles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a case brought by 10 of the women, the Supreme
Court agreed to decide whether the urine tests were
unconstitutional searches or whether they were justified by the
health needs of fetuses and babies.

DARKLY STRETCHING THE DEFINITION OF MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   Reaching beyond earth, air, fire and water, Aristotle insisted
that the heavenly spheres _ the realm of the stars and gods _ must
be composed of something less mundane. This ethereal fifth essence,
or ``quintessence,'' was the very substance, medieval theologians
went on to propose, of which the angels themselves were made.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of modern astronomy is to banish such mystical
notions, proving that everything above consists of no-nonsense
matter, that we live in a material world. But as was clear from
Dark Matter 2000, a conference held in February in Marina del Rey,
Calif., the quest is only progressing because of science's
willingness to stretch the very meaning of the word ``matter.''
This once simple stuff is coming to seem as ethereal as anyone
could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hopes to the contrary, it now appears more certain than
ever that most of the universe is made from some kind of unworldly
``dark matter'' that can pass right through ordinary matter,
leaving barely a trace. Scientists are also coming to believe that
empty space is pervaded by an equally mysterious ``dark energy,'' a
kind of anti-gravitational umph that is accelerating the cosmic
expansion, the explosion set off by the big bang.
</P>
<P>
   With a sense of irony, some physicists are calling this
hypothetical new force quintessence _ a reminder that Aristotle
wasn't so far off in believing that the heavens are more alien and
wondrous than meets the earthly eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual universe is far more interesting than the universe
of science fiction,'' said Dr. Lawrence M. Krauss, chairman of the
physics department at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
``Nature comes up with possibilities that no science fiction writer
would dare suggest.'' With a foot in both worlds, Krauss is the
author of ``The Physics of Star Trek'' and ``Quintessence,'' a
newly updated book about dark matter and dark energy.
</P>
<P>
   Dark matter was concocted to get around a disturbing fact:
Galaxies spin so fast that they should have twirled apart eons ago.
Count the stars in the Milky Way and add up their heft. The
inescapable conclusion is that there isn't nearly enough gravity to
hold the whole conglomeration together. Astronomers originally
hoped that something ordinary like dim, burnt-out stars hiding in
the galactic outskirts could account for the missing gravity. But
attempts to find these Machos, for ``massive compact halo
objects,'' have yet to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Deepening the mystery, cosmologists have concluded that the
universe probably couldn't have evolved the way it has unless most
of the dark matter is not just dark but invisible _ made from
exotic stuff that neither emits nor reflects light.
</P>
<P>
   What is this barely existing substance? Aristotle needed a
hypothetical essence with just the right properties to form the
luminous heavenly spheres. The theorists needed to come up with
particles that were massive enough to balance the scales of nature
and yet interacted only very weakly with ordinary matter. Otherwise
it would be hard to explain why the stuff hadn't already been
found. Tailor-made for this purpose is the ``weakly interacting
massive particle,'' or Wimp _ the paradoxically powerful rival to
the Macho.
</P>
<P>
   To separate itself from theology, science must find evidence
that its creations are real. At the recent conference in Marina del
Rey _ the full title was Fourth International Symposium on Sources
and Detection of Dark Matter in the Universe _ astronomers from the
University of Rome defended a dramatic claim they had posted on the
Internet earlier in the month: that they had detected a wind of
Wimps blowing through the earth as it moves across the sky.
Detecting a particle that was designed to be almost undetectable is
obviously quite a feat. Other researchers immediately disputed the
claim, and a California team that has been diligently seeking Wimps
declared that it had found none at all.
</P>
<P>
   And so the question of what accounts for the dark matter remains
appropriately up in the air. Experimenters are also looking for
other candidates, like the axion, a lightweight, weakly interacting
particle (ghostlier than the famously ghostly neutrino) that was
originally devised for an entirely different purpose: Unless there
were axions, physicists realized, an important theory in particle
physics would contain a glaring mathematical inconsistency. Named
after a popular laundry detergent, the axion would blot out the
stain.
</P>
<P>
   Even farther out into the speculative realm is a very heavy
version of the Wimp called the Wimpzilla. And farthest out of all
is the so-called mirror matter. While Wimps would react very
reluctantly with ordinary matter, the mirror matter would be even
more aloof, apparent only through its gravitational pull.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicists speculate that the mirror matter is just regular
matter trapped in another dimension. While its light is stuck
inside what amounts to a parallel universe, its gravity comes
shining through, bedeviling the astronomer's calculations. This
nether realm might also be home to the dark energy _ the
quintessence needed to give a boost to the cosmic expansion,
explaining why it is speeding up instead of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   Most scientists would rather find answers to the cosmic
mysteries without leaving their own universe. But if this is not
possible, there may be some consolation. Our shining stars would
look like dark matter to observers in the mirror world. If some
kind of cosmic justice prevails, astronomers on both sides of the
looking glass are sharing the same deep sense of confusion.

A CREDIBILITY GAP IN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest buzzphrase circulating among politicians and computer
industry executives these days is the digital divide, the gulf
between those who have access to computers and the Internet and
those who do not. Poor people and minorities, or so the thinking
goes, are in danger of being shut out of what promises to be the
most important mode of gathering and exchanging information, and
what is emerging as a common way of making and spending lots of
money.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, there is a growing recognition among those
dealing most closely with the issue that the term digital divide,
while clever and provocative, has become a catchall phrase for
politicians with conspicuous agendas and that the divide is a
complex phenomenon that no amount of measurement can fully explain.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, it seems that the nation is actually facing a
multitude of digital divides, not one limited to race or income or
education. While it is true that millions of people are still
without access to computers or the Internet, those who are counted
as connected fall along a spectrum: Some are dialing into the
Internet through antiquated rural phone lines that cannot handle
high data speeds, while others use ultra high-speed connections
from both work and home. Millions of others are getting their
connection only occasionally from public libraries, classrooms or
community centers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week was a busy time for those in the digital
bridge-building business. First, Vice President Al Gore visited a
San Francisco nonprofit group to deliver a speech on the divide.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, the Rev. Jesse Jackson opened a branch of his
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition in Silicon Valley, with the goal of closing
the divide among the poor. The same day, Jackson delivered a speech
at the University of California at Berkeley in which he pronounced
access to technology ``the newest stage of the civil rights
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, results of a survey conducted by National Public
Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government corroborated earlier studies that
found that at higher income levels there is virtually no racial
gap. More good news: Of those who bought computers in the last two
years, about one-third are from low-income or minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the survey found a persistent racial divide among
low-income households when it comes to computer ownership and
Internet access at home.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings may not spell out the problem as much as help
reveal its thorniness. It helps to start by looking at the ways in
which people connect to the Internet. Plenty of people have
connections at work, but some of them are not wired at home. In
addition, connecting to the Internet from work, a library or school
is quite different from connecting from the privacy of one's living
room. Experts say that the only way to fully appreciate the Web is
to experience it and that the most useful experience, unfettered by
the constraints of an institutional setting, comes with using the
Internet from home.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a high-speed cable modem connection gives a
Web surfer a far different view of cyberspace _ one that's
lightning quick and rich with sound and motion _ than that seen via
a slower link from a traditional modem.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, much of the digital bridge-building has focused on
schools. At first blush, the gap there doesn't seem especially
alarming. According to Market Data Retrieval, a company that has
surveyed the nation's public schools, 94 percent of schools in
wealthy districts have access to the Internet, compared with 84
percent of schools that serve poor populations.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures are deceptive. ``Those numbers fail to address
the nature of those connections,'' David Gollaher, chief executive
of the California Healthcare Institute, a nonprofit group in La
Jolla, Calif., told a group of health care experts who gathered
last week at Berkeley to discuss the digital divide and e-health
(industry shorthand for the delivery of health information and
services on the Internet).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the poorer schools, Gollaher said, connect to the
Internet using a relatively slow 56 kilobit-per-second connection,
which may be fine for sending e-mail but prevents a large
population of potential users from experiencing the full scope and
power of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gollaher later said it was not until he got a high-speed
connection at his home that his own children grew interested in the
Web. ``They download a lot of music, and they listen to radio
stations online,'' he said. ``Many of the uses they prefer are uses
that depend on high-speed connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have claimed in recent weeks that the digital
divide is actually a myth, that income at all levels might play a
greater role than race in disparities between the digital haves and
have-nots, though the two are often connected.
</P>
<P>
   The NPR survey disproved that claim with a finding that among
households of all income levels, 57 percent of whites under the age
of 60 have Internet or e-mail access from home, compared with 38
percent of blacks. In households where income is less than $30,000
a year, the study found, 34 percent of whites have access from
home, compared with 19 percent of blacks.

</P>
<P>
   That divide narrows drastically when online access takes place
outside the home, especially in the workplace. ``The gap largely
disappears everywhere except at home,'' said Molly Brodie, a vice
president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who oversaw the NPR
survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you start to look a little deeper, you see that the
biggest problem is at home,'' said Donna L. Hoffman, a professor of
management at Vanderbilt University and the co-author of a 1998
study with results similar to those in the NPR survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can understand what it can do for you
unless you use it,'' she said of the Internet. ``You have to try
it, then you can see the meaning it can have in your own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecting to the Internet from outside the home makes having
such an experience more difficult, she said. ``I just think it's
very hard to do that when you have a 30-minute limit, or when you
have to wait in line, or with others around.''
</P>
<P>
   David Greenbaum, a researcher at Berkeley who works with
community groups in Oakland to address the digital divide, suspects
that the problem of access from home might be one of cause and
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``One premise that underlies all of this is that if someone had
the right kind of access at home, they'd be much more involved in
the whole wired and online world,'' Greenbaum said. ``But if they
already had the impulse and interest to be part of that world, then
they'd have the kind of motivation to have a machine at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the NPR survey found no significant difference
between whites and blacks at low-income levels when it came to
owning other home electronics, like cable television and VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum said that at a recent digital divide conference in
Oakland, a number of people asked: ``Why is it people are willing
to spend $500 on a big wide-screen TV? How can we instill that same
kind of economic pull to a desire to being online?''

A CREDIBILITY GAP IN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest buzzphrase circulating among politicians and computer
industry executives these days is the digital divide, the gulf
between those who have access to computers and the Internet and
those who do not. Poor people and minorities, or so the thinking
goes, are in danger of being shut out of what promises to be the
most important mode of gathering and exchanging information, and
what is emerging as a common way of making and spending lots of
money.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, there is a growing recognition among those
dealing most closely with the issue that the term digital divide,
while clever and provocative, has become a catchall phrase for
politicians with conspicuous agendas and that the divide is a
complex phenomenon that no amount of measurement can fully explain.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, it seems that the nation is actually facing a
multitude of digital divides, not one limited to race or income or
education. While it is true that millions of people are still
without access to computers or the Internet, those who are counted
as connected fall along a spectrum: Some are dialing into the
Internet through antiquated rural phone lines that cannot handle
high data speeds, while others use ultra high-speed connections
from both work and home. Millions of others are getting their
connection only occasionally from public libraries, classrooms or
community centers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week was a busy time for those in the digital
bridge-building business. First, Vice President Al Gore visited a
San Francisco nonprofit group to deliver a speech on the divide.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, the Rev. Jesse Jackson opened a branch of his
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition in Silicon Valley, with the goal of closing
the divide among the poor. The same day, Jackson delivered a speech
at the University of California at Berkeley in which he pronounced
access to technology ``the newest stage of the civil rights
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, results of a survey conducted by National Public
Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government corroborated earlier studies that
found that at higher income levels there is virtually no racial
gap. More good news: Of those who bought computers in the last two
years, about one-third are from low-income or minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the survey found a persistent racial divide among
low-income households when it comes to computer ownership and
Internet access at home.
</P>
<P>
   Such findings may not spell out the problem as much as help
reveal its thorniness. It helps to start by looking at the ways in
which people connect to the Internet. Plenty of people have
connections at work, but some of them are not wired at home. In
addition, connecting to the Internet from work, a library or school
is quite different from connecting from the privacy of one's living
room. Experts say that the only way to fully appreciate the Web is
to experience it and that the most useful experience, unfettered by
the constraints of an institutional setting, comes with using the
Internet from home.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a high-speed cable modem connection gives a
Web surfer a far different view of cyberspace _ one that's
lightning quick and rich with sound and motion _ than that seen via
a slower link from a traditional modem.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, much of the digital bridge-building has focused on
schools. At first blush, the gap there doesn't seem especially
alarming. According to Market Data Retrieval, a company that has
surveyed the nation's public schools, 94 percent of schools in
wealthy districts have access to the Internet, compared with 84
percent of schools that serve poor populations.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures are deceptive. ``Those numbers fail to address
the nature of those connections,'' David Gollaher, chief executive
of the California Healthcare Institute, a nonprofit group in La
Jolla, Calif., told a group of health care experts who gathered
last week at Berkeley to discuss the digital divide and e-health
(industry shorthand for the delivery of health information and
services on the Internet).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the poorer schools, Gollaher said, connect to the
Internet using a relatively slow 56 kilobit-per-second connection,
which may be fine for sending e-mail but prevents a large
population of potential users from experiencing the full scope and
power of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gollaher later said it was not until he got a high-speed
connection at his home that his own children grew interested in the
Web. ``They download a lot of music, and they listen to radio
stations online,'' he said. ``Many of the uses they prefer are uses
that depend on high-speed connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have claimed in recent weeks that the digital
divide is actually a myth, that income at all levels might play a
greater role than race in disparities between the digital haves and
have-nots, though the two are often connected.

ABOUT FACE: GUESS WHO'S EMBRACING IMMIGRANTS NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   In 1994, Gov. Pete Wilson rode to re-election on his successful
support of Proposition 187, which barred the children of illegal
immigrants from attending public school in California.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Republican-led Congress pointed to the huge
budget deficit when it enacted legislation that barred hundreds of
thousands of legal immigrants from receiving food stamps and
federal disability assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant bashing then swept into the presidential campaign as a
wedge issue. Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, called
for barring the children of illegal immigrants from attending
schools. Wilson seized on anti-immigrant proposals to spur his
faltering presidential bid. And Pat Buchanan's motto may well have
been ``Don't give me your tired, your poor.''
</P>
<P>
   What a difference four years make. George W. Bush has denounced
the Republicans' past anti-immigrant initiatives and boasts that he
can speak Spanish, while Al Gore has even assayed a few stumbling
words of Espanol. Not only that, Republican Party strategists have
declared that Hispanics will be the soccer moms of this year's
campaign. It's as if immigrants have been transformed
Cinderella-like into the belles of the political ball. ``There's
been a remarkable turnaround,'' said Frank Sharry, executive
director of the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy group for
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why. Democratic and Republican strategists
agree that Hispanics may provide the swing votes in the four states
_ California, New York, Texas and Florida _ that have large
Hispanic populations and which, taken together, account for half
the electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   While immigrants tend to vote in smaller percentages than other
demographic groups, the number of Hispanic-American and
Asian-American voters is growing fast, and so are their campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants are also increasingly valued by Corporate America;
were the nation's 6 million illegal immigrants expelled tomorrow,
thousands of restaurants, hotels, farms, poultry plants and garment
factories and gardening companies would be forced to close for want
of workers. Some economists also believe that the nation's record
economic boom may have already sputtered without immigrants to fill
millions of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that without the flow of immigrants, we
would have hit much earlier the level at which we started to have
wage inflation, and that would have meant higher interest rates and
that would have reduced the spectacular growth that we see,'' said
Daniel Bachman, chief economist at Transatlantic Futures, a
Washington-based research institute. His opinion is shared by Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a low-wage, service economy phenomenon. The
high-tech sector has asked that the annual quota for high-skilled
immigrants be nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Unions, like many Republicans, viewed immigrants with suspicion.
The AFL-CIO, for example, saw them as an economic fifth column that
took away union jobs and depressed wages. Recently, however, it has
called for a general amnesty for illegal workers. In economic boom
times, with unemployment at 4 percent, these are potential union
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer have a knee-jerk reaction that immigrants drag
down the standard of living,'' said John Wilhelm, president of the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. ``We, the labor
movement, want to show we're on their side.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys by the Public Policy Institute of California found that
in 1994, 20 percent of Californians said immigration was the topic
they most wanted politicians to talk about, while this year only 2
percent of Californians feel that way. ``Whenever we're in boom
periods, as we are today, people are more generous in their
attitudes toward immigrants,'' said Mark Baldassare, survey
director at the California institute. ``Immigration is not a very
good wedge issue in the current economic climate,'' said Mark
Baldassare, survey director at the California institute.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans switched tacks after sifting through recent election
returns. In 1996, 72 percent of Hispanic voters backed Bill
Clinton, while 21 percent supported Bob Dole. And exit polls showed
that in California's 1998 race for governor, 78 percent of Hispanic
voters backed Gray Davis, the Democratic victor. Republican
strategists were also startled that in California alone, 250,000
Mexican and Salvadoran immigrants became naturalized Americans and
registered to vote in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The record number of immigrants who have sought citizenship,
registered to vote and then voted Democratic around the country in
recent years is widely viewed as a backlash against
Republican-backed, anti-immigrant policies. ``The politics of
immigrant bashing has backfired,'' said Harry Pachon, president of
the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, a research group in Claremont,
Calif. This has made a small group of Republicans, led by Jack Kemp
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, who spoke out against their
party's nativist policies, look prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic politicians risk being torn between Hispanic voters
and the traditionally Democratic African-Americans, who often see
them as competitors for jobs and political power. Nonetheless, with
demographers projecting that Hispanics will replace
African-Americans as the largest minority group in five years, the
role of Hispanics in politics will undoubtedly grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ellis Island immigrants of the early 1900s became a key
part of the New Deal coalition that led to decades of dominance by
the Democratic Party,'' said Sharry of the National Immigration
Forum. ``The new wave of immigrants is clearly up for grabs, and
with the tight races for Congress and the White House, this
fast-growing population can determine who dominates over the next
few decades.''

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Gay Democrats and Republicans _ in nearly a dozen states from
Massachusetts to Ohio, Georgia to Missouri and New York to
California _ head to the polls on Super Tuesday to make their
voices heard. These voices _ if loud and strong enough _ could make
a real difference in the upcoming presidential election.
 &HT;    ``In a close race, gay voters can be an important swing vote,''
says Sean Cahill, of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy
Institute. Cahill is the author of a recently released publication,
``What's at Stake,'' a primer for the 2000 presidential elections.
 &HT;    Issues of concern to gay voters have been featured prominently
in both parties' presidential debates. Democrats Bill Bradely and
Vice President Al Gore favor lifting the ban on openly gay members
of the armed forces. Republican hopefuls Gov. George W. Bush and
Sen. John McCain disagree and support the current ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy ban.
 &HT;    The last two presidential elections demonstrated the growing
political clout of gay voters. At the national level 5 percent of
registered voters in the 1996 presidential election identified
themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, according to Voters New
Service exit polls.
 &HT;    In states such as New York and California the gay vote may be as
high as 10 percent.
 &HT;    According to exit polling data and the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, the gay vote was a key part of President Clinton's
electoral coalition in 1992 and 1996. Clinton received 72 percent
of the gay vote in 1992 and 66 percent 1996.
 &HT;    Gay voting trends can also be seen in the Republican Party.
 &HT;    ``More and more gay voters are backing Republicans,'' writes
Cahill. ``While only one-quarter of gay, lesbian or bisexual voters
(GLB) backed Republican Congressional candidates in 1992, by 1998
one third of GLB voters backed Republican House candidates.''
 &HT;    Heading into Super Tuesday, increasing numbers of gay voters _
particularly the gay Log Cabin Republicans _ are mobilized by the
insurgent candidacy of McCain. In a recent campaign speech in
Virginia Beach, Va., he called religious right leaders Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell ``agents of intolerance. ''
 &HT;    Buoyed by his surprise victories in the New Hampshire and
Michigan primaries, McCain _ Vietnam War hero and self-described
``proud Reagan Republican '' _ appears poised to draw previously
disaffected Independents and even Democrats back into the voting
booth. Some of those voters will no doubt be gay.
 &HT;    There is no question McCain is the best choice for gay
Republicans. Despite the efforts of Log Cabin Republicans, the
G.O.P. has consistently positioned itself against any form of gay
civil-rights legislation.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, McCain met with the gay Log Cabin Republicans last
year and accepted more than $40,000 in campaign contributions.
 &HT;    ``I am unabashed, unembarrassed and proud to work with you,'' he
told Log Cabin. ``There is no room for discrimination in the party
of Lincoln,'' McCain says.
 &HT;    Bush balked at the idea of meeting with gay Republican
leadership. Last fall on ``Meet the Press,'' Bush told Tim Russert
he would ``probably not'' meet with Log Cabin ``because it creates
a huge political scene.''
 &HT;    There's little comfort on McCain's ``Straight Talk Express'' for
gays. Like Bush, he opposes federal hate crimes legislation, gay
and lesbian adoptions, same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships
as well as federal legislation banning employment discrimination
based on sexual orientation. In 1996 McCain voted against the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, a national employment
discrimination ban, which lost by a vote of 49-50.
 &HT;    Democrats offer a shining path of support for gay civil-rights.
Bradley and Gore are aggressively courting the gay community. When
it comes to gay voters' key issues _ hate violence,
anti-discrimination measures, parenting, adoption and foster care,
equality for same-sex relationships, health care and military
service _ the democratic contenders voice strong support for
equality and fairness.
 &HT;    ``If gay Americans can serve openly in the White House, in
Congress, in the courts, in the Treasury Department _ why can't
they serve openly in the military?'' Bradley says. ``It doesn't
make sense.''
 &HT;    ``I would try to bring about the kind of change in policy, on
the 'don't ask; don't tell' policy that President Harry Truman
brought about after World War II in integrating the military,''
Gore says.
 &HT;    Gay voters have countless good reasons to get to the polls and
vote on Tuesday.
 &HT;    ``The American public overwhelmingly supports our equal and fair
treatment,'' writes Cahill of the Task Force. ``This support has
increased markedly over the course of the 1990s.''
 &HT;    Let's keep that support on track and on the upswing by voting on
March 7. Swing this Super Tuesday.

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    Some life stories are filled with such courage and determination
that they beckon to be told. Here is the simple tale of Shenique
Gilbert, a 17-year-old senior at Hallandale High School, a
sprawling urban campus between Fort Lauderdale and Miami.
 &HT;    The mean streets of this South Florida city _ the violence, lack
of economic opportunities and low expectations _ have destroyed
many lives and prevented countless professional careers from taking
root. Most people agree only the smart, hardworking and very lucky
can successfully escape this environment.
 &HT;    Count Shenique among the smart and hardworking.
 &HT;    One of six children reared by a single mom, she has won a
$10,000 Horatio Alger Association scholarship. The scholarships are
given to 105 students nationwide who have overcome adversity and
have reached specific goals.
 &HT;    Alger, who died in 1899, wrote 100 best-selling books for boys.
The stories, such as ``Ragged Dick,'' ``Luck and Pluck'' and
``Tattered Tom,'' were about poor newsboys and other menial
laborers whose honesty and industry pushed them beyond adversity
and gained them economic success.
 &HT;    Indeed, adversity has been one of Shenique's constant
companions. Her father spent 10 years in prison, and her older
sister dropped out of high school. Her mother, Eddie Mae Ware, is a
devout Christian who has supported her children _ alone _ as a
house cleaner.
 &HT;    Drugs have been in Shenique's face all of her life, and
world-hardened brothers and sisters have tried to lure her away
from her dream of attending college and becoming a high school
history teacher.
 &HT;    But she has chosen to follow her dream.
 &HT;    In the fall, Shenique will attend Florida A&AMP;M University in
Tallahassee. She is president of Hallandale's student government, a
star in five sports and a scholar in the top 10 percent of her
class.
 &HT;    Shenique is not perfect, but try to find someone who has
anything negative to say about her.
 &HT;    Deidre Mobley, lead instructor for the school's Institute of
Business and Entrepreneurialship, said Shenique has more ``drive''
than any other student she has ever taught. The program is tough,
teaching students how to write resumes, how to dress and how to
venture into business with confidence and assertiveness. Each
student is carefully selected.
 &HT;    ``Shenique is out of this world,'' Mobley says. ``You don't see
this kind of motivation in most people her age. She will succeed
because of her positive attitude toward education. She looks toward
the future. When I first met her two years ago, she was quiet and
shy.
 &HT;    ``But she had a spark in her eyes, and she paid attention in
class. She has changed a lot. Now, she is outspoken. She takes
leadership both in class and out of class. I am very proud of her.
This is a tough two-year program.''
 &HT;    When asked to account for her bright future, Shenique does not
care if she is called a goody-goody.
 &HT;    ``I am doing well because of God, my mother and my family,'' she
says. ``All of my teachers, coaches and our principal help me. My
classmates are real supportive. My mother, though, is my role
model. She works hard and takes care of us. She motivates me, and
the rest of my family motivate me. They are depending on me to
succeed.
 &HT;    ``I will be the first one in my family to attend college. I'm a
good basketball player, and I hope to get a basketball scholarship,
too. I want to succeed for me and for them. After I finish college,
I want to come back here and teach history and own a business.''
 &HT;    In May, when Horatio Alger scholarship winners travel to
Washington, D.C., Shenique will be there, too. She and her peers
will spend a week visiting the Smithsonian Institution, touring the
Capitol and listening to some of the nation's political leaders,
including Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who will deliver a
special motivational speech.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, she will continue to study, run the student
government, play sports, help her mother clean their home and keep
her three siblings still living at home out of trouble.

THE DIALLO CASE: A QUESTION OF RACE

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    My more than 40 years as a journalist cushioned me from the
shock of learning that four black jurors joined eight white jurors
in a not-guilty verdict for the four New York City police officers
who, on Feb. 4, 1999, fired 41 rounds at Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
22-year-old black man from West Africa, striking him 19 times.
 &HT;    Diallo's only crime was standing in the vestibule of his Bronx
home.
 &HT;    Unlike many of my younger friends, I did not predict a hung jury
simply because there were four black women on the panel. I was
prepared for anything, because I've grown to understand a lot about
contradictory ``black responses'' that might confound the best of
America's social critics.
 &HT;    However, I was indeed stunned when, on Feb. 22, I heard two of
the black jurors say in a television interview that race never came
up during the 21 hours of jury deliberations.
 &HT;    How could race have been so consciously ignored? Surely the
frequently debated issue of ``racial profiling'' might have been
introduced at some point.
 &HT;    The verdict makes me question many things:
 &HT;    Would Diallo have been shot down so quickly and mercilessly in
his doorway if he had presented the typical ``boy next door'' image
_ like that of the blond, young, white gentleman who was convicted
of blowing up the federal building in Oklahoma City? Would Diallo
have fared better if he resembled the Columbine High School killers
_ also white _ instead of exposing a dark round face, a broad nose
and a fuzzy mustache over thick lips?
 &HT;    Doesn't Diallo's face resemble the countenance of thousands of
innocent young black men across America who are suspect in the
minds of cops? Henceforth, must they quiver in their doorways every
time a car loaded with plainclothes cops drives by at night with
the power to harass them, possibly kill them and go unpunished?
 &HT;    Since all sides agreed that Diallo was not being sought for any
crime, why didn't the jury find some of his slayers guilty of at
least one of the six charges against them, such as criminally
negligent homicide?
 &HT;    Over the years, I've observed a noteworthy thought pattern among
some African-Americans that may apply here: Some will bend over
backward to prove they are not biased. Others will voluntarily
ignore a sound judgment derived from their own remarkable social
histories. Instead, they elect to view the world through lenses
fashioned by whites.
 &HT;    Initially the defense team tried to remove three of the four
black women from jury consideration because of their race. The four
black jurors successfully proved the defense wrong.
 &HT;    Then there was the Bronx District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson, a
black man who appeared so eager to be fair-minded that he didn't
appoint a single black lawyer to the prosecution team in a case
which arose in a borough that is 77 percent black.
 &HT;    Yet race mattered from the trial's outset: The proceedings were
moved from the Bronx, a largely black neighborhood, to upstate
Albany, which is mostly white. The cautious prosecution team even
declined to refer to racial prejudice as a serious factor in police
conduct.
 &HT;    Finally, Justice Joseph C. Teresi told the jury to walk in the
shoes of the four white cops on the night of the Diallo slaying.
Consequently the question of race became a non sequitur, even
though according to Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general,
blacks constitute 62.7 percent of people stopped by the NYPD Street
Crime Unit to which the defendants belonged _ a unit that stopped
blacks 23 percent more times than whites.
 &HT;    Oddly enough, the judge did not ask the jurors to place
themselves in Diallo's shoes in those moments before his quick,
unexpected execution.
 &HT;    Let's not forget that Amadou Diallo was the only fatality on
that February night in the Bronx when four cops acted out their
unit's slogan: ``We own the night.''

Y2K `BLACKOUT'

 By AKILAH MONIFA  
 &HT;    Blacks are being ignored in the 2000 presidential race by both
major parties.
 &HT;    February may have been Black History Month in America, but not
on the campaign trail. Until now, African-Americans could count on
politicians at least feigning interest in our issues once every
four years. But as we enter the 21st century, with the economic
disparity between African-Americans and other citizens looming as
large as ever, I wonder why we are seeing a Y2K ``blackout'' on the
issues of greatest importance to our community.
 &HT;    According to the League of Women Voters, Ambassador Alan Keyes,
the only African-American in the race, is the only one with a
statement on affirmative action. Keyes, of course, is against it.
 &HT;    Only Sen. John McCain has a position paper on work-family
issues, another area of interest for many African-American voters.
 &HT;    And only former Sen. Bill Bradley has a statement on civil
rights issues _ although with the primary in South Carolina fast
approaching, he forcefully attacked racial prejudice and called for
the state to stop flying the Confederate battle flag above its
Capitol. Trailing Gore in the polls, Bradley apparently hopes South
Carolina's large black population will rescue him; his sudden
attention reeks of pandering.
 &HT;    Perhaps the Democrats think the black vote is a fait accompli.
In the last three presidential elections, nearly nine out of 10
African-Americans had voted Democratic.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Republicans are busy courting the Latino vote. For
the first time, Latino voters are being blitzed with a
multimillion-dollar bilingual ad campaign launched by the
Republican National Committee.
 &HT;    In 1996, 44 percent of Latinos voted, compared with 53 percent
of African-Americans and 60 percent of white voters, according to
Census Bureau data.
 &HT;    Yet the popularly held theory is that whoever wins the Latino
vote in California will win the presidency. And 40 percent of new
voters in California are Latino.
 &HT;    Even the Rev. Jesse Jackson has been conspicuously absent this
election season. In past elections, we could count on him to be an
outspoken player and advocate for our issues, regardless of whether
he was running. But this time it seems he has also abandoned us in
party politics.
 &HT;    The Associated Press reported that Jackson and his son Jesse
Jackson Jr. (D.-Ill.) are withholding endorsements in exchange for
a Democratic presidential candidate's promise to support a third
Chicago-area airport near the younger Jackson's district.
 &HT;    That leaves African-Americans in a political black hole, as
candidates scramble for other voters of color to get them over the
hump. Once catered to and wooed _ at least at election time _
African-Americans are, for the most part, being ignored. We are
out; Latinos are in.
 &HT;    This new form of neglect comes at a time when African-Americans
still experience unequal opportunities, despite state and federal
legislation. A digital divide looms between white people and people
of color: Only five African-Americans and one Latino sit on the
boards of companies in Silicon Valley, according to a 1999 survey
by the Coalition for Fair Employment in Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    Taxicabs still often refuse to stop for African-American men.
Racial profiling by police abounds as we drive, shop and live.
 &HT;    Employment discrimination is widespread, including in the arts.
On television, actors of color remain virtually absent despite
agreements last year between the NAACP and several networks to
increase the involvement of people of color in front of the camera
and behind the scenes.
 &HT;    In the past five years, while much of America has been riding a
wave of Silicon Valley-inspired prosperity, a University of
Michigan study found that the average African-American household's
net worth decreased from $8,400 to $7,500.
 &HT;    By contrast, the net worth of the median American household
increased 9 percent, to $59,000.
 &HT;    In his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech, the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. said African-Americans were living ``on a lonely island of
poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.''
 &HT;    Thirty-seven years after King's speech, it seems we are still on
that lonely island. Given the extraordinarily slow rate of
progress, all presidential candidates should be addressing the
issues and proposing solutions. But they aren't.
 &HT;    If King's dream is to become a reality, America needs
leadership. And leadership begins with presidential candidates who
must acknowledge the concerns of African-Americans and propose
solutions in their platforms. The only way to end a ``blackout'' is
to shed light on the issues.

 By MARK DAVIS  
 &HT;    A recent federal tally counted 157 online brokers competing for
your business. In this crowded marketplace, don't be too surprised
or impressed if a brokerage claims to be the No. 1 firm. The
Internet is flush with online broker rankings and hardly any two
agree.
 &HT;    According to Gomez Advisors Inc., the best-known judge of online
services, Charles Schwab earns the best overall ranking. But even
Gomez (at www.Gomez.com) hedges its bet. It also issues four other
top rankings that emphasize features such as cost and planning
tools.
 &HT;    When choosing a broker, look for a ranking that emphasizes the
features that matter to you. For example, Gomez Advisors calls
Schwab the best site for a ``One-Stop Shopper.'' But the same site
ranked 10th on the list for a ``Hyper-Active Trader.''
 &HT;    Other sites rank trading sites with different systems, but let's
start with the one factor they all share _ price. Even the most
expensive online brokers charge commissions that are a fraction of
what full-service brokers charge. And if you want any brokerage
firm's lowest commission, including a discount broker's cheapest
turn, you will have to open an account online.
 &HT;    After prices dropped dramatically in the early years of online
brokering, the commissions among the 10 largest online brokers now
hover at just under $16 a trade, according to averages calculated
by Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.
 &HT;    However, that average masks a considerable range. A trade at
Brown &AMP; Co. can cost as little as $5. A similar transaction would
cost $8, $9.99, $12, $14.95, $20, or $29.95 at other sites,
according to a comparison by Fortune magazine.
 &HT;    The real-market cost of a trade gets more complicated than just
a flat price. For starters, the price varies depending on what type
of order you use. That $5 Brown trade, for example, is for a market
order, the simplest type of transaction. Limit orders and other
strategic techniques often cost more.
 &HT;    The most popular sites go beyond handling transactions. They
offer online big payment services, financial planning, market
research, securities analyses and personal-finance software. In
fact, Schwab is currently the biggest online broker in terms of
market share, but at $29.95 per trade, it's also one of the
costliest.
 &HT;    A cheaper choice would be Firstrade Securities Inc., which will
execute the same order as Schwab for only $6.95.
 &HT;    Firstrade scored a perfect 10 in the most recent ``overall
cost'' comparisons by Gomez Advisors.
 &HT;    But focusing so much on price sacrifices the features and
convenience that drive people to trade online in the first place. A
look at the eight most popular online brokers _ Schwab, E*Trade,
 &HT;    Waterhouse Securities, Datek Online, Fidelity Investments,
Ameritrade, DLJ Direct and Discover Brokerage Direct _ shows no
correlation to prices, which start at Ameritrade with $8 per trade.
 &HT;    As a rule, expect no hand-holding at the less-expensive firms.
 &HT;    ``They're extremely nonservice-oriented,'' says Mark Lynch, a
Firstrade customer in Kansas who switched from Schwab over the
price issue. ``You just buy and sell stocks through them.''
 &HT;    The downside of trading online includes system crashes, software
glitches and trying to climb the learning curve while making
big-money trades.
 &HT;    In general, the pricier sites earn credit for being dependable
and having all those brokers to take calls when things break down.
 &HT;    The Securities and Exchange Commission reports that customers
complain most often about not being able to access their accounts.
Also prominent have been complaints that orders were delayed or
were not processed, or that errors occurred in processing them.
 &HT;    Depending on the financial context of your investments, one
botched trade by your brokerage firm could jeopardize any
cost-savings you achieved in low transaction fees.
 &HT;    Regulators found that one of the problems with delays is a
misconception by online customers that they're directly connected
to the stock market. Because most orders are confirmed almost
immediately, they assume it really works that way.
 &HT;    But trading online is fundamentally the same as visiting your
broker's office or calling to place an order on the telephone. The
customer still makes the order, and a licensed broker must execute
it. The distinction is that online brokers let you deliver the
order over the Internet which usually means your order reaches the
floor faster and more efficiently.

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Gay Democrats and Republicans _ in nearly a dozen states from
Massachusetts to Ohio, Georgia to Missouri and New York to
California _ head to the polls on Super Tuesday to make their
voices heard. These voices _ if loud and strong enough _ could make
a real difference in the upcoming presidential election.
 &HT;    ``In a close race, gay voters can be an important swing vote,''
says Sean Cahill, of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy
Institute. Cahill is the author of a recently released publication,
``What's at Stake,'' a primer for the 2000 presidential elections.
 &HT;    Issues of concern to gay voters have been featured prominently
in both parties' presidential debates. Democrats Bill Bradely and
Vice President Al Gore favor lifting the ban on openly gay members
of the armed forces. Republican hopefuls Gov. George W. Bush and
Sen. John McCain disagree and support the current ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy ban.
 &HT;    The last two presidential elections demonstrated the growing
political clout of gay voters. At the national level 5 percent of
registered voters in the 1996 presidential election identified
themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, according to Voters New
Service exit polls.
 &HT;    In states such as New York and California the gay vote may be as
high as 10 percent.
 &HT;    According to exit polling data and the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, the gay vote was a key part of President Clinton's
electoral coalition in 1992 and 1996. Clinton received 72 percent
of the gay vote in 1992 and 66 percent 1996.
 &HT;    Gay voting trends can also be seen in the Republican Party.
 &HT;    ``More and more gay voters are backing Republicans,'' writes
Cahill. ``While only one-quarter of gay, lesbian or bisexual voters
(GLB) backed Republican Congressional candidates in 1992, by 1998
one third of GLB voters backed Republican House candidates.''
 &HT;    Heading into Super Tuesday, increasing numbers of gay voters _
particularly the gay Log Cabin Republicans _ are mobilized by the
insurgent candidacy of McCain. In a recent campaign speech in
Virginia Beach, Va., he called religious right leaders Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell ``agents of intolerance. ''
 &HT;    Buoyed by his surprise victories in the New Hampshire and
Michigan primaries, McCain _ Vietnam War hero and self-described
``proud Reagan Republican '' _ appears poised to draw previously
disaffected Independents and even Democrats back into the voting
booth. Some of those voters will no doubt be gay.
 &HT;    There is no question McCain is the best choice for gay
Republicans. Despite the efforts of Log Cabin Republicans, the
G.O.P. has consistently positioned itself against any form of gay
civil-rights legislation.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, McCain met with the gay Log Cabin Republicans last
year and accepted more than $40,000 in campaign contributions.
 &HT;    ``I am unabashed, unembarrassed and proud to work with you,'' he
told Log Cabin. ``There is no room for discrimination in the party
of Lincoln,'' McCain says.
 &HT;    Bush balked at the idea of meeting with gay Republican
leadership. Last fall on ``Meet the Press,'' Bush told Tim Russert
he would ``probably not'' meet with Log Cabin ``because it creates
a huge political scene.''
 &HT;    There's little comfort on McCain's ``Straight Talk Express'' for
gays. Like Bush, he opposes federal hate crimes legislation, gay
and lesbian adoptions, same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships
as well as federal legislation banning employment discrimination
based on sexual orientation. In 1996 McCain voted against the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA, a national employment
discrimination ban, which lost by a vote of 49-50.
 &HT;    Democrats offer a shining path of support for gay civil-rights.
Bradley and Gore are aggressively courting the gay community. When
it comes to gay voters' key issues _ hate violence,
anti-discrimination measures, parenting, adoption and foster care,
equality for same-sex relationships, health care and military
service _ the democratic contenders voice strong support for
equality and fairness.
 &HT;    ``If gay Americans can serve openly in the White House, in
Congress, in the courts, in the Treasury Department _ why can't
they serve openly in the military?'' Bradley says. ``It doesn't
make sense.''
 &HT;    ``I would try to bring about the kind of change in policy, on
the 'don't ask; don't tell' policy that President Harry Truman
brought about after World War II in integrating the military,''
Gore says.
 &HT;    Gay voters have countless good reasons to get to the polls and
vote on Tuesday.
 &HT;    ``The American public overwhelmingly supports our equal and fair
treatment,'' writes Cahill of the Task Force. ``This support has
increased markedly over the course of the 1990s.''
 &HT;    Let's keep that support on track and on the upswing by voting on
March 7. Swing this Super Tuesday.

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    Some life stories are filled with such courage and determination
that they beckon to be told. Here is the simple tale of Shenique
Gilbert, a 17-year-old senior at Hallandale High School, a
sprawling urban campus between Fort Lauderdale and Miami.
 &HT;    The mean streets of this South Florida city _ the violence, lack
of economic opportunities and low expectations _ have destroyed
many lives and prevented countless professional careers from taking
root. Most people agree only the smart, hardworking and very lucky
can successfully escape this environment.
 &HT;    Count Shenique among the smart and hardworking.
 &HT;    One of six children reared by a single mom, she has won a
$10,000 Horatio Alger Association scholarship. The scholarships are
given to 105 students nationwide who have overcome adversity and
have reached specific goals.
 &HT;    Alger, who died in 1899, wrote 100 best-selling books for boys.
The stories, such as ``Ragged Dick,'' ``Luck and Pluck'' and
``Tattered Tom,'' were about poor newsboys and other menial
laborers whose honesty and industry pushed them beyond adversity
and gained them economic success.
 &HT;    Indeed, adversity has been one of Shenique's constant
companions. Her father spent 10 years in prison, and her older
sister dropped out of high school. Her mother, Eddie Mae Ware, is a
devout Christian who has supported her children _ alone _ as a
house cleaner.
 &HT;    Drugs have been in Shenique's face all of her life, and
world-hardened brothers and sisters have tried to lure her away
from her dream of attending college and becoming a high school
history teacher.
 &HT;    But she has chosen to follow her dream.
 &HT;    In the fall, Shenique will attend Florida A&AMP;M University in
Tallahassee. She is president of Hallandale's student government, a
star in five sports and a scholar in the top 10 percent of her
class.
 &HT;    Shenique is not perfect, but try to find someone who has
anything negative to say about her.
 &HT;    Deidre Mobley, lead instructor for the school's Institute of
Business and Entrepreneurialship, said Shenique has more ``drive''
than any other student she has ever taught. The program is tough,
teaching students how to write resumes, how to dress and how to
venture into business with confidence and assertiveness. Each
student is carefully selected.
 &HT;    ``Shenique is out of this world,'' Mobley says. ``You don't see
this kind of motivation in most people her age. She will succeed
because of her positive attitude toward education. She looks toward
the future. When I first met her two years ago, she was quiet and
shy.
 &HT;    ``But she had a spark in her eyes, and she paid attention in
class. She has changed a lot. Now, she is outspoken. She takes
leadership both in class and out of class. I am very proud of her.
This is a tough two-year program.''
 &HT;    When asked to account for her bright future, Shenique does not
care if she is called a goody-goody.
 &HT;    ``I am doing well because of God, my mother and my family,'' she
says. ``All of my teachers, coaches and our principal help me. My
classmates are real supportive. My mother, though, is my role
model. She works hard and takes care of us. She motivates me, and
the rest of my family motivate me. They are depending on me to
succeed.
 &HT;    ``I will be the first one in my family to attend college. I'm a
good basketball player, and I hope to get a basketball scholarship,
too. I want to succeed for me and for them. After I finish college,
I want to come back here and teach history and own a business.''
 &HT;    In May, when Horatio Alger scholarship winners travel to
Washington, D.C., Shenique will be there, too. She and her peers
will spend a week visiting the Smithsonian Institution, touring the
Capitol and listening to some of the nation's political leaders,
including Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who will deliver a
special motivational speech.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, she will continue to study, run the student
government, play sports, help her mother clean their home and keep
her three siblings still living at home out of trouble.

THE DIALLO CASE: A QUESTION OF RACE

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    My more than 40 years as a journalist cushioned me from the
shock of learning that four black jurors joined eight white jurors
in a not-guilty verdict for the four New York City police officers
who, on Feb. 4, 1999, fired 41 rounds at Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
22-year-old black man from West Africa, striking him 19 times.
 &HT;    Diallo's only crime was standing in the vestibule of his Bronx
home.
 &HT;    Unlike many of my younger friends, I did not predict a hung jury
simply because there were four black women on the panel. I was
prepared for anything, because I've grown to understand a lot about
contradictory ``black responses'' that might confound the best of
America's social critics.
 &HT;    However, I was indeed stunned when, on Feb. 22, I heard two of
the black jurors say in a television interview that race never came
up during the 21 hours of jury deliberations.
 &HT;    How could race have been so consciously ignored? Surely the
frequently debated issue of ``racial profiling'' might have been
introduced at some point.
 &HT;    The verdict makes me question many things:
 &HT;    Would Diallo have been shot down so quickly and mercilessly in
his doorway if he had presented the typical ``boy next door'' image
_ like that of the blond, young, white gentleman who was convicted
of blowing up the federal building in Oklahoma City? Would Diallo
have fared better if he resembled the Columbine High School killers
_ also white _ instead of exposing a dark round face, a broad nose
and a fuzzy mustache over thick lips?
 &HT;    Doesn't Diallo's face resemble the countenance of thousands of
innocent young black men across America who are suspect in the
minds of cops? Henceforth, must they quiver in their doorways every
time a car loaded with plainclothes cops drives by at night with
the power to harass them, possibly kill them and go unpunished?
 &HT;    Since all sides agreed that Diallo was not being sought for any
crime, why didn't the jury find some of his slayers guilty of at
least one of the six charges against them, such as criminally
negligent homicide?
 &HT;    Over the years, I've observed a noteworthy thought pattern among
some African-Americans that may apply here: Some will bend over
backward to prove they are not biased. Others will voluntarily
ignore a sound judgment derived from their own remarkable social
histories. Instead, they elect to view the world through lenses
fashioned by whites.
 &HT;    Initially the defense team tried to remove three of the four
black women from jury consideration because of their race. The four
black jurors successfully proved the defense wrong.
 &HT;    Then there was the Bronx District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson, a
black man who appeared so eager to be fair-minded that he didn't
appoint a single black lawyer to the prosecution team in a case
which arose in a borough that is 77 percent black.
 &HT;    Yet race mattered from the trial's outset: The proceedings were
moved from the Bronx, a largely black neighborhood, to upstate
Albany, which is mostly white. The cautious prosecution team even
declined to refer to racial prejudice as a serious factor in police
conduct.
 &HT;    Finally, Justice Joseph C. Teresi told the jury to walk in the
shoes of the four white cops on the night of the Diallo slaying.
Consequently the question of race became a non sequitur, even
though according to Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general,
blacks constitute 62.7 percent of people stopped by the NYPD Street
Crime Unit to which the defendants belonged _ a unit that stopped
blacks 23 percent more times than whites.
 &HT;    Oddly enough, the judge did not ask the jurors to place
themselves in Diallo's shoes in those moments before his quick,
unexpected execution.
 &HT;    Let's not forget that Amadou Diallo was the only fatality on
that February night in the Bronx when four cops acted out their
unit's slogan: ``We own the night.''

 By AKILAH MONIFA  
 &HT;    Blacks are being ignored in the 2000 presidential race by both
major parties.
 &HT;    February may have been Black History Month in America, but not
on the campaign trail. Until now, African-Americans could count on
politicians at least feigning interest in our issues once every
four years. But as we enter the 21st century, with the economic
disparity between African-Americans and other citizens looming as
large as ever, I wonder why we are seeing a Y2K ``blackout'' on the
issues of greatest importance to our community.
 &HT;    According to the League of Women Voters, Ambassador Alan Keyes,
the only African-American in the race, is the only one with a
statement on affirmative action. Keyes, of course, is against it.
 &HT;    Only Sen. John McCain has a position paper on work-family
issues, another area of interest for many African-American voters.
 &HT;    And only former Sen. Bill Bradley has a statement on civil
rights issues _ although with the primary in South Carolina fast
approaching, he forcefully attacked racial prejudice and called for
the state to stop flying the Confederate battle flag above its
Capitol. Trailing Gore in the polls, Bradley apparently hopes South
Carolina's large black population will rescue him; his sudden
attention reeks of pandering.
 &HT;    Perhaps the Democrats think the black vote is a fait accompli.
In the last three presidential elections, nearly nine out of 10
African-Americans had voted Democratic.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Republicans are busy courting the Latino vote. For
the first time, Latino voters are being blitzed with a
multimillion-dollar bilingual ad campaign launched by the
Republican National Committee.
 &HT;    In 1996, 44 percent of Latinos voted, compared with 53 percent
of African-Americans and 60 percent of white voters, according to
Census Bureau data.
 &HT;    Yet the popularly held theory is that whoever wins the Latino
vote in California will win the presidency. And 40 percent of new
voters in California are Latino.
 &HT;    Even the Rev. Jesse Jackson has been conspicuously absent this
election season. In past elections, we could count on him to be an
outspoken player and advocate for our issues, regardless of whether
he was running. But this time it seems he has also abandoned us in
party politics.
 &HT;    The Associated Press reported that Jackson and his son Jesse
Jackson Jr. (D.-Ill.) are withholding endorsements in exchange for
a Democratic presidential candidate's promise to support a third
Chicago-area airport near the younger Jackson's district.
 &HT;    That leaves African-Americans in a political black hole, as
candidates scramble for other voters of color to get them over the
hump. Once catered to and wooed _ at least at election time _
African-Americans are, for the most part, being ignored. We are
out; Latinos are in.
 &HT;    This new form of neglect comes at a time when African-Americans
still experience unequal opportunities, despite state and federal
legislation. A digital divide looms between white people and people
of color: Only five African-Americans and one Latino sit on the
boards of companies in Silicon Valley, according to a 1999 survey
by the Coalition for Fair Employment in Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    Taxicabs still often refuse to stop for African-American men.
Racial profiling by police abounds as we drive, shop and live.
 &HT;    Employment discrimination is widespread, including in the arts.
On television, actors of color remain virtually absent despite
agreements last year between the NAACP and several networks to
increase the involvement of people of color in front of the camera
and behind the scenes.
 &HT;    In the past five years, while much of America has been riding a
wave of Silicon Valley-inspired prosperity, a University of
Michigan study found that the average African-American household's
net worth decreased from $8,400 to $7,500.
 &HT;    By contrast, the net worth of the median American household
increased 9 percent, to $59,000.
 &HT;    In his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech, the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. said African-Americans were living ``on a lonely island of
poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.''
 &HT;    Thirty-seven years after King's speech, it seems we are still on
that lonely island. Given the extraordinarily slow rate of
progress, all presidential candidates should be addressing the
issues and proposing solutions. But they aren't.
 &HT;    If King's dream is to become a reality, America needs
leadership. And leadership begins with presidential candidates who
must acknowledge the concerns of African-Americans and propose
solutions in their platforms. The only way to end a ``blackout'' is
to shed light on the issues.

 By MARK DAVIS  
 &HT;    A recent federal tally counted 157 online brokers competing for
your business. In this crowded marketplace, don't be too surprised
or impressed if a brokerage claims to be the No. 1 firm. The
Internet is flush with online broker rankings and hardly any two
agree.
 &HT;    According to Gomez Advisors Inc., the best-known judge of online
services, Charles Schwab earns the best overall ranking. But even
Gomez (at www.Gomez.com) hedges its bet. It also issues four other
top rankings that emphasize features such as cost and planning
tools.
 &HT;    When choosing a broker, look for a ranking that emphasizes the
features that matter to you. For example, Gomez Advisors calls
Schwab the best site for a ``One-Stop Shopper.'' But the same site
ranked 10th on the list for a ``Hyper-Active Trader.''
 &HT;    Other sites rank trading sites with different systems, but let's
start with the one factor they all share _ price. Even the most
expensive online brokers charge commissions that are a fraction of
what full-service brokers charge. And if you want any brokerage
firm's lowest commission, including a discount broker's cheapest
turn, you will have to open an account online.
 &HT;    After prices dropped dramatically in the early years of online
brokering, the commissions among the 10 largest online brokers now
hover at just under $16 a trade, according to averages calculated
by Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.
 &HT;    However, that average masks a considerable range. A trade at
Brown &AMP; Co. can cost as little as $5. A similar transaction would
cost $8, $9.99, $12, $14.95, $20, or $29.95 at other sites,
according to a comparison by Fortune magazine.
 &HT;    The real-market cost of a trade gets more complicated than just
a flat price. For starters, the price varies depending on what type
of order you use. That $5 Brown trade, for example, is for a market
order, the simplest type of transaction. Limit orders and other
strategic techniques often cost more.
 &HT;    The most popular sites go beyond handling transactions. They
offer online big payment services, financial planning, market
research, securities analyses and personal-finance software. In
fact, Schwab is currently the biggest online broker in terms of
market share, but at $29.95 per trade, it's also one of the
costliest.
 &HT;    A cheaper choice would be Firstrade Securities Inc., which will
execute the same order as Schwab for only $6.95.
 &HT;    Firstrade scored a perfect 10 in the most recent ``overall
cost'' comparisons by Gomez Advisors.
 &HT;    But focusing so much on price sacrifices the features and
convenience that drive people to trade online in the first place. A
look at the eight most popular online brokers _ Schwab, E*Trade,
 &HT;    Waterhouse Securities, Datek Online, Fidelity Investments,
Ameritrade, DLJ Direct and Discover Brokerage Direct _ shows no
correlation to prices, which start at Ameritrade with $8 per trade.
 &HT;    As a rule, expect no hand-holding at the less-expensive firms.
 &HT;    ``They're extremely nonservice-oriented,'' says Mark Lynch, a
Firstrade customer in Kansas who switched from Schwab over the
price issue. ``You just buy and sell stocks through them.''
 &HT;    The downside of trading online includes system crashes, software
glitches and trying to climb the learning curve while making
big-money trades.
 &HT;    In general, the pricier sites earn credit for being dependable
and having all those brokers to take calls when things break down.
 &HT;    The Securities and Exchange Commission reports that customers
complain most often about not being able to access their accounts.
Also prominent have been complaints that orders were delayed or
were not processed, or that errors occurred in processing them.
 &HT;    Depending on the financial context of your investments, one
botched trade by your brokerage firm could jeopardize any
cost-savings you achieved in low transaction fees.
 &HT;    Regulators found that one of the problems with delays is a
misconception by online customers that they're directly connected
to the stock market. Because most orders are confirmed almost
immediately, they assume it really works that way.
 &HT;    But trading online is fundamentally the same as visiting your
broker's office or calling to place an order on the telephone. The
customer still makes the order, and a licensed broker must execute
it. The distinction is that online brokers let you deliver the
order over the Internet which usually means your order reaches the
floor faster and more efficiently.

   GREEN BANK, W.Va. _ The world's largest machine on dry land
seems out of place in the rugged isolation of Deer Creek Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But this patch of scarce flatland, sparsely populated and
surrounded by the Allegheny Mountains, is the ideal home for the
gleaming white two-acre radio telescope that looms above
neighboring farms.
</P>
<P>
   For four decades, this remote Pocahontas County hamlet has been
``the center of American radio astronomy,'' explained Mark
McKinnon, deputy site director of the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory facility at Green Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Shielded by the mountains from earthly interference such as
radio stations, Green Bank's sensitive telescopes have explored
distant galaxies by collecting radio waves since 1958. Now
construction crews are nearing completion of a colossal new one
packed with high-tech improvements. It could let astronomers
examine uncharted reaches of the universe, and perhaps alter our
conceptions of time and space and creation.
</P>
<P>
   The new Green Bank Telescope (GBT) will be ``the largest dynamic
structure on Earth,'' said McKinnon. The only bigger machines are
aircraft carriers and similar-sized ocean vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The project has taken more than a decade. It began shortly after
the collapse of Green Bank's 26-year-old radio telescope in late
1988. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., famous for looking after the home
folks, quickly convinced Congress to appropriate $75 million to
begin building a much bigger replacement.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable complications and delay, the new GBT _
weighing 16 million pounds and standing as tall as the Washington
Monument _ is to be completed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched the telescope take shape like a monstrous
roller-coaster, its neighbors are curious about what it will find,
and thankful for the dollars that its construction brought into a
hardscrabble community.
</P>
<P>
   The region was initially chosen for an observatory because of
``its lack of potential for economic development,'' said McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   Pocahontas County is about 100 miles long and 50 miles wide, but
only about 8,000 people live there. On the winding mountain roads,
some school buses take two hours to reach the high school in
Marlinton, the county seat. The Monogahela National Forest covers
much of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Steady paychecks are hard to come by. The observatory employs
110 people. Other residents are farmers or loggers. There is mostly
seasonal work at the Snowshoe Ski Resort on the far side of Little
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to string together several jobs to make a living,''
said Tony Samons, who works as the Green Bank barber and a finish
carpenter and preaches to a congregation of about 40 souls at the
Church of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three sets of people here,'' allowed Samons, who
charges $4 for a haircut. ``First there are the natives. To be a
native, your grandpa had to be born here.''
</P>
<P>
   Samons, who was born in Kentucky and moved here in 1979, puts
himself and many of the observatory people into a second group:
long-time residents who have reared families hereabouts, are
acquainted with everybody, but aren't ``natives.''
</P>
<P>
   The third group is made up of ``real outsiders'' such as
transient construction workers or visiting hunters, he said. ``The
natives call them pilgrims.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a stubbornly insular place, where folks mind their own
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a few people around who would sell you
moonshine if you wanted it,'' said Samons. ``But more grow
marijuana. They plant it in the national forest or between rows in
cornfields.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, Green Bank's churchgoers have a choice of the
Liberty Presbyterian, Wesley Chapel United Methodist, Hebron
Baptist or the Church of God. Wares at the Green Bank General Store
range from hand-sewn quilts to crossbows. A homemade ice cream
sandwich costs 69 cents, a double-edged ax goes for $45 and a used
mandolin will set you back $145. For a fee, the Mountain State Meat
Market will turn a hunter's venison into sausage, jerky or cured
deer ham.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bank has a clinic, a public library, an elementary school,
a post office, a hardware store, a volunteer fire department and
rescue squad, a bank, an Oldsmobile dealer, an antique store, a
one-chair barber shop and a combination convenience store, gas
station and pizza parlor.
</P>
<P>
   And now it has a new, world-class GBT _ which stands for ``Great
Big Telescope,'' according to local humorists.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   The Green Bank Telescope has been described as an ear to the
sky. But that's not exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   A radio telescope doesn't ``hear'' radio signals from outer
space any more than a car radio ``hears'' a Dixie Chicks song
broadcast by a country music station. Both have an antenna that
collects radio waves, said McKinnon. The car radio converts these
waves into sounds. The radio telescope translates them into images
or graphs that let astronomers learn about unseen objects in the
distant universe.
</P>
<P>
   Radio signals reaching Earth from faraway galaxies are feeble,
often barely discernible. So astronomers are constructing
ever-bigger antennae to catch them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like you can capture more raindrops in a bigger bucket,''
explained McKinnon. ``The GBT has two acres of collecting area. You
could build eight houses on it. It will be the largest fully
steerable radio telescope in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its size, the GBT has new technologies aimed at
helping astronomers examine the edges of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, there's the offset feed arm,'' said McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   In all radio telescopes, the antenna is a parabolic dish that
catches the radio signal and focuses it on a receiver. Earlier
models used support arms to hold the receiver over the middle of
the dish, but the arms blocked some of the incoming radio waves.
The GBT's angled feed arm holds the receiver without interfering
with incoming signals. The same design is used on some small home
TV satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Another technological advance is the GBT's ``active surface,''
said McKinnon. The surface of its parabolic dish is a mosaic of
2,004 moveable aluminium panels mounted on ``actuators.'' As the
giant dish is turned and tilted to face the incoming radio waves,
computers adjust the actuators to ensure that the surface is
absolutely smooth and is focusing the desired signal on the
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The telescope is surrounded by 12 range finders that use lasers
to scan the surface of the dish for any irregularities caused by
sun or wind. If the hot summer sun has expanded an exposed section
of the frame by a fraction of an inch, for instance, the lasers
will trigger a corrective movement of the surface panels.
</P>
<P>
   The collected radio signals from space are transmitted via fiber
optics from the telescope receiver to a control room and
observatory about a mile away. To keep its electronic equipment
from tainting the signal from space with their own faint radio
waves, this control room is lined with copper wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers use old diesel cars and trucks to drive to and from
the telescope _ eliminating the interference generated by spark
plugs in conventional gas-powered vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 million-pound telescope sits on 16 gigantic steel wheels
that roll on a circular metal track 210 feet across. The track
rests on a reinforced concrete foundation that extends 25 feet
below ground to the bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   A gigantic gear raises and lowers the elevation of the huge _
but delicately balanced _ parabolic dish and the offset arm that
angles over it. This whole asymmetrical shebang is made of welded
steel beams that had to be trucked in over the mountainous roads.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its enormous size, the GBT is designed to operate more
precisely than a quartz watch, said McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers from around the world will use the GBT.
</P>
<P>
   The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the
National Science Foundation, a federal agency, and operated under
an agreement with Associated Universities, Inc., a consortium of
academic institutions. The National Radio Astronomy Observatory has
other telescopes at Socorro, N.M., and Kitt Peak, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The facilities operate under an ``open sky policy,'' explained
McKinnon. Leading astronomers submit research proposals and
requests for time on a telescope. A panel of scientific referees
decides which projects are worthy. Highly trained telescope
operators help conduct these searches of outer space. Sometimes the
data is transmitted over the Internet, sparing astronomers the trip
to isolated telescope sites.
</P>
<P>
   There are trade-offs for scientists living here in the center of
the National Radio Quiet Zone, set up by the Federal Communications
Commission to protect the purity of signals from outer space.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better place for a radio telescope. But it's an hour
and a half drive to the grocery store or a movie. Winter weather
can be brutal. On the other hand, by staying on the second-grade
honor roll, 8-year-old Caitlin McKinnon earns free skiing
privileges for herself and her parents on nearby Snowshoe slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance into the community is sometimes slow. Fertile
flatland is rare and coveted. Some farmers resented that the
observatory seized such a prime spot. West Virginia has been stung
by companies that deserted the state after clearing forests for
timber or bulldozing mountaintops for coal.
</P>
<P>
   There are lingering suspicions that ``outsiders come to take,''
said McKinnon, who has lived at Green Bank for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The mountains are beautiful but harsh, said Samons, the barber
and preacher. ``I wouldn't live anywhere else.''

   &UR; gfcapsline &LR;  &UR; ufcdrop,5 &LR;  W  &UR; rr &LR;  OODSIDE, Calif. _ In Silicon Val-
ley, where failure is worn like a badge of courage, Ann Meceda is a
shining exam- ple of success.
</P>
<P>
   At 28, she is already on her third start-up, having been chief
executive of one, executive vice president of new media for
another, and now executive vice president of business development
at a third Internet venture.
</P>
<P>
   Showing no signs of fatigue, Meceda agreed to sit down for
dinner recently to discuss what it feels like to be part of a new
generation of hard-charging, risk-defying, and
nomadic &UR;  &LR; entrepreneurs flooding the Valley with wave after wave of
Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do like the concept of starting with nothing and cre- ating
something out of it,'' said Meceda, looking relaxed and composed in
her gray sweater and indigo jeans as she nibbled on a chicken
sandwich at Buck's, an eclectic diner that over the years has
become the de facto breakfast hangout for Silicon Valley venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged journey for Meceda began in 1997, six months before
she was to graduate from the Haas School of Business at the
University of California at Berkeley. Meceda and a group of fellow
classmates launched a start- up called Private Communications Corp.
as a project for a class on entrepreneurship. PCC was built around
the con- cept of an ``anonymous, disposable telephone number'' that
could be used by online dating services to let people extend their
online chats over the phone without having to disclose their real
phone numbers.

   In May, just weeks before graduating, Meceda be- came the
company's CEO, knowing that the business could just as easily burst
into flames as catch on like wild-H fire. Her decision to forgo a
job in Paris with a global entertainment company to head a risky
start-up became  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  the subject of a 1998
Harvard Business School case study.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months after she took the job, PCC ran out of money, despite
having raised $324,000 in capital, and Me-H ceda moved on. She
jumped to another start-up, HLH Entertainment, a music production
company in San Fran- cisco, as chief financial officer and then
executive vice president of new media. Folks at HLH didn't bat an
eye- lash over her experience at a failed start-up.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech &UR;  &LR;  start-up business is like baseball, ac- cording
to Randy Komisar, a veteran Silicon Valley entrepreneur who helped
found Claris Corp. among other companies. One can ``fail 70 percent
of the time and still be considered a success,'' Komisar wrote in
his upcoming book, ``The Monk and the Riddle,'' which is being pub-
lished in May by the Harvard Business School Press.
 &UR; -------------------- &LR;  ``The Valley recognizes that failure is an
unavoidable part of the search for success.''
</P>
<P>
   Meceda, the daughter of two entrepreneurs, seems unfazed by past
adversity or the possibility of sudden failure in the future. She
is now involved in an Internet start-up that is currently in
``stealth mode,'' a Silicon Valley tactic that calls for absolute
secrecy about &UR;  &LR;  the company's business plan in order to prevent
copycats during the crucial ramp-up phase. The wraps come off in
April. By then, &UR;  &LR;  her company would have created a comfortable head
start over its rivals, Meceda says. Until then, she &UR;  &LR;  is not even
allowed to reveal her company's name. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Asked whether she is a millionaire yet, Meceda laughed
and &UR;  &LR; said no. After a moment's thought, however, she changed her
answer. ``Maybe,'' said Meceda, who explained that her equity in
HLH might be worth $1 &UR;  &LR;  million, depending on how well the company
did in its last round of financing. ``I'm just not sure,'' she said
with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Meceda noted that some of her &UR;  &LR;  peers &UR;  &LR;  talk about ``being
done,'' accumulating enough wealth to be able to pursue other
interests. ``It's about achieving a sense of financial freedom, to
have a choice as op- posed to having money for money's sake,'' she
explained.
</P>
<P>
   But Meceda doesn't look forward to ``being done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have an endpoint,'' Meceda said. ``As long as
people keep coming up with ideas, I've got a job.''

 &HT;    Bill brings back bird brawl
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Not everyone shares my enthusiasm for the
Florida Legislature. But I look on the first Tuesday after the
first Monday of March as something of a holiday. It kicks off a
two-month period when the state's editorial writers and columnists
may open their newspapers each morning confident that outrages and
comedy will leap from the pages. You just need to write it down
fast enough. This session should be no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Perusing the list of pre-filed bills _ legislation already in
the works before the session starts _ one finds all the perennials.
</P>
<P>
   Bills to gut the growth management law? Check. Bills to allow
more secrecy at all levels of government? Check.
</P>
<P>
   Bills to create tax breaks to select little niches of commercial
endeavor. Check, check and the check is in the mail. Bills that are
entirely symbolic but guaranteed to start an argument? Check.
</P>
<P>
   I was particularly happy to find the return of some legislation
in that last category _ a bill to give Florida a better state bird.
</P>
<P>
   I have long been a student of my state's weird array of official
symbols. State statutes describe the official state soil as myakka
fine sand (and a fine sand it is). Our official state reptile may
be bought in rubber replica at any better souvenir store. We have
an official beverage, official butterfly, official state fish
(freshwater and saltwater), official flower, official wild flower,
official gem, official shell, official stone, official tree,
official water mammals (freshwater and saltwater) and an official
state band (The St. Johns River City Band and not Jimmy Buffett's
Coral Reefer Band.)
</P>
<P>
   The official state song, ``Suwannee River,'' is an
embarrassment. I don't know how many Floridians can sing with any
conviction that they are ``still longing for de old plantation,''
but I suspect not enough to staff a good-sized Civil War
reenactment.
</P>
<P>
   Florida doesn't have a very strong identity. Even more than most
Americans, we are still deciding who we are. This makes the quest
for new symbols poignant, strange and sometimes surprisingly
heated.
</P>
<P>
   That happened last year when changing the official state bird
was debated hotly. The state bird is the mockingbird, a common,
noisy, aggressive creature found everywhere in the continental
United States. It's a
</P>
<P>
   bland state symbol that implies we don't have anything more
interesting on the wing around here.
</P>
<P>
   The suggested replacement was the scrub jay, a bird found only
in Florida but sadly in short supply. But the bird's threatened
status got the attention of development interests who saw state
bird status as a propaganda tool for environmentalists. They
imagined headlines like ``Strip mall slated in state bird's
habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   The development issue, however, stayed in background. Instead,
opponents went negative on the jay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They eat the eggs of other birds,'' huffed Marion Hammer, the
veteran NRA lobbyist enlisted to fight the scrub jay menace.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's criminal conduct, that's robbery and murder.''
</P>
<P>
   She described the bird as ``lazy,'' displaying ``a welfare
mentality.'' She almost called it a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   With legislators deadlocked on which was the nicer bird, the
bill died.
</P>
<P>
   The scrub jay bill is back for another try. This time, it says
right in the legislation ``that the designation of the Florida
scrub jay is the official state bird is strictly symbolic and does
not require any additional protections or acquisition of habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   There it is in black and white: Just because it's the state bird
doesn't mean we have to stop killing it. With this spelled out in
the act, there should be no reason to oppose the little scrub jay.
Personally, I'd feel better with a limpkin or great white heron,
but a scrub jay works fine for me. It's a truly native bird, and
one that, like much of natural Florida, is every year steadily
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators should assent and move to more pressing
concerns. Like finding a hotter official state band or proudly
designating Key lime as the official state pie.

 &HT;    Weight-loss gurus' wallets grow fatter as you grow more confused
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Losing weight is simple, yet Americans spend $50
billion a year on weight-loss programs.
</P>
<P>
   Every year Americans get fatter.
</P>
<P>
   Film director Oliver Stone should make a movie about this giant
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the government sponsored a food fight among the diet
industry's heavyweights. That's suspicious right there.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneur behind the Atkins Diet, Dr. Robert Atkins,
squared off with Dr. Dean Ornish, the author of ``Eat More, Weigh
Less'' and four other best-selling diet books.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barry Sears was on hand to defend his lucrative high-protein
Zone diet.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of those billions that fat Americans shell out every
year fill the pockets of these three men.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand at the Agriculture Department's ``great nutrition
debate'' were other fat cats in the nutrition and diet promotion
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the department sponsored
the debate because ``there is so much confusing, conflicting
information out there.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Americans love to buy diet books. They buy tons of
them. The only books Americans buy more than diet books are
cookbooks. Book stores can't stock enough diet cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Book publishers must be one of the secret ingredients in this
sure-fire recipe for wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The creators of some of the more lucrative diets sell their own
diet food to accompany their diet regimens.
</P>
<P>
   Expensive brand-name nutritional supplements come in pills,
candy bars, powders and drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, best-selling diets have emphasized hamburgers,
acupuncture, grapefruit, crystal therapy, steaks, hypnosis, high
carbohydrates, low carbohydrates, fasting, meditation, papaya juice
and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   High protein diets are hot right now.
</P>
<P>
   Most nutritionists, doctors and researchers who are not peddling
diet books or diet products are unimpressed with all the diet fads.
</P>
<P>
   So am I, although I have no diet, nutrition or weight-loss
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   I've never been on a diet, but I have gained and lost a lot of
weight in my lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The way I see it, unless someone has a medical problem, gaining
and losing weight are simple enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy people gain weight by taking in more fuel than they
burn.
</P>
<P>
   Cars and people both need fuel.
</P>
<P>
   If you add too much fuel to a car, it overflows on the ground
and pollutes the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, if you add too much fuel to your body, it does
not spill out on the ground. Instead, the extra fuel pollutes your
body.
</P>
<P>
   Fat people have these big, expandable fuel tanks they haul
around with them.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fuel people funnel into their bodies is far from
premium grade. People would never dream of putting the sort of junk
fuel in their cars that they put in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Premium gasoline may be too expensive for some motorists.
Premium-grade food, however, is generally less expensive than the
outsized portions of low-grade food that Americans gulp down daily.
</P>
<P>
   America would not be in the midst of an obesity epidemic if
people who supersized their fuel intake supersized their energy
output.
</P>
<P>
   Overeating followed by junk snacks and drinks while watching
television makes people fat. An evening of pushing remote control
buttons won't burn a french fry's worth of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Losing weight is just as simple as gaining weight.
</P>
<P>
   Stop overeating, take in only premium-grade food, and burn off
all that extra fuel you poured into your body.
</P>
<P>
   Losing weight is simple, but it sure isn't easy.

 &HT;    ``Polls are out...weather and naked ladies are in''
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ What with ``Super Tuesday'' and all, I'd have
thought politics would be the argument of choice this morning among
my retired buddies at the cafe. Not so. They're talking about water
tables, vacations, and women. Mostly women.
</P>
<P>
   Cal says if we don't start getting some rain and quick, farmers
are in for a rough season. ``No rain in sight,'' he quotes the AM
radio show he listens to every morning. ``They promised Tuesday,
but weathermen are like wives. They'll promise you anything just
so's you'll listen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that ought to be a lesson to you,'' I suggest. ``Maybe
you should start paying attention.'' Cal says that wouldn't be a
smart thing to do because if he started listening to Hazel after
all of these years she'd probably think he was up to something.
</P>
<P>
   ``More'n likely, no good,'' Amos chimes in with the obligatory
snicker. The boys are at it again. They've been goading and jabbing
one another with wisecracks like these for a lot longer than the 17
years I've known them. They'll admit to at least 70.
</P>
<P>
   It's always fun embroiling these two in a political discussion.
One usually winds up red in the face while the other pounds his
palm on the table so hard it jiggles the coffee mugs. But this
morning, nobody's going for the bait.
</P>
<P>
   Cal, a lifetime Republican, says he's as sick of pols and polls
as he is of that lousy bran cereal his wife feeds him every
morning. ``She says it's good for me. I ask her who wants to live
forever if he has to eat fodder for breakfast.'' Every once in a
while, he'll sneak in a short stack at the cafe, swearing all of us
to secrecy should we run into Hazel in the market or at church on
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   About this time Benny huffs in straight from his brisk two-mile
morning walk. We slide our chairs around to make room for him as he
mops his brow. ``Boy,'' he exclaims between deep breaths, ``I sure
do feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Amos asks him why he looks so bad if he's feeling so good.
Benny, who recently had some bypass work done, tells Amos he's just
jealous because he couldn't make a couple of miles if he had all
day.
</P>
<P>
   Amos, who has a zipper in his chest just like Benny's, denies
this. ``I get all the exercise I need just going from my chair to
the icebox.'' He giggles, clapping a hand over his mouth which
means he forgot to put in his bridge this morning, and tells us
Lucy has been threatening to have their boys move the refrigerator
to the barn so he'd have to work harder for his ice cream. ``All
</P>
<P>
   she buys me is that no-fat stuff. Tain't really ice cream, is
it?'' He answers himself with a sad shake of his head and a
drawn-out ``Naa-aw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So who're we voting for this year?'' I ask, trying again.
Benny says he doesn't care any more as long as Nixon doesn't get
it. Amos looks at him kind of funny and asks him if he hadn't heard
Nixon is dead. Benny says he was being sarcastic, but Cal says it
wouldn't surprise him any if a dead guy got elected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one wants to talk politics which is not normal for
this usually fractious bunch. This is the fifth presidential
election year I've spent over coffee cups with these guys and their
sudden reticence on things political is puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   Amos wants to talk about his plane ride to Arizona, and Cal is
lengthily describing a picture of some movie star he saw in last
week's Time. ``She didn't have on enough of a dress to blow your
nose in. Honest, she was as good as nekkid.'' Benny wants to know
if he saved the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   My mind wanders off while the guys are chewing on that one, and
I can't help thinking that if this corner of northwest Ohio is any
indicator, the entire democratic process is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Pols and polls are out...weather and naked ladies are in.
</P>
<P>
   Around here folks, it's back to basics.

 &HT;    You won't mind zombies taking revengeBy Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News ServiceFOR THE CONSOLE:
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's gross, it's gratuitously violent and the story's stupid,
but there's something about Sega's Zombie's Revenge ($50,
www.dreamcast.com) that's totally addictive. In the game, you are
one of three characters hacking, shooting or punching your way
through hundreds of zombies. The game is based on the arcade hit
and plays pretty close to the standup model. This makes for
lightning-fast game play _ if you blink or lose concentration, you
die. There is also the cool part of the game where you can pick up
almost anything and use it as a weapon. Zombie's Revenge is a
``must'' for the shooter game addict or anyone else who enjoyed
Sega's ``Dynamite Cop.''
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP:
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, last year on the PC, the game is an
involved, addictive, turn-based simulation tracking the future of
seven political and cultural factions starting new civilizations on
an undeveloped planet. Taking control of one of these factions, you
rebuild an alien landscape, engage in domestic relations and
balance your power between battle and scientific or cultural
advancement. To say this game is deep doesn't begin to describe
Alpha Centauri's complexity. It's a must-have for any
empire-building gamer, and now Mac fans have a chance to own it,
too.

 &HT;    Search the world for long-lost friends
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that it seems almost everyone in the world is
online, with an e-mail account and a Web page, one task is easier
than ever _ finding a friend from years ago.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find directories and search engines made for just that
task. With any luck, you can track down that high school
sweetheart, college roommate or the fellow who borrowed that book
and never returned it.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point for your search is Switchboard.com, a
search engine that helps you find an e-mail address, as well as
telephone numbers and even street addresses. So head to
www.switchboard.com/ and select the link called People Search. Once
there, you enter as much information as you have. The only
essential item is a last name. So you could _ foolishly for sure _
search the nation for all the Smiths. You can already see that it
will help if the person you are searching for has a fairly unusual
last name. But if you can narrow the search by supplying the city
and the first name, your search should be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet people-finders work the same way. But there's a
good reason to bookmark every search engine of this type you can
find. Since there isn't a master list of all Internet users, each
search engine will have a different group of names and addresses.
</P>
<P>
   So go next to Bigfoot.com, another longtime people-finder
located at www.bigfoot.com/. One really handy search feature here _
besides the one described above _ is the ability to find out a
person's name and address by entering an e-mail address. This
feature only works with those who have created a profile on
Bigfoot, so don't be disappointed if your search doesn't return any
information.
</P>
<P>
   One must in your list of people-finders is PeopleSearch.com. It
truly is different from the other sites. For one thing, this site
at www.peoplesearch.com/ uses multiple search engines to find a
person. That search is free; simply look for the link labeled Free
People Search. For another, just in case you have tried all the
other search techniques and still can't find the person, there's
even more help available. You'll pay for that help, starting at
$39, but there are times _ when a person has changed his or her
name because of marriage or just because the world is crawling with
people with that same name _ that you may need the help.
</P>
<P>
   Web pages are an excellent way to locate a person. And even if
your friend doesn't have a Web page of his own, there's a good
chance that another Web page may mention them. Businesses, schools
and social organizations often maintain directories that, at the
least, contain e-mail addresses and names of members. So use a
search engine _ AltaVista (www.altavista.com) is my choice for
searches like this because it does a good job of searching the body
of the page _ and simply enter your friend's name. Let's suppose
the name is Martha Smith. Enter it this way in AltaVista: ``Martha
Smith'' (include the quote marks). That is how you tell the search
engine to return only pages that contain those two names in that
exact order. If you don't do that you'll find every Martha, every
Smith, a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, check the newsgroups. This is a subset of the Net where
people post messages according to topic areas. To find out if your
friend has left a message there (it will contain an e-mail address)
use this page _ which contains a variety of newsgroup search
engines _ at www.lycos.com/computers/internet/newsgroups.html.

 &HT;    Help with your taxes

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Internal Revenue Service: The friendly IRS Web site opens with
the newsy Digital Daily. When we checked in, it was reminding
America that ``more than 1.6 million taxpayers who failed to file
tax returns for 1996 risk losing about $2 billion in refunds if
they don't get their late returns to the IRS'' this year. We
thought that sort of procrastination was illegal or something. The
site offers forms that can be filled in on-screen and then printed
for mailing. www.irs.ustreas.gov/
</P>
<P>
   Waste Basket: Just for fun, look here to read about what the
government does with our hard-earned money. The site is by a
watchdog group called Taxpayers for Common Sense, which monitors
proposals for federal land giveaways, boondoggles, corporate
handouts and budget gimmicks.

   H&AMP;R Block: When we looked, H&AMP;R Block, the granddaddy of tax
help, told us it was having ``difficulty handling everyone trying
to use our online tax program'' and was not accepting new users for
the $9.95 service. As it turned out, the site was also dealing with
a glitch that let some visitors view other people's financial data.
Yikes! The company promised to be back up soon, though, and as an
alternative was offering its downloadable software free, along with
a coupon for $10 off at an H&AMP;R Block office.

the service uses your financial information to target you with

gross incomes under $20,000 will also be done free, Intuit says. As
is true with most such sites, you need not do all the work in one

 &HT;    Resources aid in LAN-making Home network within reach
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Here's background on why we're taking up this space. We're
problem solvers. We investigate, figure things out, learn _
sometimes the hard way _ teach and bring new technology to the
newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: We don't know it all, but we can point you to a sea of
information and help navigate. We'll teach you to fish by tapping
the Internet, reference books, your instincts and common sense to
get the most out of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You've asked lots of questions about networking two, maybe
three, home computers and sharing files and a printer. The
technology's there. Why not make sharing easier than playing pass
the floppy or Zip? Turn Dad's printer into the ``family'' printer?
Share an Internet connection? That's why we're devoting this column
to the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You'll be creating your own LAN, or Local Area Network.
Impressive. If you've never heard of a LAN or need to know basic
network-speak, cruise to the Miramar Systems Inc. Networking 101
link (www.miramarsys.com
</P>
<P>
   /home/net101.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You must decide the size of your network and how much you
can spend. Some options include Ethernet, phone wire and wireless
networking. There's even a nifty power outlet deal. A quick
tutorial on Ethernet: It's a tried-and-true method of data
communication that requires a chunky cable, fatter than a phone
wire, connected from each computer Network Interface Card into a
hub (where you park devices on a LAN so they can chat). You'll have
to jump through some internal network hoops to share an Internet
connection. A place to start is the NETGEAR site (netgear
</P>
<P>
   .baynetworks.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There's the obvious, which is using your phone line. To
find out about AnyPoint from Intel, surf to www.intel.com/anypoint.
A slick wireless option is the Airport for the Macintosh
(www.apple.com/airport/). We love Macs. Wireless is where we're all
headed. No more tangles.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Breathe, Jacki. Bear in mind that wireless is costlier. A
reliable and fast wireless PC solution would be Proxim (www.proxim
.com/). Or, hey, you may like the idea of plugging into a power
outlet to create a network. No NIC installs or hubs. For
quick-and-easy, go to Intelogis (www .intelogis.com). You can share
a printer, files and an Internet connection within minutes, all at
around $200.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: For a good list of home network kits, try ZDNet
(www.zdnet.com/products/stories/reviews/0,4161,2226069,00.html).
Kits have it all. Hardware and software, for as little as $90. And,
yep, you can shell out more, too. Prices vary depending on how
cutting-edge the network option, the ``plug-and-playishness'' of
the kit, who installs NICs, the type of cabling and the hub size.
The possibilities are all over the map.

 &HT;    National park digital guides cover nuances from every angle
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It would be hard to find two more utterly different
places than Yellowstone National Park and the Okefenokee Swamp: one
majestic, the other dark and brooding.
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, the most magical places I have ever seen, and
I haven't seen nearly enough of them.
</P>
<P>
   Maptech, whose reproductions of Geological Survey maps of North
Georgia we discussed some time ago, has produced a series of
National Park Digital Guides for all 54 national parks. I've been
tracing on one of them the places we saw at Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   I'm parked now overlooking the Hayden Valley, not far from the
Lake Hotel, in the hour before dawn. Our son, an outdoor
photographer, was working in the park, and he brought us to that
spot at just that time. I cannot remember the last time I saw land
illuminated by starlight; it may have been 50 years ago, when
coyotes yapped and sang around our house just as they do now in the
valley.
</P>
<P>
   The park maps have all the advantages of Maptech's standard
topographical maps _ you can measure distances as the crow flies or
along a path, and when you have laid out your distance line you can
switch to a profile view that shows how much uphill and downhill
you'll have to contend with. You can zoom in and out, mark up a map
with a trail you want to hike and print it out.
</P>
<P>
   The maps also have a lot of text; there are guides to services
in the park you're looking at, plus discussions of the flora and
fauna, history, climate and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   The Okefenokee is included on the CD-ROM in Maptech's terrain
Navigator series that also covers the Georgia coastal area. All the
same goodies are here, even the profile views, although there isn't
much profile to the Okefenokee.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to find Billy's Island, the turnaround point in our
epic motorboat adventure. The problem with outboard motors like
those they rent in the swamp is that they steer exactly opposite
the way one steers a car. It takes a while to remember which way to
twist the throttle to run it up or shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect there's an alligator that hangs out not far from
Billy's Island who still has nightmares about our encounter; I can
only hope we didn't stunt his growth. He was only about 3 feet long
when we met; he was minding his own business, sunning himself on a
partially submerged log.
</P>
<P>
   A close-up photo was in order. With the captain at the helm and
his lady in the bow, the idea was to run up the motor briefly, then
shut it off entirely and glide soundlessly as close to the 'gator
as we could. I maneuvered the boat around to line up with the log,
the memsahib positioned herself up front, and I put the motor in
gear. Unfortunately, instead of shutting it down, I twisted the
wrong way and put the pedal to the water, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The poor 'gator awoke to the sight of a motorboat roaring toward
him at breakneck speed, a woman's legs flailing in the air over the
gunnels. Fortunately, the memsahib stayed with the boat, and the
'gator was long gone when we replaced him on top of the log.
</P>
<P>
   The map of the swamp wouldn't help my seamanship, but it would
certainly make venturing beyond Billy's Island a lot nicer. In the
meantime, it's great fun just to scroll around the swamp and
imagine that water like a black mirror, with the birds overhead,
the reptiles watching you pass in the heavy silence. We'll do it in
kayaks next time. A motorboat is almost an insult to the place.

 &HT;    Pentium chips fast, but Celeron might be better buy
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When is the best time to buy a computer? It's when you
need one.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the questions I get by phone and e-mail, that's the most
common. And there are dozens of cliched _ and unsatisfying _
answers to the question. My favorite is to wait until the computer
you own won't perform some vital task _ either won't run a program
that you need, or runs it so slowly that it's unsatisfying.
</P>
<P>
   But the real truth with computers is that most people buy a
computer when they get the craving, very much like buying a car.
The old one still runs, still gets you to work, but _ with obvious
exceptions _ most of us do not wait until the wheels fall off the
old car. It's the same with computers.
</P>
<P>
   We are coming into some confusing times when it comes to buying
a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know is that new chips are coming from Intel.
There'll soon be even faster Pentium III chips, and also _ probably
next month _ Intel will bring out a new version of its popular
lower-priced junior brand chip, the Celeron. The Pentium III chips
will be fast _ with the state of the art at 866 megahertz and
increased to 933 megahertz later in the year. And they'll be
relatively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Celeron chips won't be as fast _ with a top speed of 600
megahertz _ and not just because of the clock speed (that's the 600
megahertz part).
</P>
<P>
   I hate to throw numbers around _ someone could get hurt _ but we
need them to tell this story. One of the factors in how fast your
computer runs is a thing called bus speed. That's the speed the
chip is able to use when transferring data. Think of the bus as the
pipeline that connects the chip and the computer. The faster that
pipeline _ the speed also is measured in megahertz _ the better the
computer is at wringing all the speed out of the chip.
</P>
<P>
   Celeron chips use the old bus speed of 66 megahertz. The new
Pentium III chips work at bus speeds of 100 to 133 megahertz. That
means that a 600-megahertz Pentium III chip will run much faster
than a 600-megahertz Celeron chip, maybe 30 percent faster.
</P>
<P>
   All that being true, I'm guessing that you know what the next
shoe to drop is. You are thinking that the Pentium III is the best
buy. And _ if you're in true need of blazing speed, if you spend a
lot of time with graphics, if you are designing a nuclear submarine
in the basement _ that's right. It's also right if money is no
object. Go ahead and pop for the Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're like me and tend to use a home computer to log on
to the Net, play a few games (they are power-hungry, but the
600-megahertz Celeron will run them just fine, especially if you
get a high-end video card to go with it) and to write letters _
then a Celeron is worth looking at.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some people in the industry think that Intel actually
did too good of a job in designing the Celeron (and the new one is
even better because of a new chip technique that is important but
almost impossible to explain in the space I have left). The Celeron
runs so fast and sells for so little that some folks think that
Intel is losing a lot of Pentium III sales to that computer.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of price differential can you expect between the
Celeron and the Pentium III? I'm guessing that the new chips will
be about $300 apart (the spread will vary based on the speed of
each chip, but that's close).
</P>
<P>
   And since the Pentium III tends to go into higher-end machines,
the actual price difference when you consider the end price of the
PC may be higher.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you have PC lust now that it's turning spring, at least
consider looking at the new Celeron chip in March.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Celeron chip PC over one with Pentium III

 &HT;    Battery charger is a do-it-yourself jump
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Few things are more frustrating than a car that
won't start because of a weak battery.
</P>
<P>
   But a Philadelphia company is marketing a device that allows you
to jump-start your car from inside the car. You don't have to flag
down a stranger and wrestle with jumper cables. You don't have to
wait for the auto club to show up. You don't even have to open your
hood.
</P>
<P>
   StartMeUp is an emergency battery charger that weighs only six
ounces and easily fits in a glove compartment where it stays usable
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   If you attempt to start your car and get only the clicking noise
associated with a drained battery, you plug StartMeUp into the
cigarette lighter receptacle. After five minutes of charging, the
car will start, according to Future Labs, the Philadelphia company
that developed StartMeUp.

 &HT;    Home theater moves to spotlight as layouts become more
affordable
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home theater gets more affordable and more popular
each year. While there are still the few who pop $100,000 and up
for a Hollywood-style home theater, complete with leather seats and
screen sizes that rival your neighborhood multiplex, there are
reasonably good systems for $1,500 or less. One of the really hot
trends is flat plasma screen monitors. If you want to check out the
devices many see as the future of home theater, pick up the March
issue of Audio Video Interiors (you can also find it on the Web at
www.audiovideointeriors.com). In the same issue, you'll get the top
10 tech support tips that may help you solve problems without
making a call.
</P>
<P>
   Are you a Web auction junkie? Do you buy and sell on one of the
services such as eBay? If you do, you may spend more time than you
need to log on to the Web site to see how the item you care about
is doing. If you'd like to save some time, check out the March
issue of Popular Mechanics. You'll find an article that tells you
how to check your online accounts and place bids using a cell
phone. If you don't have access to the magazine, you can read the
article at www

   If you have a Macintosh, you probably value it because of the
ease of use and the fact it's designed for people who usually have
more interest in the work that it can do than in learning about the
innards of the machine and its software. But there are times when
things go wrong. That's when it helps to have a program such as
Norton Utilities Version 4.0 for the Macintosh. It's a Mac-friendly
program that helps you rescue damaged files on your hard disk,
speed up disk performance and even permanently delete especially
sensitive files. You can find the program on CD almost anyplace
that software is sold for about $40.
</P>
<P>
   Another Mac program worth checking out for the teenage females
in your family is called Seventeen Style Studio. It only comes in a
Mac version and lets kids and teens check out new hairstyles and
experiment with the way different types of makeup treatments would
look. You simply use your own photograph, then manipulate that
image with the tools that come with the software. This program
comes from MacSoft and sells for about $45.

</P>
<P>
   As the weather becomes more like spring, many people begin to
think of shaping up and exercising. Whether you are interested in
limbering up for golf, speeding up for soccer or just looking
better when it comes time to hit the beach, there's a site designed
to help. It's called GetFit.com and can be found at
www.getfit.com/zones/home/index.jsp. Besides the exercise tips,
there are recipes designed to help in a quest to slim down.
</P>
<P>
   While eBay gets most of the ink, there are some other nifty
auction sites on the Web. One worth checking _ since it comes from
a name that most people trust _ is the auction site on Yahoo.
You'll find it at auctions.yahoo.com/.

 &HT;    People share recollections, large and small
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a few months ago, just as 1999 was becoming
2000, that people were putting things in time capsules and sticking
them in the ground. Folks in Wyandotte, Mich., placed pictures, a
community calendar and seeds from the local garden club. Students
from a high school in Hartford, Conn., created one with a T-shirt,
a cafeteria menu and a letter to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One of the drawbacks with time capsules is they are mostly
filled with artifacts, pieces of pop culture that show future
generations how our time was accessorized. They tend not to tell
too much about how people really think.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.randomaccessmemory .org, tries to do that, to
be a kind of national diary. The site, Random Access Memory: an
Experiment in Collective Recollection, offers people the chance to
publish their memories. Registration is required, but the
information needed is minimal, and it is free. So far, 853 people
have made almost 1,978 entries.
</P>
<P>
   According to the site's main page, Random Access Memory is
designed to be a ``backup archive for your personal memories, for
recollections important or trivial. We encourage you to use this
site spontaneously. If you suddenly remember the sled you played
with as a child, or the sweet, eggy cake your mother fed you dipped
in tea, sign in and record the memory at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The site stores the entries and lets registered users search
them by date, subject or name. People wanting to maintain a low
profile can register under an assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a peek into our national psyche offered by a search for
the word ``television.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollywolly, 1959: ``Watching the black-and-white version of
Scrooge every Christmas Eve. Having to get up to change the
channel!! I shudder to think about it now. Ringing the operator to
make a phone call and then when we did get our dial phone, you had
to wait for the people on our `party line' to hang up!! Bringing a
nickel and two pennies to school every day for ice cream time.
Getting our first color television.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh, 1968: ``I remember my parents watching, for hours, long
funeral services on our black-and-white TV. I realize now that this
was the year of Robert Kennedy's and Martin Luther King's deaths,
but at the time I thought that funerals were regular television
programs and wondered why my parents liked to watch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Quasilove,1982: ``In our kitchen, my father and I watch the
space shuttle launch. We have no television. The story is that he
broke it before I was born. But somehow now it projects and my
father and I watch the space shuttle launch against our kitchen
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   A search on the word ``cookies'' turns up these slices of
American pie:
</P>
<P>
   Enigma, 1990: ``I had a few pounds of roast beef in my pants. As
well as some cookies and a hard-bound book about Jim Morrison. We
were hungry but had no money. So we thought we would just go into
the grocery store and get some food. Or as the grocery store called
it ... steal some food. Of course we got caught since I had so much
(stuff) in my pants and the other guys refused to carry anything in
their pants. I was first out the door and was almost gone when Jeff
said my name in a voice that sounded pathetic. I turn and see some
woman with her nails dug into his forearm and her legs wrapped
around his ankles. I told him to come on ... we should get out of
there. At this point I realize we are not getting out of there so I
give up. Back inside, upstairs we wait for the police. They are all
so serious, so right, so stupid. They have no eyes. Too bad they
have mouths and hands. When the police get there it is even
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   PaulcPaul, 1936: ``My first-grade teacher, Mrs. Sayers, treated
us to cookies and milk every day. I fell in love with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Hvnle, 1969: ``Dogs and cookies. I remember when I was about 4
or 5 years old, I was out in the back yard eating a cookie, and
several dogs were jumping on me trying to get my cookie. I cried
and cried and was scared of dogs for a long time. Someone, I forgot
who, nailed a spool to the screen door, my level, so I could get
into the house by myself.''

 &HT;    Battery charger is a do-it-yourself jump
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Few things are more frustrating than a car that
won't start because of a weak battery.
</P>
<P>
   But a Philadelphia company is marketing a device that allows you
to jump-start your car from inside the car. You don't have to flag
down a stranger and wrestle with jumper cables. You don't have to
wait for the auto club to show up. You don't even have to open your
hood.
</P>
<P>
   StartMeUp is an emergency battery charger that weighs only six
ounces and easily fits in a glove compartment where it stays usable
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   If you attempt to start your car and get only the clicking noise
associated with a drained battery, you plug StartMeUp into the
cigarette lighter receptacle. After five minutes of charging, the
car will start, according to Future Labs, the Philadelphia company
that developed StartMeUp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides motorists with peace of mind knowing they will
never be stranded with a drained battery again,'' said Kyle Burns,
president and CEO of Future Labs. ``You wouldn't think of driving a
car without a spare tire. By the same token, people should have a
device that allows them to jump-start their car from safely inside
the vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   StartMeUp is a one-use product. After a unit starts a car, it is
thrown away. Future Labs says the product is environmentally
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The product will not work if the battery is completely depleted.
If you hear a clicking when the ignition key is turned, that means
there's some life left in the battery, and StartMeUp should work,
Future Labs says. It won't work if the battery is defective or if
the starter is malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   StartMeUp is supposed to work on cars, minivans and light
trucks, both domestic and foreign. It doesn't work on diesel
engines, though a diesel model is being developed.
</P>
<P>
   A Future Labs press release indicated StartMeUp should be
available through automotive and discount stores nationwide for
about $19.95. If you can't find it in stores, you can order it
online at www.startmeup.com or by calling (888) 782-7863 (STARTME).

 &HT;    You won't mind zombies taking revengeBy Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News ServiceFOR THE CONSOLE:
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's gross, it's gratuitously violent and the story's stupid,
but there's something about Sega's Zombie's Revenge ($50,
www.dreamcast.com) that's totally addictive. In the game, you are
one of three characters hacking, shooting or punching your way
through hundreds of zombies. The game is based on the arcade hit
and plays pretty close to the standup model. This makes for
lightning-fast game play _ if you blink or lose concentration, you
die. There is also the cool part of the game where you can pick up
almost anything and use it as a weapon. Zombie's Revenge is a
``must'' for the shooter game addict or anyone else who enjoyed
Sega's ``Dynamite Cop.''
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP:
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Austin's Aspyr Media Inc. has made a
good business of creating Macintosh versions of popular PC games.
Following its success porting games such as the ``Tomb Raider''
series, Aspyr has scored a home run with its port of Sid Meier's
Alpha Centauri ($50 for Mac, www.aspyr. com).
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it last year on the PC, the game is an
involved, addictive, turn-based simulation tracking the future of
seven political and cultural factions starting new civilizations on
an undeveloped planet. Taking control of one of these factions, you
rebuild an alien landscape, engage in domestic relations and
balance your power between battle and scientific or cultural
advancement. To say this game is deep doesn't begin to describe
Alpha Centauri's complexity. It's a must-have for any
empire-building gamer, and now Mac fans have a chance to own it,
too.

 &HT;    Search the world for long-lost friends
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that it seems almost everyone in the world is
online, with an e-mail account and a Web page, one task is easier
than ever _ finding a friend from years ago.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find directories and search engines made for just that
task. With any luck, you can track down that high school
sweetheart, college roommate or the fellow who borrowed that book
and never returned it.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point for your search is Switchboard.com, a
search engine that helps you find an e-mail address, as well as
telephone numbers and even street addresses. So head to
www.switchboard.com/ and select the link called People Search. Once
there, you enter as much information as you have. The only
essential item is a last name. So you could _ foolishly for sure _
search the nation for all the Smiths. You can already see that it
will help if the person you are searching for has a fairly unusual
last name. But if you can narrow the search by supplying the city
and the first name, your search should be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet people-finders work the same way. But there's a
good reason to bookmark every search engine of this type you can
find. Since there isn't a master list of all Internet users, each
search engine will have a different group of names and addresses.
</P>
<P>
   So go next to Bigfoot.com, another longtime people-finder
located at www.bigfoot.com/. One really handy search feature here _
besides the one described above _ is the ability to find out a
person's name and address by entering an e-mail address. This
feature only works with those who have created a profile on
Bigfoot, so don't be disappointed if your search doesn't return any
information.
</P>
<P>
   One must in your list of people-finders is PeopleSearch.com. It
truly is different from the other sites. For one thing, this site
at www.peoplesearch.com/ uses multiple search engines to find a
person. That search is free; simply look for the link labeled Free
People Search. For another, just in case you have tried all the
other search techniques and still can't find the person, there's
even more help available. You'll pay for that help, starting at
$39, but there are times _ when a person has changed his or her
name because of marriage or just because the world is crawling with
people with that same name _ that you may need the help.
</P>
<P>
   Web pages are an excellent way to locate a person. And even if
your friend doesn't have a Web page of his own, there's a good
chance that another Web page may mention them. Businesses, schools
and social organizations often maintain directories that, at the
least, contain e-mail addresses and names of members. So use a
search engine _ AltaVista (www.altavista.com) is my choice for
searches like this because it does a good job of searching the body
of the page _ and simply enter your friend's name. Let's suppose
the name is Martha Smith. Enter it this way in AltaVista: ``Martha
Smith'' (include the quote marks). That is how you tell the search
engine to return only pages that contain those two names in that
exact order. If you don't do that you'll find every Martha, every
Smith, a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, check the newsgroups. This is a subset of the Net where
people post messages according to topic areas. To find out if your
friend has left a message there (it will contain an e-mail address)
use this page _ which contains a variety of newsgroup search
engines _ at www.lycos.com/computers/internet/newsgroups.html.

 &HT;    Resources aid in LAN-making Home network within reach
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Here's background on why we're taking up this space. We're
problem solvers. We investigate, figure things out, learn _
sometimes the hard way _ teach and bring new technology to the
newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: We don't know it all, but we can point you to a sea of
information and help navigate. We'll teach you to fish by tapping
the Internet, reference books, your instincts and common sense to
get the most out of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You've asked lots of questions about networking two, maybe
three, home computers and sharing files and a printer. The
technology's there. Why not make sharing easier than playing pass
the floppy or Zip? Turn Dad's printer into the ``family'' printer?
Share an Internet connection? That's why we're devoting this column
to the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You'll be creating your own LAN, or Local Area Network.
Impressive. If you've never heard of a LAN or need to know basic
network-speak, cruise to the Miramar Systems Inc. Networking 101
link (www.miramarsys.com
</P>
<P>
   /home/net101.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You must decide the size of your network and how much you
can spend. Some options include Ethernet, phone wire and wireless
networking. There's even a nifty power outlet deal. A quick
tutorial on Ethernet: It's a tried-and-true method of data
communication that requires a chunky cable, fatter than a phone
wire, connected from each computer Network Interface Card into a
hub (where you park devices on a LAN so they can chat). You'll have
to jump through some internal network hoops to share an Internet
connection. A place to start is the NETGEAR site (netgear
</P>
<P>
   .baynetworks.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: There's the obvious, which is using your phone line. To
find out about AnyPoint from Intel, surf to www.intel.com/anypoint.
A slick wireless option is the Airport for the Macintosh
(www.apple.com/airport/). We love Macs. Wireless is where we're all
headed. No more tangles.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Breathe, Jacki. Bear in mind that wireless is costlier. A
reliable and fast wireless PC solution would be Proxim (www.proxim
.com/). Or, hey, you may like the idea of plugging into a power
outlet to create a network. No NIC installs or hubs. For
quick-and-easy, go to Intelogis (www .intelogis.com). You can share
a printer, files and an Internet connection within minutes, all at
around $200.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: For a good list of home network kits, try ZDNet
(www.zdnet.com/products/stories/reviews/0,4161,2226069,00.html).
Kits have it all. Hardware and software, for as little as $90. And,
yep, you can shell out more, too. Prices vary depending on how
cutting-edge the network option, the ``plug-and-playishness'' of
the kit, who installs NICs, the type of cabling and the hub size.
The possibilities are all over the map.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our family has decided to collect the commemorative state
quarters. I thought I heard there will be five a year released over
the next 10 years, with five released in January1999 and another
five in January 2000. What is the schedule and which states are
presently in circulation? _ Angela Ozymy
</P>
<P>
   A: The coins, produced at the Philadelphia and Denver mints,
will be issued over a 10 year period (1999-2008), five per year.
(None will be issued for the District of Columbia.) The coins are
issued in the same order that the states joined the union.
Presently in circulation are quarters commemorating Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut and Massachusetts.
Look for Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Virginia to be
issued this year (at about 10-week intervals). Expect the Lone Star
state quarter in 2004. For details, contact the U.S. Mint customer
care center at (202) 283-2646.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you use the poppy seeds from a poppy flower in baking?
They look like the kind you buy at the store. _ Linda G.
</P>
<P>
   A: All poppies are not created equal. According to the Central
Texas Poison Center at (800) POISON1, using poppy seeds from a
poppy flower for baking is dangerous because there are different
types of genus Papaver plants available in the store.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does baseball commissioner Bud Selig have an e-mail address
where we can send him our opinions on rulings? I am sick and tired
of the repeaters like Darryl Strawberry getting only a one-year
suspension while Pete Rose is suspended for life. I would like to
give Selig my thoughts on the subject whether or not he wants to
hear them. _ Bob Olson
</P>
<P>
   A: None that I could find. Send your missive of opinions to
Allan H. Selig, Office of the Commissioner of Baseball, 245 Park
Ave., New York, N.Y. 10167. It is harder to toss a letter than to
hit the delete button. Q: I don't know if you can help with this or
not, but my 15-year-old daughter put tattoos on. Do you know of a
doctor who can take them off? Is there a way to bleach them off? We
are up in the air about this. _ J.L.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Bleach won't cut it. A laser procedure will. The process also
works on those pesky brown age spots. Some colors are more
difficult to lighten (e.g. greens and oranges). Some of the tattoo
is vaporized; some pulverized, and pigment particles are swallowed
by blood cells. Dermabrasion also works on some stubborn tattoos.
Other, possibilities? Photoderm, which requires local anesthesia
and might leave scarring, or infrared coagulator treatment, which
also requires a local anesthetic and takes longer to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give me information on the chapel in which JFK Jr.
was married? Also, are there similar ones in the Hill Country? _
Jenny P.
</P>
<P>
   A: The chapel is on Cumberland Island, Ga., a national seashore.
Built in the 1930s, the small Baptist church was a town gathering
center for an African-American community (this section of the
island was one of the first places blacks were allowed to own
property). The church only holds about 20 people, has no
electricity and, for most, requires an 11-mile walk (closer access
to the settlement is under study). Guests of the island's Greyfield
Inn, where the Kennedy reception was held, (904) 261-6408, have
vehicular access to the island's roads, alleviating the walk. To
apply for a special permit, call the The National Park Service at
(912) 882-4335.
</P>
<P>
   The Hill Country is soooo much closer. Sharon Buford, (830)
997-2835, of the Gillespie County Historical Society suggests an
1855 Methodist Church Sanctuary for weddings and receptions. To
view it, visit www.ktc.net/gchs. The native limestone church sports
lovely stained glass and electricity. Maximum capacity is 220.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need a special hammer, a straight peen, to play
``nagelschlagen.'' I've exhausted the knowledge at Home Depot,
confounded Sears, frustrated The Hardware Store and surprised the
guys at Breed &AMP; Co. It's nothing more than a cross peen hammer with
the cross ``straight'' (parallel to the handle). _ Wayne Sanders
</P>
<P>
   A: Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, you should have come to me sooner. A
straight peen hammer is a blacksmith's tool. Order one from Koka
Metalsmiths by calling (507) 643-7946 or e-mail
kokairon(at)clear.lakes.com. Prices begin at $39. Koka also sells
silversmith hammers and Japanese-style hammers. Don't see many of
either in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, readers, the peen is the wedge- or ball-shaped end
of a hammerhead. ``Nagelschlagen'' is a German game played in
barrooms and at Oktoberfest and fairs involving a large tree stump
and nails.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any way a private citizen can refuse to be counted
in the upcoming census? _ P.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: You could be fined, says spokeswoman Leslie Lawson. Census is
required by law. The census works with individuals to get everyone
counted through follow-ups and interviews with neighbors, and
participation has no negative repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the census cannot share your information with anyone,
including other federal agencies. The cost of not participating?
Loss of federal grant money for education, health care, parks,
roads, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that a man died in Hawaii after being in a food
storage warehouse full of dried mouse and rat droppings. He died of
massive organ failure after inhaling this rodent dust. Is there a
virus like the hantavirus that lives in these droppings? Should we
all rinse off can tops and wipe off cardboard food packaging just
in case? Everything you buy has been in one of these warehouses. _
D.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Pure rumor, says Norman Sato of the Hawaii Health Department.
``We have had no reports of that kind of death.'' The folks at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention add that the hantavirus
has many types, one of which results in death by massive organ
failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Sin Nombre virus is the primary hantavirus in the United
States, and is carried by the deer mouse. The CDC recommends basic
precautions to prevent exposure: Eliminate rodent harbors, control
the rodent population (traps, etc.), clean up rodent-infested areas
and avoid rodents when outdoors. Of course, when cleaning rodent
droppings, do not stir up or breathe the dust. Good kitchen hygiene
includes wiping can lids and frequent hand washing.

 &HT;    The future's bright for Future Man
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Now seems the ideal time to be a futurist.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium came with nary a bug. Technology stocks buoy the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   So why does the human being known as FM-2030 (Future Man) sound
frustrated today, even as the clear sun reflects into his
stark-white Biscayne Bay condominium?
</P>
<P>
   ``My body is at the repair shop, so unfortunately I had to
borrow this body, just so I could interact with you,'' says FM, the
name he uses in casual conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   Relax. It's future humor.
</P>
<P>
   To FM, his body is a 4 million-year-old anachronism, a primate's
body meant for swinging on trees, an inefficient and altogether too
fragile thing attached to a small, modern organ called the brain
which can ``look out billions of light years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I am, ready to gallop across the solar system,'' he says,
though his sick pancreas, ``a stupid, dumb, wretched organ,''
barely allows him to walk across the room.
</P>
<P>
   FM-2030 will not stay frustrated long. He's too busy
anticipating the day when scientists thaw his frozen body later
this century and transform him into a ``post-biological'' organism.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas like this _ the same ones he's been transmitting in
classes at Florida International University and his books _ still
excite him, after nearly four decades of provocative predictions.
</P>
<P>
   He teaches a class on the future, a subject he is so obsessed
with that he has taken on the persona of a futureman, a person
living decades from now. He speaks like a futureman, acts like a
futureman, thinks like a futureman and keeps it going 24 hours a
day. Every day.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for some interesting dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday, this gentle man who rolls his R's when he
calls people ``dear,'' pounds on the lectern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are turning reality upside down, and we are saying that
death need not be final,'' he tells his class.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a loose black jacket with rolled sleeves over a black
shirt, he's about to show a short film on cryogenics to 28, largely
well-educated, adult students. Cryogenics, freezing the body until
science finds a way to cure what ails it, is but one subject FM
addressed in five weekly three-hour sessions at Miami Beach's
Wolfsonian Museum that ended last week. The inevitable end of
marriage, family, capitalism, socialism, poverty, religion and
automobile travel all took time to explain to a group of students
still very much living in the present.
</P>
<P>
   THE FUTURE REQUIRES IMAGINATION
</P>
<P>
   Describing the future, a space FM inhabits and romances,
requires imagination, he says. One has to stretch his mind, for
example, to comprehend the ``Santa Claus Machine,'' which FM says
will work like the copy machine, only it will reproduce the
molecular structure of three-dimensional objects. This, combined
with free energy from the sun, will provide limitless resources and
eliminate competition.
</P>
<P>
   Without competition, capitalism and socialism, we will die of
irrelevance. This is, of course, the short version. But it's a good
example of his thought process: technology, already in its
formative stages, will radically change human nature once it
becomes a commonplace part of the culture.
</P>
<P>
   And because the rate of change will continue to increase,
current logic will not apply to future realities.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to put it in even simpler terms, the whole world will
change.
</P>
<P>
   FM's students say they're initially stunned by their prof's
ideas. But as the class goes on and they begin to analyze his
logic, they begin to appreciate the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right on in many ways,'' said Nancy Lipoff, 61, who took
the class with her husband and several friends. ``On the other
hand, for people who believe in religion and believe in tradition
and believe in preserving things for our children and
grandchildren, he doesn't fit into that mold at all.''
</P>
<P>
   No, molds do not interest FM. Though he lived in 12 or 13
countries by the time he was 17, he says has no nationality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I belong to the whole planet, and I embrace the whole
planet.''
</P>
<P>
   His ancestral origins? ``For that, you'll have to talk to my
ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   Official records _ which list him as FM, Twenty Thirty _
indicate he's 69 years old, but he won't confirm.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto, his former employment at the United Nations, mentioned in
the forward of a book he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   What about the rumors that his family of international diplomats
includes former heads of state? ``I have no family,'' says FM,
explaining that networks of close friends, companions and lovers
replace traditional modes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Without the need to produce babies inside the body, children
will have multiple mothers and fathers from multiple gene pools, he
once wrote. Children from these ``mosaic births'' will be raised by
groups which might or might not be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S IN A NAME?
</P>
<P>
   He knows you won't necessarily agree with him. Then again, no
one would have believed him 100 years ago if he insisted he didn't
belong to a tribe, he says. So please, ``allow me to define myself
the way I see myself.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he began doing in the mid-1960s, when his name was
FM Esfandiary and he began teaching about the future at the New
School for Social Research in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Names convey ancestry, ethnicity, the past, nationality and
religion, he says, reading from his 1989 book ``Are You
Transhuman?''
</P>
<P>
   FM wanted to evoke the future with his name. And like the world,
it will evolve. ``I will change (the name) again right before
2030,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the future is essential or one risks riding on
Interstate 95 in a horse and carriage, to use one of his favorite
analogies.
</P>
<P>
   During class, one student who is particularly skeptical of FM's
vision insists his own name is FM-2020 ``because I'm 10 years
behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   FM laughs. ``I switch on the future in total context, and that's
too much future for most people,'' he says later.
</P>
<P>
   BETTING ON A BRIGHT FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   Still, FM is confident, even if his timing is premature. If he's
wrong, it's a shame for humanity, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But FM is betting his money on a bright future. He's arranged to
pay $100,000 to the Alcor Life Extension Foundation of Scottsdale,
Ariz., to preserve his body in liquid nitrogen when his body no
longer works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why risk being in the last generation to die before anti-aging
solves the life span problem?'' reads the company's pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that occurs 30, 50 or 100 years after his death, FM
plans to relish his golden years for centuries, if not millennia _
even if he has no money when he wakes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like me don't give a damn. I'll be so glad that I'm
back.''

 &HT;    Help with your taxes
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Internal Revenue Service: The friendly IRS Web site opens with
the newsy Digital Daily. When we checked in, it was reminding
America that ``more than 1.6 million taxpayers who failed to file
tax returns for 1996 risk losing about $2 billion in refunds if
they don't get their late returns to the IRS'' this year. We
thought that sort of procrastination was illegal or something. The
site offers forms that can be filled in on-screen and then printed
for mailing. www.irs.ustreas.gov/
</P>
<P>
   Waste Basket: Just for fun, look here to read about what the
government does with our hard-earned money. The site is by a
watchdog group called Taxpayers for Common Sense, which monitors
proposals for federal land giveaways, boondoggles, corporate
handouts and budget gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   www.taxpayer.net/TCS/wastebasket/wbindex.html
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;R Block: When we looked, H&AMP;R Block, the granddaddy of tax
help, told us it was having ``difficulty handling everyone trying
to use our online tax program'' and was not accepting new users for
the $9.95 service. As it turned out, the site was also dealing with
a glitch that let some visitors view other people's financial data.
Yikes! The company promised to be back up soon, though, and as an
alternative was offering its downloadable software free, along with
a coupon for $10 off at an H&AMP;R Block office.
</P>
<P>
   www.hrblock.com/taxcenter/doingmytaxes/onlinetax.html
</P>
<P>
   HD Vest Online: It's free to fill out your 1040 on this site and
zap it to the IRS. The catch? Goodbye, privacy. After you're done,
the service uses your financial information to target you with
advertising and offers. And ``if you choose to withhold the
requested information, you will not be eligible to take advantage
of certain hdvest.com services such as the free tax-calculation
program or other services.'' So there. www.hdvestonline.com/
</P>
<P>
   TurboTax: Intuit-owned TurboTax for the Web offers online
preparation of the shorter 1040EZ form for free and other forms for
$9.95 each. There's an exception, though. Returns with adjusted
gross incomes under $20,000 will also be done free, Intuit says. As
is true with most such sites, you need not do all the work in one
sitting. The site remembers who you are and lets you pick up the
process where you left off.
www.turbotax.com/turbotaxweb99/welcome.html?SRC &QC; sectaxcust
</P>
<P>
   123: This site confused us by proclaiming ``Online Tax Prep for
Free'' on the opening screen, then introducing the fees: $5 for
printing returns, $9.95 for an e-filing. Where does the ``free''
part come in? Oh, that's for free access to the site, ``including
FREE return calculation.'' We are still scratching our head.

have to find out how vulnerable you are. Shields Up, a free

 &HT;    Home theater moves to spotlight as layouts become more
affordable
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home theater gets more affordable and more popular
each year. While there are still the few who pop $100,000 and up
for a Hollywood-style home theater, complete with leather seats and
screen sizes that rival your neighborhood multiplex, there are
reasonably good systems for $1,500 or less. One of the really hot
trends is flat plasma screen monitors. If you want to check out the
devices many see as the future of home theater, pick up the March
issue of Audio Video Interiors (you can also find it on the Web at
www.audiovideointeriors.com). In the same issue, you'll get the top
10 tech support tips that may help you solve problems without
making a call.

   Are you a Web auction junkie? Do you buy and sell on one of the
services such as eBay? If you do, you may spend more time than you
need to log on to the Web site to see how the item you care about
is doing. If you'd like to save some time, check out the March
issue of Popular Mechanics. You'll find an article that tells you
how to check your online accounts and place bids using a cell
phone. If you don't have access to the magazine, you can read the
article at www

   If you have a Macintosh, you probably value it because of the
ease of use and the fact it's designed for people who usually have
more interest in the work that it can do than in learning about the
innards of the machine and its software. But there are times when
things go wrong. That's when it helps to have a program such as
Norton Utilities Version 4.0 for the Macintosh. It's a Mac-friendly
program that helps you rescue damaged files on your hard disk,
speed up disk performance and even permanently delete especially
sensitive files. You can find the program on CD almost anyplace
that software is sold for about $40.
</P>
<P>
   Another Mac program worth checking out for the teenage females
in your family is called Seventeen Style Studio. It only comes in a
Mac version and lets kids and teens check out new hairstyles and
experiment with the way different types of makeup treatments would
look. You simply use your own photograph, then manipulate that
image with the tools that come with the software. This program
comes from MacSoft and sells for about $45.

   As the weather becomes more like spring, many people begin to
think of shaping up and exercising. Whether you are interested in
limbering up for golf, speeding up for soccer or just looking
better when it comes time to hit the beach, there's a site designed
to help. It's called GetFit.com and can be found at
www.getfit.com/zones/home/index.jsp. Besides the exercise tips,
there are recipes designed to help in a quest to slim down.
</P>
<P>
   While eBay gets most of the ink, there are some other nifty
auction sites on the Web. One worth checking _ since it comes from
a name that most people trust _ is the auction site on Yahoo.
You'll find it at auctions.yahoo.com/.

 &HT;    People share recollections, large and small
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a few months ago, just as 1999 was becoming
2000, that people were putting things in time capsules and sticking
them in the ground. Folks in Wyandotte, Mich., placed pictures, a
community calendar and seeds from the local garden club. Students
from a high school in Hartford, Conn., created one with a T-shirt,
a cafeteria menu and a letter to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One of the drawbacks with time capsules is they are mostly
filled with artifacts, pieces of pop culture that show future
generations how our time was accessorized. They tend not to tell
too much about how people really think.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.randomaccessmemory .org, tries to do that, to
be a kind of national diary. The site, Random Access Memory: an
Experiment in Collective Recollection, offers people the chance to
publish their memories. Registration is required, but the
information needed is minimal, and it is free. So far, 853 people
have made almost 1,978 entries.
</P>
<P>
   According to the site's main page, Random Access Memory is
designed to be a ``backup archive for your personal memories, for
recollections important or trivial. We encourage you to use this
site spontaneously. If you suddenly remember the sled you played
with as a child, or the sweet, eggy cake your mother fed you dipped
in tea, sign in and record the memory at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The site stores the entries and lets registered users search
them by date, subject or name. People wanting to maintain a low
profile can register under an assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a peek into our national psyche offered by a search for
the word ``television.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollywolly, 1959: ``Watching the black-and-white version of
Scrooge every Christmas Eve. Having to get up to change the
channel!! I shudder to think about it now. Ringing the operator to
make a phone call and then when we did get our dial phone, you had
to wait for the people on our `party line' to hang up!! Bringing a
nickel and two pennies to school every day for ice cream time.
Getting our first color television.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh, 1968: ``I remember my parents watching, for hours, long
funeral services on our black-and-white TV. I realize now that this
was the year of Robert Kennedy's and Martin Luther King's deaths,
but at the time I thought that funerals were regular television
programs and wondered why my parents liked to watch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Quasilove,1982: ``In our kitchen, my father and I watch the
space shuttle launch. We have no television. The story is that he
broke it before I was born. But somehow now it projects and my
father and I watch the space shuttle launch against our kitchen
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   A search on the word ``cookies'' turns up these slices of
American pie:
</P>
<P>
   Enigma, 1990: ``I had a few pounds of roast beef in my pants. As
well as some cookies and a hard-bound book about Jim Morrison. We
were hungry but had no money. So we thought we would just go into
the grocery store and get some food. Or as the grocery store called
it ... steal some food. Of course we got caught since I had so much
(stuff) in my pants and the other guys refused to carry anything in
their pants. I was first out the door and was almost gone when Jeff
said my name in a voice that sounded pathetic. I turn and see some
woman with her nails dug into his forearm and her legs wrapped
around his ankles. I told him to come on ... we should get out of
there. At this point I realize we are not getting out of there so I
give up. Back inside, upstairs we wait for the police. They are all
so serious, so right, so stupid. They have no eyes. Too bad they
have mouths and hands. When the police get there it is even
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   PaulcPaul, 1936: ``My first-grade teacher, Mrs. Sayers, treated
us to cookies and milk every day. I fell in love with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Hvnle, 1969: ``Dogs and cookies. I remember when I was about 4
or 5 years old, I was out in the back yard eating a cookie, and
several dogs were jumping on me trying to get my cookie. I cried
and cried and was scared of dogs for a long time. Someone, I forgot
who, nailed a spool to the screen door, my level, so I could get
into the house by myself.''

 &HT;    National park digital guides cover nuances from every angle
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It would be hard to find two more utterly different
places than Yellowstone National Park and the Okefenokee Swamp: one
majestic, the other dark and brooding.
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, the most magical places I have ever seen, and
I haven't seen nearly enough of them.
</P>
<P>
   Maptech, whose reproductions of Geological Survey maps of North
Georgia we discussed some time ago, has produced a series of
National Park Digital Guides for all 54 national parks. I've been
tracing on one of them the places we saw at Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   I'm parked now overlooking the Hayden Valley, not far from the
Lake Hotel, in the hour before dawn. Our son, an outdoor
photographer, was working in the park, and he brought us to that
spot at just that time. I cannot remember the last time I saw land
illuminated by starlight; it may have been 50 years ago, when
coyotes yapped and sang around our house just as they do now in the
valley.
</P>
<P>
   The park maps have all the advantages of Maptech's standard
topographical maps _ you can measure distances as the crow flies or
along a path, and when you have laid out your distance line you can
switch to a profile view that shows how much uphill and downhill
you'll have to contend with. You can zoom in and out, mark up a map
with a trail you want to hike and print it out.
</P>
<P>
   The maps also have a lot of text; there are guides to services
in the park you're looking at, plus discussions of the flora and
fauna, history, climate and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   The Okefenokee is included on the CD-ROM in Maptech's terrain
Navigator series that also covers the Georgia coastal area. All the
same goodies are here, even the profile views, although there isn't
much profile to the Okefenokee.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to find Billy's Island, the turnaround point in our
epic motorboat adventure. The problem with outboard motors like
those they rent in the swamp is that they steer exactly opposite
the way one steers a car. It takes a while to remember which way to
twist the throttle to run it up or shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect there's an alligator that hangs out not far from
Billy's Island who still has nightmares about our encounter; I can
only hope we didn't stunt his growth. He was only about 3 feet long
when we met; he was minding his own business, sunning himself on a
partially submerged log.
</P>
<P>
   A close-up photo was in order. With the captain at the helm and
his lady in the bow, the idea was to run up the motor briefly, then
shut it off entirely and glide soundlessly as close to the 'gator
as we could. I maneuvered the boat around to line up with the log,
the memsahib positioned herself up front, and I put the motor in
gear. Unfortunately, instead of shutting it down, I twisted the
wrong way and put the pedal to the water, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The poor 'gator awoke to the sight of a motorboat roaring toward
him at breakneck speed, a woman's legs flailing in the air over the
gunnels. Fortunately, the memsahib stayed with the boat, and the
'gator was long gone when we replaced him on top of the log.
</P>
<P>
   The map of the swamp wouldn't help my seamanship, but it would
certainly make venturing beyond Billy's Island a lot nicer. In the
meantime, it's great fun just to scroll around the swamp and
imagine that water like a black mirror, with the birds overhead,
the reptiles watching you pass in the heavy silence. We'll do it in
kayaks next time. A motorboat is almost an insult to the place.

 &HT;    Pentium chips fast, but Celeron might be better buy
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When is the best time to buy a computer? It's when you
need one.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the questions I get by phone and e-mail, that's the most
common. And there are dozens of cliched _ and unsatisfying _
answers to the question. My favorite is to wait until the computer
you own won't perform some vital task _ either won't run a program
that you need, or runs it so slowly that it's unsatisfying.
</P>
<P>
   But the real truth with computers is that most people buy a
computer when they get the craving, very much like buying a car.
The old one still runs, still gets you to work, but _ with obvious
exceptions _ most of us do not wait until the wheels fall off the
old car. It's the same with computers.
</P>
<P>
   We are coming into some confusing times when it comes to buying
a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know is that new chips are coming from Intel.
There'll soon be even faster Pentium III chips, and also _ probably
next month _ Intel will bring out a new version of its popular
lower-priced junior brand chip, the Celeron. The Pentium III chips
will be fast _ with the state of the art at 866 megahertz and
increased to 933 megahertz later in the year. And they'll be
relatively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Celeron chips won't be as fast _ with a top speed of 600
megahertz _ and not just because of the clock speed (that's the 600
megahertz part).
</P>
<P>
   I hate to throw numbers around _ someone could get hurt _ but we
need them to tell this story. One of the factors in how fast your
computer runs is a thing called bus speed. That's the speed the
chip is able to use when transferring data. Think of the bus as the
pipeline that connects the chip and the computer. The faster that
pipeline _ the speed also is measured in megahertz _ the better the
computer is at wringing all the speed out of the chip.
</P>
<P>
   Celeron chips use the old bus speed of 66 megahertz. The new
Pentium III chips work at bus speeds of 100 to 133 megahertz. That
means that a 600-megahertz Pentium III chip will run much faster
than a 600-megahertz Celeron chip, maybe 30 percent faster.
</P>
<P>
   All that being true, I'm guessing that you know what the next
shoe to drop is. You are thinking that the Pentium III is the best
buy. And _ if you're in true need of blazing speed, if you spend a
lot of time with graphics, if you are designing a nuclear submarine
in the basement _ that's right. It's also right if money is no
object. Go ahead and pop for the Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're like me and tend to use a home computer to log on
to the Net, play a few games (they are power-hungry, but the
600-megahertz Celeron will run them just fine, especially if you
get a high-end video card to go with it) and to write letters _
then a Celeron is worth looking at.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some people in the industry think that Intel actually
did too good of a job in designing the Celeron (and the new one is
even better because of a new chip technique that is important but
almost impossible to explain in the space I have left). The Celeron
runs so fast and sells for so little that some folks think that
Intel is losing a lot of Pentium III sales to that computer.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of price differential can you expect between the
Celeron and the Pentium III? I'm guessing that the new chips will
be about $300 apart (the spread will vary based on the speed of
each chip, but that's close).
</P>
<P>
   And since the Pentium III tends to go into higher-end machines,
the actual price difference when you consider the end price of the
PC may be higher.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you have PC lust now that it's turning spring, at least
consider looking at the new Celeron chip in March.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Celeron chip PC over one with Pentium III

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our family has decided to collect the commemorative state
quarters. I thought I heard there will be five a year released over
the next 10 years, with five released in January1999 and another
five in January 2000. What is the schedule and which states are
presently in circulation? _ Angela Ozymy
</P>
<P>
   A: The coins, produced at the Philadelphia and Denver mints,
will be issued over a 10 year period (1999-2008), five per year.
(None will be issued for the District of Columbia.) The coins are
issued in the same order that the states joined the union.
Presently in circulation are quarters commemorating Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut and Massachusetts.
Look for Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire and Virginia to be
issued this year (at about 10-week intervals). Expect the Lone Star
state quarter in 2004. For details, contact the U.S. Mint customer
care center at (202) 283-2646.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you use the poppy seeds from a poppy flower in baking?
They look like the kind you buy at the store. _ Linda G.
</P>
<P>
   A: All poppies are not created equal. According to the Central
Texas Poison Center at (800) POISON1, using poppy seeds from a
poppy flower for baking is dangerous because there are different
types of genus Papaver plants available in the store.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does baseball commissioner Bud Selig have an e-mail address
where we can send him our opinions on rulings? I am sick and tired
of the repeaters like Darryl Strawberry getting only a one-year
suspension while Pete Rose is suspended for life. I would like to
give Selig my thoughts on the subject whether or not he wants to
hear them. _ Bob Olson
</P>
<P>
   A: None that I could find. Send your missive of opinions to
Allan H. Selig, Office of the Commissioner of Baseball, 245 Park
Ave., New York, N.Y. 10167. It is harder to toss a letter than to
hit the delete button. Q: I don't know if you can help with this or
not, but my 15-year-old daughter put tattoos on. Do you know of a
doctor who can take them off? Is there a way to bleach them off? We
are up in the air about this. _ J.L.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Bleach won't cut it. A laser procedure will. The process also
works on those pesky brown age spots. Some colors are more
difficult to lighten (e.g. greens and oranges). Some of the tattoo
is vaporized; some pulverized, and pigment particles are swallowed
by blood cells. Dermabrasion also works on some stubborn tattoos.
Other, possibilities? Photoderm, which requires local anesthesia
and might leave scarring, or infrared coagulator treatment, which
also requires a local anesthetic and takes longer to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give me information on the chapel in which JFK Jr.
was married? Also, are there similar ones in the Hill Country? _
Jenny P.
</P>
<P>
   A: The chapel is on Cumberland Island, Ga., a national seashore.
Built in the 1930s, the small Baptist church was a town gathering
center for an African-American community (this section of the
island was one of the first places blacks were allowed to own
property). The church only holds about 20 people, has no
electricity and, for most, requires an 11-mile walk (closer access
to the settlement is under study). Guests of the island's Greyfield
Inn, where the Kennedy reception was held, (904) 261-6408, have
vehicular access to the island's roads, alleviating the walk. To
apply for a special permit, call the The National Park Service at
(912) 882-4335.
</P>
<P>
   The Hill Country is soooo much closer. Sharon Buford, (830)
997-2835, of the Gillespie County Historical Society suggests an
1855 Methodist Church Sanctuary for weddings and receptions. To
view it, visit www.ktc.net/gchs. The native limestone church sports
lovely stained glass and electricity. Maximum capacity is 220.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need a special hammer, a straight peen, to play
``nagelschlagen.'' I've exhausted the knowledge at Home Depot,
confounded Sears, frustrated The Hardware Store and surprised the
guys at Breed &AMP; Co. It's nothing more than a cross peen hammer with
the cross ``straight'' (parallel to the handle). _ Wayne Sanders
</P>
<P>
   A: Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, you should have come to me sooner. A
straight peen hammer is a blacksmith's tool. Order one from Koka
Metalsmiths by calling (507) 643-7946 or e-mail
kokairon(at)clear.lakes.com. Prices begin at $39. Koka also sells
silversmith hammers and Japanese-style hammers. Don't see many of
either in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, readers, the peen is the wedge- or ball-shaped end
of a hammerhead. ``Nagelschlagen'' is a German game played in
barrooms and at Oktoberfest and fairs involving a large tree stump
and nails.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any way a private citizen can refuse to be counted
in the upcoming census? _ P.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: You could be fined, says spokeswoman Leslie Lawson. Census is
required by law. The census works with individuals to get everyone
counted through follow-ups and interviews with neighbors, and
participation has no negative repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the census cannot share your information with anyone,
including other federal agencies. The cost of not participating?
Loss of federal grant money for education, health care, parks,
roads, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that a man died in Hawaii after being in a food
storage warehouse full of dried mouse and rat droppings. He died of
massive organ failure after inhaling this rodent dust. Is there a
virus like the hantavirus that lives in these droppings? Should we
all rinse off can tops and wipe off cardboard food packaging just
in case? Everything you buy has been in one of these warehouses. _
D.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Pure rumor, says Norman Sato of the Hawaii Health Department.
``We have had no reports of that kind of death.'' The folks at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention add that the hantavirus
has many types, one of which results in death by massive organ
failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Sin Nombre virus is the primary hantavirus in the United
States, and is carried by the deer mouse. The CDC recommends basic
precautions to prevent exposure: Eliminate rodent harbors, control
the rodent population (traps, etc.), clean up rodent-infested areas
and avoid rodents when outdoors. Of course, when cleaning rodent
droppings, do not stir up or breathe the dust. Good kitchen hygiene
includes wiping can lids and frequent hand washing.

enthusiasm for the Florida Legislature. But I look on the first

   MISSROSE _ When Robert Horne died of lung cancer nearly two
years ago, he bereaved two women. He was faithful to both to the
very end of his life. One woman was his wife, Missy Horne, who
treasures his memory still. She's in her 60s. ``I don't lie about
my age, but I don't advertise it either,'' she said. The other is
Rose Sachs, 87, one of Palm Beach's best-known socialites, whose
40-year relationship with ``my Robert'' bears an uncanny
resemblance to the 1989 movie Driving Miss Daisy, in which a black
man and a wealthy white woman gradually come to discover a shared
humanity. ``It's true,'' said Missy Horne. ``Whenever they pulled
up in the Rolls-Royce at the Palm Beach Airport, all the porters
would shout, ``Here comes Robert! Driving Miss Daisy!''' ``That's
right,'' giggled Rose Sachs. ``They called me 'Miss Daisy.' I would
ride up in the front seat with Robert, because we had so much to
talk about. There were people who thought that was improper, but I
didn't care. I loved Robert.'' (Browning, Palm Beach Post). 57.

   FUTUREMAN _ Now seems the ideal time to be a futurist. The
millennium came with nary a bug. Technology stocks buoy the
economy. So why does the human being known as FM-2030 (Future Man)
sound frustrated today, even as the clear sun reflects into his
stark-white Biscayne Bay condominium? (Bierman, Palm Beach Post).

   HOSPITALS-INFECTIONS _ ATLANTA _ Melanie Dodd's patient needed a
dressing changed. It sounded like an uncomplicated task, but it
included more steps than a space shuttle launch: Wash and dry
hands. Pull on latex gloves. Loosen the edges of the dressing.
Change the gloves. Put on mask. Change dressing... At a time when
hospitals are seeing a growing number of drug-resistant illnesses
and ``secondary infections'' - where patients contract diseases
AFTER they enter a hospital - it's been said that hospitals today
are a terrible place for sick people to be. With CDC holding a
major conference in Atlanta this week on preventing hospital
infections, we detail how consumers can protect themselves from
hospital-borne diseases and profile nurses and docs in the
frontlines of the defense. (McKenna. Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   CARDIOLOGIST _ ATLANTA _ Dr. Elisabeth Ofili, chief cardiologist
at Morehouse School of Medicine, is the first woman to be elected
president of the Association of Black Cardiologists, an
organization formed 25 years ago. She plans to lead the
organization's goal of starting an international resource center in
Atlanta on cardiovascular disease among blacks worldwide. Ofili,
44, was born in Nigeria, where she attended medical school before
moving to the United States and completing her medical residency.

   HEALTH-DISPARITY-BLACKS _ A lack of health insurance and low
income-status are reasons often given for the disparity between
blacks and whites when it comes to health care access and disease
death rates. But even when economics and insurance are equal,
treatment is often still unequal, concludes a Morehouse School of
Medicine report released last week. (Guthrie, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 15.

   HEALTH-INTERNET _ A newly launched website hopes to make spring
and fall a little easier for allergy sufferers. Using your zip
code, Pollen.com majm generates a free local forecast of probable
pollen counts for the next four days. (McKenna. Atlanta

   ANEURYSM-STENT _ The aneurysm in Bob Kincaid's abdomen was
growing. The ballooning piece of his blood vessel was big enough to
pop. When aneurysms rupture in the aorta, a main artery, the odds
of survival aren't good. But Kincaid, a 77-year-old man with heart
trouble, turned to a new procedure that fixes aneurysms without
surgery and its risks. Kincaid's aneurysm was repaired from the
inside, using and aortic stent. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News). WITH

   BRAINBOY _ PALM CITY _ When Shawn Nigam was 6-months-old, he
couldn't sit up by himself but could say words like ``ball'' and
``car.'' At 10-months, he learned the alphabet and five months
later, he could write letters. By age 2, Shawn was reading and
writing approximately 65 words.Now, the precocious 3-year-old with
a 150 IQ -- making him one of the smartest kids his age in the U.S.
-- has a penchant for the solar system, computers and new
languages. (Davies, Palm Beach Post). 34.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Remember when NBC's Thursday lineup was
``Must-See TV?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's not must-see anymore. Instead of ``Seinfeld'' and
``Mad About You,'' the Peacock has ``Jesse'' and ``Stark Raving
Mad'' wedged in there with ``Friends,'' ``Frasier'' and ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC no longer has a must-see night, although Wednesday came
close for a while, when ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks'' briefly joined ``West
Wing'' and ``Law &AMP; Order.'' And Fox comes close on Sundays,
although ``Futurama'' ruins the good comedy flow and the last few
``X-Files'' have been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   If I were Queen of All Prime-Time Scheduling (a job I richly
deserve on so many levels), every network would have at least one
must-see night. Every network except UPN, which is riddled with bad
sitcoms and wrestling. My solution would require moving a couple of
shows from one network to another and changing one hourlong
comedy-drama into a half-hour comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Sound drastic? Sure, but I'm Queen of All Prime-Time Scheduling,
at least for today.
</P>
<P>
   FOX'S MUST-SEE SUNDAY SCHEDULE:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``King of the Hill''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Simpsons''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Malcolm in the Middle''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The X-Files''
</P>
<P>
   Fox gets this one because we're already used to seeing the
network's best shows here. We'll start with two hours of sitcoms
and wind up with ``The X-Files'' _ but we're going to make Chris
Carter promise not to write any more episodes riffing on ``Cops''
or virtual reality games. What's NBC's ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks'' doing
there?
</P>
<P>
   Since the network is clearly planning to cancel this fine teen
comedy-drama, we'll tighten it to a half-hour and sell it to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wins, especially viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ABC'S MUST-SEE MONDAY SCHEDULE:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Practice''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``NYPD Blue''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Once &AMP; Again
</P>
<P>
   This assumes ``Monday Night Football'' season is over, of
course. The alphabet network has three of the best dramas on TV, so
why not line 'em up? This way we get a tidal wave of emotions,
starting with shock, moving through heartache and winding up with
heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Must-See Tuesday Schedule:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Ally McBeal''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Get Real''
</P>
<P>
   (Only two hours because that's all Fox programs during
prime-time on weeknights.)
</P>
<P>
   The network famous for sleazy reality shows and edgy comedies
also has a couple of first-rate dramas. One is wildly fanciful, and
the other is so real it makes your teeth ache. If you are among the
millions who have not sampled the new family drama ``Get Real,''
get with it. The realistic portrayal of the married couple's
passion and communication woes can be excruciating to watch, but
isn't that what realistic drama is about? Jon Tenney and Debrah
Farentino reek of honesty in their ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   NBC'S MUST-SEE WEDNESDAY SCHEDULE
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Third Watch''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The West Wing''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Law &AMP; Order''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to NBC's fine dramas, an argument can be made that we're
in a Golden Age for the genre. The network's top producers have
long proven capable with cops and lawyers. This year Aaron Sorkin
has proved that political drama can be riveting.
</P>
<P>
   NBC'S MUST-SEE THURSDAY SCHEDULE:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Friends''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Frasier''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Will &AMP; Grace''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Sports Night''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``ER''
</P>
<P>
   Let's restore this night to its former luster. All it takes is a
little juggling and a multimillion-dollar deal with creator Aaron
Sorkin's production company. That's how NBC would acquire ``Sports
Night,'' a truly first-rate comedy that ABC seems ready to let go.
It was off the schedule during the February sweeps and will end its
season prematurely on April 4. It would fit snugly with NBC's smart
sitcoms on this night.
</P>
<P>
   CBS'S BETTER-THAN-A-POKE-IN-THE-EYE FRIDAY SCHEDULE:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``60 Minutes''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Everybody Loves Raymond''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cosby''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Judging Amy''
</P>
<P>
   Improved ratings notwithstanding, CBS doesn't have a lot of good
stuff on the air this season. The network _ and all of television
for that matter _ would collapse if ``60 Minutes'' disappeared, so
we'll start with that, add a couple of easy-to-take (but hardly
thigh-slapping) comedies and wind up with the best of the Big Eye's
rather tepid new dramas.
</P>
<P>
   WB'S MUST-SEE SATURDAY SCHEDULE:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Felicity''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Angel''
</P>
<P>
   Grown-ups can take the night off. Go see a movie, leave the
rowdy teens at home where they're relatively safe and turn on a
trio of fun programs that are geared just to them. All have hot
guys and gals, rock music and quirky stories.

 &HT;    It's Georgia's turn to vote in the primaries
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Today is ``Super Tuesday'' for Georgia and 15 other
states. It's the biggest day of the year for primaries and
caucuses, which give voters a chance to help pick their parties'
candidates for president.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will choose delegates, who will go to the national
conventions to nominate the parties' candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The race is tightest among Republicans. Texas Governor George W.
Bush has 170 delegates so far. Arizona Senator John McCain has 105
delegates. It takes 1,034 delegates to lock in the nomination. A
total of 613 Republican delegates will be awarded on today.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to win Georgia, which has 54 delegates. Bush
hopes to do so well today that McCain drops out of the race. But
McCain has lots of support in New England and in New York, Ohio and
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   FLOODS TRAP THOUSANDS IN AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers from many nations are trying to save thousands of
people stranded atop roofs and trees by flooding in Mozambique. The
country, which is one of the poorest in the world, is on the
southeastern coast of Africa. Two weeks of heavy rain in early
February left Mozambique with its worst flooding in 50 years. Then
Cyclone Eline hit on Feb. 22. (A cyclone is the same thing as a
hurricane.) It dumped huge amounts of rain, ripped roofs off houses
and cut off power and water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates that about 1 million people are without
homes. Aid officials say that thousands may be dead. They say that
about half the children rescued have been separated from their
parents _ or that their parents are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now, officials are concerned about Cyclone Gloria, another storm
heading toward Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   ROCKER BACK ON THE FIELD WITH THE BRAVES
</P>
<P>
   Braves relief pitcher John Rocker joined his team in Florida
last week for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker read an apology to reporters for saying mean things about
gays, minorities and foreigners during a magazine interview.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the interview, the baseball commissioner had banned
him from spring training and the first month of the season. But
Rocker appealed the ruling. An ``arbitrator'' _ a type of judge _
heard arguments from both sides, and decided to reduce the
punishment. The arbitrator ruled that Rocker should sit out the
first 14 days of the regular season. In addition, he cut Rocker's
original $20,000 fine to $500. The arbitrator did not explain the
reasons behind his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   At the team's training camp, Rocker tried to make up with his
teammates, many of whom were angry about his comments in the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   At a closed clubhouse meeting, Rocker was described as near
tears as he apologized and pleaded with his Atlanta teammates.
``Please, guys, let me play,'' he asked them.

&HT;     SPRING BREAK NO VACATION FOR PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BARBARA HIGDON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Spring Break and graduation trips looming just ahead,
travel companies have the student market in their sights.
</P>
<P>
   Spring Break accounts for about 30 percent of that business
annually, said Elliot Veith, manager of marketing communications
for Council Travel, the international travel agency. More than 1.5
million undergraduates will take a Spring Break trip this year.
</P>
<P>
   Students with fat wallets book package trips to exotic resorts _
and that's not just college kids. Spring Break traditions have
trickled down to high school, and a trip to Disney World with Mom
and Dad just can't compare. More often, Junior and Sissy want to
hit the beaches alone.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the boys and the girls going for Spring Break?
</P>
<P>
   Florida is still first. Council Travel's figures indicate Panama
City Beach is the biggest draw, with Daytona Beach third. Cancun
ranks No. 2, followed by South Padre in Texas and Colorado's
various ski resorts at Nos. 4 and 5 in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Bikini-clad girls wave from glossy cover photos on USA Student
Travel's flier for Cancun Grad Week 2000. One relatively low price
includes air fare, seven nights' hotel accommodations and free
admission to hot dance clubs and more.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet lists many more tour companies willing to book
spring trips to Mexico. Many solicit student representatives to
distribute fliers at high schools and help pay their own way by
booking other travelers. High school kids are free to book any of
the trips _ there is no age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   USA Student Travel's note to parents suggests that allowing kids
to travel can be one of the most rewarding aspects of being a
parent. ``Seeing your child light up as they glimpse new countries
and cultures for the first time, feeling their excitement as they
meet new friends, watching them make connections between classroom
learning and `real life''' is what student travel is all about.
</P>
<P>
   While the company's educational trips to Space Camp, Washington,
D.C., or Europe may fulfill those parental expectations, Cancun
offers more ``real life'' than some teens can handle.
</P>
<P>
   Parents may look on the whole rite with bemused indulgence _
some born of actual experience. After all, there's not much new
under the sun, is there? What's the harm in letting hard-working
kids have some fun?
</P>
<P>
   USA Student Travel's brochure clearly states the risks. It
indicates the drinking age in Mexico, for example, is 18 and
cautions there is a lack of enforcement. Company literature states
that it does not condone the use of alcohol, and that these are not
school-sponsored activities. Students younger than 18 must have a
parent's signature on the application form; however, neither that
nor the child's age is verified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the drinking age may be lower, there is a legal age for
drinking in Mexico,'' said Jeff Trexler, sales manager for USA
Student Travel. ``Most of what is illegal in the U.S. is illegal in
Mexico. You can't go on vacation and suspend adherence to the
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents must know their children, Trexler said. ``If they
haven't observed responsible behavior in their kids in the 18 years
they've been at home, they shouldn't expect it in a foreign
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bullock, a licensed professional counselor whose practice
deals with families and children in San Antonio, suggested that a
child's behavior though the years will probably indicate behavior
in a Spring Break setting.
</P>
<P>
   It depends on the parent-child relationship, Bullock said. It
depends on the amount of trust and whether you have the kind of
relationship where your child will call you if there is a problem.
``If they've always pushed limits at home, and we think they're not
going to do it when we're not there, we're crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for parents who trust their children, there's concern about
the other dangers in an atmosphere devoid of control or
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Trexler stipulated that USA Student Travel is merely ``a regular
travel agency. We book air, hotel and transfers.'' They do not
chaperone, though staff members try to be available to help in
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of minor injuries requiring medical attention compounded
by language problems are frequent. Public nudity, drug use, theft
and drunkenness are common. If you want an idea of what the beach
scene is like at Spring Break, read Student Advantage's ``Spring
Break Revealed'' message board (www.studentadvantage.com) that
lists more than 100 student reviews of Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Weiss accompanied her daughter's group on a graduation
trip to Cancun in 1999 and was on the scene when a San Antonio girl
died in a fall from a hotel balcony.
</P>
<P>
   What was Cancun like?
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot imagine,'' Weiss said. ``The excess is too much for
words. I thought there would be one adult for every six kids, but
on our airplane of 339 kids, there were four 4 adults.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the kids got off the plane in Cancun, there were little
bars set up everywhere. By the time they got on our bus, kids were
drinking Corona beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the bars,'' Weiss said, ``The waitresses would walk around
with a whistle. When they whistled, the kids could buy two shots of
tequila for 50 cents. They'd pour it down the kids' throats.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancun doesn't corner the market on accidents. Falls, drownings
and other injuries occur at other destinations, including South
Padre in Texas. An 18-year-old Oklahoma woman became the first
Texas Spring Break fatality of 1998 when she was struck in an
alcohol-related hit-and-run on the beach at South Padre. In 1995, a
17-year-old from Austin died after falling six stories from an
island hotel balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Although Florida remains the top destination for Spring Break,
travel there is down by 20 percent in part because places such as
Fort Lauderdale _ the setting of the 1960 Spring Break film ``Where
the Boys Are'' _ banned Spring Breakers years ago. Still, about
500,000 Spring Breakers descend on Florida Panhandle beaches.
</P>
<P>
   What should parents consider before allowing kids to go on a
Spring Break trip?
</P>
<P>
   Investigate the tour companies carefully, determine the air
carrier, read the fine print, and ask plenty of questions.

   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The treasures of the newest
Bay Area recreation lands, waters and wetlands are known to few,
yet are surveyed without hardly a thought from afar by thousands
each day. This area covers 13,000 acres, highlighted by 10,000
acres of wetlands and an intricate web of waterways that can be
accessed by canoe, kayak or power boat, along with dirt roads on
levees that can be used as trails that are ideal for biking, hiking
and birdwatching. There are also several of the better shoreline
fishing spots in the region. By TOM STIENSTRA.

<P>
   SPRING-BREAK (Undated) _ Students with fat wallets book package
trips to exotic resorts _ and that's not just college kids. Spring
Break traditions have trickled down to high school, and a trip to
Disney World with Mom and Dad just can't compare. More often,
Junior and Sissy want to hit the beaches alone. And Florida remains
a popular destination. By BARBARA HIGDON.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA (Havana, Cuba) _ Two words of advice on traveling to Cuba:
Go. Now. Go before Burger Kings mar the Malecon or someone slaps up
a Gap at the Plaza de la Revolucion. Go while Russian-built Ladas
still whisk past the plaza's mammoth image of Che Guevara. Catch a
fading glimpse of the Western Hemisphere's last Communist state for
better and for worse. Yes, some things are better. And many things
are worse. By KATE GURNETT.

<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ One month a Republican, and I
can't wait to get back to the party of Hillary and Bill and Al and
the other Bill, the one who used to have an outside shot. That's
how painful this presidential primary has been. How backward is the
Republican Party? The GOP has taken us into a new millennium with a
primary based on religious war - and between different groups of
Christians, of all things. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The only ballot-measure petition
I'll ever sign is one that proposes a moratorium on ballot
measures. Each California election gets worse. The list of complex,
confusing propositions grows more unwieldy. Millions of dollars are
wasted as big industries like tobacco or insurance put self-serving
propositions on the ballot and ragtag citizens groups fight them.
By STEPHANIE SALTER.

   Under the bright Southern California sky, a black Mercedes wired
with three phone lines speeds down the Ventura Freeway into the San
Fernando Valley. Its destination is a small '70s-era tract house in
Woodland Hills, where Gwyneth Paltrow is just waking up from a nap
to film a scene in her next Miramax movie, ``Bounce,'' costarring
Ben Affleck and directed by Don Roos (``The Opposite of Sex'').
</P>
<P>
   In the back seat of the limo, Miramax co-president of production
Meryl Poster clutches her cell phone, which is quiet for a moment.
Her first stop of the day, she explains, will be an easy one,
because the Oscar-decorated stars of ``Bounce'' are surprisingly
low-maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a happy set,'' she says. ``They're consummate
professionals. I don't need to be holding their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   All the same, whenever talent like Gwyneth and Ben are involved,
it's prudent for the studio brass to ``show support,'' as Poster
says. So for the duration of the nine-week shoot, she has relocated
with her family from New York's Upper East Side to a snug house in
Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous year, she had also traveled to Massachusetts for
``The Cider House Rules,'' on which she served as executive
producer. Then she headed to Italy for ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   If Harvey Weinstein is the demanding father in the Miramax
family, then Poster is the understanding mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meryl is Harvey's relationship person,'' Paltrow says.
``Without Meryl, Harvey wouldn't get anywhere, bossing everybody
around. Meryl is there to smooth it over.''
</P>
<P>
   Poster diplomatically adds that Weinstein ``has great
relationships with actors. I have great relationships with
agents.''
</P>
<P>
   But Paltrow clearly counts on Poster for peace of mind. The
first word out of her mouth when she emerges from her dressing room
is ``Meryl?'' And between takes, Gwyneth gravitates toward the
older woman _ whispering in her ear, hugging her and using her as a
leaning post for stretching exercises.
</P>
<P>
   During crew lunch, the two recall that they first crossed paths
at an audition around 1991, then quickly became pals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw her on `Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,''' Poster
recalls. ``I thought there was something in her.''
</P>
<P>
   Poster used to invite the actress to premieres, and they
attended the Toronto Film Festival together.
</P>
<P>
   ``She protected me from Robert Downey Jr.,'' remembers Paltrow
with a laugh. ``I do come from a pretty nice family.''
</P>
<P>
   The decisive moment for Paltrow _ and for Miramax _ soon
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvey said, `If you do ``The Pallbearer,'' then I'll give you
``Emma,'' ' '' Paltrow recalls. ``As usual, Harvey got his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Paltrow has stuck with the studio far longer than
she has stuck with her boyfriends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in New York _ I don't have personal relationships with
any other studios,'' she says. ``Things just grew and grew, and I
was here.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of Poster's rise. She arrived at Miramax
from the William Morris Agency at the moment when the scrappy
independent film company had its first major hit, ``Sex, Lies, and
Videotape.'' It was a bumpy landing for Poster, who started as
executive assistant to Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week I was there, I quit,'' she recalls. ``I hated
it. The pressure was so intense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Poster succeeded in making herself indispensable to
Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company grew so fast that as his assistant I was going to
lunch with Daniel Day Lewis,'' she remembers.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, she is still Weinstein's shadow. ``My wife
calls her my day wife,'' Weinstein says.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the movies on which she was executive producer _
``Cop Land,'' ``The Pallbearer,'' ``Wide Awake'' and ``Marvin's
Room,'' in addition to ``The Cider House Rules'' _ have been
lackluster at the box office, Poster has proven herself a keen
scout for unknown talent. Most recently, she signed Jason Biggs to
a two-movie deal before ``American Pie'' made him a youthful
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   And while Poster may have mastered the cozy den-mother schtick
with her young stars, Weinstein stresses that she's a formidable
presence in the office, where it really counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meryl is a firecracker,'' he says. ``She kicks ass. Every day,
she starts with me and works her way up.'' &QL;

``Cop Land,'' ``The Pallbearer,'' ``Wide Awake'' and ``Marvin's
Room,'' in addition to ``The Cider House Rules'' _ have been
lackluster at the box office, Poster has proven herself a keen
scout for unknown talent. Most recently, she signed Jason Biggs to
a two-movie deal before ``American Pie'' made him a youthful
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   And while Poster may have mastered the cozy den-mother schtick
with her young stars, Weinstein stresses that she's a formidable
presence in the office, where it really counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meryl is a firecracker,'' he says. ``She kicks ass. Every day,
she starts with me and works her way up.'' &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It's that time again. On Feb. 15, the Oscar nominations were
announced. Suddenly, five women underwent more stylistic scrutiny
than any supermodel or society girl ever has.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in New York, Milan, Paris and Los Angeles dropped what
they were doing to take note of these ladies, who are suddenly
Fashion's Most Desirable _ at least until March 27.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? One of these candidates could emerge as the next
Gwyneth Paltrow, a celebrity who gets as much attention for her
talent as she does for her sense of style. After all, it's not a
bad runway to show off the new trends for evening: only about a
billion people will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   No designer worth his or her sequins could ever hope for better
product placement _ a dress on an Oscar nominee is better than
having a commercial on the Superbowl.
</P>
<P>
   But will the first Oscar ceremony of the new millennium be any
different than the usual frenzied parade of ballgowns?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the worst things,'' Tom Ford notes, ``is seeing a dress
wear an actress rather an actress wear a dress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger,'' says noted New York celebrity hairdresser John
Sahag, ``is that in looking glamourous, many actresses end up
looking old fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take a poll of fashion experts _ the designers,
hair stylists, makeup artists, clothing stylists, retailers and top
fashion editors _ to see what advice they can offer this new Top
Five.
</P>
<P>
   Some liked the challenge of glamming up the more serious
actresses, like Janet McTeer, Meryl Streep and Annette Bening.
``I'd love to see them in classic looks, sort of modernized Grace
Kelly,'' offers Jeanine Lobell, creator of Stila Cosmetics and a
veteran of Oscar makeup. ``If women like that do too much and get
too trendy, it's hard to pull off.''
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone agrees with Barneys New York creative director
Simon Doonan, who says: ``The general consensus is, it's time for
something new!'' That means no more ballgowns, beaded sweater sets,
evening separates, too-tight clothes, and death to the pastel
pashmina. But what else do Oscar fashionistas have up their silken
sleeves?
</P>
<P>
   Here, some pointers from the pros.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANNETTE BENING, for ``American Beauty'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's always had the body and the swagger to wear anything, but
Annette Bening is loyal to one man: Giorgio Armani. She usually
wears a black column dress or black evening tuxedo. This year, she
has another requirement: on March 26, she'll be nine months
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I want to dress Annette Bening. I like the red
evening column with a draped neckline that was a knockout on our
fall runway. I can seriously see Annette Bening in this, in either
the red or the black. I love dressing her. I think she has stature
_ divine! She is an American beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Even though I have not seen all the movies and I'm
not familiar with all the actresses, I believe Annette Bening has
an amazing and perfect American style.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Annette Bening pretty
much always wears Armani. She's like the first lady of Hollywood
and she should dress like a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I love Annette, but I heard she's not going
because of the pregnancy. She's a classic beauty. Between her,
Julianne Moore and Hilary Swank, you can't do better than those
three. Not only do I respect them as artists, they also have
amazing bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``In all fairness to Annette Bening, she's been
pregnant for eight months and she still managed to look elegant at
the Golden Globes. But I don't think for her it's a year she'll be
making a major fashion statement.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Annette likes Escada. I'd suggest
something cashmere. Maybe Randolph Duke. They're pretty, they're
comfy, they're sexy. I did one for Cindy Crawford when she was
pregnant. Thank God we're not in the days of having to hide it any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROL SHAW, makeup artist, did Bening's makeup for the recent
Vanity Fair cover: ``I think she's just naturally luminescent. I
would do her either very understated or with a shiny red lip. Very
Old Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   SALLY HERSHBERGER, hairstylist: ``She always looks great, but
I'd like to freshen up Annette Bening's look a little. I'd brighten
up her color and smooth her short hair into an Audrey Hepburn-type
of style.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``I'd like to see her with
chin-length hair, with lots of layers. She needs slightly more
volume and movement in her hair. She's very, very sexy, but with
hair that's too extreme _ too short, too full. I'd also like to see
more of an amber-copper mix with her color. I'd also give her long
bangs.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Annette Bening dresses older than she
is. She wears Armani and Escada, and it's not the designs, her
choices are a little matronly. She doesn't have a typical face. Her
hair is too big. This is a woman who is more unique looking. She's
very sexy yet she doesn't dress sexy at all. I wish she would. She
has a great capacity for seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JULIANNE MOORE, for ``The End of the Affair'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore always manages to set off those amazing red locks
with of-the-moment looks _ by Prada, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Ralph Lauren
_ without ever looking too fashiony or contrived. She walks the
line between fashionable and subtle without ever falling on her
heels.
</P>
<P>
   TOM FORD: ``Julianne Moore has the greatest style. I'd love to
dress her.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Julianne Moore is sexy and glamorous and she's the
one I'm most curious about.''
</P>
<P>
   TOMMY HILFIGER: ``I think Julianne Moore looks very good in
casual. I'd like to see her in our leather jeans and a cashmere
turtleneck.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I'd put Julianne Moore in a simple dress in a
vivid color, perhaps violet to play off her red hair. She's so
alluring and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``I have a beautiful brown cashmere dress in the
collection that would look great with Julianne Moore's red hair and
white skin. She should wear something fitted and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``For me, Julianne Moore is the
ultimate. You don't see many redheads on the screen. I would keep
her hair long, at about collarbone length, but I'd give it a bit of
angle between the cheekbone and jaws, with some long wispy layers
for movement. Her color is awesome _ I wouldn't change a thing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Julianne Moore is an example of the perfect
redhead. She should always stay with the reds, but I would play
with red seasonally on her _ for a winter show like the Academy
Awards, I'd make her a rich auburn, and in the summer, I'd do a
gorgeous strawberry shade.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMES PURCELL: ``We need to get her to look more like a
glamorous actress than a Gucci ad. I would put Moore in something
neither over-the-top nor overly beaded, but simple and elegant with
a more dramatic hairstyle.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Of all the actresses nominated for
Best Actress, Julianne Moore likes clothes the most. She wears
Prada and Ralph and looks that are very simple. However, when Moore
wore a Ralph Lauren gown, the back was cut too close to the sides.
But she's very savvy not to wear looks that are too billowy or too
full. She always looks fuller than she is.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Julianne Moore could go vintage. She
could look great in a Henry James dress. I would suggest she go to
Galliano. She should have major impact on the red carpet. She's
just so beautiful. She should do a Victorian Henry James look.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANET MCTEER, for ``Tumbleweeds'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch British actress and Tony Award winner (for ``A
Doll's House'' on Broadway in 1997) is an enigma to designers but
says that what she'll wear to the Oscars is at the bottom of her
priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somebody will come up with something nice for me to
wear,'' she said recently. ``I wore all British things to the
Golden Globes. Or I could be the first woman to wear pants to the
Oscars. But you don't often get to wear a really fancy frock in
your life, do you? So bring on the fancy frocks. I do hope all the
designers come calling. Stand in line, matey!''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``Somebody I'd like to see make an effort is Janet
McTeer, because she's so sensual and so sexy in that film, and
she's someone who could look even better at the Academy Awards. She
has an incredibly sensual body. At the Golden Globes, she looked
like she wanted to escape it. I'm thinking something minimal but
beautifully cut, sophisticated and sensual.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Janet McTeer is a British actress who
blew everybody off the map when she did `A Doll's House.' She's a
very full-shaped lady, and tall, and designers should be aware of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Janet McTeer needs to do something dramatic for
the Oscars, because a lot of us don't know her well. If she does
something really different, it'll make everyone wake up and say `Oh
my God, that's her?' I'd cut her hair _ which is too long, by the
way _ very short, and I'd bleach it beige. Then I'd do a beige gown
and taupe lips. Then, I guarantee, everyone would be talking about
her after the show because she'd look so fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Janet McTeer is a very handsome
woman. She wore a twin set with a skirt with a bit of a dramatic
train to the Golden Globes. For an English woman, she looked
fantastic. She shouldn't try to upstage herself if she did well at
the Golden Globes. She looked very handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BARRETT, hairstylist: ``Janet has a stunning face. I styled
her for the Golden Globes, and I brought out her face, using her
hair as an accessory. I also added a little red to her hair. I'd
like to see her do something similar for the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, stylist: ``The woman has so much presence. I'd
love to see her in something by Oscar de la Renta _ she's so
statuesque.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILLIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Someone like Janet McTeer, she's
waiting to be discovered. With her I would go with a beautiful
Badgley Mischka or Randolph Duke. She doesn't have to be
unpredictable. I love the fact that she's not a young starlet or an
older actress. I don't see her in something sexy, sexy. Maybe
Valentino or Armani. They're going through the Valentino archives.
I'm waiting for the sketches. Maybe something from the '40s. Or
there are some really great things from Chanel Couture. I could see
her in something fresh and spring-like.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``English women have these weird hairdos.
She would look so great with a short haircut. She has a
great-looking neck, that beautiful length that so many women don't
have. I'd do even a low ponytail with hair extensions at the nape,
emphasize the face and neck. That English look is such stoic
beauty. The more you add, the worse it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MERYL STREEP, for ``Music of the Heart'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is Streep's 12th Academy Awards nomination, which makes her
the most nominated female ever, tying with Katherine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Meryl may have every bit as much talent as Hepburn _ but
if only she had half as much style. Maybe after 11 times at the
Oscars she'll finally get it right. As Tom Ford reiterated, ``Meryl
Streep may be brilliant, but fashionwise, she needs a little
help.''
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I love Meryl,'' said the designer, scanning the
racks in her showroom for an example of the look she would
prescribe. She pulled out a turtleneck dress and declared it right,
with a few alterations: ``Just simple and beautiful, down to the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Meryl Streep is above and beyond fashion and her
style matches her personality: warm, elegant and superior.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Meryl Streep should go with
something very classic. She should do the Park Avenue Matron look
and wear a marvelous twin set, maybe an embroidered and embellished
sweater and full skirt, preferably Oscar de la Renta.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Meryl Streep should
wear Michael Kors. It plays up to her sexiness. She's been playing
it down and needs to play it up. Or, she should wear Celine. Her
hair should be over one eye. Kors knows how to give the ladies of a
certain age some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``I'd like Meryl Streep to cut her hair
off a bit, something off the shoulders, short around her face. Not
anything fancy, not extremely trendy. Something along the way of
very chic, above the shoulder. Then the weight line would be at the
right length.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Meryl Streep's been looking heavier. I
hope she'll be a little more glamorous at the Oscars. You don't
want her to look like the mother of the bride. I'd love to try
something a little corsety: emphasize the cleavage, suck in the
waist, push up the breasts. I rarely do black, but in this case I
might.''
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I always wanted to dress Meryl Streep because I
respect her so much as an actress. She hasn't come off as sexy
lately, but I think she can be classy and sexy at the same time.''
For Streep, Dennis suggested a beaded white robe with pants.
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I'd liven up her look with a tailored jacket
and a wonderful skirt. I've spent time on the red carpet and I've
seen photographers and journalists clamoring for a quote from
Portia de Rossi, when Meryl Streep comes in and no one pays
attention to the greatest actress of our time. That's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``Meryl Streep is a great actress, but I think she
could use a little help in the fashion department. I'd love to make
her look glamorous and beautiful in a black strapless gown with an
A-line skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Of all the nominees, she's the one
that I'd most like to make over. First, I'd give her shorter hair _
something about chin length, keeping the ends soft and sexy,
something with a little volume so it's not just stuck to her head.
I'd keep her as a blonde, but give her some brighter highlights for
some depth.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Meryl Streep is the USA's perfect blonde. She can
wear any color blonde. If I were coloring her, I'd do a dark blonde
base with lighter tones in front and a little darker in back _ sort
of a surfer-girl shade. Her hair is too long right now.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I suggest a look that's clean and simple and
something she's comfortable with, even if it's not fabulous. She
should look like herself. At this point, it doesn't matter what she
wears.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Meryl Streep is the one who needs the
most help. I don't think she cares enough. Maybe she should wear
Oscar de la Renta. He doesn't sacrifice a woman's elegance while
trying to make them look modern.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HILARY SWANK, for ``Boys Don't Cry'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's this year's Oscar It Girl, with all the dream elements a
designer's looking for: tall, thin, hip, stylish, great looking,
has talent _ and a good bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Karl Lagerfeld, Donatella Versace and Tom Ford have put
her on the ``Must Dress'' list. As InStyle's Hal Rubenstein puts
it: ``Hilary Swank will be drowning in dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Hilary Swank has the greatest style.
She set the tone at the Golden Globes in a black Versace, and it
was a major coup for her and for Versace. She should stick with the
tried-and-true formula.''
</P>
<P>
   SIMON DOONAN, Barneys New York: ``It would be great if Hilary
Swank wore Comme des Garcons, or better yet, vintage Comme des
Garcons! My advice for the Oscars is vintage, vintage, vintage.
Hilary Swank could wear something vintage like a Dior `New Look'
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Hilary Swank is changing her look so as not to be
framed with the character of her movie. I know her well _ she
attended my couture show in Paris and I'm happy to help her
again.''
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I would pick Hilary Swank (to dress), because
she'll get the most attention _ and this is no secret _ it's all
about who will get the most attention.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTINA PERRIN: ``I think Hilary Swank has the most fantastic
body and that beautiful short, cropped hair. She should wear
something very sleek and dark red.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA HERRERA: ``I would like to see Hilary Swank in
something different beside a slinky embroidered dress. A red
strapless dress would be beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``Although Hilary Swank glammed it up in Versace
Couture at the Golden Globes, I think she should wear a satin
tuxedo for a feminine/masculine play. I don't really want to see
her in a ballgown or a long dress.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, veteran Oscar and Hollywood stylist: ``I have
the thrill of dressing Hilary for the Oscars this year! I think
she's our young Mia Farrow, with a sensuality about her that's the
girl next door with a little edge. I am thinking about color this
time. The Golden Globes was Hilary's first time out. I predict
she's gonna have a little more fun at the Academy Awards. We're not
married to one designer.''
</P>
<P>
   JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran Oscar makeup artist:
``I'd like to work on Hilary Swank. I just like the way she looks
and I think that she doesn't need a lot of makeup. She's the kind
of person you'd put one thing on _ a little eye or a little lip _
she's not someone you'd like to paint everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN SAHAG, hairstylist: ``Hilary Swank's hair looks like it's
growing out from the film. I definitely think that now that she
finished her movie she could go back to being feminine: grow the
sides, fringe, and back out, and go for something messier and more
tousled. I think that would be a nice contrast for the public to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Hilary should consciously play
against the androgyny we've seen of her to show her versatility.
I'd take her hair a little longer. I'd also give her soft bangs
that she could brush to the side, and layer her hair a bit on top
for volume. I'd also like to see her with some caramel highlights;
they'd give her hair a little sparkle and make it a little more
electric.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS, celebrity colorist, Avon Centre: ``Because she
played a boy in `Boys Don't Cry,' I'd tell her to arrive at the
Oscars totally femmed out _ big red lips, honey-colored hair,
something really high gloss, high glam. I'd dress her in a gorgeous
Badgley Mischka dress and get Kevyn Aucoin or Laura Mercier to do
really glamorous makeup on her.'' &QL;

   VERA WANG: ``In all fairness to Annette Bening, she's been
pregnant for eight months and she still managed to look elegant at
the Golden Globes. But I don't think for her it's a year she'll be
making a major fashion statement.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Annette likes Escada. I'd suggest
something cashmere. Maybe Randolph Duke. They're pretty, they're
comfy, they're sexy. I did one for Cindy Crawford when she was
pregnant. Thank God we're not in the days of having to hide it any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROL SHAW, makeup artist, did Bening's makeup for the recent
Vanity Fair cover: ``I think she's just naturally luminescent. I
would do her either very understated or with a shiny red lip. Very
Old Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   SALLY HERSHBERGER, hairstylist: ``She always looks great, but
I'd like to freshen up Annette Bening's look a little. I'd brighten
up her color and smooth her short hair into an Audrey Hepburn-type
of style.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``I'd like to see her with
chin-length hair, with lots of layers. She needs slightly more
volume and movement in her hair. She's very, very sexy, but with
hair that's too extreme _ too short, too full. I'd also like to see
more of an amber-copper mix with her color. I'd also give her long
bangs.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Annette Bening dresses older than she
is. She wears Armani and Escada, and it's not the designs, her
choices are a little matronly. She doesn't have a typical face. Her
hair is too big. This is a woman who is more unique looking. She's
very sexy yet she doesn't dress sexy at all. I wish she would. She
has a great capacity for seduction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JULIANNE MOORE, for ``The End of the Affair'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore always manages to set off those amazing red locks
with of-the-moment looks _ by Prada, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, Ralph Lauren
_ without ever looking too fashiony or contrived. She walks the
line between fashionable and subtle without ever falling on her
heels.
</P>
<P>
   TOM FORD: ``Julianne Moore has the greatest style. I'd love to
dress her.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Julianne Moore is sexy and glamorous and she's the
one I'm most curious about.''
</P>
<P>
   TOMMY HILFIGER: ``I think Julianne Moore looks very good in
casual. I'd like to see her in our leather jeans and a cashmere
turtleneck.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I'd put Julianne Moore in a simple dress in a
vivid color, perhaps violet to play off her red hair. She's so
alluring and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``I have a beautiful brown cashmere dress in the
collection that would look great with Julianne Moore's red hair and
white skin. She should wear something fitted and sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``For me, Julianne Moore is the
ultimate. You don't see many redheads on the screen. I would keep
her hair long, at about collarbone length, but I'd give it a bit of
angle between the cheekbone and jaws, with some long wispy layers
for movement. Her color is awesome _ I wouldn't change a thing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Julianne Moore is an example of the perfect
redhead. She should always stay with the reds, but I would play
with red seasonally on her _ for a winter show like the Academy
Awards, I'd make her a rich auburn, and in the summer, I'd do a
gorgeous strawberry shade.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMES PURCELL: ``We need to get her to look more like a
glamorous actress than a Gucci ad. I would put Moore in something
neither over-the-top nor overly beaded, but simple and elegant with
a more dramatic hairstyle.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Of all the actresses nominated for
Best Actress, Julianne Moore likes clothes the most. She wears
Prada and Ralph and looks that are very simple. However, when Moore
wore a Ralph Lauren gown, the back was cut too close to the sides.
But she's very savvy not to wear looks that are too billowy or too
full. She always looks fuller than she is.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Julianne Moore could go vintage. She
could look great in a Henry James dress. I would suggest she go to
Galliano. She should have major impact on the red carpet. She's
just so beautiful. She should do a Victorian Henry James look.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANET MCTEER, for ``Tumbleweeds'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch British actress and Tony Award winner (for ``A
Doll's House'' on Broadway in 1997) is an enigma to designers but
says that what she'll wear to the Oscars is at the bottom of her
priority list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somebody will come up with something nice for me to
wear,'' she said recently. ``I wore all British things to the
Golden Globes. Or I could be the first woman to wear pants to the
Oscars. But you don't often get to wear a really fancy frock in
your life, do you? So bring on the fancy frocks. I do hope all the
designers come calling. Stand in line, matey!''
</P>
<P>
   VERA WANG: ``Somebody I'd like to see make an effort is Janet
McTeer, because she's so sensual and so sexy in that film, and
she's someone who could look even better at the Academy Awards. She
has an incredibly sensual body. At the Golden Globes, she looked
like she wanted to escape it. I'm thinking something minimal but
beautifully cut, sophisticated and sensual.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Janet McTeer is a British actress who
blew everybody off the map when she did `A Doll's House.' She's a
very full-shaped lady, and tall, and designers should be aware of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Janet McTeer needs to do something dramatic for
the Oscars, because a lot of us don't know her well. If she does
something really different, it'll make everyone wake up and say `Oh
my God, that's her?' I'd cut her hair _ which is too long, by the
way _ very short, and I'd bleach it beige. Then I'd do a beige gown
and taupe lips. Then, I guarantee, everyone would be talking about
her after the show because she'd look so fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Janet McTeer is a very handsome
woman. She wore a twin set with a skirt with a bit of a dramatic
train to the Golden Globes. For an English woman, she looked
fantastic. She shouldn't try to upstage herself if she did well at
the Golden Globes. She looked very handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN BARRETT, hairstylist: ``Janet has a stunning face. I styled
her for the Golden Globes, and I brought out her face, using her
hair as an accessory. I also added a little red to her hair. I'd
like to see her do something similar for the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, stylist: ``The woman has so much presence. I'd
love to see her in something by Oscar de la Renta _ she's so
statuesque.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILLIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Someone like Janet McTeer, she's
waiting to be discovered. With her I would go with a beautiful
Badgley Mischka or Randolph Duke. She doesn't have to be
unpredictable. I love the fact that she's not a young starlet or an
older actress. I don't see her in something sexy, sexy. Maybe
Valentino or Armani. They're going through the Valentino archives.
I'm waiting for the sketches. Maybe something from the '40s. Or
there are some really great things from Chanel Couture. I could see
her in something fresh and spring-like.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``English women have these weird hairdos.
She would look so great with a short haircut. She has a
great-looking neck, that beautiful length that so many women don't
have. I'd do even a low ponytail with hair extensions at the nape,
emphasize the face and neck. That English look is such stoic
beauty. The more you add, the worse it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MERYL STREEP, for ``Music of the Heart'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is Streep's 12th Academy Awards nomination, which makes her
the most nominated female ever, tying with Katherine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Meryl may have every bit as much talent as Hepburn _ but
if only she had half as much style. Maybe after 11 times at the
Oscars she'll finally get it right. As Tom Ford reiterated, ``Meryl
Streep may be brilliant, but fashionwise, she needs a little
help.''
</P>
<P>
   DONNA KARAN: ``I love Meryl,'' said the designer, scanning the
racks in her showroom for an example of the look she would
prescribe. She pulled out a turtleneck dress and declared it right,
with a few alterations: ``Just simple and beautiful, down to the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Meryl Streep is above and beyond fashion and her
style matches her personality: warm, elegant and superior.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Meryl Streep should go with
something very classic. She should do the Park Avenue Matron look
and wear a marvelous twin set, maybe an embroidered and embellished
sweater and full skirt, preferably Oscar de la Renta.''
</P>
<P>
   AMY SPINDLER, New York Times Magazine: ``Meryl Streep should
wear Michael Kors. It plays up to her sexiness. She's been playing
it down and needs to play it up. Or, she should wear Celine. Her
hair should be over one eye. Kors knows how to give the ladies of a
certain age some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ART LUNA, hairstylist: ``I'd like Meryl Streep to cut her hair
off a bit, something off the shoulders, short around her face. Not
anything fancy, not extremely trendy. Something along the way of
very chic, above the shoulder. Then the weight line would be at the
right length.''
</P>
<P>
   PHILIP BLOCH, stylist: ``Meryl Streep's been looking heavier. I
hope she'll be a little more glamorous at the Oscars. You don't
want her to look like the mother of the bride. I'd love to try
something a little corsety: emphasize the cleavage, suck in the
waist, push up the breasts. I rarely do black, but in this case I
might.''
</P>
<P>
   PAMELA DENNIS: ``I always wanted to dress Meryl Streep because I
respect her so much as an actress. She hasn't come off as sexy
lately, but I think she can be classy and sexy at the same time.''
For Streep, Dennis suggested a beaded white robe with pants.
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I'd liven up her look with a tailored jacket
and a wonderful skirt. I've spent time on the red carpet and I've
seen photographers and journalists clamoring for a quote from
Portia de Rossi, when Meryl Streep comes in and no one pays
attention to the greatest actress of our time. That's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   HEIDI WEISEL: ``Meryl Streep is a great actress, but I think she
could use a little help in the fashion department. I'd love to make
her look glamorous and beautiful in a black strapless gown with an
A-line skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Of all the nominees, she's the one
that I'd most like to make over. First, I'd give her shorter hair _
something about chin length, keeping the ends soft and sexy,
something with a little volume so it's not just stuck to her head.
I'd keep her as a blonde, but give her some brighter highlights for
some depth.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS: ``Meryl Streep is the USA's perfect blonde. She can
wear any color blonde. If I were coloring her, I'd do a dark blonde
base with lighter tones in front and a little darker in back _ sort
of a surfer-girl shade. Her hair is too long right now.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``I suggest a look that's clean and simple and
something she's comfortable with, even if it's not fabulous. She
should look like herself. At this point, it doesn't matter what she
wears.''
</P>
<P>
   HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Meryl Streep is the one who needs the
most help. I don't think she cares enough. Maybe she should wear
Oscar de la Renta. He doesn't sacrifice a woman's elegance while
trying to make them look modern.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HILARY SWANK, for ``Boys Don't Cry'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's this year's Oscar It Girl, with all the dream elements a
designer's looking for: tall, thin, hip, stylish, great looking,
has talent _ and a good bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Karl Lagerfeld, Donatella Versace and Tom Ford have put
her on the ``Must Dress'' list. As InStyle's Hal Rubenstein puts
it: ``Hilary Swank will be drowning in dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE LEON TALLEY, Vogue: ``Hilary Swank has the greatest style.
She set the tone at the Golden Globes in a black Versace, and it
was a major coup for her and for Versace. She should stick with the
tried-and-true formula.''
</P>
<P>
   SIMON DOONAN, Barneys New York: ``It would be great if Hilary
Swank wore Comme des Garcons, or better yet, vintage Comme des
Garcons! My advice for the Oscars is vintage, vintage, vintage.
Hilary Swank could wear something vintage like a Dior `New Look'
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   VALENTINO: ``Hilary Swank is changing her look so as not to be
framed with the character of her movie. I know her well _ she
attended my couture show in Paris and I'm happy to help her
again.''
</P>
<P>
   RANDOLPH DUKE: ``I would pick Hilary Swank (to dress), because
she'll get the most attention _ and this is no secret _ it's all
about who will get the most attention.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTINA PERRIN: ``I think Hilary Swank has the most fantastic
body and that beautiful short, cropped hair. She should wear
something very sleek and dark red.''
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA HERRERA: ``I would like to see Hilary Swank in
something different beside a slinky embroidered dress. A red
strapless dress would be beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   VICTOR ALFARO: ``Although Hilary Swank glammed it up in Versace
Couture at the Golden Globes, I think she should wear a satin
tuxedo for a feminine/masculine play. I don't really want to see
her in a ballgown or a long dress.''
</P>
<P>
   JESSICA PASTER, veteran Oscar and Hollywood stylist: ``I have
the thrill of dressing Hilary for the Oscars this year! I think
she's our young Mia Farrow, with a sensuality about her that's the
girl next door with a little edge. I am thinking about color this
time. The Golden Globes was Hilary's first time out. I predict
she's gonna have a little more fun at the Academy Awards. We're not
married to one designer.''
</P>
<P>
   JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran Oscar makeup artist:
``I'd like to work on Hilary Swank. I just like the way she looks
and I think that she doesn't need a lot of makeup. She's the kind
of person you'd put one thing on _ a little eye or a little lip _
she's not someone you'd like to paint everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN SAHAG, hairstylist: ``Hilary Swank's hair looks like it's
growing out from the film. I definitely think that now that she
finished her movie she could go back to being feminine: grow the
sides, fringe, and back out, and go for something messier and more
tousled. I think that would be a nice contrast for the public to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Hilary should consciously play
against the androgyny we've seen of her to show her versatility.
I'd take her hair a little longer. I'd also give her soft bangs
that she could brush to the side, and layer her hair a bit on top
for volume. I'd also like to see her with some caramel highlights;
they'd give her hair a little sparkle and make it a little more
electric.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD JOHNS, celebrity colorist, Avon Centre: ``Because she
played a boy in `Boys Don't Cry,' I'd tell her to arrive at the
Oscars totally femmed out _ big red lips, honey-colored hair,
something really high gloss, high glam. I'd dress her in a gorgeous
Badgley Mischka dress and get Kevyn Aucoin or Laura Mercier to do
really glamorous makeup on her.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Emmanuel Mignot opened the door, a dachshund bounded into
the basement room at Stanford University's Sleep Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, a dozen men and women exchanged nervous
glances. Now they watched as Mignot's associate, Seiji Nishino,
reached for his research tool: a can of dog food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allez Beau teckel!'' said Mignot, a native of Paris, as he
knelt to rub the dog's belly.
</P>
<P>
   Beau seemed an excitable but ordinary dog. His regular food was
dry pellets. But today, Beau would get canned dog food _ a special
treat.
</P>
<P>
   Nishino spooned the wet food onto the floor, and Mignot cooed,
``C'est de la bonne viande.'' Beau perked up, trotted happily to
the food, sniffed, rolled his eyes in pleasurable anticipation _
and dropped to the concrete, limp as an empty sock.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors, members of a narcolepsy support group from
California's East Bay area, awwwwwww-ed in sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic symptoms of narcolepsy, the disorder in
which sleep instantly overwhelms a person during the day, is
collapse triggered by excitement or strong emotions. So what
happened to Beau, a narcoleptic dog, did not surprise the people in
the room.
</P>
<P>
   As a lab researcher with a Ph.D. in molecular pharmacology,
Mignot believes he has finally discovered the key to understanding
narcolepsy. Last August, Mignot announced that he and others
experimenting with a colony of narcoleptic dogs had identified the
gene that causes narcolepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, a few weeks later molecular geneticist Masashi
Yanagisawa and his colleagues at the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
announced they had found a closely associated gene in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups of scientists believe their discoveries could soon
lead to an effective treatment for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Narcoleptics are not the only ones for whom the new findings
offer cause for hope. Ultimately millions of Americans, including
everyone who has insomnia or is overweight, could benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping and eating are linked both behaviorally and
evolutionarily. When Yanagisawa found the sleep gene in mice, he
was studying a gene for eating. They turned out to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the identification of the gene could also lead to
the creation of drugs to suppress appetite and fight obesity. Drug
companies are already working on it.
</P>
<P>
   In the faulty gene Mignot and Yanagisawa uncovered, a
straightforward biogenetic mechanism has gone awry. A normal cell
has chemical receptors on its surface that link up with specific
molecules generated by the body and control the timing of such
functions as eating and sleeping. If the receptor genes don't work
(as in narcoleptic dogs), or if the chemical isn't produced (as in
the mice), things go wrong. The challenge is to discover how the
mechanism breaks down in narcoleptic humans and then to develop
drugs that correct it.
</P>
<P>
   Narcolepsy is characterized by extreme daytime sleepiness,
involuntary sleep attacks, paralysis, hallucinations and, in severe
cases, episodes of cataplexy in which a person _ usually in the
grip of strong emotion _ suddenly loses muscle tone and goes limp.
That's what happened to Beau when he sniffed that dog food.
</P>
<P>
   Narcolepsy usually shows itself during adolescence or in the
early 20s, ``a really tough time,'' Mignot notes. ``At an age when
narcoleptics want to conform, they get so excited they fall down.''
</P>
<P>
   In one study of 500 narcoleptics, 85 percent said the disorder
had reduced their job performance, 33 percent said their
medications reduced their sex drive, 15 percent were permanently
disabled and many reported impaired memory and concentration.
</P>
<P>
   In its worst form, the malady can destroy a person's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without medication, I can hardly do anything,'' says Mali
Einen, 38. She discovered she was narcoleptic at age 24 when her
baby daughter, Kelsey, said something funny during a Christmas
celebration. At that moment, Mali suddenly collapsed ``like a
puppet with its strings cut, right into the Christmas tree,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Einen's life has changed. She was a single mom with
a successful career as a hedge-fund money manager. But as her
narcolepsy grew worse, she had increasing difficulty coping with it
at work and at home. Once, passed out and dreaming that someone had
broken into the house, she woke up, dialed 9-1-1 and screamed, then
had to explain what had happened to the police.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't worked or dated in years, and only medication keeps
her alert enough to get through the day. She and Kelsey, now 16,
live alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been lonely,'' she says resignedly. ``Life is lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   What we call narcolepsy was first noted by French physician
Jean-Baptiste Edouard Gelineau in the 1880s. Normal people remain
wakeful during the day, then pass through three stages at night:
wakefulness, non-REM sleep and REM sleep _ in that order. REM
sleep, named for the rapid eye movements that accompany it, is the
dreaming stage of sleep. In narcoleptics, however, REM sleep
arrives out of order. Usually triggered by emotion, it abruptly
follows the wakeful stage, and the person slumps into a waking
dream.
</P>
<P>
   So far, even the best available drugs treat only symptoms.
Amphetamines and other stimulants keep the narcoleptic awake;
antidepressants fight off cataplexy.
</P>
<P>
   Einen took Ritalin for a year, then found she was building a
tolerance to it. So she switched to Dexadrine, an addictive
stimulant she has relied on for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   At night, Einen now takes an experimental drug, gamma
hydroxybutyrate, which she says knocks her into a deep, restorative
sleep, but only for two or three hours. Then she has to get up and
take another dose. ``I still need naps,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mignot's research has shown that dogs inherit narcolepsy much
like human beings do; some siblings get it and some don't. For a
decade, Mignot and his colleagues have scrutinized the dogs' DNA,
comparing it with that of normal littermates until, in 1998, they
narrowed the defect down to a single chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   All the complex set of symptoms that add up to narcolepsy
results from tiny changes in that single gene, a receptor in the
dogs' brains intended to receive molecular signals from chemicals
called hypocretins, also known as orexins.
</P>
<P>
   Think of brain cells as rooms with locks called receptors on
their surfaces and a hypocretin as a key that is also a stimulant.
In a normal animal, the hypocretin hooks up with the lock, opens it
and stimulates it to increase electrical activity _ to be alert.
Without the receptor gene, however, the key won't open the lock and
can't stimulate the brain cell. That's what's wrong in the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In Yanagisawa's mice, the receptor is present but the hypocretin
isn't. In other words, the lock has no key. But the effect is the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be the same in humans? And can we use the information to
help narcoleptics? Mignot thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to find drugs that can replace or block or mimic the
effect of the molecule like hypocretin,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Einen remains positive, grabbing 40 winks
whenever she must during the day. She's easy to spot, she says:
``I'm the weirdo in the Burger King parking lot with the doors
locked and the seat pushed back, taking a nap.''  &QL;

   When Emmanuel Mignot opened the door, a dachshund bounded into
the basement room at Stanford University's Sleep Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, a dozen men and women exchanged nervous
glances. Now they watched as Mignot's associate, Seiji Nishino,
reached for his research tool: a can of dog food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allez Beau teckel!'' said Mignot, a native of Paris, as he
knelt to rub the dog's belly.
</P>
<P>
   Beau seemed an excitable but ordinary dog. His regular food was
dry pellets. But today, Beau would get canned dog food _ a special
treat.
</P>
<P>
   Nishino spooned the wet food onto the floor, and Mignot cooed,
``C'est de la bonne viande.'' Beau perked up, trotted happily to
the food, sniffed, rolled his eyes in pleasurable anticipation _
and dropped to the concrete, limp as an empty sock.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors, members of a narcolepsy support group from
California's East Bay area, awwwwwww-ed in sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic symptoms of narcolepsy, the disorder in
which sleep instantly overwhelms a person during the day, is
collapse triggered by excitement or strong emotions. So what
happened to Beau, a narcoleptic dog, did not surprise the people in
the room.
</P>
<P>
   As a lab researcher with a Ph.D. in molecular pharmacology,
Mignot believes he has finally discovered the key to understanding
narcolepsy. Last August, Mignot announced that he and others
experimenting with a colony of narcoleptic dogs had identified the
gene that causes narcolepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, a few weeks later molecular geneticist Masashi
Yanagisawa and his colleagues at the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
announced they had found a closely associated gene in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups of scientists believe their discoveries could soon
lead to an effective treatment for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Narcoleptics are not the only ones for whom the new findings
offer cause for hope. Ultimately millions of Americans, including
everyone who has insomnia or is overweight, could benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping and eating are linked both behaviorally and
evolutionarily. When Yanagisawa found the sleep gene in mice, he
was studying a gene for eating. They turned out to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the identification of the gene could also lead to
the creation of drugs to suppress appetite and fight obesity. Drug
companies are already working on it.
</P>
<P>
   In the faulty gene Mignot and Yanagisawa uncovered, a
straightforward biogenetic mechanism has gone awry. A normal cell
has chemical receptors on its surface that link up with specific
molecules generated by the body and control the timing of such
functions as eating and sleeping. If the receptor genes don't work
(as in narcoleptic dogs), or if the chemical isn't produced (as in
the mice), things go wrong. The challenge is to discover how the
mechanism breaks down in narcoleptic humans and then to develop
drugs that correct it.
</P>
<P>
   Narcolepsy is characterized by extreme daytime sleepiness,
involuntary sleep attacks, paralysis, hallucinations and, in severe
cases, episodes of cataplexy in which a person _ usually in the
grip of strong emotion _ suddenly loses muscle tone and goes limp.
That's what happened to Beau when he sniffed that dog food.
</P>
<P>
   Narcolepsy usually shows itself during adolescence or in the
early 20s, ``a really tough time,'' Mignot notes. ``At an age when
narcoleptics want to conform, they get so excited they fall down.''
</P>
<P>
   In one study of 500 narcoleptics, 85 percent said the disorder
had reduced their job performance, 33 percent said their
medications reduced their sex drive, 15 percent were permanently
disabled and many reported impaired memory and concentration.
</P>
<P>
   In its worst form, the malady can destroy a person's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without medication, I can hardly do anything,'' says Mali
Einen, 38. She discovered she was narcoleptic at age 24 when her
baby daughter, Kelsey, said something funny during a Christmas
celebration. At that moment, Mali suddenly collapsed ``like a
puppet with its strings cut, right into the Christmas tree,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Einen's life has changed. She was a single mom with
a successful career as a hedge-fund money manager. But as her
narcolepsy grew worse, she had increasing difficulty coping with it
at work and at home. Once, passed out and dreaming that someone had
broken into the house, she woke up, dialed 9-1-1 and screamed, then
had to explain what had happened to the police.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't worked or dated in years, and only medication keeps
her alert enough to get through the day. She and Kelsey, now 16,
live alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been lonely,'' she says resignedly. ``Life is lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   What we call narcolepsy was first noted by French physician
Jean-Baptiste Edouard Gelineau in the 1880s. Normal people remain
wakeful during the day, then pass through three stages at night:
wakefulness, non-REM sleep and REM sleep _ in that order. REM
sleep, named for the rapid eye movements that accompany it, is the
dreaming stage of sleep. In narcoleptics, however, REM sleep
arrives out of order. Usually triggered by emotion, it abruptly
follows the wakeful stage, and the person slumps into a waking
dream.
</P>
<P>
   So far, even the best available drugs treat only symptoms.
Amphetamines and other stimulants keep the narcoleptic awake;
antidepressants fight off cataplexy.
</P>
<P>
   Einen took Ritalin for a year, then found she was building a
tolerance to it. So she switched to Dexadrine, an addictive
stimulant she has relied on for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   At night, Einen now takes an experimental drug, gamma
hydroxybutyrate, which she says knocks her into a deep, restorative
sleep, but only for two or three hours. Then she has to get up and
take another dose. ``I still need naps,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mignot's research has shown that dogs inherit narcolepsy much
like human beings do; some siblings get it and some don't. For a
decade, Mignot and his colleagues have scrutinized the dogs' DNA,
comparing it with that of normal littermates until, in 1998, they
narrowed the defect down to a single chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   All the complex set of symptoms that add up to narcolepsy
results from tiny changes in that single gene, a receptor in the
dogs' brains intended to receive molecular signals from chemicals
called hypocretins, also known as orexins.
</P>
<P>
   Think of brain cells as rooms with locks called receptors on
their surfaces and a hypocretin as a key that is also a stimulant.
In a normal animal, the hypocretin hooks up with the lock, opens it
and stimulates it to increase electrical activity _ to be alert.
Without the receptor gene, however, the key won't open the lock and
can't stimulate the brain cell. That's what's wrong in the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In Yanagisawa's mice, the receptor is present but the hypocretin
isn't. In other words, the lock has no key. But the effect is the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be the same in humans? And can we use the information to
help narcoleptics? Mignot thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to find drugs that can replace or block or mimic the
effect of the molecule like hypocretin,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Einen remains positive, grabbing 40 winks
whenever she must during the day. She's easy to spot, she says:
``I'm the weirdo in the Burger King parking lot with the doors
locked and the seat pushed back, taking a nap.''  &QL;

<P>
   When he's not dashing down the fast lane at a track meet or
practice, 22-year-old sprinter Rahim Sajan runs for the sake of
science.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Calgary's Human Performance Laboratory, he
stands patiently, one hairy and muscular leg extended, while small
silver balls are taped to strategic sites near his hip, knee and
ankle joints.
</P>
<P>
   Today Sajan will be testing three different pairs of prototype
running shoes fitted with three different soles. As he runs the
length of a 30-meter track, the reflective balls will help video
cameras capture the movement of his joints.
</P>
<P>
   A steel platform embedded in the track's floor will measure the
force exerted when his feet touch down. Then he'll be wired for
treadmill testing, with electrodes like little metal buttons
recording the electrical signals going to his leg muscles as he
runs.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the research is to determine which sole aids his
performance most while protecting him from injury. So far, the
results are leaving common assumptions about running shoes in the
dust.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, for example, that the impact generated during
running is not nearly as damaging as was once thought. A good
running shoe should support the natural alignment of the feet and
legs, rather than correct it. And the lesson for picking the best
shoe for you boils down to this: If it feels good, wear it. That
advice is simple, the biomechanics supporting it is not.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Calgary team is physicist-turned-biomechanist
Benno Nigg. A longtime member of the International Olympic
Committee Medical Commission, Nigg set out to build better running
shoes back when they were still called sneakers. His earlier ideas
helped establish the prevailing belief that the main functions of
running shoes should be to properly align the legs and feet and to
cushion the impact of a heel-toe stride.
</P>
<P>
   But Nigg has since come to question these prescriptions. His
doubts began when he set out to prove that the jarring impact of
running on hard surfaces is a major cause of injury. In fact, he
and others doing similar studies found no relation between the
magnitude of impact forces and the injury rate in runners.
</P>
<P>
   Fast runners, for example, land with two or three times the
force of slower runners, yet in Nigg's studies they were injured no
more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Running on hard surfaces doesn't result in more injuries than
running on soft surfaces. And if the impact from running was
stressful to joints, degenerative joint diseases such as
osteoarthritis would presumably be more common in runners than in
nonrunners. They aren't.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Nigg's studies show that joints are taxed most not
at the moment of initial impact but by the stress on the foot as
the runner's weight rolls from the heel toward the toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces during midstance and takeoff are about three to
five times higher than the forces during landing,'' Nigg says. Thus
he concludes that impact has been unfairly blamed. ``There may be
certain cases where impact produces an injury, but it's not an
epidemic, which the sports-medicine world and the fitness world and
the shoe producers thought was the case. And we thought it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet runners do get hurt; two-thirds of serious runners can
expect to sustain an injury in any given year. And no one would
dispute that cushioned shoes feel better than brogans for a jog
around the park.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes one shoe better than another? Nigg believes the
answer lies in the muscle activation that not only keeps a runner's
posture stable but also counters vibrations of the soft tissue in
the body when a runner's heel strikes the ground. Studies like the
one in which Sajan takes part have shown that muscles tense up in
order to reduce these soft-tissue vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   Studies that correlate muscle activation with both comfort and
oxygen consumption show that the more work the muscles have to do
to minimize soft-tissue vibrations, the less comfortable and more
exhausting running will be.
</P>
<P>
   But Nigg also found that higher impact doesn't necessarily
create more work for the muscles. That's because soft-tissue
vibrations occur at different frequencies in different people, just
as guitar strings of different lengths and diameters resonate at
different frequencies when plucked in the same manner.
</P>
<P>
   In people, the preferred frequencies depend largely on body
weight and muscle tone. So the problem for runners is not so much
the initial force of the impact as its effects on soft tissue.
Running in a particular pair of shoes can amplify the natural
vibrations, and the runner's muscles must work harder to counteract
them.
</P>
<P>
   The cushioning in running shoes can help or hinder how the
body's muscles respond _ or, in Nigg's words, ``tune'' _ by
shifting impact frequencies away from or toward the frequency at
which an individual's soft tissue naturally wants to resonate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why different people like different shoes,'' Nigg says.
``You can tune yourself to a certain shoe. Or you can choose a shoe
that you don't have to tune too much.''
</P>
<P>
   With the right shoe, the difference in performance, he says,
``is up to 5 percent _ that's eight minutes in a marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on his findings, Nigg proposes that injuries result when
too much muscle energy is taken up with the task of countering
vibrations rather than with running.
</P>
<P>
   Proper alignment is important, too, but Nigg's ideas about
what's proper have changed since the 1970s. Thirty years ago, he
pioneered the dual-density midsole, a layer of cushioning that is
harder on the inner part of the arch and softer on the outer part,
which helps correct the excessive inward rolling of the foot,
called overpronation, that plagues as many as half of all runners.
Dual-density midsoles have become a standard feature of
high-performance shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of a single model of ideal movement _ the concept
that put a dual-density midsole in every shoe _ Nigg's research
suggests that each body has its own preferred pattern of motion,
which is revealed when a person is running barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   Muscles will fight to maintain that template of barefoot
movement if shoes counteract it, Nigg says. But shoes that promote
barefoot alignment will greatly lessen the load on muscles,
improving comfort and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Working from these conclusions, Nigg and his colleagues have
assailed another standard feature of running shoes: the toe spring,
or raised forefront. Toe springs were thought to help the foot rock
forward during a stride, but they may actually impede takeoff by
immobilizing the joints at the ball of the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Nigg's main goal now is to persuade companies to group their
shoe models according to parameters such as degree of cushioning,
dynamic alignment and shape, so that consumers who have found a
model that works for them can easily spot other new or existing
models with the same properties.
</P>
<P>
   Although his colleagues are skeptical, Nigg says, the grouping
system has been well received by shoe manufacturers and could show
up on shelves within five years. Stay tuned. &QL;

   One of the most dramatic symptoms of narcolepsy, the disorder in
which sleep instantly overwhelms a person during the day, is
collapse triggered by excitement or strong emotions. So what
happened to Beau, a narcoleptic dog, did not surprise the people in
the room.
</P>
<P>
   As a lab researcher with a Ph.D. in molecular pharmacology,
Mignot believes he has finally discovered the key to understanding
narcolepsy. Last August, Mignot announced that he and others
experimenting with a colony of narcoleptic dogs had identified the
gene that causes narcolepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, a few weeks later molecular geneticist Masashi
Yanagisawa and his colleagues at the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
announced they had found a closely associated gene in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups of scientists believe their discoveries could soon
lead to an effective treatment for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Narcoleptics are not the only ones for whom the new findings
offer cause for hope. Ultimately millions of Americans, including
everyone who has insomnia or is overweight, could benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping and eating are linked both behaviorally and
evolutionarily. When Yanagisawa found the sleep gene in mice, he
was studying a gene for eating. They turned out to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the identification of the gene could also lead to
the creation of drugs to suppress appetite and fight obesity. Drug
companies are already working on it.
</P>
<P>
   In the faulty gene Mignot and Yanagisawa uncovered, a
straightforward biogenetic mechanism has gone awry. A normal cell
has chemical receptors on its surface that link up with specific
molecules generated by the body and control the timing of such
functions as eating and sleeping. If the receptor genes don't work
(as in narcoleptic dogs), or if the chemical isn't produced (as in
the mice), things go wrong. The challenge is to discover how the
mechanism breaks down in narcoleptic humans and then to develop
drugs that correct it.
</P>
<P>
   Narcolepsy is characterized by extreme daytime sleepiness,
involuntary sleep attacks, paralysis, hallucinations and, in severe
cases, episodes of cataplexy in which a person _ usually in the
grip of strong emotion _ suddenly loses muscle tone and goes limp.
That's what happened to Beau when he sniffed that dog food.
</P>
<P>
   Narcolepsy usually shows itself during adolescence or in the
early 20s, ``a really tough time,'' Mignot notes. ``At an age when
narcoleptics want to conform, they get so excited they fall down.''
</P>
<P>
   In one study of 500 narcoleptics, 85 percent said the disorder
had reduced their job performance, 33 percent said their
medications reduced their sex drive, 15 percent were permanently
disabled and many reported impaired memory and concentration.
</P>
<P>
   In its worst form, the malady can destroy a person's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without medication, I can hardly do anything,'' says Mali
Einen, 38. She discovered she was narcoleptic at age 24 when her
baby daughter, Kelsey, said something funny during a Christmas
celebration. At that moment, Mali suddenly collapsed ``like a
puppet with its strings cut, right into the Christmas tree,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Einen's life has changed. She was a single mom with
a successful career as a hedge-fund money manager. But as her
narcolepsy grew worse, she had increasing difficulty coping with it
at work and at home. Once, passed out and dreaming that someone had
broken into the house, she woke up, dialed 9-1-1 and screamed, then
had to explain what had happened to the police.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't worked or dated in years, and only medication keeps
her alert enough to get through the day. She and Kelsey, now 16,
live alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been lonely,'' she says resignedly. ``Life is lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   What we call narcolepsy was first noted by French physician
Jean-Baptiste Edouard Gelineau in the 1880s. Normal people remain
wakeful during the day, then pass through three stages at night:
wakefulness, non-REM sleep and REM sleep _ in that order. REM
sleep, named for the rapid eye movements that accompany it, is the
dreaming stage of sleep. In narcoleptics, however, REM sleep
arrives out of order. Usually triggered by emotion, it abruptly
follows the wakeful stage, and the person slumps into a waking
dream.
</P>
<P>
   So far, even the best available drugs treat only symptoms.
Amphetamines and other stimulants keep the narcoleptic awake;
antidepressants fight off cataplexy.
</P>
<P>
   Einen took Ritalin for a year, then found she was building a
tolerance to it. So she switched to Dexadrine, an addictive
stimulant she has relied on for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   At night, Einen now takes an experimental drug, gamma
hydroxybutyrate, which she says knocks her into a deep, restorative
sleep, but only for two or three hours. Then she has to get up and
take another dose. ``I still need naps,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mignot's research has shown that dogs inherit narcolepsy much
like human beings do; some siblings get it and some don't. For a
decade, Mignot and his colleagues have scrutinized the dogs' DNA,
comparing it with that of normal littermates until, in 1998, they
narrowed the defect down to a single chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   All the complex set of symptoms that add up to narcolepsy
results from tiny changes in that single gene, a receptor in the
dogs' brains intended to receive molecular signals from chemicals
called hypocretins, also known as orexins.
</P>
<P>
   Think of brain cells as rooms with locks called receptors on
their surfaces and a hypocretin as a key that is also a stimulant.
In a normal animal, the hypocretin hooks up with the lock, opens it
and stimulates it to increase electrical activity _ to be alert.
Without the receptor gene, however, the key won't open the lock and
can't stimulate the brain cell. That's what's wrong in the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In Yanagisawa's mice, the receptor is present but the hypocretin
isn't. In other words, the lock has no key. But the effect is the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be the same in humans? And can we use the information to
help narcoleptics? Mignot thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to find drugs that can replace or block or mimic the
effect of the molecule like hypocretin,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Einen remains positive, grabbing 40 winks
whenever she must during the day. She's easy to spot, she says:
``I'm the weirdo in the Burger King parking lot with the doors
locked and the seat pushed back, taking a nap.''  &QL;

   When Emmanuel Mignot opened the door, a dachshund bounded into
the basement room at Stanford University's Sleep Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, a dozen men and women exchanged nervous
glances. Now they watched as Mignot's associate, Seiji Nishino,
reached for his research tool: a can of dog food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allez Beau teckel!'' said Mignot, a native of Paris, as he
knelt to rub the dog's belly.
</P>
<P>
   Beau seemed an excitable but ordinary dog. His regular food was
dry pellets. But today, Beau would get canned dog food _ a special
treat.
</P>
<P>
   Nishino spooned the wet food onto the floor, and Mignot cooed,
``C'est de la bonne viande.'' Beau perked up, trotted happily to
the food, sniffed, rolled his eyes in pleasurable anticipation _
and dropped to the concrete, limp as an empty sock.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors, members of a narcolepsy support group from
California's East Bay area, awwwwwww-ed in sympathy.

<P>
   When he's not dashing down the fast lane at a track meet or
practice, 22-year-old sprinter Rahim Sajan runs for the sake of
science.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Calgary's Human Performance Laboratory, he
stands patiently, one hairy and muscular leg extended, while small
silver balls are taped to strategic sites near his hip, knee and
ankle joints.
</P>
<P>
   Today Sajan will be testing three different pairs of prototype
running shoes fitted with three different soles. As he runs the
length of a 30-meter track, the reflective balls will help video
cameras capture the movement of his joints.
</P>
<P>
   A steel platform embedded in the track's floor will measure the
force exerted when his feet touch down. Then he'll be wired for
treadmill testing, with electrodes like little metal buttons
recording the electrical signals going to his leg muscles as he
runs.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the research is to determine which sole aids his
performance most while protecting him from injury. So far, the
results are leaving common assumptions about running shoes in the
dust.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, for example, that the impact generated during
running is not nearly as damaging as was once thought. A good
running shoe should support the natural alignment of the feet and
legs, rather than correct it. And the lesson for picking the best
shoe for you boils down to this: If it feels good, wear it. That
advice is simple, the biomechanics supporting it is not.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Calgary team is physicist-turned-biomechanist
Benno Nigg. A longtime member of the International Olympic
Committee Medical Commission, Nigg set out to build better running
shoes back when they were still called sneakers. His earlier ideas
helped establish the prevailing belief that the main functions of
running shoes should be to properly align the legs and feet and to
cushion the impact of a heel-toe stride.
</P>
<P>
   But Nigg has since come to question these prescriptions. His
doubts began when he set out to prove that the jarring impact of
running on hard surfaces is a major cause of injury. In fact, he
and others doing similar studies found no relation between the
magnitude of impact forces and the injury rate in runners.
</P>
<P>
   Fast runners, for example, land with two or three times the
force of slower runners, yet in Nigg's studies they were injured no
more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Running on hard surfaces doesn't result in more injuries than
running on soft surfaces. And if the impact from running was
stressful to joints, degenerative joint diseases such as
osteoarthritis would presumably be more common in runners than in
nonrunners. They aren't.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Nigg's studies show that joints are taxed most not
at the moment of initial impact but by the stress on the foot as
the runner's weight rolls from the heel toward the toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces during midstance and takeoff are about three to
five times higher than the forces during landing,'' Nigg says. Thus
he concludes that impact has been unfairly blamed. ``There may be
certain cases where impact produces an injury, but it's not an
epidemic, which the sports-medicine world and the fitness world and
the shoe producers thought was the case. And we thought it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet runners do get hurt; two-thirds of serious runners can
expect to sustain an injury in any given year. And no one would
dispute that cushioned shoes feel better than brogans for a jog
around the park.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes one shoe better than another? Nigg believes the
answer lies in the muscle activation that not only keeps a runner's
posture stable but also counters vibrations of the soft tissue in
the body when a runner's heel strikes the ground. Studies like the
one in which Sajan takes part have shown that muscles tense up in
order to reduce these soft-tissue vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   Studies that correlate muscle activation with both comfort and
oxygen consumption show that the more work the muscles have to do
to minimize soft-tissue vibrations, the less comfortable and more
exhausting running will be.
</P>
<P>
   But Nigg also found that higher impact doesn't necessarily
create more work for the muscles. That's because soft-tissue
vibrations occur at different frequencies in different people, just
as guitar strings of different lengths and diameters resonate at
different frequencies when plucked in the same manner.
</P>
<P>
   In people, the preferred frequencies depend largely on body
weight and muscle tone. So the problem for runners is not so much
the initial force of the impact as its effects on soft tissue.
Running in a particular pair of shoes can amplify the natural
vibrations, and the runner's muscles must work harder to counteract
them.
</P>
<P>
   The cushioning in running shoes can help or hinder how the
body's muscles respond _ or, in Nigg's words, ``tune'' _ by
shifting impact frequencies away from or toward the frequency at
which an individual's soft tissue naturally wants to resonate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why different people like different shoes,'' Nigg says.
``You can tune yourself to a certain shoe. Or you can choose a shoe
that you don't have to tune too much.''
</P>
<P>
   With the right shoe, the difference in performance, he says,
``is up to 5 percent _ that's eight minutes in a marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on his findings, Nigg proposes that injuries result when
too much muscle energy is taken up with the task of countering
vibrations rather than with running.
</P>
<P>
   Proper alignment is important, too, but Nigg's ideas about
what's proper have changed since the 1970s. Thirty years ago, he
pioneered the dual-density midsole, a layer of cushioning that is
harder on the inner part of the arch and softer on the outer part,
which helps correct the excessive inward rolling of the foot,
called overpronation, that plagues as many as half of all runners.
Dual-density midsoles have become a standard feature of
high-performance shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of a single model of ideal movement _ the concept
that put a dual-density midsole in every shoe _ Nigg's research
suggests that each body has its own preferred pattern of motion,
which is revealed when a person is running barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   Muscles will fight to maintain that template of barefoot
movement if shoes counteract it, Nigg says. But shoes that promote
barefoot alignment will greatly lessen the load on muscles,
improving comfort and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Working from these conclusions, Nigg and his colleagues have
assailed another standard feature of running shoes: the toe spring,
or raised forefront. Toe springs were thought to help the foot rock
forward during a stride, but they may actually impede takeoff by
immobilizing the joints at the ball of the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Nigg's main goal now is to persuade companies to group their
shoe models according to parameters such as degree of cushioning,
dynamic alignment and shape, so that consumers who have found a
model that works for them can easily spot other new or existing
models with the same properties.
</P>
<P>
   Although his colleagues are skeptical, Nigg says, the grouping
system has been well received by shoe manufacturers and could show
up on shelves within five years. Stay tuned. &QL;

   The leader of the Calgary team is physicist-turned-biomechanist
Benno Nigg. A longtime member of the International Olympic
Committee Medical Commission, Nigg set out to build better running
shoes back when they were still called sneakers. His earlier ideas
helped establish the prevailing belief that the main functions of
running shoes should be to properly align the legs and feet and to
cushion the impact of a heel-toe stride.
</P>
<P>
   But Nigg has since come to question these prescriptions. His
doubts began when he set out to prove that the jarring impact of
running on hard surfaces is a major cause of injury. In fact, he
and others doing similar studies found no relation between the
magnitude of impact forces and the injury rate in runners.
</P>
<P>
   Fast runners, for example, land with two or three times the
force of slower runners, yet in Nigg's studies they were injured no
more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Running on hard surfaces doesn't result in more injuries than
running on soft surfaces. And if the impact from running was
stressful to joints, degenerative joint diseases such as
osteoarthritis would presumably be more common in runners than in
nonrunners. They aren't.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Nigg's studies show that joints are taxed most not
at the moment of initial impact but by the stress on the foot as
the runner's weight rolls from the heel toward the toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces during midstance and takeoff are about three to
five times higher than the forces during landing,'' Nigg says. Thus
he concludes that impact has been unfairly blamed. ``There may be
certain cases where impact produces an injury, but it's not an
epidemic, which the sports-medicine world and the fitness world and
the shoe producers thought was the case. And we thought it too.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet runners do get hurt; two-thirds of serious runners can
expect to sustain an injury in any given year. And no one would
dispute that cushioned shoes feel better than brogans for a jog
around the park.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes one shoe better than another? Nigg believes the
answer lies in the muscle activation that not only keeps a runner's
posture stable but also counters vibrations of the soft tissue in
the body when a runner's heel strikes the ground. Studies like the
one in which Sajan takes part have shown that muscles tense up in
order to reduce these soft-tissue vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   Studies that correlate muscle activation with both comfort and
oxygen consumption show that the more work the muscles have to do
to minimize soft-tissue vibrations, the less comfortable and more
exhausting running will be.
</P>
<P>
   But Nigg also found that higher impact doesn't necessarily
create more work for the muscles. That's because soft-tissue
vibrations occur at different frequencies in different people, just
as guitar strings of different lengths and diameters resonate at
different frequencies when plucked in the same manner.
</P>
<P>
   In people, the preferred frequencies depend largely on body
weight and muscle tone. So the problem for runners is not so much
the initial force of the impact as its effects on soft tissue.
Running in a particular pair of shoes can amplify the natural
vibrations, and the runner's muscles must work harder to counteract
them.
</P>
<P>
   The cushioning in running shoes can help or hinder how the
body's muscles respond _ or, in Nigg's words, ``tune'' _ by
shifting impact frequencies away from or toward the frequency at
which an individual's soft tissue naturally wants to resonate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why different people like different shoes,'' Nigg says.
``You can tune yourself to a certain shoe. Or you can choose a shoe
that you don't have to tune too much.''
</P>
<P>
   With the right shoe, the difference in performance, he says,
``is up to 5 percent _ that's eight minutes in a marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on his findings, Nigg proposes that injuries result when
too much muscle energy is taken up with the task of countering
vibrations rather than with running.
</P>
<P>
   Proper alignment is important, too, but Nigg's ideas about
what's proper have changed since the 1970s. Thirty years ago, he
pioneered the dual-density midsole, a layer of cushioning that is
harder on the inner part of the arch and softer on the outer part,
which helps correct the excessive inward rolling of the foot,
called overpronation, that plagues as many as half of all runners.
Dual-density midsoles have become a standard feature of
high-performance shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of a single model of ideal movement _ the concept
that put a dual-density midsole in every shoe _ Nigg's research
suggests that each body has its own preferred pattern of motion,
which is revealed when a person is running barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   Muscles will fight to maintain that template of barefoot
movement if shoes counteract it, Nigg says. But shoes that promote
barefoot alignment will greatly lessen the load on muscles,
improving comfort and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Working from these conclusions, Nigg and his colleagues have
assailed another standard feature of running shoes: the toe spring,
or raised forefront. Toe springs were thought to help the foot rock
forward during a stride, but they may actually impede takeoff by
immobilizing the joints at the ball of the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Nigg's main goal now is to persuade companies to group their
shoe models according to parameters such as degree of cushioning,
dynamic alignment and shape, so that consumers who have found a
model that works for them can easily spot other new or existing
models with the same properties.
</P>
<P>
   Although his colleagues are skeptical, Nigg says, the grouping
system has been well received by shoe manufacturers and could show
up on shelves within five years. Stay tuned. &QL;

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER  
 &HT;    Now's the time to consider a late winter sports vacation to
Utah. From Feb. 8 to 24, 2002, the Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Winter
Games will be off and running.
 &HT;    According to the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, more than 3,500
athletes will compete in seven sports and 70 medal events. The
committee has likened hosting the 17-day XIX Olympic Winter Games
to presenting 17 consecutive Super Bowls.
 &HT;    But why go now? While the estimated 1.7 million tickets for the
Games won't go on sale until the fall of 2000, many of the
facilities have already been built and the race courses laid out.
 &HT;    Smart skiers and snowboarders can book a ski vacation in Utah
this season and sample the legendary Wasatch Mountain snow on
uncrowded Olympic courses. Adventurous souls can ride a bobsled 74
mph down the Olympic bobsleigh track or attempt to ski jump.
 &HT;    Salt Lake City is an ideal geographic location for Olympic
events, with nine major ski resorts within an hour's drive of the
city center, the hub of the Games.
 &HT;    Start with Park City, which is less than 45 minutes from Salt
Lake City. This is Utah's premier ski town, a place that still
bears traces of its mining past. The action today, however, can be
found in the trendy restaurants, bars and shops along Main Street.
 &HT;    The Park City Mountain Resort, which bills itself as having
``The Greatest Snow on Earth,'' will host the men's and women's
giant slalom events, as well as snowboarding. For more information,
contact Park City Mountain Resort, P.O. Box 39, Park City, Utah
84060; (800) 222-PARK; www.parkcitymountain.com.
 &HT;    A few minutes away is Deer Valley, the most luxurious ski resort
in Utah, famed for its immaculate snow grooming, fine lodging and
good dining. Four Olympic alpine skiing events will be held here:
the men's and women's slaloms and combined slaloms.
 &HT;    The black-diamond run, called ``Know You Don't,'' will be the
site of the slalom races, while ``Big Stick'' is the choice for the
combined slalom.
 &HT;    Arguably the most exciting event in the Olympics will be held
here as well, the freestyle-skiing competitions of aerials and
moguls. For more information, contact Deer Valley Resort, P.O. Box
1525, Park City, Utah 84060; (800) 558-3337; www.deervalley.com.
 &HT;    Close to Park City is the Utah Winter Sports Park, a 387-acre
facility that will host the bobsleigh, luge, skeleton, ski jumping
and Nordic combined. The skeleton competition is aptly named, since
competitors board a narrow sled that is really just the frame of a
stripped-down bobsled. Riders go headfirst down the icy bobsleigh
track at close to 80 mph.
 &HT;    The 1,335-meter bobsleigh/luge track has five start areas and is
one of only 12 competition-certified ``refrigeration tracks'' in
the world.
 &HT;    In addition to watching American hopefuls practice on the
bobsleigh and luge, a singular highlight is watching others try out
skeleton, which has only twice before been an Olympic sport.
 &HT;    Better yet, amateur bobsleigh enthusiasts can take a ride on the
track. Two guests at a time can ride in a four-man bobsled,
accompanied by a driver and a brakeman. The cost is $125 per person
and reservations are required. Rides on a training device called a
Rocket are $27 per person.
 &HT;    Nordic ski jumping at the Utah Winter Sports Park is available
to the public, but the jumps are not the official Olympic jumps.
Instead, participants use the K-10 meter, K-20 meter and K-40 meter
ski jumps. These jumps are designed so that the jumper is never
more than two feet off the snow.
 &HT;    The Winter Sports Park claims that this is the only public
jumping facility in North America, if not the world. The cost is
$30 for adults, $20 for youths ages 13 to 17, and $15 for those
under age 12. The price includes instruction and a helmet. For more
information, contact the Utah Winter Sports Park, P.O. Box 980337,
Park City, Utah 84098; (435) 658-4200;
http://www.slc2002.org/sports/uwsp_frame.html.
 &HT;    Northwest of Park City, near the city of Ogden, the Snowbasin
Ski Area is the site of six Olympic events, including the men's and
women's downhill, combined downhill and super G races.
 &HT;    The men's downhill course was designed by Olympic Gold medalist
Bernard Russi. It has a vertical drop of 2,770 feet that is
expected to generate race speeds of more than 90 miles per hour.
 &HT;    Amateur skiers can enjoy the vertigo-inducing course at much
slower speeds, of course. And they can enjoy Snowbasin, one of the
great hidden secrets of Utah skiing.
 &HT;    While a new base area for the Olympic Games is being built, this
ski area still has an old-fashioned mom-and-pop feel to it. It's a
large, challenging and uncrowded mountain beloved by Ogden locals,
and the views that stretch into neighboring Nevada and Wyoming are
a bonus. For more information, contact Snowbasin, P.O. Box 460,
Huntsville, Utah 84317; (801) 399-1135; www.snowbasin.com).
 &HT;    For more information about wintertime fun in this part of the
country, contact Ski Utah, 150 West 500 South, Salt Lake City, Utah
84101; (800) 754-8824; www.skiutah.com.
 &HT;    For updates on the Olympic Games, contact the Salt Lake City
Organizing Committee, 257 East 200 South, Salt Lake City, Utah
84111; (801) 212-2002; www.slc2002.org.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: A good crop of character
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Deniece L. Barker
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Sudan, a small West Texas town where tumbleweeds
still tumble and antelopes still roam today.
</P>
<P>
   It's a town where farmers crawl into their weather-beaten pickup
trucks and putter snail-like into town down the narrow, two-lane
blacktop, their brake lights flickering on and off as they
carefully survey the crops that line both sides of the road.
</P>
<P>
   When the farmer sees an oncoming vehicle, he lifts a dry, crusty
forefinger off the steering wheel, then places it back down again _
his way of saying howdy to both friends and strangers alike.
</P>
<P>
   My grandpa was one of those farmers, and like the others, he too
was bound to the rich, dry ground through a type of marriage
whispered between him and God _ a marriage of pure determination,
wit and perseverance pitted against the forces of nature.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hard, grueling role, but one that my grandpa embraced
proudly and one that he proclaimed not only for himself but for his
entire family.
</P>
<P>
   Like any child, I was unaware of his struggles to make a good
crop year after year. But as I grew older, I began to see traces of
those struggles in his sun-baked face and the wrinkles buried deep
into his tired old skin.
</P>
<P>
   I could see them in the calluses that came from a lifetime of
wrapping his hands around a hoe handle as he walked up and down
each row, whacking down weeds that grew too close to the
vulnerable, undeveloped cotton.
</P>
<P>
   I saw them in his posture, a crooked spine from years of bending
and picking up irrigation pipes, then placing them back down again
just two rows over, day after back-breaking day.
</P>
<P>
   And when the storms blew in with hail the size of golf balls,
dropping like boulders from the blackened sky, I could see the
despair that would well up in his eyes, his precious crop a mangled
mess of leaves, stalks and cotton bolls floating on the soaked
ground.
</P>
<P>
   But there was tenacity in his walk as he sloshed through the
muddy rubble, surveying the destruction, and he didn't give up.
</P>
<P>
   No, my grandpa simply nursed what was left _ and for his
efforts, God rewarded him with a small but adequate crop.
</P>
<P>
   Only now at middle age do I realize the depth of those struggles
and fully appreciate the legacy my grandpa left me.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded deep inside, I embrace pride, strength, courage and,
above all, tenacity, which I'll cherish forever.

TRANSFER $100,000 TO BALANCE THIS PORTFOLIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. My wife and I believe our pensions and Social Security will
provide adequate living expenses in retirement. The listed holdings
are only a security blanket. Should we reduce the mortgage debt
with funds from the above? Is our portfolio balanced? Should we
reduce some holdings, or add a bond fund? When we reach the age of
mandatory IRA withdrawals, which funds should we start with? Should
we invest discretionary money in additional funds or more secure
CDs?
</P>
<P>
   T.L., Escondido, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A. You don't identify which Hotchkis and Wiley funds you hold,
but even so, you have a little less than 86 percent of your IRA
portfolio in three large-cap domestic funds: Fidelity's Magellan
and Contrafund, and the Janus fund. I'd cut that to about 50
percent, which would mean transferring $100,000 to other funds.
</P>
<P>
   Staying within your current fund families, I suggest you allot
that $100,000 evenly among three funds that will improve your
portfolio balance: Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock, Fidelity Select Health
Care, and Janus Venture (a small-cap fund).
</P>
<P>
   Since you will not be calling on the IRA money in the
foreseeable future, I see no particular need to add bonds. But if
your view of a security blanket is a portfolio that's going to
provide a smoother ride, reacting less to sour markets, then you
might consider substituting Fidelity Puritan for Janus Venture.
That would do less to diversify the portfolio, but it would give
you a little more exposure to bonds than the two high-yield funds
you now hold. It would also reduce the risk in my initial
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Even though you are comfortable financially, I suggest you keep
the CD account as an emergency backup, perhaps moving $5,000 to a
fund such as Fidelity Cash Reserves. Its check-writing privilege
will provide liquidity, without any penalties.
</P>
<P>
   As for where to invest any excess funds, that's where I would
bring the mortgage into play _ prepaying against the mortgage as
surplus funds become available.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a retired lawyer. My wife and I own winter and summer
homes valued at approximately $600,000. Our goal is to earn about
$35,000 to supplement Social Security. Lately, the two American
funds, for which we paid $100,000, have dropped about 12 percent,
and I am concerned that higher interest rates will further deplete
these accounts. How can we achieve our goal without great risk?
</P>
<P>
   C.S., Dover, N.H. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I calculate the annual yield from your portfolio at $29,037 _
not counting the unspecified IRA and the nearly negligible
dividends from your common stock. Whatever the current IRA holding,
you could move it to a GNMA fund in which you could expect it to
contribute another $3,900, based on an assumed 6.5 percent yield.
You also could swap your position in American Balanced fund, which
yields 3.67 percent, for additional shares in Income Fund of
America, which has a 5.4 percent yield, thereby adding $808 to your
income stream. That would take you to $33,745.
</P>
<P>
   To make up the final $1,255, you could follow one of two
strategies:
</P>
<P>
   Convert about $20,000 of your common stock holdings to the
fixed-income side. Another strategy _ one I usually don't endorse _
is to simply sell $1,255 worth of common stock each year. My
typical reluctance involves people who are counting on capital
gains from the stock market to supply a large part of their income.
In your case, the amount is fairly small, and since this is the one
segment of your portfolio which should bring you significant
long-term gains, I'd rather that you sell only enough to make up
that $1,255 each year, rather than sell a larger chunk to add to
the fixed-income side.
</P>
<P>
   I presumed that your money market holding is a mutual fund
account rather than a bank's; therefore, I estimated a 5 percent
yield. If that's not the case, I would quickly make it the case.
Typically, mutual fund money market accounts pay about double the
yield of average bank money market accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Next, don't be discouraged about the two American funds. Both
hold conservative value-oriented portfolios, and value is one
market segment which has been pounded lately. (And of course bonds,
which make up most of the rest of their portfolios, is another
market segment that's been unpopular lately.) But both funds have
solid long-term records. I wouldn't sell either because of recent
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you have a disproportionate amount of your assets in
real estate. You certainly could get yourself into a much sounder
long-term situation if you sold one of your residences. Selling
real estate would not only provide some growth capital, it would
also lower your tax burden, thus reducing the amount you will need
to live on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I contribute 12 percent of my salary to my company's 401(k).
How much can I expect to have at 65, and how can I improve my
investment allocations to maximize my retirement portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   T.F., Woburn, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm a little confused about the $59,271 in the income fund,
and am hoping that it's a typo _ and that the money is actually
invested in Fidelity Equity-Income fund. If it is indeed in an
income fund, I would move it immediately. You're simply too young
to have the lion's share of your retirement savings in a
fixed-income holding.
</P>
<P>
   If I were selecting a portfolio from among those available in
your plan, I would put 20 percent in Fidelity Growth Company, 40
percent in Fidelity US Equity Index, and 20 percent each in
Fidelity Low-Priced Stock and Templeton Foreign. If you developed
such a portfolio, contributing $860 a month for 16 years and
realized average annual portfolio growth of 10 percent, you would
end up with $715,260 in the 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, if your IRA remained in a money market account, you
might expect it to grow to a further $29,761 after 16 years. On the
other hand, if you followed my strong advice that you move the
money to stock mutual funds, it would amount to $62,647, based on a
projection of 10 percent annual returns.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to use this money to make a couple of
sector plays, dividing it evenly between Fidelity Select Health
Care and Fidelity Select Computers. Both of these funds have fairly
high risk levels, but both operate in sectors that provide a lot of
opportunity, and if you stick with them for 16 years, the odds
appear good that the 10 percent growth projection will prove
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think even that's too risky, you still should get out
of the money market account. If you're looking for a conservative
home for the IRA, but one that will still give you a fair prospect
for some growth, you might look at Fidelity Puritan fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Money Musings: I have been watching somewhat bemusedly a
takeover fight involving Dexter Corp., of Windsor Locks, Conn., in
which my daughters have small interests. Dexter, which has been so
sound asleep for a decade or so that I wince when I remember that
it was I who bought the stock, is being wooed by International
Specialty Products of Wayne, N.J. Dexter makes much of the fact
that ISP has not specified how it proposes to finance its $45 per
share cash tender offer. I cannot fathom why Dexter stockholders
should care, provided ISP's checks don't bounce. The battle seems
to demonstrate the argument that stock markets are efficient _ when
managements don't produce for a long time, stockholders get the
small consolation of a buyout. The current management, after all,
will get the more substantial consolation of their golden
parachutes.

CASE FOR REPARATIONS TO BLACKS IS PROFOUND BUT WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are black Americans owed reparations for the 240 years that
their forebears were enslaved in this country? Some people have
always said so, but the claim has never been taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is going to change. Last week, two of the
best-known black men on Harvard's faculty enlisted in the
reparations crusade. Law professsor Charles Ogletree Jr. told The
Boston Globe that he and Henry Louis Gates Jr., the chairman of
Harvard's Afro-American Studies Department, as well as several
other intellectuals, are assessing ``the viability'' of demanding
payment for the long generations of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Their announcement comes shortly after the publication of ``The
Debt: What America Owes to Blacks,'' a passionate brief in favor of
reparations by Randall Robinson, the founder of TransAfrica. An
issue that has always been relegated to the political fringe is
beginning to draw the spotlight of mainstream attention.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the descendants of slaves should be compensated
isn't clear even to those who favor the idea. Ideas run the gamut
from a government check for each black family to free college
tuition for needy black students. Nor do the advocates agree on the
best way to press their demand. Some talk of a class-action
lawsuit. Others support a bill, annually introduced by John
Conyers, a Detroit congressman, that would set up a federal
commission on reparations.
</P>
<P>
   But the details are beside the point, Ogletree says. ``This is
not a situation of someone sitting at the mailbox waiting for a
check,'' he told the Globe. ``That trivializes the broad purpose.
The real point is to put closure to a very sorry period in our
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Closure, however, is the one thing a great debate on the subject
of reparations is assuredly not going to provide. Far from calming
racial grievances, it will only inflame them further. As it is, the
quotas and preferences of affirmative action fuel endless strife
and afflict American society with a nerve-racking
color-consciousness. A national campaign for a vast transfer of
wealth from whites to blacks is not going to make things better.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for reparations is not a frivolous one. ``Black
people worked long, hard, killing days, years, centuries _ and they
were never paid,'' Randall Robinson writes. ``The value of their
labor went into others' pockets _ plantation owners, Northern
entrepreneurs, state treasuries, the United States government. . .
. There is a debt here.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of reparations cite economists who calculate the
value of that debt, adjusted for inflation, at $1.4 trillion _ and
up. And that doesn't include the added trillions lost to black
Americans after Emancipation _ the income they were denied because
of legal segregation and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a claim without merit. Indeed, as a matter of
abstract justice, the case for reparations is profound. But so are
the objections to it. No white American alive today has ever owned
a slave, and the vast majority of Americans are descended from
non-slaveowners. No black American alive today is a survivor of
slavery, or even the child _ or with rare exceptions, the
grandchild _ of a survivor of slavery. The nearly 2 1/2 centuries
during which human beings were treated as chattel are a sordid
stain on our history. But no living American is responsible for
that stain, and none deserves to be punished for it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who call for reparations point to precedents _ the money
paid to Japanese-Americans for their internment during World War II
and the sums earmarked for Jews to settle claims arising from the
Holocaust. But those cases stand on a different moral plane. The
Japanese Americans who received payment were themselves imprisoned
by the US government. The Jewish survivors who accepted
compensation from the German government _ and many survivors,
incidentally, have refused to touch so much as a pfennig _
themselves suffered at the hands of the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Slavery was a horror and its effects are with us still, but
today's blacks are not survivors and today's whites are not
culpable.
</P>
<P>
   Some injustices cannot be rectified. Some debts cannot be paid.
Surely the proponents of reparations do not mean to suggest that
mere dollars _ even trillions of them _ can retroactively cleanse
the evil committed by those who bought and used Africans like
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   The United States inherited slavery from the Europeans who
colonized America, and didn't abolish it until 1865. There is an
ocean of tragedy in that history. But there is also a world of hope
and glory in the long American ascent to equality and civil rights.
Slavery and Jim Crow were wretched, but they came to an end. And
they did so in large part because white Americans turned against
them.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing can atone for the brutality of slavery, but that doesn't
mean Americans have not tried to make things right. The descendants
of the slaves live in a land where the government, the law, and the
courts are adamant about protecting their rights and ensuring
equality for all. That may not balance the ledger-books of history.
It is not everything. But it is a great deal, and it has enabled
African-Americans to know more freedom and success than any black
people in history.

<P>
   You've read their advice in best-selling books or heard it on
television or radio. Now, you can log on to financial advisers' Web
pages to find their latest words of wisdom, plus information about
their upcoming public appearances, favorite Internet links, even
their theme songs and movie ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Using their names plus a .com for their Web addresses, everyone
from author Suze Orman to ``Wall Street Week'' host Louis Rukeyser
to economist Ed Yardeni now has a home page.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, self-promotion is inherent in having an Internet
site named after yourself. And some of the pages are a little thin
on content, while others may be too technical for the average
investor. In an age of celebrity, though, these sites may be giving
the public exactly what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   And with everyone talking about the Internet and the stock
market and investing, the sites may also be giving the public what
it needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any personal finance site that can teach an investor any
important lesson about planning for (the) future is of great
value,'' said Dan Burke, a senior analyst who rates online
brokerages for Gomez Advisors, of Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which on its own site, www.Gomez.com, bills itself
as the ``e-commerce authority,'' has not assessed financial
advisers' individual sites. But Gomez has rated sites for banking,
brokerage services, home buying, insurance, and mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   With any financial advice or information from the Web, though,
consumers and investors need to remember that they must do their
own research and weigh the merits of what's being said _ and why
it's being said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial advisers' sites usually fill you in on their
latest books and newsletters and let you know about TV appearances,
radio broadcasts, or speaking engagements.
</P>
<P>
   Most also allow you to e-mail a personal finance or investment
question, and they may feature some quirky personal information
about the advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there are some useful features on the various
sites, such as online calculators, economic data, and links to
information about everything from charitable giving to college
savings to the latest market news. Plus you get insight into the
person's thinking about IRAs, taxes, and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't necessarily find all the sophisticated tools and
information that are offered on a comprehensive site, such as
www.Quicken.com or Microsoft's www.MoneyCentral.msn.com.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a roundup of some of the financial advisers' sites:
</P>
<P>
   --www.andrewtobias.com _ One of the best parts is a
sophisticated mutual fund calculator that lets you estimate the
bite that taxes and expenses take out of a mutual fund investment
in a taxable account, based on the fund's real-world costs.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias, author of ``The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need''
and other books, writes an almost-daily online column. Recent
topics include the difficulty of short-selling (in the context of a
stock he recommended and still owns) and saving for children's
college educations.
</P>
<P>
   --www.suzeorman.com _ With a different photo of Orman on almost
every page, plus information about her books, tapes, and upcoming
speaking engagements, this site appears primarily geared to those
who are already fans of her bestsellers, ``The Courage to Be Rich''
and ``The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom.'' But Orman, a certified
financial planner, does provide useful links to other sites that
offer information about charitable giving, mutual funds, credit
counseling services, life insurance, and retirement planning.
</P>
<P>
   --www.jonathanpond.com _ The least technically advanced and
slick of the sites reviewed, this one, by the nationally known
Boston-based financial planner and public television and radio
commentator, promises ``to give you the best and most up-to-date
financial guidance.'' Primarily, the site provides information
about his books, videos, newsletter, and public TV appearances. But
Pond also answers e-mail questions on such topics as the danger of
jointly holding property and 401(k) vs. Roth IRA. And there are
useful links to college and estate-planning sites.
</P>
<P>
   --www.bobbrinker.com _ Not necessarily for the beginner, this
site, by ``Moneytalk'' radio show host Bob Brinker, provides links
to company conference calls and stock market news, excerpts from
Brinker's Marketimer newsletter, and a listing of all the radio
stations that carry his show. Brinker also offers an online
discussion group, a list of the states that don't tax income,
interest, or dividends, and hundreds of links to information about
online banking, bonds, mutual funds, and stock exchanges. The most
useful part of the site is its investor education center, covering
everything from general economics to stocks.
</P>
<P>
   --www.yardeni.com _ Also not for the beginner, this site, from
Ed Yardeni, chief global economist and investment strategist for
Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, has sophisticated economic
data, online charts, and demographic information, and links to the
Federal Reserve and other agencies. Yardeni, famous for having
warned of a Y2K crisis that did not come to pass, also has some fun
things on his site, such as the complete text of ``Hamlet'' and his
own movie ratings.
</P>
<P>
   --www.rukeyser.com _ This site by the longtime public TV
personality offers little more than a chance to subscribe to his
newsletters, sign up for his Las Vegas investment conference, or
buy his special reports. But there are some free online samples of
commentaries for fans who can't get enough of Rukeyser's folksy
monologues.

`FAMILY' AN ADOPTION HORROR STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY 
By Susan Merrell 
HarperCollins, 350 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Had the title not been taken already (by So-Cal punk heroes
Social Distortion), Susan Merrell could have called her first novel
``Mommy's Little Monster.'' The child at the center of ``A Member
of the Family'' is, in more sympathetic terms, a profoundly
disturbed, emotionally scarred little boy at war with everyone
around him.
</P>
<P>
   But really, Michael Latham is a monster, pure and simple. What
else to call a child who beats the stuffing out of his classmates,
bloodies his teacher's face with a handful of rocks, spits at his
therapist, clamps down on his mother's finger with the ferocity of
a pit bull, smears feces everywhere, and regularly brutalizes his
sister?
</P>
<P>
   That this terrible tyke is so relentlessly incorrigible makes
``A Member of the Family'' mesmerizing _ and, at times, almost
unreadable. Though well written, it is the nightmarish, often
unpleasant story of a family's deterioration caused by an
uncontrollable child. Yet the occasional desire to walk away from
the book _ and Michael _ mirrors the dilemma faced by Chris and
Deborah Latham, who struggle with the decision of what to do with
their adopted son.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Michael is adopted, which gives this novel an especially
painful twist _ should an adopted child who proves too difficult to
handle be returned like a malfunctioning appliance? Born amid the
horrors of the collapsing Romania, Michael was 18 months old when
he was rescued from an orphanage by the Lathams. But the stain of
his early life remains.
</P>
<P>
   Before Michael, Chris and Deborah enjoyed the sort of ideal life
and marriage just ripe to be shaken to its core. They live in a big
old house in Sag Harbor, on Long Island, with their daughter,
Caroline. They are eager to share the bounty of their lives when
they accept a child, born Mihai, into their home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as a toddler, Michael seemed ``as mercurial as an
ancient god.'' He was remote and aloof, rarely responding to warmth
and love with the welcoming ease of his sister. As the novel
begins, Michael's already 5, and his moods have grown more extreme.
Still, Deborah refuses to acknowledge the depth of his troubles.
She takes issue with anyone, including Chris, who believes Michael
is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't give up on him. I won't,'' Deborah says, when
Michael's teacher complains of the boy's ``utter disregard'' for
those around him. ``I don't care how difficult you make it. He's my
son.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael may be her son, but he's also a cross between Damien of
``The Omen'' and Saddam Hussein. His parents try brain scans and
homeopathic therapies, but nothing seems to make a difference.
Michael isn't just unruly; he's a pint-size terrorist holding his
family hostage. If Deborah refuses to see it, her husband and
daughter are abundantly aware of the effects. Chris has withdrawn
emotionally, and Caroline yearns for the days before Michael came
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so much better without him. You think I can't remember,
but I can,'' the 7-year-old tells her mother. ``I remember how nice
it was, before. Can't he go back?'' But Deborah isn't having any of
it. Certainly, there's something to be said about the
indefatigability of a mother's love, but at times Deborah just
seems clueless. Each day Michael inflicts some fresh hell on his
family, but Deborah insists he's getting better, that this phase
will pass as if it were nothing more serious than a spell of
bed-wetting. But as Merrell writes, ``Like a virus he was
infiltrating every cell of the organism that was their family. And
it was killing them.''
</P>
<P>
   When Merrell concerns herself with the breakdown of the Latham
family, the book is absorbing, and reminiscent of Doris Lessing's
``The Fifth Child.'' But _ perhaps because she's writing her first
novel _ Merrell doesn't trust herself enough to stay with that
story alone. Her novel bogs down with excursions into the bitter
marriage of Martin and Alice Dunn, an older couple who years before
took in a foster child, Des, who may have contributed to the death
of their son, Jack. There's the revelation of a secret from Chris's
life, also involving Jack's death, which isn't as shattering or
interesting as Merrell wants it to be.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, several cases, most prominently the lawsuit filed by
the adoptive parents of convicted child killer Jeremy Strohmeyer,
have focused on the culpability of adoption agencies in placing
children predisposed to violence or mental problems. With this
backdrop, ``A Member of the Family'' arrives with a harrowing,
ripped-from-the-headlines immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the effect is intended or not, this story may do for
adoptions what ``Psycho'' did for showers. ``Good wombs hath borne
bad sons,'' William Shakespeare wrote in ``The Tempest.'' As this
novel makes frighteningly clear, so have good adoption agencies.

SWIMMING TO SPALDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since ``Swimming to Cambodia'' in 1985, Spalding Gray's
monologues have been one of the highlights of the theater season.
Three of them were turned into feature films, and Gray has even
appeared in a commercial for Virgin Atlantic. Friday night he
begins a three-performance run at the Emerson Majestic Theatre of
his new monologue, ``Morning, Noon and Night,'' about life with a
wife and three children in Sag Harbor, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard, then, to remember that it wasn't so long ago he was
on the periphery of the country's cultural consciousness. I first
met Gray in 1985 when I was covering television and he was
performing before the Television Critics Association at a press
event for PBS's new avant-garde show, ``Alive From Off-Center.'' If
Spalding Gray were to write a monologue about meeting Spalding Gray
it might go something like this:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As I walked through the Arizona Biltmore, the hotel that Frank
Lloyd Wright built in Phoenix, cocktail hour was beckoning. After
that, dinner and a performance by a guy named Spalding Gray, whom I
had heard about but never seen. It looked to be a night of eating,
drinking, and maybe even being made merry on a company expense
account.
</P>
<P>
   Cocktails were served beside the elegant swimming pool and as I
headed to the bar I bumped into the publicist for ``Alive From
Off-Center,'' the show on which Gray was appearing, along with
David Byrne, Laurie Anderson, and others. ``Hey, Ed, you want to
meet Spalding?'' ``Sure,'' I lied, thinking this meant I might have
to do some work.
</P>
<P>
   What did I know about Spalding Gray? A friend had tried to get
me to see him the last time he was in Cambridge, and when I asked
what he was like, my friend said, ``He's very funny. He's kind of
like Garrison Keillor with an edge.'' ``Prairie Home Companion''
was never high on my dance card, so I passed.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing I noticed was Gray's flannel shirt, and when the
publicist introduced us I expected a hippie-ish, hail-fellow folkie
like Jay O'Callahan so I put on my phony smile and enthusiastically
shook his hand, ``Hi, Spalding.'' ``Hello,'' he mumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any chance we'll see you back in Cambridge, Spalding?'' ``I
was just there.'' ``I know. I was out of the country. I really
wanted to see you.'' He acknowledged the lies with a nod of utter
uninterest. The ``interview'' was not going well, which was
something of a relief because now I could drink in peace, and I
bumbled my way toward a graceless exit.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner the television critics were ushered into a room
where Gray was going to perform part of ``Swimming to Cambodia.''
This was well before the movie had come out and so, like me, almost
all of my colleagues had no idea who Spalding Gray was or what they
were in for.
</P>
<P>
   Gray entered solemnly, sat down behind a desk, took a sip of
water, and started talking about taking a break from work beside a
swimming pool at a modern hotel. How bizarre _ only the one he was
talking about was in Thailand while he was shooting ``The Killing
Fields.'' More striking than the coincidence, though, was the way
he came alive. This was no Garrison Keillor with an edge. This was
Jack Kerouac with an edge. This guy who seemed nervous and
shut-down started unbuttoning the sleeves of his flannel shirt and
unleashing a torrent of near-paralyzing insecurities turned into
Zen insights, neuroses turned into perfect moments, chance
encounters turned into swirling metaphors for war and peace. As the
monologue skipped across time, he was also making hilarious fun of
people he had met, from John Malkovich to a guy sitting next to him
on the train. Uh-oh. What if his thing was standing by pools at
cocktail hour waiting for people to make fools of themselves?
</P>
<P>
   I started playing back the none-too-reliable tape in my head of
what I might have said to him. ``And then this guy I had never met
named Ed Siegel came up to me with this sycophantic grin: `Hey,
Spald, when are we going to see you in Cambridge again?' even
though he had obviously never seen me in Cambridge or anywhere else
in his life? Who did he think I was? Garrison Keillor?'' I started
worrying about whether my socks matched, if I had spilled a drink
on myself, if I had put on deodorant after the shower, whatever
else I might have done to add fuel to his monologue. I broke out in
a cold sweat as I envisioned every pair of critics' eyes turned to
me, laughing at my socks, my hair. Laughing at me! The paranoia was
uncontrollable as I imagined: ``Don't TV critics take showers?''
Gales of laughter. ``How about that comb-over?'' More laughter.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, I realized he was working from a script and had
much bigger fish to fry anyway. Now that the jokes were at other
people's expense I could sit back and enjoy Gray to my heart's
content.
</P>
<P>
   When the performance was over, many of the critics headed to the
PBS hospitality suite. (I don't mean to give the impression that
journalists are always looking for free drinks.) The others I
talked to weren't as smitten with Gray (``It went on so long . . .
) and after despairing of finding another fan (``What was he trying
to say?'') I looked on the couch and there was Gray, staring
blankly at the TV in the middle of the room. Thinking that his
abruptness at cocktail hour was just a case of preperformance
jitters, I cruised over to my new soulmate and sat beside him.
Since I wasn't reviewing the performance, I figured I could be
frank, even if it did come out like more fakery. ``That was
terrific.'' ``Thanks.'' ``I haven't seen `Swimming From Cambodia'
before. What are you going to do on `Alive From Off-Center'? He
looked alarmed. ``I'm not doing `Swimming From Cambodia' on `Alive
From Off-Center.' '' ``Yes, no, I know.'' ``I'm doing something
else.'' ``Right. I know.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't going any better than the last time, so I figured he
must be one of those artists who's only on when he's onstage and
headed back to my room. I did, however, become a huge fan of his,
and when he came back to Cambridge and Boston in future years I
went to see each of his monologues. Honest.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years after meeting Gray I had switched beats, from
television to theater. The publicist from the Trinity Repertory
Company was on the phone, saying that Spalding Gray was coming to
Providence for workshop performances and was available for
interviews. Normally I shy away from interviewing people I'm
reviewing, but as this wasn't open to review I figured I had no
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Watching him perform ``Skiing to New England,'' which would
eventually become ``It's a Slippery Slope,'' I again marveled at
his ability to turn an everyday experience like learning to ski
into a combination of Buddhist beatnik metaphors: ``To be in
control you have to be out of control.'' When I remembered I was
going to have to interview him the next day, the sweats came back
as my mind started racing. ``Aren't you that television critic from
Phoenix who asked all those idiot questions? What are you doing
here?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a 10 a.m. interview at the glittering
Westin breakfast buffet, but I was too nervous to eat and talk at
the same time, so I got there early and had breakfast before the
interview. At 10:20 he hadn't shown so I asked the hotel operator
to connect me to his room. ``Helloooo,'' said a very tired, very
unhappy voice an octave or two lower than the voice I was
expecting. ``Spalding Gray?'' ``Yeahhh.'' ``This is Ed Siegel. I
think I have an appointment with you.'' ``What time is it?'' he
moaned. ``10:20.'' ``Ohhh, I haven't slept this long in ages.''
``Would you like to cancel?'' I asked hopefully. ``No, give me a
few minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   I was envisioning the monologue he'd be making: ``Television
critics are people who are paid to watch television, if you can
imagine that. At television critics conventions they're paid to
watch television, eat, drink, and chase celebrities. This idiot
television critic from The Boston Globe, fresh from interviewing
Boy George and Mr. T together after a press conference about `The A
Team.' . . . Ten years later I'm sound asleep in this luxurious
hotel and the phone rings and it's this same guy waking me up to
come down for an interview. . . . '' Maybe he had even done
research about prior humiliations: ``And then, while everybody else
was making out on the bus, he was too shy to ask Ruby Greenberg for
a kiss. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   A grizzled Gray stepped off the elevator, carrying a bottle of
Poland Spring. I was dreading the interview as he got his
breakfast. We sat down, I asked him the first question, and he
proceeded to give me one of the most affable, candid, and genuinely
introspective interviews I've ever had, answering everything in
detail, and in good humor, questions about the breakup of his
marriage (part of his previous monologue), whether people dread
speaking to him for fear of winding up in his monologues (a bit of
projection, perhaps), whether he does things because they'd make
good material for monologues.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later I wondered whether I should ask the final
question, and since part of the message of the previous night's
monologue was to go for it, I decided I might as well. ``You know,
we've actually met once before when I was a television critic. Do
you remember doing `Swimming to Cambodia' for PBS?'' ``Oh yeah.''
``I can't get over how different you are. You seemed completely on
edge, and ever since I've thought of you as someone who's really
shy and who opens up only when he's onstage.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed amused at what was obviously a completely erroneous
exercise in pop psychology and said, ``I remember it was cocktail
hour and I was angry because everyone else was drinking and I don't
drink before a performance.'' (In ``Gray's Anatomy'' he says, ``If
you don't drink, your day is just one big (he lets out a long yell)
_ Bed!''). ``I had also been up for something like 48 straight
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   I drove back to Boston wanting to call all the TV critics and
say, ``See, I wasn't such a loser'' _ and then remembered the
monologue was in my imagination. I was content that I seemed to
have good material for a feature _ and even more content that
Spalding Gray had better material for monologues than an evening
spent with critics, one in particular.

 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ It's not love, but it's close, and the scene usually
plays out like this: The new client, looking eager, grateful, and a
little guilty, clutches the portfolio and asks, ``But what do I
tell my other accountant?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer from the newfound CPA is practiced, firm, and kind:
``It's time for you to move on. You need someone with greater
capability _ someone who understands that you've grown.''
</P>
<P>
   The client knows how true that is, and prepares to write The
Letter _ typically the way that such breaks are made. But after all
those years and tax forms with good old Number One, the decision
still hurts. A relationship with an accountant or a financial
planner is, after all, a marriage of sorts. And divorce can be as
traumatic as it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons given on both sides of the desk can sound painfully
familiar: ``We weren't communicating.'' ``She'd been burned before
and didn't trust me.'' ``Lack of commitment.'' ``He was fine when I
was starting out, but now, well. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Accountant Jeff Levine of Alkon &AMP; Levine PC has seen heartbreak.
He has a client who is paying to have his taxes done twice _ once
by Levine and again by the accountant the client wants to let go
but just can't. The client's old Number One may be inadequate, but
he has also fallen ill. And how can you give a guy the ax at a time
like that?
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Kahn tells another tale of heart over mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the last five years I was with my accountant that I had
to break it off,'' she says. Kahn, president of New Dimensions in
Technology, an executive-recruiting firm, had a 15-year accounting
relationship with her New York money man, but had grown weary of
the commuter partnership and wanted somebody local. Eventually, she
found a Massachusetts CPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It broke our friendship,'' she says of her old Number One.
``We don't speak.''
</P>
<P>
   John Buono, who works in the training department of the NStar
utility company, left his acountant for Turbotax. ``He was so busy
he didn't even notice,'' Buono says.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, cruel indifference! And after one has bared all the numbers
and expressed those innermost desires for early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no semblance of a relationship,'' says Dave Porter,
managing partner of Baystate Financial Services, remembering his
breakup with an accountant. ``No communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter, who is a financial planner, says focus group data have
shown him that people consider accountants, whose traditional
purview is taxes and overseeing the books, their ``most trusted
adviser, the guy in the white hat.'' The relationship often spans a
client's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks financial planners, whose profession has developed in
the last 25 years and who generally take a broader look at a
person's goals, are more likely to experience strain with clients,
especially in this roaring economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation level is incredible,'' Porter says. ``A client
will say, `My neighbor got a 30 percent return. How come I only got
25 percent?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes those demands can drive the money professional _
accountant or planner _ to call it quits with a client, although
that's rare. ``It happens if there is continuing tension,'' says
accountant Jim Welch, the managing principal of Needel, Welch &AMP;
Stone PC. ``When the staff keeps getting abrupt, demanding phone
calls, then it's time to break it off.''
</P>
<P>
   People change, notes Tom McFarland, president of The Darrow Co.
and chairman of the Financial Planning Association of
Massachusetts. ``Something dramatic may have happened in their
lives and they're just not the same person who first walked in the
door.'' That's when it's time for the financial adviser to say,
ever so tactfully, ``Maybe you should think about calling around
and getting somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the fiscal equivalent of ``Maybe we should date other
people,'' and that's never easy to say or accept. ``Even with a bad
relationship, it's tough,'' says Levine, the Newton accountant.
``When a client leaves, it feels like a little piece of my heart is
leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Who says accountants are dull? Who says the ledger is cold? This
is finance, ladies and gentlemen, and it's very, very personal.

INDEX FUNDS DRAW LOTS OF CONVERTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Nobel Prize-winning economists Paul A. Samuelson and
William F. Sharpe are asked for their latest hot investment tip,
they have a humdrum answer: stock market index mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't make investing too exciting,'' said Samuelson,
professor emeritus of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. ``It ought to be a dull, dull business. If you want
excitement, take $500 and go to Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't think you'll strike it rich by picking the next hot
actively managed mutual fund, either, said Sharpe, professor
emeritus at Stanford University and chairman of Financial Engines,
an online investment advisory firm. Although he acknowledges
wanting to hit the jackpot is part of human nature, he says, ``That
really can be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson's and Sharpe's academic research, which led to Nobel
prizes in 1970 and 1990, respectively, helped make the arguments
for indexing, and now the two are being joined by a growing number
of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, indexing is buying and holding a group of stocks,
bonds, or other assets that passively tracks an index, such as the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500. The performance of the investment mirrors
that of the index.
</P>
<P>
   One result of all the new interest: Vanguard 500 Index, which
tracks the S&AMP;P 500, has been rapidly gaining on the actively
managed Fidelity Magellan as the world's largest mutual fund.
Although both have been hit in the recent market downturn, with the
Vanguard fund dipping more, and Magellan being closed to most new
investors for a while, each continues to hover around $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for passively indexing vs. actively managing your
money is heating up. At stake in this pitched battle are the hearts
and minds of investors, not to mention their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   Each month billions of dollars are pumped into both index and
actively managed mutual funds through retirement programs, college
savings plans, and other investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   So passionate are indexers that they call themselves ``Vanguard
Diehards'' and ``Bogleheads'' (after John C. Bogle, who started
Vanguard 500 Index, the first index fund, nearly 25 years ago) on a
bulletin board at the Web site Morningstar.com. Morningstar tracks
mutual funds and other investments.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the interest in indexing are books by Bogle and others,
a growing number of Internet sites, new methods of index investing,
and money management firms making it a specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Indexers point to the numbers as proof: In 1999, only 354 out of
915, or 39 percent, of actively managed large-cap blend funds beat
their benchmark S&AMP;P 500 index, and over the last five years only 33
percent did so, according to the latest Morningstar statistics.
Combined with its lower costs and tax consequences, index
proponents say, the passive investment strategy has the active one
beaten hands down.
</P>
<P>
   Equally passionate are the active money managers. So convinced
are they of their prowess and ability to beat the market that some
of their comments sound straight out of the fictional Lake Wobegon,
where everyone is above average.
</P>
<P>
   They point to their high-powered research, analytical tools,
asset allocation models, and other advantages to having your funds
actively managed by them. And there are plenty of books on the
market about the stock-picking secrets of the pros, notably ``One
Up on Wall Street'' and ``Beating the Street'' by Peter Lynch, who
made Fidelity Magellan famous.
</P>
<P>
   And they point to the years that they beat the index.
</P>
<P>
   While Vanguard 500 Index is gaining on Magellan, index fund
investments are still just a drop in the bucket of all mutual fund
dollars. Overall, across all open-end funds available to US
investors, active money managers still have most of the money, with
$4.2 trillion, compared with only $367 billion in index funds,
according to Morningstar statistics as of Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the net cash flow into actively managed domestic
equity funds continued to outpace that for domestic index funds,
with $91.3 billion into active funds and $50.1 billion into index
funds, according to statistics kept by Financial Research Corp. of
Boston. Among those on the side of active management are Ronald H.
Muhlenkamp, portfolio manager of the $180 million Muhlenkamp fund,
who has been a guest commentator on CNBC and ``Wall Street Week,''
along with Louis Rukeyser and Vincent Loporchio, a spokesman for
Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that over time, active management provides
shareholders the best long-term performance,'' said Loporchio. ``We
believe that actively managed funds can add value through
fundamental bottom-up stock-picking. We have superior research and
stock selection, which helps us deliver strong performance.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to Magellan's no-load total return beating the S&AMP;P
500 index the last two years. In 1999, Magellan returned 24.05
percent, while the index returned 21.04 percent. In 1998, Magellan
returned 33.63 percent, while the index returned 28.58 percent.
``That's a significant difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Muhlenkamp said of indexing fans: ``The first question always
becomes, what index?
</P>
<P>
   ``They refer to whichever index has been hot the last three
years. Once upon a time, it was the real estate index, the gold
index, the bond index. Now I assume it's the S&AMP;P 500 index''
because of its recent performance, said Muhlenkamp, whose no-load,
tax-efficient fund is based in Pennsylvania and was up 11.40
percent in 1999 and an average of 15.33 percent a year over the
last 10 years, as of Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people are doing is they're running to Vanguard because
it has been hot, just as they ran to Magellan after it had been
hot. We'd rather run the other way,'' he said. With investors
chasing after past performance even though it's no guarantee of
future results, ``They buy at the top and sell at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   But some proponents of indexing said the key is to buy a broadly
diversified index and hold it for the long term, and not to run
after whatever appears to be the best-performing specialized index,
such as the recently highflying, technology-laden Nasdaq Composite.
</P>
<P>
   While the S&AMP;P 500 index has done well lately with large-company
stocks in favor _ up 21.04 percent in 1999 and an average annual
18.21 percent over the 10 years ending Dec. 31, 1999 _ index fans
suggest tracking an even more diversified index, such as the
Wilshire 5000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The S&AMP;P 500 really is concentrated in large-cap stocks.
Individual investors should have exposure throughout the entire US
marketplace,'' said George Sauter, managing director of the
Vanguard Core Management Group, who oversees the stock index funds
for the Pennsylvania mutual fund family.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund, which
tracks the Wilshire 5000 and represents the entire US market,
including small-capitalization and large-cap stocks, and Nasdaq-
and New York Stock Exchange-traded shares. The Wilshire 5000 index
was up 23.77 percent in 1999 and an average 17.61 percent annually
over the 10 years ended Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And as to actively managed funds whose total returns may happen
to beat the S&AMP;P 500 index in a particular year, index supporters
say that once costs and taxes that can accompany active management
are accounted for, the actual returns may lag the index.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have to be an either/or proposition for investors
when it comes to indexing vs. actively managed funds.
</P>
<P>
   And it no longer has to be just the original Vanguard 500 Index
if the S&AMP;P 500 index is what you want to track, now that there are
competitors, including Fidelity, StockJungle.com, and State Street
Global Advisors, offering similarly low-cost and even no-cost
versions of the old standby.
</P>
<P>
   There are now even so-called index shares tracking the S&AMP;P 500,
called SPDRS (pronounced spiders), for Standard &AMP; Poor's Depositary
Receipts, which trade just like individual stocks on the American
Stock Exchange, with the ticker symbol SPY. The exchange also
offers index shares that track the Dow Jones industrial average
(nicknamed Diamonds, ticker symbol DIA), while Nasdaq offers the
Nasdaq 100 (nicknamed Cube, ticker symbol QQQ).
</P>
<P>
   There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach,
depending on an individual investor's situation, investing style,
and tolerance for risk, say financial advisers, money managers, and
economists.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Glovsky, a certified financial planner and president of
Mintz Levin Financial Advisors in Boston, said while he's more in
favor of actively managed funds, ``I wouldn't rule out an S&AMP;P 500
index,'' such as a Fidelity Spartan or Vanguard fund.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Cochrane, a finance professor at the University of
Chicago, said he favors index funds as do most academics familiar
with the research on passive vs. active investing, but he also owns
individual stocks as ``extremely long-term holdings, where I
neither buy nor sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's indexing fans say they've become converts
because of its boring simplicity and its effectiveness, as
Samuelson and Sharpe point out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps things simple, indexing. It's just an incredibly
sound strategy,'' said Jeff Troutner, senior editor of an Internet
site called IndexFunds.com, which features everything you might
ever want to know about indexing.
</P>
<P>
   Without indexing, he said, ``investing is so emotional.
Everybody's got an opinion about the stock market _ your
brother-in-law, your doctor, your cab driver. You end up really
with a lousy portfolio over time with that kind of input.''
</P>
<P>
   Troutner is also president of TAM Asset Management in
California, which specializes in indexing and allocates clients'
portfolios among different indexes based on their needs, charging
.50 to 1 percent of assets under management annually.
</P>
<P>
   One of Troutner's clients through TAM Asset Management, Bruce
Joseph, 69, a retired ear, nose, and throat doctor in Hawaii, said
he became an indexing convert recently after about 30 years of
investing in actively managed funds and individual stocks, without
doing any better than the market over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed funds can win for one or maybe several years, but most
revert to the mean and can't beat the appropriate index,'' said
Joseph. And ``picking your own stock is really a lot of work, even
when you do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   With the simplicity of indexing, he can now spend his retirement
years focusing on leisure with his wife. ``We travel some, play
tennis a couple of hours. I read a lot of fiction and do what I've
always wanted to do,'' said Joseph, caught by telephone in Hawaii
just before he left for his morning sets of tennis.

   QUESTION: What's an Oscar really worth?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: It depends on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 400: &LR;  &QL;  That's the sum that R.S. Owens and Co., the
Chicago-based
manufacturer, spends to create each of the 13.5-inch-tall,
8.5-pound statuettes. An Oscar is made of brittania and is coated
with layers of copper, nickel, silver, and, finally, 24-karat gold
electroplate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $50 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  The industry trade publication Variety estimates
that's
how much the major studios will spend promoting their Oscar
hopefuls this year. Expenses for these blitzes now include ads in
Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, parties and private screenings,
plus thousands of videotapes and DVDs dispatched to the 5,500
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1955-56, the producers of ``Marty'' actually spent more
money on the film's Oscar campaign ($400,000) than they did to make
the movie ($350,000). The tactic worked: ``Marty'' won the
best-picture award.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $64 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  How much last year's winner for best picture,
``Shakespeare in Love,'' garnered in additional revenue following
the Oscar nominations. The amount represented a 177 percent
increase beyond the $36 million it took in prior to the
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   $20 MILLION PER FILM: That's what Tom Hanks now commands after
having won two best-actor awards (``Philadelphia'' in 1995 and
``Forrest Gump'' in 1996.) Other members of the $20 Million Club
include Jim Carrey, Harrison Ford, John Travolta, Brad Pitt,
Leonardo DiCaprio, and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   $24 MILLION: The 1998 best-picture champ, ``Titanic,'' earned
that amount in additional box-office revenue for each _ yes, each _
of its record 11 Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   _ $2 MILLION: Not all winners have been able to cash in on their
Oscar gold in a big way. Mel Gibson's ``Braveheart'' won best
picture in 1995, but the movie's box-office revenue increased only
from $68 million to $70 million as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Perhaps because the film earned most of its money when it
was released in May and then re-released in December to create
Oscar buzz. By the time the Academy Awards rolled around in March
1996, most interested moviegoers had already seen the film.
</P>
<P>
   $1.54 MILLION: The most ever paid at auction (on June 12, 1999)
for an Oscar. This was the price for the statuette awarded to
``Gone With the Wind'' for best picture in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   $0: Since 1950, Oscars have been awarded for display purposes
only. Winners must sign an agreement conferring actual ownership to
the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &AMP; Sciences. &QL;

FRENCH AFFAIR WITH OYSTERS DEALT A BLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The fishmonger sat glumly outside a cafe here in
Montmartre, pointing to the oysters he can't give away these days.
``Even you Americans aren't buying them,'' he said ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, the French aren't buying them. This is like
Italians cutting back on pasta or Germans giving up sausage.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita, nobody in the world eats more oysters than the
French. They slurp down nearly 2 billion oysters a year. In France,
oyster farming is a $250 million a year industry that employs more
than 8,000 growers.
</P>
<P>
   But that industry is under threat like never before because of
an oil spill and the severe storms that struck around Christmas.
The winter storms ruined at least 20 percent of the oyster beds
along the Atlantic coast, according to France's National Oyster
Growers Association. To make matters worse, the tanker Erika broke
up and spilled 3 million gallons of crude into the waters off the
Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   Goulven Brest, president of the growers' association, said the
government has to do more to bail out his members. In some
villages, like Fouras, halfway down the coast, all of the oyster
beds were destroyed. Growers there will not be able to harvest
another crop until 2003. ``Unless the government intervenes, a huge
number of growers will go out of business,'' Brest said.
</P>
<P>
   On land, French farmers are famous, or infamous, for their
propensity to strike or dump crops to demand more subsidies. They
have blamed their problems on globalization and have trashed or
picketed McDonald's restaurants, seeing the American fast-food
chain as a villain undermining their traditional food chain.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term threat to the oyster industry is largely the
fault of Mother Nature, while the suddenness of the crisis is
mostly self-inflicted. The French, worried about the possibility of
contamination from the oil spill, have simply stopped eating
oysters in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The French agency in charge of food safety has repeatedly
assured the public that the oysters currently on the market are
safe to eat because they were harvested from the sea and put in
purified water beds months before the storms and spill. Like many
Europeans, the French apparently have little faith in, or aren't
listening to, their government when it comes to food safety.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Dupon, a fishmonger who sells shellfish to restaurants in
the north of Paris, said demand at restaurants has dropped
precipitously, in some cases as much as 70 percent. Supermarkets
are selling half as many oysters as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the tourists; it's the French who aren't buying,''
Dupon said.
</P>
<P>
   If the oysters on sale here now are safe _ and the ones sold at
Le Sancerre in Montmartre certainly tasted good _ that does not
bode well for the industry, because the real problem will come in
two or three years with a dramatic shortage of French oysters.
While the shortfall could easily be made up by imports, the French
traditionally are leery of knockoffs of staples such as wine and
pate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had Irish oysters and English oysters,'' Dupon said.
``I don't want to be chauvinistic, but they are not as good as
French.''
</P>
<P>
   While wholesalers like Dupon face a more immediate problem posed
by consumer confidence, the oyster growers face a more long-term
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Brest says his association's members need more help than the $50
million in subsidies the government has pledged so far. Last month,
in a tepid imitation of their landlubber counterparts, hundreds of
angry oyster growers marched on the Department of Agriculture here,
demanding a bailout. Like oysters, such demonstrations seem likely
to become a staple of French life for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Fishmongers like Dupon, meanwhile, have to persuade their
customers that the oysters on sale are safe and tasty. That means
having to ingest them in front of doubting customers. Dupon said he
had to eat two dozen one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love oysters,'' he said, patting his stomach, ``but even for
me, that is too much.''

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ERIN: JULIA ROBERTS TAKES A TURN TO THE
DRAMATIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Julia Roberts in a scene from ``Erin
Brockovich.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    When ``Erin Brockovich'' opens on March 17, you'll see a Julia
Roberts you've never seen before.
 &HT;    Or so she promises, as she leafs through a stack of publicity
photos during an interview at New York's Regency Hotel.
 &HT;    ``Frankly,'' she says with a shake of her long mane of curly,
red hair, ``it's more cleavage than God ever thought to give me.''
 &HT;    The real-life Brockovich, a housewife turned environmental
crusader, loved suck-it-all-in clothes that left little to the
imagination. Not at all Roberts' style _ on this cold winter day,
she looks ready for a bridal shower in a dainty mauve sweater,
matching long skirt and 20 beaded, matching bracelets.
 &HT;    ``I would come to the set to shoot this movie in my T-shirt,
sweatpants and flip-flops,'' the actress says, ``and then I would
be transformed into Erin gear. When I would walk back onto the set
in the highest heels and tightest little numbers, the crew guys
would yell, `What happened to you?!'''
 &HT;    Not that Roberts minded. She wanted to do something different
with ``Erin Brockovich,'' a taut drama that is a sharp contrast to
her recent string of hit romantic comedies, including ``My Best
Friend's Wedding'' (1998), ``Notting Hill'' (1999) and ``Runaway
Bride'' (1999), which between them raked in $395 million at the box
office.
 &HT;    Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film casts her as a single
mother of three, undereducated and without much of a job history,
who winds up working for a fussy, set-in-his-ways attorney (Albert
Finney). And then she stumbles across records of a cluster of
cancer cases in a nearby small town, and starts raising hell.
 &HT;    ``I did this movie because I loved this woman,'' Roberts says.
``She has such spirit. You take a situation like this, where you
have a court-environment movie about files, water and people
getting sick _ Erin could have been a very quiet person going,
`Well, this doesn't seem right.' That would be so boring.''
 &HT;    Not to worry, because in real life and onscreen alike, Erin
Brockovich is no shrinking violet.
 &HT;    ``It was so much fun to go, `What the f--k is this about? This
doesn't make any sense,''' Roberts says, grinning. ``There was an
energy about this woman that was so appealing as an actor.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, she admits that it wasn't as much fun when
the role started seeping into her real-world life.
 &HT;    ``I carried her around all the time,'' the actress says. ``For
instance, on the set, if I needed some caffeine, I would suddenly
say, `What is the matter with you people _ do we have to wait for
another damn millennium to get coffee? What the f--k is going on?'
 &HT;    ``Normally, I'm like, `I'm sorry, is the coffee still coming?
Why don't I get it? Don't worry about me.'''
 &HT;    Some critics are already viewing ``Erin Brockovich'' as Roberts'
shot at an Oscar, a test of whether she has the acting chops to
move beyond romantic comedy. But she denies seeing things in so
serious a light.
 &HT;    ``I just do movies that are good,'' she says cheerfully. ``If
they were all good romantic comedies, that's all I'd do.''
 &HT;    Not so long ago, Roberts lacked such equanimity. She hated being
pigeonholed as a romantic-comedy star, and seemed resentful of her
own fame. In recent years, however, she has apparently become more
comfortable with ... well, with being Julia Roberts.
 &HT;    Her two most recent films even seemed to spoof her public image:
``Notting Hill,'' which cast her as a tabloid-plagued movie star,
and ``Runaway Bride,'' which played off of her much-publicized,
highly changeable love life.
 &HT;    ``I've come to terms that this is my chosen profession and I
really love it,'' she says. ``The good outweighs the bad.
 &HT;    ``I can deal with the scrutiny now,'' she adds, ``because I know
the comments of a total stranger don't amount to a hill of beans.
This is just a person who isn't willing to say it to my face.
 &HT;    ``Would I be a dental hygienist so nobody would say bad things
about me? I don't think so.''
 &HT;    At the very least, she makes a better living this way _ at $20
million per film, she's the highest-paid actress in the history of
Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``Getting paid $20 million doesn't make me a better actor,'' she
cautions. ``It doesn't make me work harder or less hard. I'm as on
time to work now as when I got paid scale plus 10 percent.
 &HT;    ``Nothing changes because of what you get paid,'' Roberts adds,
``except what you get paid _ and the fact that everybody wants to
talk about what you get paid. Which, where I come from, is an
inappropriate question to ask somebody.
 &HT;    ``No offense,'' she adds brightly.
 &HT;    The 32-year-old actress comes from Smyrna, Ga., where she grew
up as the child of two acting teachers. All three of their children
became actors, taking Roberts as a common stage name: Lisa and Eric
preceded their sister to New York, but while Eric remains a film
and television regular, it's Julia who really broke the bank,
beginning with ``Mystic Pizza'' (1988).
 &HT;    Two years later, she became an international star playing a
hooker with a heart of gold in ``Pretty Woman'' (1990), and the
rest is film history.
 &HT;    Well, actually, some of it is tabloid history. There was the
engagement to actor Kiefer Sutherland, which she broke off three
days before the wedding. There was the short-lived marriage to
singer Lyle Lovett. There were reported romances with actors Liam
Neeson, Dylan McDermott, Daniel Day-Lewis and Matthew Perry.
 &HT;    Roberts' greater calm these days has a lot to do with her
two-year-old relationship with ``Law and Order'' star Benjamin
Bratt.
 &HT;    ``I feel like I radiate when he's nearby,'' she admits. ``The
confidence I have gives me a feeling of empowerment that floors
me.''
 &HT;    So is the runaway bride about ready to stop running?
 &HT;    ``Let's just say I am very happy right now,'' she says
teasingly. ``You'll be the first to know if we get married.''
 &HT;    One plus, she adds, is that Bratt doesn't mind that his
girlfriend is more famous than he is, a fact with which Roberts has
long since come to terms.
 &HT;    ``I believe two people are connected at the heart, and it
doesn't matter what you do or who you are or where you live,'' she
says. ``There are no boundaries or barriers if two people are
destined to be together.''
 &HT;    Besides, she knows as well as anyone that fame can be evanescent
in Hollywood, where for years magazines and television shows have
been touting each newly arrived beauty as ``the next Julia
Roberts.''
 &HT;    ``Honey, who needs the next when you have me right here?'' she
says with a laugh.
 &HT;    ``I don't have concerns about not being famous anymore,'' she
adds, more seriously. ``I never have. Someday the audience might
get sick of me.''
 &HT;    Occasionally she is reminded that, even now, her $20 million
smile doesn't shine on everyone _ a fact which, she says, is oddly
reassuring.
 &HT;    ``Last year I was at a dinner party,'' she recalls. ``A woman
asked me what I did for a living. I said, `I'm an actress.' At that
point someone abruptly said to her, `You don't know who Julia
Roberts is?' And everyone attacked this poor woman.
 &HT;    ``Frankly, I was really impressed,'' Roberts says. ``I thought,
`This woman has a life.'''

MCCAIN'S CANDIDACY SHOULD START LOOKING FOR A PARKING PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That sputtering you hear is the ``Straight Talk Express''
running out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called phenomenon that is John McCain's campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination will soon be over _ if not this
Tuesday, then the following Tuesday. These next two rounds of
primaries should make it clear, even to the most ardent
Bush-haters, that Texas Gov. George W. Bush will be the Republican
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, McCain has been running on fumes since Bush
crushed him in the South Carolina primary. He won Michigan a few
days later, but that was a phony victory in a primary where less
than half the voters were Republicans _ and where many Democrats
who marked their ballots for McCain were just trying to embarrass
Republican Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
   Motives of non-Republican voters aside, McCain's success in
Michigan was completely meaningless because he lost overwhelmingly
to Bush among Republican voters. And here's a news flash: A
candidate can't win the Republican presidential nomination without
Republican votes.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a simple premise, you can't help but wonder what
McCain was thinking about when he decided to base his campaign on
the pursuit of Democrats and independents. Maybe the answer is that
it wasn't really a decision; maybe he realized early on that
non-Republicans were his core audience and he simply went with the
flow.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't worked up till now, anyway, and there's no reason to
expect the strategy to suddenly catch fire as McCain takes on Bush
in real Republican primaries that will be dominated by real
Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a few states _ Massachusetts, to name one _ in
which McCain's anti-Republican rhetoric will be helpful to the
senator from Arizona. That verbal nuclear warhead he fired at the
party's Christian conservatives last week may have been
well-received in some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But for hard-core Republicans _ including those who aren't big
fans of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell _ McCain's blast at the
religious right was another manifestation of his stated desire to
conduct a ``hostile takeover'' of the Grand Old Party.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans figure they encounter more than enough hostility
from their enemies in this country. They don't need a
standard-bearer who's even money to nod in agreement when his
Democratic opponent starts trashing the GOP in the general election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There are other questions about McCain, of course. Questions of
hypocrisy regarding a candidate who rails against campaign finance
abuses even as he accepts contributions from lobbyists who stand to
benefit from his activities as chairman of a powerful Senate
committee. Questions about duplicity when a candidate who claims to
be a straight talker lies about campaign tactics. Questions about
the temperament of a candidate who is magnanimous when he wins but
throws a veritable tantrum when he loses.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who are tempted to vote for McCain might want to
consider such questions. But they don't really need to; all they
need to do is consider the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush calls himself a ``reformer with results,'' and that's what
he is. He ran for governor on a platform of reform _ education
reform, tort reform, reform of the juvenile justice system, among
others _ and he worked with legislators of both parties to enact
those campaign promises into law. He can achieve similar results as
president _ and Republican voters know it.
</P>
<P>
   Come fall, independents and even some Democrats will finally get
the message as well. Bush is what McCain claims to be: a
forward-looking conservative who can appeal to a broad
cross-section of voters. He did it in Texas. He can do it as a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain surge was an intriguing piece of fiction conjured up
by a fawning media and assorted opinionizers who have no use for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It made a good story in a campaign that originally figured to be
lacking in suspense. But the story is about to end.

CROSSOVER KING: THE UNLIKELY TRIUMPH OF RICKY MARTIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of singer Ricky Martin.) 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be released in Canada before March 19, 2000. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How does a soap-opera bartender turn into the world's top male
singer?
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Ricky Martin. Only five years ago, he was best known as
``General Hospital's'' Miguel Morez, a Fabio-haired martini-maker
who left women the world over shaken and stirred, and was prone to
breaking into song at the drop of an olive.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, soap fans still remember Miguel fondly, even if
nowadays the recollection makes Martin wince _ especially when fans
bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was going through my mind in those days?'' he says with a
laugh, shaking his head. ``It always happens, it always happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Puerto Rico 29 years ago, Martin blazed a unique road to
stardom, with stops along the way as a child star with the
prototypical boy band Menudo, a stint on ``General Hospital,'' a
run on Broadway in ``Les Miserables'' and, finally, his emergence
as a top Spanish-language recording artist.
</P>
<P>
   And there matters stood until Martin stepped onstage to sing
``The Cup of Life'' at the 1998 Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stage midway through a lifeless ceremony, Martin and
his zero-to-60 hips galvanized millions of viewers, speaking the
language of sex so fluently that most viewers didn't even realize
he wasn't singing in English.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, ``La Vida Loca'' skyrocketed to the top of
the charts worldwide _ it was the kind of song that, once you heard
it, stayed in your head all day _ and Ricky Martin went from Latin
star to bigger-than-life, worldwide presence.
</P>
<P>
   In person, Martin is forthright and garrulous, his natural
enthusiasm charging whatever topic he's discussing. Take, for
example, his love for rock music, a love that would have led him in
a very different direction if it weren't for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really influenced by rock music because of my
brothers,'' Martin recalls. ``Then one day my mom said, ``Enough
with rock _ I cannot stand it anymore! Do you know about Latin
sounds?'
</P>
<P>
   ``She grabbed us by the ear and took us to a Celia Cruz and Tito
Puente concert and said, `This is music that you have to learn to
appreciate, because this is you, it's where you come from, your
sound.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't too happy at the concert,'' he admits, ``but later
on, today, I say, `Mom, thank you so much,' because it's just the
fact that I can not just talk about this music but I can perform
it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Martin adds, his first musical passion was, believe it
or not, disco. Blame it on ``Saturday Night Fever'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, like, 7,'' he recalls with a laugh, ``but I thought I
was John Travolta. I was combing my hair back and walking with a
little limp like him, and I wanted to wear polyester. My mom was
like, ``This is Puerto Rico, it's really hot, you're not wearing
it.' I was really wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's rapid rise has left him at risk from backlash.
Celebrity is a potent drug that some stars, such as Madonna, can
acclimate themselves to, while others, such as Kurt Cobain, are
unable to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has publicly credited his spiritual beliefs and yoga for
helping him to deal with praise and criticism alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful for whatever people are saying,'' he says with a
shrug. ``Being grateful to critics, both good and bad, and being
willing to say, `Hi, nice to meet you, my name is ... ' to
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   A small circle of longtime friends also help him maintain his
poise, the singer adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep me balanced,'' Martin says. ``My friends are people
that I've known since I was 10, 12 years old. I grew up with them,
they know me pretty well. They're really honest about me and my
music, because it's the way I express myself.''
</P>
<P>
   For someone whose career has been based in large part on his sex
appeal, Martin is surprisingly uncomfortable being identified as a
sex symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I have to deal with, unfortunately,'' he says
with a grimace. ``I'm not going to waste all my energy thinking
about whether people think I'm a sex symbol or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexuality and sensuality are two different things,'' he adds.
``Sensuality is something that you're born with. Sexuality is
something that I keep for my room, and it's not coming out of
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, when it comes to sex, Ricky Martin says he's
pretty much an old-fashioned guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself kind of conservative when it comes to sex,''
he says, ``and I respect others when it comes to that. I don't
judge when it comes to sex _ and I'm talking about myself, I'm
talking about straight, gay, lesbian, it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is too short not to be happy,'' he says. ``You've got to
be happy. If you're happy making love to a dog, go for it!''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, then laughs at his joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, don't do that,'' he says. ``Don't do that!''
</P>
<P>
   As Martin winds up a tour that has taken his ``Vida Loca''
around the world several times, he's preparing to head back into
the studio to record his followup album while keeping one eye on
the future. Ten years down the road, he says, he still wants to be
singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on stage is not something I want to let go of,'' he
says. ``It's just amazing, this feeling of control. I'd also like
to do something behind the camera _ I've learned a lot from a lot
of directors I've worked with over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And maybe I'll stop for a couple of years and study
cinematography,'' he says. ``Then maybe I can start directing my
own videos. That's something I'd love to try, because it's another
perspective. Seeing myself from an outside point of view is very
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has a firm idea as to how he'd like to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone that taught someone about Latin cultures, someone that
worked a lot,'' he says very seriously. ``And, at the same time,
someone that always was grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   As he gets up to leave, Martin turns with one more comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the thing that has worked for me is to be stubborn,''
he says thoughtfully. ``If you want something without hurting
others, go for it. Maybe it's not tomorrow, maybe it's not the day
after tomorrow, maybe it's in five years, but eventually it will be
yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, start getting ready for whenever you
have it in your hands _ you can manage it, you can control it,'' he
concludes. ``Be surrounded by great people, creative people, people
that are honest _ and be yourself.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: What's an Oscar really worth?
</P>
<P>
   ANSER: It depends on how you look at it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 400: &LR;  &QL;  That's the sum that R.S. Owens and Co., the
Chicago-based
manufacturer, spends to create each of the 13.5-inch-tall,
8.5-pound statuettes. An Oscar is made of brittania and is coated
with layers of copper, nickel, silver, and, finally, 24-karat gold
electroplate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $50 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  The industry trade publication Variety estimates
that's
how much the major studios will spend promoting their Oscar
hopefuls this year. Expenses for these blitzes now include ads in
Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, parties and private screenings,
plus thousands of videotapes and DVDs dispatched to the 5,500
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1955-56, the producers of ``Marty'' actually spent more
money on the film's Oscar campaign ($400,000) than they did to make
the movie ($350,000). The tactic worked: ``Marty'' won the
best-picture award.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; $64 MILLION: &LR;  &QL;  How much last year's winner for best picture,
``Shakespeare in Love,'' garnered in additional revenue following
the Oscar nominations. The amount represented a 177 percent
increase beyond the $36 million it took in prior to the
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   $20 MILLION PER FILM: That's what Tom Hanks now commands after
having won two best-actor awards (``Philadelphia'' in 1995 and
``Forrest Gump'' in 1996.) Other members of the $20 Million Club
include Jim Carrey, Harrison Ford, John Travolta, Brad Pitt,
Leonardo DiCaprio, and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   $24 MILLION: The 1998 best-picture champ, ``Titanic,'' earned
that amount in additional box-office revenue for each _ yes, each _
of its record 11 Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   _ $2 MILLION: Not all winners have been able to cash in on their
Oscar gold in a big way. Mel Gibson's ``Braveheart'' won best
picture in 1995, but the movie's box-office revenue increased only
from $68 million to $70 million as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Perhaps because the film earned most of its money when it
was released in May and then re-released in December to create
Oscar buzz. By the time the Academy Awards rolled around in March
1996, most interested moviegoers had already seen the film.
</P>
<P>
   $1.54 MILLION: The most ever paid at auction (on June 12, 1999)
for an Oscar. This was the price for the statuette awarded to
``Gone With the Wind'' for best picture in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   $0: Since 1950, Oscars have been awarded for display purposes
only. Winners must sign an agreement conferring actual ownership to
the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &AMP; Sciences. &QL;

 By S. BURELISON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    ``It's an honor just to be nominated.''
 &HT;    You'll hear that phrase a lot this Oscar season, as the
Academy's nominees put on their best faces and pretend they don't
care much whose name is read on March 26.
 &HT;    But four-time nominee _ and four-time loser _ Barbara Stanwyck
confessed that each loss was painful.
 &HT;    ``Anyone who says they're not is lying,'' she said.
 &HT;    Losers should take solace, however, in the knowledge that even
Oscar can make mistakes. Also-rans such as Alfred Hitchcock,
Richard Burton, Cary Grant and Stanwyck herself left behind films
that have withstood the test of time, which is far tougher than
winning any award.
 &HT;    ``It's so much fun being nominated _ everyone is a winner,''
two-time nominee Liv Ullman said. ``And then, afterward, there are
four losers.''
 &HT;    In honor of those 80 percent, try your hand at these questions
about Academy Award losers. 
 -0- 
 THE LOSING QUESTIONS  
 &HT;    1. Two actresses made history in 1998 when both were nominated
for playing the same character in the same film _ and both lost.
Who were the ladies, and what was the movie?
 &HT;    2. James Dean didn't live to experience his two nominations,
both of which he lost. For which films was he tapped?
 &HT;    3. Portraying lawyers is a good way for actors to get nominated,
but the Academy often has objected to their winning. In which films
were screen attorneys James Stewart, Spencer Tracy, Paul Newman and
Susan Sarandon reversed on appeal?
 &HT;    4. Frankly, my dear, 1939 was a great year for Best Picture
winner ``Gone With the Wind.'' Four of its performers were
nominated, with only two winning. Name the other two.
 &HT;    5. Denzel Washington's nomination for portraying boxer Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter doesn't guarantee a win _ just ask John
Garfield, Kirk Douglas, James Earl Jones and Sylvester Stallone.
Name the movies in which they were nominated for roles as boxers,
only to be KOed by the voters.
 &HT;    6. For which film did Marjorie Main, best known as Ma Kettle,
get an Oscar nomination?
 &HT;    7. Versatility is no guarantee: What actress was nominated as a
nun in 1985 and as a floozy in 1994, but lost both years?
 &HT;    8. What a drag _ two talented actors dressed as women for their
nominated performances, but lost. Can you name the gentlemen and
their cross-dressing comedies?
 &HT;    9. Actress Shelley Winters won two Oscars out of four
nominations. In both of her losing roles, she ends up all wet. What
are the films?
 &HT;    10. John Travolta has received two Best Actor nominations in his
career, losing both. What were the films?
 &HT;    11. The votes just weren't there for Raymond Massey, Alexander
Knox and Anthony Hopkins when they portrayed American presidents
onscreen. Name the real-life commanders-in-chief they played.
 &HT;    12. ``I am big _ it's the awards that got small,'' Norma Desmond
might have said. Who was Norma, and what Best Actress nominee lost
for playing her?
 &HT;    13. Oscar perennials Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks both lost for
their first nominations. Name the films.
 &HT;    14. What leading man called his nominated performance in ``None
But the Lonely Heart'' ``a successful bit of acting,'' even if he
didn't win the statue?
 &HT;    15. What two actors, playing husband-and-wife entertainers, got
matching 1994 Oscar nominations _ and went home equally
empty-handed?
 &HT;    16. After six nominations and no gold, Al Pacino was nominated
twice in 1993. Name the films.
 &HT;    17. Who didn't get the Academy's sympathy vote for dying young
in ``Steel Magnolias'' (1989)?
 &HT;    18. Name the four actors nominated, but not voted Oscars, for
their portrayals of real-life figures Lou Gehrig, Howard Hughes,
Patsy Cline and South African activist Steve Biko.
 &HT;    19. Best Supporting Actress nominee Angelina Jolie is a rising
star, just as was her father, Jon Voight, when he was first
nominated. What film got him the nod?
 &HT;    20. Here's the toughie: There have been only two films in which
the entire cast was Oscar-nominated _ and lost. What were they? 
 -0- 
 THE WINNING ANSWERS  
 &HT;    1. In ``Titanic'' (1998), Kate Winslet was nominated for Best
Actress as young Rose, while Gloria Stuart earned a
supporting-actress nod as the elderly Rose in the film's framing
sequence.
 &HT;    2. James Dean died in 1955, only months before being nominated
as Best Actor for ``East of Eden'' (1955) and shortly after
finishing ``Giant'' (1956), for which he received his second
posthumous nomination.
 &HT;    3. James Stewart was nominated for ``Anatomy of a Murder''
(1959), Spencer Tracy for ``Inherit the Wind'' (1960), Paul Newman
for ``The Verdict'' (1982) and Susan Sarandon for ``The Client''
(1994).
 &HT;    4. Clark Gable lost out on a ``Gone with the Wind'' Oscar, as
did supporting-actress nominee Olivia de Havilland to co-star
Hattie McDaniel. Thomas Mitchell, who played Scarlett's father, won
Best Supporting Actor, but not for ``GWTW'' _ he had also played
the drunken doctor in ``Stagecoach'' (1939).
 &HT;    5. Out for the count were nominees John Garfield for the classic
``Body and Soul'' (1947), Kirk Douglas for ``Champion'' (1949),
James Earl Jones for ``The Great White Hope'' (1970) and Sylvester
Stallone for ``Rocky'' (1976).
 &HT;    6. Ma Kettle first appeared as a supporting character in ``The
Egg and I'' (1947), for which Marjorie Main was Oscar-nominated.
Main played her for seven more years in the popular ``Ma and Pa
Kettle'' series.
 &HT;    7. Meg Tilly was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for
``Agnes of God'' (1985) and ``Bullets over Broadway'' (1994), and
lost both times.
 &HT;    8. Jack Lemmon was nominated for ``Some Like It Hot'' (1959) and
Dustin Hoffman for ``Tootsie'' (1982), but both went home
empty-handed.
 &HT;    9. Winters is drowned by her boyfriend in ``A Place in the Sun''
(1951) and succumbs to a heart attack while trying to escape a
sinking ship in ``The Poseidon Adventure'' (1972).
 &HT;    10. John Travolta's first nomination was for ``Saturday Night
Fever'' (1977). His second came 17 years later, for a very
different role in ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994).
 &HT;    11. Raymond Massey was ``Abe Lincoln in Illinois'' (1940),
Alexander Knox was ``Wilson'' (1944) and Anthony Hopkins was
``Nixon'' in 1996.
 &HT;    12. Norma Desmond is the faded silent-screen star in ``Sunset
Boulevard'' (1950), portrayed by Gloria Swanson, whose loss to
``Born Yesterday's'' Judy Holliday was considered an upset.
 &HT;    13. Meryl Streep said she was happy she didn't win for ``The
Deer Hunter'' (1978), because she had perspiration stains on her
dress. Hanks may or may not have sweated over his loss for ``Big''
(1988).
 &HT;    14. Cary Grant, remembered best for his comedies, was nominated
only for two serious roles, in ``Penny Serenade'' (1941) and ``None
But the Lonely Heart'' (1944).
 &HT;    15. Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett, as Ike and Tina
Turner, were both nominated for ``What's Love Got to Do With It''
(1994).
 &HT;    16. After six losses, Al Pacino was nominated for his supporting
role in ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' (1992) and his leading role in
``Scent of a Woman'' (1992). He won the latter ... finally.
 &HT;    17. Julia Roberts was the only member of the high-powered
``Steel Magnolias'' cast to get a nomination.
 &HT;    18. Gary Cooper played Lou Gehrig in ``Pride of the Yankees''
(1942), Jason Robards played a disheveled Howard Hughes in ``Melvin
and Howard'' (1980), Jessica Lange starred as Patsy Cline in
``Sweet Dreams'' (1985) and Steve Biko was portrayed by Denzel
Washington in ``Cry Freedom'' (1987).
 &HT;    19. Jon Voight was nominated, along with co-star Dustin Hoffman,
for ``Midnight Cowboy'' (1969), the first X-rated movie to win as
Best Picture.
 &HT;    20. The casts weren't too large, obviously: Michael Caine and
Laurence Olivier were both nominated for ``Sleuth'' (1972), and
James Whitmore was nominated for his one-man show, ``Give 'Em Hell,
Harry!'' (1975). Both had originated as stage productions.

DEVON SAWA, THE LAST BIG THING 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Devon Sawa in a scene from ``Final
Destination.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Back in 1997, Devon Sawa was the Next Big Thing.
 &HT;    Talented and handsome, Sawa turned up everywhere as the hype
machine kicked into overdrive for the family adventure film ``Wild
America.'' Teens drooled over Sawa, while magazines and television
shows dutifully gave him the up-and-coming treatment.
 &HT;    Nobody went wild for ``Wild America,'' however, and instead of
emerging as a rival to teen-dream co-star Jonathan Taylor Thomas,
the 17-year-old Sawa found himself dangerously close to the
Hollywood scrap heap.
 &HT;    Sawa then retrenched and sought good, if lower-profile, work in
such independent features as ``A Cool Dry Place'' (1998) and ``SLC
Punk!'' (1999). He also appeared in ``Idle Hands'' (1999), a
disastrous teen horror/comedy that had the ill fortune to be
released in the wake of the Columbine High School massacre.
 &HT;    Friendly and refreshingly realistic, Sawa has no problem dealing
with his flash-in-the-pan moment.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't taken very seriously back then,'' he says by
telephone from his Los Angeles home. ``I knew that, and I took a
little break. Then I tried to enter the world of young actor
instead of young heartthrob or whatever they wanted to call me. It
was a very tedious and long transition.
 &HT;    ``Going in, all I wanted was longevity,'' he says. ``I didn't
want to cash in at such a young age. I wanted to have a good career
and be respected as an actor.''
 &HT;    He pauses.
 &HT;    ``There's no right way of doing anything in this business, and
no way to predict what will happen,'' he says. ``When I didn't want
to be the flavor of the month, it was unfortunately at a time when
the scripts that came with a lot more money and much bigger budgets
were just crap.''
 &HT;    Movies like ``SLC Punk!'' thus attracted Sawa's interest.
 &HT;    ``That was two minutes of screen time, but it was challenging
and something cool to do,'' Sawa says of the comedy/drama about a
punk rocker (Matthew Lillard) and his buddies in Salt Lake City.
``I guess it was me rebelling against the teen-idol world _ I
wanted to stay away from that.''
 &HT;    Sawa, now 21 and a little wiser, returns to the screen on March
17 as the star of ``Final Destination.'' Co-written and directed by
James Wong, a noted ``X-Files'' scribe and director, ``Final
Destination'' is a $25 million supernatural thriller, a far cry
from his recent fare.
 &HT;    ``The film is about a guy who has a premonition of an airplane
going down, and he has the premonition before the plane actually
takes off,'' Sawa says. ``He gets kicked off the plane because he
freaks out.
 &HT;    ``So you see him in the terminal, and in the background the
plane goes down exactly as he predicted it would,'' the actor
continues. ``Now Death is after him and six friends who were on the
plane.
 &HT;    ``You could sense Death, but it's never really a character,'' he
adds. ``Death was played by the special-effects team.''
 &HT;    The toughest days on set, Sawa says, didn't involve special
effects, explosions or manifestations of the Grim Reaper. Mother
Nature was actually a bigger challenge.
 &HT;    ``We shot a lot at night in Vancouver, British Columbia,'' says
the actor, himself a Vancouver native. ``Some of it was in the
middle of winter. We had wind, rain and 14-hour days, and we had to
make it look like it was springtime in Paris.
 &HT;    ``Plus, we had these light clothes on,'' he says, laughing. ``It
was tough at times, but we got through it.
 &HT;    ``I feel good with this one,'' Sawa adds. ``Even if it doesn't
produce what they're predicting at the box office, I felt like I
made an amazing movie. I'm very proud of it _ it's very creepy.
 &HT;    ``Hopefully people will enjoy it, and that's the most important
thing.''
 &HT;    Sawa will next be seen in ``Guilty,'' a psychological thriller
that he describes as a big-budget indie feature. The film,
currently being shopped around to potential distributors, co-stars
Gabrielle Anwar, Angela Featherstone and Bill Pullman.
 &HT;    ``Bill and I worked together for a week on `Casper' (1996),''
Sawa says. ``I was 15, and he seemed like the most amazing,
together guy. I wanted to work with him again because I thought I
could learn from him, and I did.''
 &HT;    The subject matter is pretty grim, the actor says. His character
leaves home in search of his long-lost father, and along the way
falls in with an attractive girl (Featherstone). But once he
actually meets his father (Pullman), he discovers that the girl may
have been raped by his father.
 &HT;    ``It's about how everybody deals with these different twists and
turns,'' Sawa says enigmatically.
 &HT;    The actor has nothing else on his plate at the moment. Having
recently ended a long relationship, he's ``single and on the prowl
in this crazy town,'' as he puts it. When not out prowling, Sawa
can usually be found in front of a television set indulging his
latest habit, watching wrestling.
 &HT;    Still, he says, his great passion remains acting.
 &HT;    ``I started when I was 10 years old,'' Sawa says. ``I don't know
anything else. I love it.
 &HT;    ``Out of the 14 hours a day you work, the actual two minutes you
get on screen that day are worth it,'' he says. ``To become someone
else, to see the special effects and stunts, is amazing. To see it
all cut together is really worth it. But I love those two
minutes.''
 &HT;    He pauses, groping for words.
 &HT;    ``There's something about when the camera starts rolling and you
start acting,'' he says tentatively. ``You don't feel that there
are 100 people around you. You just feel like you're in a scene,
and when the director yells `Cut,' all of a sudden you are back in
the real world.
 &HT;    ``It's like a drug, really,'' Sawa says. ``You just went away
for two minutes and stepped into a whole new world.
 &HT;    ``It's the coolest thing ever.''

PRIMARY SABOTEURS MAY BLOW THEIR OWN POLITICAL FINGERS OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It isn't particularly noble to disdain political party
affiliation, stay away from both primaries and refuse to attend
precinct conventions. Basically, that's a cop-out. It limits your
choices to two candidates whom other people have selected for you.
</P>
<P>
   But for members of one party to invade the other's primary for
the purpose of mischievously affecting its outcome is not only
vaguely dishonorable. It's foolish. Such a practice frequently
backfires. Its perpetrators often find that they've outsmarted
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush suggests that Michigan Democratic Party
loyalists voted promiscuously in the Republican primary there last
month. Bush says he won a majority of the strictly Republican vote,
as exit polls would indicate. He feels that Michigan Democrats
conspiratorially infiltrated the GOP primary to vote for Sen. John
McCain, believing he'd be easier to defeat in November than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If so, they may have done themselves no favor. Current polls
show the reverse to be true: McCain would be harder to beat. But
polls can be notoriously fickle, and those taken this early in a
presidential year are far from reliable indicators of what voters
will do in November. In four of the last five presidential races,
the one whom opinion polls favored in the springtime did not
triumph in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Remember? In 1988, Michael Dukakis outpolled George Bush as late
as August. President Bush looked strong in the spring of 1992, the
year he lost to Bill Clinton. Voters can be almost as changeable _
and unpredictable _ as Texas weather.
</P>
<P>
   As vice presidential adviser Jack Quinn put it Feb. 27, polls
taken amid the ups and downs of state primaries amount only to
``snapshots of people on a roller coaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Political contacts in Michigan say that independents, not
Democrats, were the ones who sank Bush. But an unknown number of
Democratic activists did infiltrate Republican voting boxes to vote
for McCain, expressly to embarrass Michigan Gov. John Engler, with
whom they've been feuding politically. Engler had staked his
influence and a big chunk of his reputation on handing Bush a
victory there, and the McCain win was egg on Engler's face.
</P>
<P>
   To this lifelong Democrat, that seems a surpassingly poor reason
to inflict oneself on another party's primary. The only thing it
achieves is the dilution of one's own influence in one's own party.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, a citizen may vote in either primary but cannot
legally vote in both. A Democrat opting to create mischief in a
Republican primary, for example, would deny himself any voice or
vote in his own party's selection process _ for congressman,
sheriff, state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   The law of unintended consequences very often attends the
maneuverings of those who play games with the time-honored
two-party process. Southern Democrats supporting George Wallace's
maverick bid for the presidency in 1968 were just enough to elect
Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, Ross Perot's Reform Party clipped enough votes off
Bush in 1992 to elect Clinton. The Green Party in New Mexico
siphons enough votes away from the Democrats to elect Republican
administrations. This in spite of the fact that the Greens appear
philosophically closer to Democrats than to those whom their
defections unwittingly benefit.
</P>
<P>
   One colossal political blunder of Texas Democrats playing games
burns in my memory. It was 1961. Lyndon B. Johnson, having been
elected vice president, vacated his Senate seat. A special election
was called, with a short-fused four-month campaign. Anybody with a
$50 filing fee could become a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Still in my 30s and with three terms in the House, I announced
for the Senate seat, convinced of my electability. Seventy other
candidates followed my example _ the largest field of contenders in
Texas history. Undaunted by the size of our state and my own
financial limitations, I felt I could win by prodigious personal
effort. I'd just get up earlier, go to bed later, travel more
miles, shake more hands and make more speeches than any of the 70
other contenders, I said.
</P>
<P>
   To make a long story short, I ran third _ barely nosed out for
second place by Bill Blakely of Dallas, who had been appointed
interim senator by Gov. Price Daniel. A little-known professor
named John Tower of Wichita Falls, the lone Republican in the race,
ran first by garnering all the Republican votes. The Democratic
vote had been split 70 ways.
</P>
<P>
   Blakely, merely by consolidating the Democratic voters, would
have been a shoo-in. But a group of disgruntled Texas Democrats
decided that they'd short-circuit the system.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these were self-styled liberals. They had little in
common with Blakely, but far less with Tower. Nevertheless, they
went to the polls in the runoff and voted for Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasoning was that Blakely would ensconce himself in the
hierarchy of Washington seniority and be hard to defeat. Tower, on
the other hand, with nobody really for him but the Republicans
(then a distinct minority in Texas politics) would be dead meat at
the next election. They could get rid of him much more easily than
Blakely, they figured, and so these Democrats paraded smugly into
the polls and pulled the lever for Tower.
</P>
<P>
   They outwitted themselves. A full generation later, Tower was
still in the Senate and meanwhile had spearheaded the effort that
built the Texas Republican Party into the formidable force that it
is today. Poor Bill Blakely by then had been dead for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Those fellow Democrats of mine were, as the British say, too
clever by half.

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ERIN: JULIA ROBERTS TAKES A TURN TO THE
DRAMATIC 
</HEADLINE>

 (Includes a color slide of Julia Roberts in a scene from ``Erin
Brockovich.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    When ``Erin Brockovich'' opens on March 17, you'll see a Julia
Roberts you've never seen before.
 &HT;    Or so she promises, as she leafs through a stack of publicity
photos during an interview at New York's Regency Hotel.
 &HT;    ``Frankly,'' she says with a shake of her long mane of curly,
red hair, ``it's more cleavage than God ever thought to give me.''
 &HT;    The real-life Brockovich, a housewife turned environmental
crusader, loved suck-it-all-in clothes that left little to the
imagination. Not at all Roberts' style _ on this cold winter day,
she looks ready for a bridal shower in a dainty mauve sweater,
matching long skirt and 20 beaded, matching bracelets.
 &HT;    ``I would come to the set to shoot this movie in my T-shirt,
sweatpants and flip-flops,'' the actress says, ``and then I would
be transformed into Erin gear. When I would walk back onto the set
in the highest heels and tightest little numbers, the crew guys
would yell, `What happened to you?!'''
 &HT;    Not that Roberts minded. She wanted to do something different
with ``Erin Brockovich,'' a taut drama that is a sharp contrast to
her recent string of hit romantic comedies, including ``My Best
Friend's Wedding'' (1998), ``Notting Hill'' (1999) and ``Runaway
Bride'' (1999), which between them raked in $395 million at the box
office.
 &HT;    Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film casts her as a single
mother of three, undereducated and without much of a job history,
who winds up working for a fussy, set-in-his-ways attorney (Albert
Finney). And then she stumbles across records of a cluster of
cancer cases in a nearby small town, and starts raising hell.
 &HT;    ``I did this movie because I loved this woman,'' Roberts says.
``She has such spirit. You take a situation like this, where you
have a court-environment movie about files, water and people
getting sick _ Erin could have been a very quiet person going,
`Well, this doesn't seem right.' That would be so boring.''
 &HT;    Not to worry, because in real life and onscreen alike, Erin
Brockovich is no shrinking violet.
 &HT;    ``It was so much fun to go, `What the f--k is this about? This
doesn't make any sense,''' Roberts says, grinning. ``There was an
energy about this woman that was so appealing as an actor.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, she admits that it wasn't as much fun when
the role started seeping into her real-world life.
 &HT;    ``I carried her around all the time,'' the actress says. ``For
instance, on the set, if I needed some caffeine, I would suddenly
say, `What is the matter with you people _ do we have to wait for
another damn millennium to get coffee? What the f--k is going on?'
 &HT;    ``Normally, I'm like, `I'm sorry, is the coffee still coming?
Why don't I get it? Don't worry about me.'''
 &HT;    Some critics are already viewing ``Erin Brockovich'' as Roberts'
shot at an Oscar, a test of whether she has the acting chops to
move beyond romantic comedy. But she denies seeing things in so
serious a light.
 &HT;    ``I just do movies that are good,'' she says cheerfully. ``If
they were all good romantic comedies, that's all I'd do.''
 &HT;    Not so long ago, Roberts lacked such equanimity. She hated being
pigeonholed as a romantic-comedy star, and seemed resentful of her
own fame. In recent years, however, she has apparently become more
comfortable with ... well, with being Julia Roberts.
 &HT;    Her two most recent films even seemed to spoof her public image:
``Notting Hill,'' which cast her as a tabloid-plagued movie star,
and ``Runaway Bride,'' which played off of her much-publicized,
highly changeable love life.
 &HT;    ``I've come to terms that this is my chosen profession and I
really love it,'' she says. ``The good outweighs the bad.
 &HT;    ``I can deal with the scrutiny now,'' she adds, ``because I know
the comments of a total stranger don't amount to a hill of beans.
This is just a person who isn't willing to say it to my face.
 &HT;    ``Would I be a dental hygienist so nobody would say bad things
about me? I don't think so.''
 &HT;    At the very least, she makes a better living this way _ at $20
million per film, she's the highest-paid actress in the history of
Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``Getting paid $20 million doesn't make me a better actor,'' she
cautions. ``It doesn't make me work harder or less hard. I'm as on
time to work now as when I got paid scale plus 10 percent.
 &HT;    ``Nothing changes because of what you get paid,'' Roberts adds,
``except what you get paid _ and the fact that everybody wants to
talk about what you get paid. Which, where I come from, is an
inappropriate question to ask somebody.
 &HT;    ``No offense,'' she adds brightly.
 &HT;    The 32-year-old actress comes from Smyrna, Ga., where she grew
up as the child of two acting teachers. All three of their children
became actors, taking Roberts as a common stage name: Lisa and Eric
preceded their sister to New York, but while Eric remains a film
and television regular, it's Julia who really broke the bank,
beginning with ``Mystic Pizza'' (1988).
 &HT;    Two years later, she became an international star playing a
hooker with a heart of gold in ``Pretty Woman'' (1990), and the
rest is film history.
 &HT;    Well, actually, some of it is tabloid history. There was the
engagement to actor Kiefer Sutherland, which she broke off three
days before the wedding. There was the short-lived marriage to
singer Lyle Lovett. There were reported romances with actors Liam
Neeson, Dylan McDermott, Daniel Day-Lewis and Matthew Perry.
 &HT;    Roberts' greater calm these days has a lot to do with her
two-year-old relationship with ``Law and Order'' star Benjamin
Bratt.
 &HT;    ``I feel like I radiate when he's nearby,'' she admits. ``The
confidence I have gives me a feeling of empowerment that floors
me.''
 &HT;    So is the runaway bride about ready to stop running?
 &HT;    ``Let's just say I am very happy right now,'' she says
teasingly. ``You'll be the first to know if we get married.''
 &HT;    One plus, she adds, is that Bratt doesn't mind that his
girlfriend is more famous than he is, a fact with which Roberts has

 &HT;    ``I believe two people are connected at the heart, and it
doesn't matter what you do or who you are or where you live,'' she
says. ``There are no boundaries or barriers if two people are
destined to be together.''
 &HT;    Besides, she knows as well as anyone that fame can be evanescent
in Hollywood, where for years magazines and television shows have

get sick of me.''

smile doesn't shine on everyone _ a fact which, she says, is oddly
reassuring.
 &HT;    ``Last year I was at a dinner party,'' she recalls. ``A woman
asked me what I did for a living. I said, `I'm an actress.' At that
point someone abruptly said to her, `You don't know who Julia

`This woman has a life.'''

<P>
   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei _ Since the 1970s, this oil-rich
kingdom on the northwest coast of Borneo has been awash in cash,
enough for the world's richest ruler to build the world's largest
palace, with plenty left over for free health care, free education,
even free vacations for his loyal subjects.
</P>
<P>
   But after nearly 30 years of a petroleum-lubricated
free-for-all, the party is over for Brunei, its spendthrift
royalty, and its coddled citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   In the most dramatic sign that the time has come to pay the
piper, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah's government filed suit late last
month against his playboy younger brother, Prince Jefri Bolkiah.
The state is demanding that the prince pay back what sources peg at
more than $10 billion in public funds that he allegedly frittered
away, buying himself luxury hotels and expensive jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The prince was saved by sovereign immunity from an embarrassing
court battle two years ago when a former Miss USA accused him and
the sultan of drugging her and keeping her as a palace sex slave.
The prince also managed to fend off or settle other lawsuits in
Britain and the United States involving alleged debts. So when the
state of Brunei filed suit, it shocked a nation where the royal
clan rules with unquestioned authority, and most citizens believed
them above the law.
</P>
<P>
   In another surprise, an economic analysis commissioned by the
sultan recently concluded that Brunei's abundant state spending is
``unsustainable'' and warned of ``fundamental economic problems
which threaten to undermine the prosperity and . . . social
stability'' of this tranquil backwater of 330,000 people. With oil
predicted to run out in 25 years and the population growing twice
as fast as the economy, the report said Brunei must diversify its
economy, trim its public sector, and promote a work ethic _ or face
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit and doomsday report were a double alarm bell for the
pampered princes and populace, ``but nobody's listening,'' said one
Western diplomat. If Bruneians continue to expect a high standard
of living for free, a society that has long been well-fed and
docile could ignite before the oil runs dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since oil came, the royals spend their money like hell _
they give tips of $10,000, run up hotel bills of $1 million _ and
our Cabinet ministers are paid more than the prime minister of
Malaysia,'' said a 33-year-old employee of Brunei Shell Oil Corp.
``Jefri's a scapegoat; they're all spending our money.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has distinguished between the royals' money and the
public's money, and now tens of billions are lost. We've all been
very selfish and blind, but I blame the sultan, because he didn't
set the rules in the first place,'' said the man, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because of fear of imprisonment for
criticizing the royal family. But at the same time, he added, ``I
have a secure job, a good life, a good salary. Why should I
complain?''
</P>
<P>
   Oil accounts for between 75 and 90 percent of government
revenue, and has made possible universal welfare without an income
tax, earning Brunei the nickname ``the Shellfare state.'' Even a
granite-and-marble-paved amusement park with Corinthian-columned
archways _ a sort-of Caesar's Palace meets Romper Room _ is free to
all comers. (Built by Jefri Bolkiah, it is also the top evening
entertainment in a country that officially bans discos and liquor).
</P>
<P>
   True to its name, Brunei Darussalam, or ``Brunei, abode of
peace,'' has long been a somnolent backwater. The last sultan
squelched a revolt in 1962 and imposed a state of emergency, which
technically remains in effect. The last parliamentary elections
were in 1968; in 1982, even the appointed legislature was
abolished. There is one opposition party with just 100 members.
Most people are too comfortable to demand change.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of Brunei's populace is employed by the government
and enjoy high wages, short work hours, interest-free loans for
houses and cars, subsidies for private school and overseas
universities, and free trips to London and Mecca after several
years of service. No wonder, then, that many would rather wait for
a government post than accept a job in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But cracks in this so-called Muslim paradise began to show two
years ago, when Amedeo Development Corp., Jefri Bolkiah's private
conglomerate, went belly up. At the same time, $35 billion was
rumored missing from the national reserves, which the prince
controlled, spurring the sultan to fire his brother as finance
minister and head of the state investment.
</P>
<P>
   The prince denies any wrongdoing and has vowed to fight the
lawsuit. His friends darkly hint that if the case goes to court,
records of lavish and questionable spending may prove equally
embarrassing for the sultan and his other brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The prince reportedly owns countless custom-made cars and
planes, a yacht named after a female body part, a $5 million set of
10 gem-encrusted watches, the official jeweler to the Queen of
England, and the Bel-Air Hotel in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   With his company in bankruptcy, however, local construction was
halted, foreign workers were sent home, and restaurants shut for
lack of customers. Monster projects that the prince began _
including a fortress-like Finance Ministry and an $800 million,
gold-leafed hotel with eight swimming pools _ remain unfinished
today.
</P>
<P>
   Previously depressed oil prices fed a budget deficit of $1
billion since 1994. The Asian financial crisis of 1997 that hit
Brunei's trade partners did not help either.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the sultan, crowned the world's richest man by
Fortune magazine in 1987 with a net worth estimated at times as
high as $40 billion, lost the title to Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates. Brunei's per capita gross domestic product _ once the
highest in Southeast Asia _ slipped 40 percent in a decade, falling
behind Singapore and Hong Kong, to $14,800 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Officials fret about the unemployment rate _ now at 4.9 percent
_ and complain that locals refuse to take jobs available in
restaurants, construction and household help.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the weaknesses in Brunei's economy go far deeper
than the collapse of the prince's firm, Amedeo. Foreign investors
say Brunei is strikingly lacking in entrepreneurial spirit, perhaps
because people have been coddled and taught not to question
authority. Brunei's wealth has created a literate population, but
it has also fostered an entitlement mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have cousins and friends who won't take a job. They say,
`No, I want $2,000 a month; I'd rather wait.' So they just eat and
sleep at their parents' home,'' said Anis, 26, one of the few
Bruneians who work alongside Filipinos and Indonesians at a major
shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a shantytown of ramshackle stilt-homes built on the
water sits in the shadows of an opulent mosque featuring imported
marble, stained glass, chandeliers and an escalator on one bank of
the Brunei River, and the sultan's 1,788-room palace on the other.
But a boat ride reveals that what looks like a squalid slum from
the shore is actually a middle-class community, and many residents
boast of luxury cars on the mainland. The floors in their homes are
covered in linoleum, and toilets are a hole in the planks emptying
into the river. But the shacks house big-screen TVs, washing
machines, refrigerators and opulent furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very big gap in incomes from the richest to the
rest of us, but no one is hungry,'' said Osman Bakar, 30, who
ferries commuters across the river. ``It's been a paradise here,
but it's changing. Everything used to be free. Now, children have
to pay a few dollars for books and we pay $1 to the doctor.'' There
is even talk of making people contribute to health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Finance Minister Selamat Munap said that ``the collapse
of Amedeo was . . . a very good wake-up call for us . . . that we
have to be prudent in our financial affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Munap said the state is also asking itself, ``How do you
encourage a culture of production, as opposed to a culture of
consumerism? . . . When entitlements are cut, (people) will work
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the government has frozen state hiring and is pushing
for privatization. But the most important shift will have to be in
attitudes, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people here expect the government to do things for them,
rather than asking what they can do for the country,'' said a
30-year-old information technology manager. ``People of the younger
generation who are exposed to the Internet and to the outside world
are beginning to change that. It may change slowly, but it's got to
change or Brunei can't survive.''

PRIMARY SABOTEURS MAY BLOW THEIR OWN POLITICAL FINGERS OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It isn't particularly noble to disdain political party
affiliation, stay away from both primaries and refuse to attend
precinct conventions. Basically, that's a cop-out. It limits your
choices to two candidates whom other people have selected for you.
</P>
<P>
   But for members of one party to invade the other's primary for
the purpose of mischievously affecting its outcome is not only
vaguely dishonorable. It's foolish. Such a practice frequently
backfires. Its perpetrators often find that they've outsmarted
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush suggests that Michigan Democratic Party
loyalists voted promiscuously in the Republican primary there last
month. Bush says he won a majority of the strictly Republican vote,
as exit polls would indicate. He feels that Michigan Democrats
conspiratorially infiltrated the GOP primary to vote for Sen. John
McCain, believing he'd be easier to defeat in November than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   If so, they may have done themselves no favor. Current polls
show the reverse to be true: McCain would be harder to beat. But
polls can be notoriously fickle, and those taken this early in a
presidential year are far from reliable indicators of what voters
will do in November. In four of the last five presidential races,
the one whom opinion polls favored in the springtime did not
triumph in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Remember? In 1988, Michael Dukakis outpolled George Bush as late
as August. President Bush looked strong in the spring of 1992, the
year he lost to Bill Clinton. Voters can be almost as changeable _
and unpredictable _ as Texas weather.
</P>
<P>
   As vice presidential adviser Jack Quinn put it Feb. 27, polls
taken amid the ups and downs of state primaries amount only to
``snapshots of people on a roller coaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Political contacts in Michigan say that independents, not
Democrats, were the ones who sank Bush. But an unknown number of
Democratic activists did infiltrate Republican voting boxes to vote
for McCain, expressly to embarrass Michigan Gov. John Engler, with
whom they've been feuding politically. Engler had staked his
influence and a big chunk of his reputation on handing Bush a
victory there, and the McCain win was egg on Engler's face.
</P>
<P>
   To this lifelong Democrat, that seems a surpassingly poor reason
to inflict oneself on another party's primary. The only thing it
achieves is the dilution of one's own influence in one's own party.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, a citizen may vote in either primary but cannot
legally vote in both. A Democrat opting to create mischief in a
Republican primary, for example, would deny himself any voice or
vote in his own party's selection process _ for congressman,
sheriff, state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   The law of unintended consequences very often attends the
maneuverings of those who play games with the time-honored
two-party process. Southern Democrats supporting George Wallace's
maverick bid for the presidency in 1968 were just enough to elect
Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, Ross Perot's Reform Party clipped enough votes off
Bush in 1992 to elect Clinton. The Green Party in New Mexico
siphons enough votes away from the Democrats to elect Republican
administrations. This in spite of the fact that the Greens appear
philosophically closer to Democrats than to those whom their
defections unwittingly benefit.
</P>
<P>
   One colossal political blunder of Texas Democrats playing games
burns in my memory. It was 1961. Lyndon B. Johnson, having been
elected vice president, vacated his Senate seat. A special election
was called, with a short-fused four-month campaign. Anybody with a
$50 filing fee could become a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Still in my 30s and with three terms in the House, I announced
for the Senate seat, convinced of my electability. Seventy other
candidates followed my example _ the largest field of contenders in
Texas history. Undaunted by the size of our state and my own
financial limitations, I felt I could win by prodigious personal
effort. I'd just get up earlier, go to bed later, travel more
miles, shake more hands and make more speeches than any of the 70
other contenders, I said.
</P>
<P>
   To make a long story short, I ran third _ barely nosed out for
second place by Bill Blakely of Dallas, who had been appointed
interim senator by Gov. Price Daniel. A little-known professor
named John Tower of Wichita Falls, the lone Republican in the race,
ran first by garnering all the Republican votes. The Democratic
vote had been split 70 ways.
</P>
<P>
   Blakely, merely by consolidating the Democratic voters, would
have been a shoo-in. But a group of disgruntled Texas Democrats
decided that they'd short-circuit the system.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these were self-styled liberals. They had little in
common with Blakely, but far less with Tower. Nevertheless, they
went to the polls in the runoff and voted for Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasoning was that Blakely would ensconce himself in the
hierarchy of Washington seniority and be hard to defeat. Tower, on
the other hand, with nobody really for him but the Republicans
(then a distinct minority in Texas politics) would be dead meat at
the next election. They could get rid of him much more easily than
Blakely, they figured, and so these Democrats paraded smugly into
the polls and pulled the lever for Tower.
</P>
<P>
   They outwitted themselves. A full generation later, Tower was
still in the Senate and meanwhile had spearheaded the effort that
built the Texas Republican Party into the formidable force that it
is today. Poor Bill Blakely by then had been dead for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Those fellow Democrats of mine were, as the British say, too
clever by half.

 &HT;    ALLEGATIONS OF RUSSIAN RIGHTS ABUSES CONTINUE
 &HT;    (750&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHOLKOVSKOYE, Russia _ Stillness in this small muddy town on
Chechnya's eastern border stretches from morning to late afternoon,
punctured only by cattle ambling down the street and men smoking
and stamping their tired feet in the winter chill.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government calls Sholkovskoye a model village in
their campaign to win the hearts and minds of Chechen civilians,
and bring normal life back to this breakaway republic devastated
during six months of war between Islamic separatists and the
Russian army.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no shooting. Relations between the authorities and the
population are excellent,'' boasts Col. Sergei Mikhailov, Russia's
deputy commander in the region, as he sits in the sandbagged town
hall building under a portrait of acting Russian President Vladimir
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   But his words contrast those of civilians here, who say Russian
soldiers have brought only a mirage of stability, an uneasy peace
threatened by hostility between those who survived and those who
waged the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've created the appearance of normal life, but it's not
real,'' said Alimkhan Magomedov, an unemployed ethnic Chechen. ``We
have absolutely no rights _ they still treat all of us as if we're
bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's leadership announced the capture last week of the
village of Shatoi _ described as the last rebel stronghold _ and
vowed to wrap up their offensive quickly. But the rebels, who have
pledged to wage a guerrilla-type war against the Russians, said
they would continue to offer stiff resistance against the troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the Russian announcement, federal forces
suffered two major setbacks in fierce battles both on the southern
front and in the Chechen capital Grozny, which the army had boasted
was completely subdued and safe.
</P>
<P>
   In a weekend interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.,
Putin repeated the military line that Russian forces have
effectively crushed rebel resistance. In addition, he stressed that
the primary task of the Russian forces would be to build peace in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Plans have been laid to decrease the Russian military presence
from the current 100,000 troops to about one-third that number, and
to slowly replace the Russian military commandant system governing
liberated villages like Sholkovskoye with new civilian
administrations and local militia forces.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Putin nor the Russian government has explained how
Russia will pay for the rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years between the first Chechen War and the second,
the Russian government transferred more than $2 billion to the
civilian Chechen government. The money was earmarked for rebuilding
infrastructure like electric and phone lines destroyed during the
first war, but most of it was embezzled Chechen officials.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Deputy Prime Minister Nickolai Koshman has said that
reconstructing Chechnya will cost Russia some 10 billion rubles
(US$400 million), but would not elaborate on what that figure
includes. Estimates for rebuilding the Grozny, where more than
600,000 people lived until the Russian air force flattened it in
devastating air attacks, run close to (US$1 billion) alone.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Russian federal budget only allocates 515 million
rubles (US$18 million) for Chechnya, an amount that compounds
cynicism among the civilian population in the war-torn region that
life will improve under Russian rule.
</P>
<P>
   This region on Chechnya's _ east bordering Dagestan _ is the
most pro-Russian part of Chechnya. It was one of the first areas to
be occupied by Russian forces after locals ran the Chechen rebels
out of the town of Sholkovskoye last October, and was spared the
destruction visited on cities like Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity and gas are working in the town, but food and work
are scarce. Along Sholkovskoye's two-lane unpaved main street the
only economic activity comes from kiosks selling Snickers, soda and
chewing gum. Other household items are nowhere to be seen on store
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some residents like pensioner Marina Kudelina, an ethnic
Russian, are satisfied with life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is better since (the Russian army) came and the bandits
left. We get our pensions and we sleep soundly in our beds,'' the
72-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone has pleasant things to say about the military.
</P>
<P>
   Luba Zagayeva is one of thousands of people who fled fighting in
Grozny and have taken shelter with relatives in the region
surrounding Sholkovskoye. Zagayeva said she lost all her identity
papers in the rush to flee the relentless air raids on her home.
Without the documents, she can't receive any food aid or travel to
another town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got nothing left there, and nothing to feed my children
here,'' Zagayeva said, standing in the town square hoping to catch
the attention of military officials entering and exiting the city
hall building.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For the four months she has lived in Sholkovskoye with her
children, the commandant's office refused to replace her family's
documents, making life harrowing for her husband and older son. The
lack of identity papers is grounds for arrest by the Ministry of
Interior soldiers that patrol the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's constant harassment. They take our men on the pretense
that they have fought for the rebels. It's no good to tell them
they have never lifted a weapon. We either pay to get them out of
jail, or they take them away and we never see them again,''
Zagayeva said.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Mikhailov denied that his men make unwarranted arrests
among the Chechen civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chechens like to work in armed forces. We must remain vigilant
and keep discipline or else peace will break down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the four months the Russian military has controlled the town,
50 criminal cases have been opened against townsfolk, with charges
ranging from robbery to drug possession to loitering. The
defendants must be transferred to the Russian town of Krasnodar,
because Sholkovskoye has no working court system.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhailov said the best long-term solution for peace in Chechnya
would be to replace the Russian troops with a local police force
that will defend the rule of law. He has already appointed a
Chechen chief of police for Sholkovskoye. So far, 180 people have
completed applications to join the local militia. No one's been
hired yet, because there's no money to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   For some Chechens, who have witnessed war for most of their
lives, the answer is much more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were independent, it was all a big mess and we
starved,'' says Abdul Magomedov, an 18-year-old chewing sunflower
seeds in Sholkovskoye's main square. ``Now (the Russians) think
they can give us bread and we'll all be happy again. But they're
wrong. We still want our own government, our own president. We
still want freedom.''

   How does a soap-opera bartender turn into the world's top male
singer?
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Ricky Martin. Only five years ago, he was best known as
``General Hospital's'' Miguel Morez, a Fabio-haired martini-maker
who left women the world over shaken and stirred, and was prone to
breaking into song at the drop of an olive.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, soap fans still remember Miguel fondly, even if
nowadays the recollection makes Martin wince _ especially when fans
bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was going through my mind in those days?'' he says with a
laugh, shaking his head. ``It always happens, it always happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Puerto Rico 29 years ago, Martin blazed a unique road to
stardom, with stops along the way as a child star with the
prototypical boy band Menudo, a stint on ``General Hospital,'' a
run on Broadway in ``Les Miserables'' and, finally, his emergence
as a top Spanish-language recording artist.
</P>
<P>
   And there matters stood until Martin stepped onstage to sing
``The Cup of Life'' at the 1998 Grammy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stage midway through a lifeless ceremony, Martin and
his zero-to-60 hips galvanized millions of viewers, speaking the
language of sex so fluently that most viewers didn't even realize
he wasn't singing in English.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, ``La Vida Loca'' skyrocketed to the top of
the charts worldwide _ it was the kind of song that, once you heard
it, stayed in your head all day _ and Ricky Martin went from Latin
star to bigger-than-life, worldwide presence.
</P>
<P>
   In person, Martin is forthright and garrulous, his natural
enthusiasm charging whatever topic he's discussing. Take, for
example, his love for rock music, a love that would have led him in
a very different direction if it weren't for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really influenced by rock music because of my
brothers,'' Martin recalls. ``Then one day my mom said, ``Enough
with rock _ I cannot stand it anymore! Do you know about Latin
sounds?'
</P>
<P>
   ``She grabbed us by the ear and took us to a Celia Cruz and Tito
Puente concert and said, `This is music that you have to learn to
appreciate, because this is you, it's where you come from, your
sound.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't too happy at the concert,'' he admits, ``but later
on, today, I say, `Mom, thank you so much,' because it's just the
fact that I can not just talk about this music but I can perform
it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Martin adds, his first musical passion was, believe it
or not, disco. Blame it on ``Saturday Night Fever'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, like, 7,'' he recalls with a laugh, ``but I thought I
was John Travolta. I was combing my hair back and walking with a
little limp like him, and I wanted to wear polyester. My mom was
like, ``This is Puerto Rico, it's really hot, you're not wearing
it.' I was really wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's rapid rise has left him at risk from backlash.
Celebrity is a potent drug that some stars, such as Madonna, can
acclimate themselves to, while others, such as Kurt Cobain, are
unable to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has publicly credited his spiritual beliefs and yoga for
helping him to deal with praise and criticism alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful for whatever people are saying,'' he says with a
shrug. ``Being grateful to critics, both good and bad, and being
willing to say, `Hi, nice to meet you, my name is ... ' to
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   A small circle of longtime friends also help him maintain his
poise, the singer adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep me balanced,'' Martin says. ``My friends are people
that I've known since I was 10, 12 years old. I grew up with them,
they know me pretty well. They're really honest about me and my
music, because it's the way I express myself.''
</P>
<P>
   For someone whose career has been based in large part on his sex
appeal, Martin is surprisingly uncomfortable being identified as a
sex symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I have to deal with, unfortunately,'' he says
with a grimace. ``I'm not going to waste all my energy thinking
about whether people think I'm a sex symbol or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexuality and sensuality are two different things,'' he adds.
``Sensuality is something that you're born with. Sexuality is
something that I keep for my room, and it's not coming out of
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, when it comes to sex, Ricky Martin says he's
pretty much an old-fashioned guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself kind of conservative when it comes to sex,''
he says, ``and I respect others when it comes to that. I don't
judge when it comes to sex _ and I'm talking about myself, I'm
talking about straight, gay, lesbian, it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is too short not to be happy,'' he says. ``You've got to
be happy. If you're happy making love to a dog, go for it!''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, then laughs at his joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, don't do that,'' he says. ``Don't do that!''
</P>
<P>
   As Martin winds up a tour that has taken his ``Vida Loca''
around the world several times, he's preparing to head back into
the studio to record his followup album while keeping one eye on
the future. Ten years down the road, he says, he still wants to be
singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on stage is not something I want to let go of,'' he
says. ``It's just amazing, this feeling of control. I'd also like
to do something behind the camera _ I've learned a lot from a lot
of directors I've worked with over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And maybe I'll stop for a couple of years and study
cinematography,'' he says. ``Then maybe I can start directing my
own videos. That's something I'd love to try, because it's another
perspective. Seeing myself from an outside point of view is very
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has a firm idea as to how he'd like to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone that taught someone about Latin cultures, someone that
worked a lot,'' he says very seriously. ``And, at the same time,
someone that always was grounded.''
</P>
<P>
   As he gets up to leave, Martin turns with one more comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the thing that has worked for me is to be stubborn,''
he says thoughtfully. ``If you want something without hurting
others, go for it. Maybe it's not tomorrow, maybe it's not the day
after tomorrow, maybe it's in five years, but eventually it will be
yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, start getting ready for whenever you
have it in your hands _ you can manage it, you can control it,'' he
concludes. ``Be surrounded by great people, creative people, people
that are honest _ and be yourself.''

entertainment package.)

 By S. BURELISON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    ``It's an honor just to be nominated.''
 &HT;    You'll hear that phrase a lot this Oscar season, as the
Academy's nominees put on their best faces and pretend they don't
care much whose name is read on March 26.
 &HT;    But four-time nominee _ and four-time loser _ Barbara Stanwyck
confessed that each loss was painful.
 &HT;    ``Anyone who says they're not is lying,'' she said.
 &HT;    Losers should take solace, however, in the knowledge that even
Oscar can make mistakes. Also-rans such as Alfred Hitchcock,
Richard Burton, Cary Grant and Stanwyck herself left behind films
that have withstood the test of time, which is far tougher than
winning any award.
 &HT;    ``It's so much fun being nominated _ everyone is a winner,''
two-time nominee Liv Ullman said. ``And then, afterward, there are
four losers.''
 &HT;    In honor of those 80 percent, try your hand at these questions
about Academy Award losers. 
 -0- 
 THE LOSING QUESTIONS  
 &HT;    1. Two actresses made history in 1998 when both were nominated
for playing the same character in the same film _ and both lost.
Who were the ladies, and what was the movie?
 &HT;    2. James Dean didn't live to experience his two nominations,
both of which he lost. For which films was he tapped?
 &HT;    3. Portraying lawyers is a good way for actors to get nominated,
but the Academy often has objected to their winning. In which films
were screen attorneys James Stewart, Spencer Tracy, Paul Newman and
Susan Sarandon reversed on appeal?
 &HT;    4. Frankly, my dear, 1939 was a great year for Best Picture
winner ``Gone With the Wind.'' Four of its performers were
nominated, with only two winning. Name the other two.
 &HT;    5. Denzel Washington's nomination for portraying boxer Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter doesn't guarantee a win _ just ask John
Garfield, Kirk Douglas, James Earl Jones and Sylvester Stallone.
Name the movies in which they were nominated for roles as boxers,
only to be KOed by the voters.
 &HT;    6. For which film did Marjorie Main, best known as Ma Kettle,
get an Oscar nomination?
 &HT;    7. Versatility is no guarantee: What actress was nominated as a
nun in 1985 and as a floozy in 1994, but lost both years?
 &HT;    8. What a drag _ two talented actors dressed as women for their
nominated performances, but lost. Can you name the gentlemen and
their cross-dressing comedies?
 &HT;    9. Actress Shelley Winters won two Oscars out of four
nominations. In both of her losing roles, she ends up all wet. What
are the films?
 &HT;    10. John Travolta has received two Best Actor nominations in his
career, losing both. What were the films?
 &HT;    11. The votes just weren't there for Raymond Massey, Alexander
Knox and Anthony Hopkins when they portrayed American presidents
onscreen. Name the real-life commanders-in-chief they played.
 &HT;    12. ``I am big _ it's the awards that got small,'' Norma Desmond
might have said. Who was Norma, and what Best Actress nominee lost
for playing her?
 &HT;    13. Oscar perennials Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks both lost for
their first nominations. Name the films.
 &HT;    14. What leading man called his nominated performance in ``None
But the Lonely Heart'' ``a successful bit of acting,'' even if he
didn't win the statue?
 &HT;    15. What two actors, playing husband-and-wife entertainers, got
matching 1994 Oscar nominations _ and went home equally
empty-handed?
 &HT;    16. After six nominations and no gold, Al Pacino was nominated
twice in 1993. Name the films.
 &HT;    17. Who didn't get the Academy's sympathy vote for dying young
in ``Steel Magnolias'' (1989)?
 &HT;    18. Name the four actors nominated, but not voted Oscars, for
their portrayals of real-life figures Lou Gehrig, Howard Hughes,
Patsy Cline and South African activist Steve Biko.
 &HT;    19. Best Supporting Actress nominee Angelina Jolie is a rising
star, just as was her father, Jon Voight, when he was first
nominated. What film got him the nod?
 &HT;    20. Here's the toughie: There have been only two films in which
the entire cast was Oscar-nominated _ and lost. What were they? 
 -0- 
 THE WINNING ANSWERS  
 &HT;    1. In ``Titanic'' (1998), Kate Winslet was nominated for Best
Actress as young Rose, while Gloria Stuart earned a
supporting-actress nod as the elderly Rose in the film's framing
sequence.
 &HT;    2. James Dean died in 1955, only months before being nominated
as Best Actor for ``East of Eden'' (1955) and shortly after
finishing ``Giant'' (1956), for which he received his second
posthumous nomination.
 &HT;    3. James Stewart was nominated for ``Anatomy of a Murder''
(1959), Spencer Tracy for ``Inherit the Wind'' (1960), Paul Newman
for ``The Verdict'' (1982) and Susan Sarandon for ``The Client''
(1994).
 &HT;    4. Clark Gable lost out on a ``Gone with the Wind'' Oscar, as
did supporting-actress nominee Olivia de Havilland to co-star
Hattie McDaniel. Thomas Mitchell, who played Scarlett's father, won
Best Supporting Actor, but not for ``GWTW'' _ he had also played
the drunken doctor in ``Stagecoach'' (1939).
 &HT;    5. Out for the count were nominees John Garfield for the classic
``Body and Soul'' (1947), Kirk Douglas for ``Champion'' (1949),
James Earl Jones for ``The Great White Hope'' (1970) and Sylvester
Stallone for ``Rocky'' (1976).
 &HT;    6. Ma Kettle first appeared as a supporting character in ``The
Egg and I'' (1947), for which Marjorie Main was Oscar-nominated.
Main played her for seven more years in the popular ``Ma and Pa
Kettle'' series.
 &HT;    7. Meg Tilly was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for
``Agnes of God'' (1985) and ``Bullets over Broadway'' (1994), and
lost both times.
 &HT;    8. Jack Lemmon was nominated for ``Some Like It Hot'' (1959) and
Dustin Hoffman for ``Tootsie'' (1982), but both went home
empty-handed.
 &HT;    9. Winters is drowned by her boyfriend in ``A Place in the Sun''
(1951) and succumbs to a heart attack while trying to escape a
sinking ship in ``The Poseidon Adventure'' (1972).
 &HT;    10. John Travolta's first nomination was for ``Saturday Night
Fever'' (1977). His second came 17 years later, for a very
different role in ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994).
 &HT;    11. Raymond Massey was ``Abe Lincoln in Illinois'' (1940),
Alexander Knox was ``Wilson'' (1944) and Anthony Hopkins was
``Nixon'' in 1996.
 &HT;    12. Norma Desmond is the faded silent-screen star in ``Sunset
Boulevard'' (1950), portrayed by Gloria Swanson, whose loss to
``Born Yesterday's'' Judy Holliday was considered an upset.
 &HT;    13. Meryl Streep said she was happy she didn't win for ``The
Deer Hunter'' (1978), because she had perspiration stains on her
dress. Hanks may or may not have sweated over his loss for ``Big''
(1988).
 &HT;    14. Cary Grant, remembered best for his comedies, was nominated
only for two serious roles, in ``Penny Serenade'' (1941) and ``None
But the Lonely Heart'' (1944).
 &HT;    15. Laurence Fishburne and Angela Bassett, as Ike and Tina
Turner, were both nominated for ``What's Love Got to Do With It''
(1994).
 &HT;    16. After six losses, Al Pacino was nominated for his supporting
role in ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' (1992) and his leading role in
``Scent of a Woman'' (1992). He won the latter ... finally.
 &HT;    17. Julia Roberts was the only member of the high-powered
``Steel Magnolias'' cast to get a nomination.
 &HT;    18. Gary Cooper played Lou Gehrig in ``Pride of the Yankees''
(1942), Jason Robards played a disheveled Howard Hughes in ``Melvin
and Howard'' (1980), Jessica Lange starred as Patsy Cline in
``Sweet Dreams'' (1985) and Steve Biko was portrayed by Denzel
Washington in ``Cry Freedom'' (1987).
 &HT;    19. Jon Voight was nominated, along with co-star Dustin Hoffman,
for ``Midnight Cowboy'' (1969), the first X-rated movie to win as
Best Picture.
 &HT;    20. The casts weren't too large, obviously: Michael Caine and
Laurence Olivier were both nominated for ``Sleuth'' (1972), and
James Whitmore was nominated for his one-man show, ``Give 'Em Hell,
Harry!'' (1975). Both had originated as stage productions.

DEVON SAWA, THE LAST BIG THING 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Devon Sawa in a scene from ``Final
Destination.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Back in 1997, Devon Sawa was the Next Big Thing.
 &HT;    Talented and handsome, Sawa turned up everywhere as the hype
machine kicked into overdrive for the family adventure film ``Wild
America.'' Teens drooled over Sawa, while magazines and television
shows dutifully gave him the up-and-coming treatment.
 &HT;    Nobody went wild for ``Wild America,'' however, and instead of
emerging as a rival to teen-dream co-star Jonathan Taylor Thomas,
the 17-year-old Sawa found himself dangerously close to the
Hollywood scrap heap.
 &HT;    Sawa then retrenched and sought good, if lower-profile, work in
such independent features as ``A Cool Dry Place'' (1998) and ``SLC
Punk!'' (1999). He also appeared in ``Idle Hands'' (1999), a
disastrous teen horror/comedy that had the ill fortune to be
released in the wake of the Columbine High School massacre.
 &HT;    Friendly and refreshingly realistic, Sawa has no problem dealing
with his flash-in-the-pan moment.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't taken very seriously back then,'' he says by
telephone from his Los Angeles home. ``I knew that, and I took a
little break. Then I tried to enter the world of young actor
instead of young heartthrob or whatever they wanted to call me. It
was a very tedious and long transition.
 &HT;    ``Going in, all I wanted was longevity,'' he says. ``I didn't
want to cash in at such a young age. I wanted to have a good career
and be respected as an actor.''
 &HT;    He pauses.
 &HT;    ``There's no right way of doing anything in this business, and
no way to predict what will happen,'' he says. ``When I didn't want
to be the flavor of the month, it was unfortunately at a time when
the scripts that came with a lot more money and much bigger budgets
were just crap.''
 &HT;    Movies like ``SLC Punk!'' thus attracted Sawa's interest.
 &HT;    ``That was two minutes of screen time, but it was challenging
and something cool to do,'' Sawa says of the comedy/drama about a
punk rocker (Matthew Lillard) and his buddies in Salt Lake City.
``I guess it was me rebelling against the teen-idol world _ I
wanted to stay away from that.''
 &HT;    Sawa, now 21 and a little wiser, returns to the screen on March
17 as the star of ``Final Destination.'' Co-written and directed by
James Wong, a noted ``X-Files'' scribe and director, ``Final
Destination'' is a $25 million supernatural thriller, a far cry
from his recent fare.
 &HT;    ``The film is about a guy who has a premonition of an airplane
going down, and he has the premonition before the plane actually
takes off,'' Sawa says. ``He gets kicked off the plane because he
freaks out.
 &HT;    ``So you see him in the terminal, and in the background the
plane goes down exactly as he predicted it would,'' the actor
continues. ``Now Death is after him and six friends who were on the
plane.
 &HT;    ``You could sense Death, but it's never really a character,'' he
adds. ``Death was played by the special-effects team.''
 &HT;    The toughest days on set, Sawa says, didn't involve special
effects, explosions or manifestations of the Grim Reaper. Mother
Nature was actually a bigger challenge.
 &HT;    ``We shot a lot at night in Vancouver, British Columbia,'' says
the actor, himself a Vancouver native. ``Some of it was in the
middle of winter. We had wind, rain and 14-hour days, and we had to
make it look like it was springtime in Paris.
 &HT;    ``Plus, we had these light clothes on,'' he says, laughing. ``It
was tough at times, but we got through it.
 &HT;    ``I feel good with this one,'' Sawa adds. ``Even if it doesn't
produce what they're predicting at the box office, I felt like I
made an amazing movie. I'm very proud of it _ it's very creepy.
 &HT;    ``Hopefully people will enjoy it, and that's the most important
thing.''
 &HT;    Sawa will next be seen in ``Guilty,'' a psychological thriller
that he describes as a big-budget indie feature. The film,
currently being shopped around to potential distributors, co-stars
Gabrielle Anwar, Angela Featherstone and Bill Pullman.
 &HT;    ``Bill and I worked together for a week on `Casper' (1996),''
Sawa says. ``I was 15, and he seemed like the most amazing,
together guy. I wanted to work with him again because I thought I
could learn from him, and I did.''
 &HT;    The subject matter is pretty grim, the actor says. His character
leaves home in search of his long-lost father, and along the way
falls in with an attractive girl (Featherstone). But once he
actually meets his father (Pullman), he discovers that the girl may
have been raped by his father.
 &HT;    ``It's about how everybody deals with these different twists and
turns,'' Sawa says enigmatically.
 &HT;    The actor has nothing else on his plate at the moment. Having
recently ended a long relationship, he's ``single and on the prowl
in this crazy town,'' as he puts it. When not out prowling, Sawa
can usually be found in front of a television set indulging his
latest habit, watching wrestling.
 &HT;    Still, he says, his great passion remains acting.
 &HT;    ``I started when I was 10 years old,'' Sawa says. ``I don't know
anything else. I love it.
 &HT;    ``Out of the 14 hours a day you work, the actual two minutes you
get on screen that day are worth it,'' he says. ``To become someone
else, to see the special effects and stunts, is amazing. To see it
all cut together is really worth it. But I love those two
minutes.''
 &HT;    He pauses, groping for words.
 &HT;    ``There's something about when the camera starts rolling and you
start acting,'' he says tentatively. ``You don't feel that there
are 100 people around you. You just feel like you're in a scene,
and when the director yells `Cut,' all of a sudden you are back in
the real world.
 &HT;    ``It's like a drug, really,'' Sawa says. ``You just went away
for two minutes and stepped into a whole new world.
 &HT;    ``It's the coolest thing ever.''

   LOS ANGELES _ In the end _ and the end may be near _ it is
apparently not enough that John McCain be a proabortion,
anti-Christian, media-courting, liberal-attracting, high-taxes
preservationist, at least to George W. Bush's inventively
opportunistic campaign. It is also important that he be pro-breast
cancer and a polluter.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush's assault has been textbook evisceration built on
a paper-thin veneer of injured innocence (he compared me to
Clinton, made me out as an anti-Catholic bigot).
</P>
<P>
   The latest misportrayal of McCain deserves more notice than it's
getting, especially as a window on the man with the smirk whose
weird, college boy mind-set led him to chuckle through a question
and follow-up on the death penalty during the recent debate here.
</P>
<P>
   The attack has a twofold purpose: giving Bush at least an even
chance of taking New York and Connecticut's primaries this week and
adding an overall popular vote victory in California to his
expected sweep of the Republican delegates at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Each element of the attack is fraudulent. Talk about jarring
``news'': McCain opposes money for vital breast cancer programs,
and his fight against renewable energy is responsible for the
coal-burning plants that foul East and West Coast air and water.
</P>
<P>
   Jarring, indeed, and also false _ hallmarks of Bush campaigns
going back to Willie Horton and Boston Harbor days. In the case of
the environmental accusation, there is a continuity back to Bush's
father's adoption of the furloughed Horton in 1988 _ the use of
so-called ``independent'' expenditures to take care of the rough
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The breast cancer canard, however, is a direct Bush operation.
In a commercial that was followed by a personal appearance at a
cancer center on Long Island, Bush uses a cancer survivor to charge
McCain with fighting funds for breast cancer programs. With horror,
she intones, ``That's shocking; America deserves better.'' The
survivor, Geri Barish, doesn't disclose that she is a major crony
of New York's top Bush-backer, Governor George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   And the truth is that McCain is a solid supporter of research
and treatment programs for breast cancer, and always has been,
especially when what's before him in Congress are the bills that
actually produce the money as opposed to publicity stunts for the
folks back home.
</P>
<P>
   What he opposes is pork-barrel. In this case, Bush has seized on
votes against amendments to extraneous legislation purporting to
increase funding, usually with juicy allocation formulas that make
the sponsoring senator look generous. These kinds of proposals are
made only in the confident expectation that they will not become
law.
</P>
<P>
   If what is involved is an actual appropriations bills for health
programs, McCain is a reliable yes vote when the bills conform to
congressional budget rules. The facts, however, are irelevant when
Bush Rules are operating.
</P>
<P>
   So also is the more relevant fact that Texas is one of the most
dangerous places for a woman to live. It ranks 50th in its
percentage of women with health insurance; the figure of 21.9
percent without any coverage compares with 13.8 percent nationally.
And one study found that nearly half the Texas women over 50 had
not had a mammogram and breast exam in the last two years.
Attacking someone on an issue where you are the bad guy has got to
be a new low.
</P>
<P>
   That goes double for the environment. Again, the pretext for the
Republican attack on McCain is an irrelevant vote. Last year
Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont sought to amend the spending bill
for energy programs to add money for solar and other renewable
projects. Some was legit, some pork to attract votes from other
senators with home-state goodies. As a tough foe of this kind of
politics, McCain voted against Jeffords on a procedural issue. But
on the actual merits, it turns out McCain is one Reagan
conservative with a pretty solid environmental record. He was on
board for the important fights, including the Clean Air Act
toughening 10 years ago and the national energy policy statute in
1992, both of which had several renewable energy components. And
his record on spending bills shows four no votes in 11 years, each
on pork, not policy grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the dishonest advertising in New York and out here
is also sinister. It is nominally independent, put on by a group
(Republicans for Clean Air) that didn't exist until these ads, and
lives in a post office box. Its treasurer is a Washington sharpie
who specializes in this junk. And the media buy was made by the
firm run by Pataki's consultant, who also placed earliers ads
conveniently condemning Steve Forbes when his wallet was deemed a
threat to Bush. Worse, the ads exploit a new campaign finance
loophole allowing unlimited spending by ``organizations'' whose
backers can be hidden from view.
</P>
<P>
   The truth will catch up too slowly here. McCain is in mortal
peril for lots of reasons. But the tactics used against him should
be remembered as the year goes on; they were dirty and dishonest.

NATION OF ISLAM SOFTENING ITS MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nation of Islam, for decades renounced by many Muslims for
unorthodox and racially divisive beliefs, increasingly is embracing
traditional Islam, say close observers of the Nation of Islam,
including some gathered at a conference on Islam at Harvard this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan in a speech last Sunday
appeared to have abandoned two tenets of the Nation of Islam that
are anathema to orthodox Muslims: that Nation of Islam founder
Wallace Fard Muhammad was an incarnation of Allah, and that Fard's
successor, Elijah Muhammad, was a prophet.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan, who had a brush with death while battling prostate
cancer last year, had already taken several steps toward a
rapprochement between the Nation of Islam and orthodox Islam. Last
year he urged Nation of Islam members to begin observing Ramadan,
an Islamic holy month, at the same time as orthodox Muslims, as
well as during a second period of time prescribed by Elijah
Muhammad. Farrakhan has also indicated that he wants to take
thousands of Nation of Islam members on a pilgrimage, or hajj, to
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Making such a pilgrimage is considered desirable for observant
Muslims, and although Farrakhan has done so before, he has never
led a large group of Nation of Islam members.
</P>
<P>
   Following a conciliatory speech by Farrakhan in Chicago last
weekend, African-American Muslim leaders and religion scholars say
they detect an important shift underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have just witnessed is a total theological
transformation of the Nation of Islam, which for 70 years has given
blacks a great sense of dignity and self-worth but also has
perpetuated a skewed and distorted version of Islam,'' said Arthur
Magida, a Farrakhan biographer. ``And if Farrakhan really embraces
a color-blind Islam now, then he will have made a clean break with
the full tradition, which has always pitted black against white.''
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance with orthodox Muslim leaders on Feb. 25 and in
a speech two days later, Farrakhan eschewed the inflammatory
rhetoric for which he is known, and suggested that he is ready to
erase the main theological differences that have divided the Nation
of Islam from orthodox Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has Farrakhan changed?'' he asked. ``Yeah, I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there remain stumbling blocks to unity with
orthodox Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are indications that Farrakhan is trying to
diversify the Nation of Islam _ he is hoping Asian-Americans,
Hispanics and even whites will join a Million Families March he is
planning as a follow up to the Million Man March of 1995 _ he has
not formally renounced the Nation of Islam teaching that whites are
a devil race. Farrakhan has in the past drawn criticism for racist
and anti-Semitic oratory.
</P>
<P>
   And the Nation of Islam's newspaper, the Final Call, continues
to publish a list of beliefs that contradict Islamic teachings that
Allah takes no human form and Mohammed was the final prophet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of suspicions right now, partly because
Farrakhan has said things in the past, but his actions were
different,'' said Lawrence H. Mamiya, an expert on the Nation of
Islam who teaches Africana studies and religion at Vassar College.
</P>
<P>
   But Mamiya calls last weekend's events historic, and says the
Nation of Islam will continue to play an important role in the
spiritual life of some black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farrakhan will continue to emphasize the need for a special
message to black people, which has been the forte of the Nation of
Islam in the past,'' he said. ``The Nation of Islam is still
playing a very important role in black communities, especially
among the underclass and those in prison, and their whole effort to
reform the lives of poor black people is still going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, leaders of the Nation of Islam and the largest
group of Sunni Muslims in the United States both said they regard
the changes as significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known each other since we were young men, and I'm
convinced I'm hearing a new Farrakhan, a different man,'' said Imam
Warith Deen Mohammed, a son of Elijah Muhammad who renounced his
father's teachings and now leads a group of Sunni Muslims called
the Muslim American Society, which claims 2 million followers.
``This means we can now accept him as a great leader, perhaps the
most popular leader in the African-American Muslim community.''
</P>
<P>
   Warith Deen Mohammed said he has been working ``to help them (in
the Nation of Islam) free themselves from the false concepts of
reality that would burden them forever'' and that, even today, ``we
know they have certain fundamental attachments to the past that for
us represent a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Nation of Islam historically played an important
role for ``the African-American culturally deprived masses,'' but
that the role is less important today, when the black community is
more educated and more integrated by the mass media into mainstream
American thought.
</P>
<P>
   Warith Deen Mohammed said he expects that as a result of
Farrakhan's evolving views, it is possible that a more radical
splinter group will break away from the Nation of Islam. However,
he said, ``it's going to be a small number of African-Americans,
because of misery and hurt and blinded by their own inability to be
successful, who will be the desperate ones asking for people to
denounce the country and denounce Christianity, and their numbers
are going to keep diminishing. The world is too open now and too
filled with knowledge for there to be big masses attracted to those
old teachings. I don't see a big role for anybody to hold on to
those ideas I was given when I was a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Minister Don Muhammad, the Nation of Islam's top official in
Boston, said he sees no theological division between the Nation of
Islam and orthodox Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adherent to the faith today would be doing Allah a
disservice if he attempted to align himself with one group or
another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Minister Don Muhammad did not describe the
Nation of Islam's founders in prophetic terms, instead saying ``All
Muslims believe in Allah and the prophet Mohammed, but the
honorable Elijah Muhammad can never be denied for the great work he
did. The prophet Mohammed never had to deal with drugs and AIDS and
the kinds of things that plague the black community today.'' He
described Elijah Muhammad as ``a direct messenger to black
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Don Muhammad said the Nation of Islam still has an important
role to play as a distinct organization, if not a distinct
religion. He said black Americans ``are in a serious, pitiful
condition as it relates to other civilized people on earth; we've
got problems other ethnic groups do not have, and we cannot go any
further without addressing them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Nation can help black Americans tackle those issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are black people in this country who really need at this
time Mr. (Elijah) Muhammad's teaching about doing for themselves,
staying with their families and taking care of their children,'' he
said. ``These aspects have nothing to do with religion itself, but
it is part of the Nation of Islam's work, and these are aspects the
Nation of Islam must address.''

 LORD JEFF: HERO, VILLAIN, AND COLLEGE TOWN'S NAMESAKE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ Lord Jeffrey Amherst dispatched the French and
Indians with such finesse some 240 years ago that in his honor, a
prominent college, a glacier, a mountain, and more than 20 towns,
including this one, proudly took his name.
</P>
<P>
   But history of late is being less kind to Lord Jeff. A small but
vocal group of citizens is questioning the propriety of naming
places after a guy, it turns out, who ordered killing Native
Americans by deliberately issuing them blankets infected with small
pox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where political correctness ends, but I know
where it starts,'' said Jack Dunphy, who is leading a charge
against Lord Jeff. ``This guy committed an egregious deed. Amherst
should not bear his name.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dunphy and associates have their way, Amherst someday might
be renamed for one of the early tribal chiefs of the area, perhaps
Chuckwalop, Umpanchala, or Quonquont. And Lord Jeff would be
relegated to a historical marker somewhere explaining how he was a
father of germ warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the latest example of how politically adjusted
perspective is trying _ literally _ to change the map.
</P>
<P>
   The US Board on Geographic Names receives about 450 requests a
year to name or rename places nationwide. About half the inquiries
that come to the Reston, Va., headquarters target previously
unnamed features _ a hill or ridge, for example.
</P>
<P>
   However, the other half address names that may have once been
acceptable, but for reasons of historical fact or political
correctness are now considered inappropriate by some, according to
Roger Payne, the board's executive secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is never easy. The response is almost always emotional when
change is the issue,'' said Payne.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, changing the name of the western Massachusetts
college town is a long shot _ not to mention the glacier and
mountain peak in Alaska named by Amherst graduates at the turn of
the last century. In fact, some 85 places nationwide offically
carry the Amherst name, apparently most, if not all, honoring Lord
Jeffrey or the college bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not named after Lord Jeff,'' said Douglas Wilson, a
spokesman for the prestigious college. ``We're named after the town
that took his name. But it would be fair to say we have adopted
him.'' The college team mascots are the Lord Jeffs and Lady Jeffs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some people around Amherst appear inclined to distance
themselves from their namesake. Michael Maderia, innkeeper of the
quaint 74-year-old Lord Jeffery Inn, said his establishment has
been fingered occasionally by critical students as the original
home of Lord Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord Jeff never came close to this area,'' Maderia emphasized.
He said life might be a little easier sometimes if his inn had
another name. ``But for this, you would have to start by renaming
the town, then the college _ which owns the inn,'' Maderia said.
</P>
<P>
   A pamplet distributed by the Amherst History Museum confirms
that the lord never came closer to Amherst than northwestern New
York State. As for the business of genocide, the pamphlet sidesteps
the matter. After quoting sermons of the Colonial era extolling
Lord Jeff as a Christian hero who loved the enemies he subdued, it
adds: ``While current residents might have mixed emotions about the
name of Amherst, those living within the region during the mid-18th
century may have been proud to adopt the name.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's heroes, today's criminals: Finding them is not hard,
notes William Fowler, director of the Massachusetts Historical
Society. He and other historians offer a few examples:
</P>
<P>
   --King Charles I of England (Charles River) was such a
tyrannical ruler that he was decapitated in 1649.
</P>
<P>
   --Chief Justice William Stoughton (Stoughton, Stoughton
Junction) presided over Salem Witch Trials.
</P>
<P>
   --Ephraim Williams (Williamstown, Williams College) and son
Elijah worked a land scam to cheat Indians out of hundreds of acres
in western Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   --Nicholas Brown (Brown University) hailed from a family that
made big bucks in textiles _ while dabbling in the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   --George Washington (2,170 features nationwide) had inherited 10
slaves by the time he was 11 years old. When he died, he owned 316
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans school system is midway through renaming 25
schools honoring former slave holders, including the George
Washington Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   The state historian in Connecticut hopes such revisionism does
not migrate north. ``Except for names that have become clearly
derogatory, where do you ever draw the line between a passing fad
and historical significance?'' asks Christopher Collier. ``Perhaps
the best solution is to teach history, not bury it. Because once
you start the process of changing names, it's hard to stem it.''
</P>
<P>
   The name squaw is attached to more than two dozen features in
Maine. But the word is considered today to be a pejorative term for
an Indian woman, and many Native American leaders have pushed to
eliminate it. The Maine Legislature is expected to vote next month
to remove the word from the map, following the lead of Minnesota
and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   In Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (most people are
unaware of the state's full name), legislation introduced last
month aims to strike the slavery-evoking ``plantation'' reference.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three decades, federal officials have allowed 28
places using the term Negro to drop the ethnic label, critics
frequently noting that there were no ``Caucasian Ponds'' or ``White
Man Rivers,'' so why should Negro be acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   Buzzards Bay, however, still has a Negro Ledge, and Plymouth a
Negro Pond. Frances Picket lives on a road that dead ends at Negro
Pond. Sometimes, history cleans itself up along the way.
``Somewhere along the way we all just started calling it Black
Pond,'' said Picket. ``I had no idea it has another name.''
</P>
<P>
   Precedence for changing the name of an entire town is spotty at
best. New England historians say the burgeoning tourist trade a
century ago encouraged some locals to buff up their image, which is
why Herring Gut on the Maine coast became Port Clyde, Ray's Pond in
southern Vermont became Lake Rayponda, and Sodom in northern
Vermont became Adamant.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, some seemingly ignored history in western
Massachusetts lit a fire under Jack Dunphy of Greenfield. A local
newspaper series offered one account after another of Indian
attacks on settlers. But there was no mention of the 1675 attack by
Colonel William Turner (Turners Falls) and Samuel Holyoke (Holyoke)
on an unarmed Indian village. Approximately 300 men, women, and
children were killed, many shot in their wigwams.
</P>
<P>
   And there was no mention of Lord Jeffrey's plague-infected
blankets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will Do well,'' Amherst wrote a commander in the field,
``to try to Inoculate the Indians, by means of Blankets, as well as
to Try Every other Methode, that can Serve to Extirpate this
Execrable Race.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter d'Errico, a law professor at the University of
Massachusetts, Amherst, has done extensive research on this and
other dispatches attributed to Amherst. He has little doubt that
Lord Jeffrey used small pox to kill, a tactic that historians
believe was well-known to the British military strategists _ and
their Colonial forefathers such as John Winthrop Massachusetts'
first governor. ``For the natives, they are all dead of small
Poxe,'' Winthrop wrote, ``so as the Lord hathe cleared our title to
what we possess.''
</P>
<P>
   Does d'Errico support renaming Amherst? ``A place name is
important. It is remembrance, it is owning up to history,'' he
said. ``So after a real discussion, a real debate, I probably would
support a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunphy said he and a few people got together on Martin Luther
King Day, called themselves People Speak Truth, and started
planning. Now several dozen strong, the group intends to take its
case of ``historical amnesia'' to local schools and colleges.
Eventually, they hope to start a petition drive that puts the
matter before Town Meeting members. To some longtime residents, it
will recall a period in the protest-packed late 1960s when Lord
Jeffrey was a target of criticism that never went very far. To
date, Town Hall has received just one letter on the subject. It was
critical of Lord Jeffrey.
</P>
<P>
   Are Amherst's 35,225 residents destined to live in Chuckwalop?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a stretch,'' said Fowler of the Massachusetts
Historical Society. ``And face it, had it not been for Lord Jeff,
we would all be speaking French.''

Indeed, for all the talk of Lebanese terrorism, it is Hezbollah

<P>
   John McCain's behavior bears the hallmarks of reckless political
courage. Denouncing the Reverend Pat Robertson, founder of the
Christian Coalition, in his own Virginia hometown, was a remarkable
moment in recent Republican history. Never before has a
presidential candidate nominee castigated the religious right like
that. It was not just a Sister Souljah moment, mimicking Bill
Clinton's 1992 attack on black extremism, it was a brother,
grandmother and indeed entire Souljah family moment. &QL;

THE OTHER JOHN MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There appear to be two McCains running for president.
</P>
<P>
   One is the John McCain who has ignited much of the electorate
with his almost refreshing anti-establishment insurgency campaign,
the candidate who has fought the big tobacco lobby and is fighting
to overhaul campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign style has appealed to the more moderate Democrats
and independents who may see the views of Democratic hopefuls Al
Gore and Bill Bradley as too liberal. It is this McCain who thus
far has attracted enough of these voters to make for a battle with
George W. Bush for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The other John McCain is far more conservative than he has
appeared at this stage of his campaign, perhaps more so than the
Democrats and independents who have voted for him, and more
conservative than those who expect to vote for him on the next two
Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been aligned with Democrats on a few issues such
as the anti-tobacco bill and campaign finance reform, McCain has
proved to be far to the right on other key issues.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, McCain voted in 1993 against the Brady bill,
which required a waiting period and a criminal background check on
customers wishing to buy a handgun. The bill eventually passed
through Congress and was signed into law. He voted against the 1994
crime bill, which included the outlawing of semiautomatic assault
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also voted for most of the provisions in Newt Gingrich's
famous 1994 campaign document Contract with America, and in 1996 he
voted against a measure that would ban job discrimination against
gays.
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Democratic Action, the nation's oldest liberal
advocacy organization, recently issued a new study of McCain's
voting record and gave him a lifetime liberal voting average of 9
percent out of 100. The percentage is based on more than 300 House
and Senate votes cast since he was elected to the House in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent MSNBC online article, an ADA spokeswoman said that
just because he went against the GOP mainstream by voting against
the tobacco industry and for campaign finance reform doesn't make
him liberal. ``All it proves,'' she said, ``is you can't be wrong
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the American Conservative Union, which
publishes annual ratings of members of Congress based on key
selected votes, noted that over his career, McCain has a solidly
conservative voting record.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's record on labor is probably more conservative than many
of his Democratic supporters who support organized labor. The
national AFL-CIO, which endorsed Gore, gave McCain a rating of zero
in 1999 and a lifetime rating of 15 percent out of 100. The
national labor organization cited McCain's vote last year against a
bill that would send federal aid to public school districts and
recruit 100,000 new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental
lobbying group, gave McCain a rating of 7 percent in 1995 and a
rating of 15 percent for his 1998 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The league specifically referred to his votes to allow timber
companies to cut trees in national forests without adequate
environmental safeguards. He also voted against an amendment to
keep the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska closed to oil
drilling. As the league noted, McCain does support a bipartisan
effort to protect the Grand Canyon, but that was not enough to get
his rating above 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCain voted to ban late-term abortions, but backed
off an earlier stance on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 US Supreme Court
decision that legalized abortions nationwide. At one point, McCain
was quoted as saying that a repeal of Roe v. Wade must occur, but
only if combined with a sustained effort to reduce the number of
abortions across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He then said last summer that he would not now support repeal of
Roe v. Wade because it would force a number of women to undergo
illegal and dangerous abortions. His message on this issue still
appears to be muddled.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also voted to convict Clinton on impeachment charges of
perjury and obstructing justice, a vote that the vast majority of
Democratic members of Congress, and most of the electorate,
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   After attracting a number of Democrats and independents to his
candidacy, McCain now hopes to appeal to a majority of Republican
voters who have thus far overwhelmingly backed Bush. He is telling
them that he is more like Ronald Reagan, who appealed to both
Republicans and Democrats in his two successful presidential
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But the real McCain is no Reagan. President Reagan had the
charisma and ability to hold onto a majority of core Republican
voters while attracting enough Democrats and independents to
defeat, first, Jimmy Carter and then, in 1984, Walter F. Mondale
for a second term.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, unlike Reagan, has had difficulty gaining a majority of
Republicans in the primaries. Perhaps, with his recent attacks
against Christian Coalition stalwarts such as Pat Robertson, he
will attract more moderate Democrats and independents, and more
moderate Republicans in such key states as California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although only the votes of registered Republicans will bind
delegates in the California primary, McCain is looking to win the
state's open primary so he could at least call the state's
delegate-counting procedure unfair.
</P>
<P>
   After attracting many Democratic and independent voters, McCain
must now woo Republicans by touting his conservative voting record.
If he survives the primary season, he would be well positioned.
Recent polls show that a Gore-Bush matchup would be too close to
call, but a Gore-McCain contest would have McCain winning easily,
largely because of his support from Democrats and independents. But
Democrats and independents might consider that, when voting for
McCain, they are voting for the entire package _ conservative as
well as maverick. The real McCain is someone they ought to get to
know.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DORSET, Vt. _ By the time she sits for the 8 a.m. ``Morning
Meeting'' at the Long Trail School, Amanda Ameden, 13, has been
traveling for 45 minutes, on two separate buses, over winding Green
Mountain passes. A worthwhile sacrifice, says her mother, Teresa
Ameden. Amanda gets to attend the school of her choice. And her
local school board pays a hefty chunk of the private tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Along with some 10,000 students from small Vermont towns, Amanda
takes part in the state's 185-year-old school choice program _
little known outside the state, largely beloved within, and, until
recently, noncontroversial.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the politically driven, experimental voucher systems that
have sparked debate in cities such as Milwaukee, Vermont's
school-choice program was born of necessity. In a sparse, rural
state, many towns are too small to maintain schools of their own.
This way, they can meet their constitutional obligation to provide
an education to every child.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when school vouchers are increasingly mentioned in
presidential debates, Vermont's program now stands as something of
a test case for the complex issue of parental freedom. And it
suggests one way education might be conducted under a President
McCain or a President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 school boards, from resort towns at the foot of ski
mountains to farm communities in the valleys, take part in the
Vermont program, sending their education money to schools outside
their borders. Parochial schools are off-limits, based on a state
Supreme Court decision, but parents can choose public or private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can pick unconventional private schools such as Long
Trail, where teachers go by their first names, two dogs and a cat
roam the halls, and students end the day with chores: emptying the
trash, shaking out rugs, washing dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents and their children hold their voucher system dear.
Families have been known to move to school-choice towns; one
cluster of ski mountain towns continually refuses to pool its
students into a public high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choice,'' Teresa Ameden declares, ``is a wonderful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But some parents and private-school leaders are sensing a
growing threat to the tradition. They point to a unanimous vote the
state Board of Education took about a year ago, suggesting that the
state should stop sending public money to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The vote _ a recommendation that carried no force of law _ was
rescinded the next month amid protest by private-school leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, state education officials downplay its significance.
</P>
<P>
   Board members raised the idea with little thought or research,
said Bill Reedy, legal counsel for the state education department,
who called it ``a quick and not a long-lasting aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   But some voucher advocates saw it as a sign of future threats.
When board members voted, ``I don't think they were on drugs or
sleep-deprived,'' said Mary Barrosse Schwartz, whose daughter
attends Long Trail School. ``To me, that says where they were
coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   She and other activists also worry that a pending bill in the
Legislature, which would create some regional districts for
public-school choice, might eventually be used to replace the
current voucher system.
</P>
<P>
   And Long Trail headmaster Dave Wilson, president of the Vermont
Independent Schools Association, said he hears ``rumblings all the
time'' about limiting private-school choice. ``There's a feeling
the state is creeping more towards invading our independence,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that scrutiny is growing should hardly be a shock;
across the country, vouchers are hot-button stuff. But they are
also edging further into the mainstream political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Several states, including Massachusetts, have experimented with
small choice programs, limited to public schools. But sending
public money to private schools has still been considered a radical
step, used only in rural states such as Vermont and Maine, which
has a similar voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   Reedy said he often gets calls from policy makers in other
states, who ask what they can learn from private vouchers in
Vermont. Not much, he tells them. In most other places, proponents
see the voucher system as a way to spur improvements in failing
public schools, while opponents warn that choice could bleed public
schools of students and money.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, vouchers aren't a remedy; they're available only to
students with no local public schools. And Vermont lacks the racial
diversity of other states, so its vouchers don't raise the
segregation worries that have stirred debate elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wilson calls his state ``a laboratory for school
choice.'' And for his students, he said, the experiment has proved
positive.
</P>
<P>
   Long Trail opened in September 1975 with four teachers, 14
students, and a $100-per-month lease at the Dorset Sportsmen's
Club. It was a large, open room, divided by partitions that were
taken down every Friday afternoon. On weekends, the building was
used for dances.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, the school has 120 students and a
large, rustic building looking out on the Taconic Mountains.
Students have three hours of homework every night, but they also
take part in a host of activities, from cooking to dancing to
tabletennis.
</P>
<P>
   Long Trail has a familial atmosphere, and some students say
that's precisely why they chose the school.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Sarah Kapusta, 17, said teachers seem to care about
students.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Kara Watson, 16, said students repect one another's
differences.
</P>
<P>
   But other students want things that Long Trail doesn't offer.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Tyler Pabst, 15, said he plans to switch schools next
year so he can play on sports teams at a larger school.
</P>
<P>
   That's a benefit of choice, parents say; schools develop their
own personalities, and students and parents can select the schools
that best fit their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids could be matched with institutions, instead of trying to
make every institution provide everything,'' said Lois Fish, whose
son and daughter graduated from Long Trail.
</P>
<P>
   But Reedy questions how many of Vermont's voucher students can
truly take advantage of their choices. Some small private schools
don't have space for every student who wants to attend.
</P>
<P>
   And often, private school tuition costs more than the vouchers
provide. In some cases, school districts make up the difference
through taxes or private donations. Some schools offer
scholarships; Long Trail offers them to about half of its students.
But in some cases, parents have to make up what can be a costly
gap.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation can also be a barrier, said Lorna Jimerson, a
former Vermont school board member who did her doctoral
dissertation on school choice in Minnesota. While some Vermont
schools and towns pay for buses, parents often need to provide
transportation. So if a family wants to take advantage of vouchers,
she said, it'd better have a car with good snow tires.
</P>
<P>
   There's also some evidence that Vermont's voucher system divides
students by social class, Jimerson said.
</P>
<P>
   One recent study showed that students in one school-choice
community, from an island on Lake Champlain, segregated themslves
at will. Some students, it seemed, felt more comfortable around
people with similar backgrounds and picked their schools along
those lines.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a small, rare study, said Bill Mathis,
superintendent of the Rutland Northeast Supervisory Union, a public
school district.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are strong emotions on both sides of the
school-choice debate, even in Vermont, there is very little data on
how the system is actually working.
</P>
<P>
   So as yet, Mathis said, there's no objective way to know whether
other states should see Vermont as a model.
</P>
<P>
   He'd love to see ``good, honest-to-goodness, quality research on
the effects of the existing system,'' he said, to ``see whether
it's a subsidy for rich parents that really isn't available for
not-so-rich parents. School-choice schemes are put out there as a
panacea. Let's go have a look.''

SAN FRANCISCO _  &UR; POTPOURRI &LR;  _ Preliminary California wine-grape
crush numbers are in for vintage '99 and the news is mixed. On the
upside, the California Agricultural Statistics Service reports that
the numbers for wine grapes crushed in 1999 are up 3 percent from
1998. The downside is that 1999's tonnage for Chardonnay, America's
most popular white wine, is equal to that of 1998 and less than
that of 1997. &QL;

CALIFORNIA WEIGHS SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BAN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The door-to-door campaign that Shannon Keating has
been waging after work and on weekends is both overtly political
and painfully personal.
</P>
<P>
   Like scores of gays and lesbians across California, Keating is
asking neighbors and strangers to look closely at her life,
detailed in a three-page letter that she usually stuffs in their
mailboxes, but prefers to put in their hands. In it, she and her
partner of 16 years write of raising a son and daughter together in
Redondo Beach, PTA meetings, and Little League games. They wonder
what kind of threat their family could pose to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to introduce myself and say, `Here's my family,
and I'm who you're afraid of,' '' said Keating, an executive with
20th Television, a division of Fox TV. ``It's real personal. I
don't think they understand who they'd be voting against: me.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurring Keating to activism in her off hours is one of the most
hotly contested measures on Tuesday's ballot, one that proponents
say would uphold the sanctity of marriage and opponents call thinly
disguised bigotry. The measure known as Proposition 22 asks voters
to validate only marriages between one man and one woman. Passage
would bar the state of California from recognizing any other kind.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, state code already allows only a man and a woman to
marry. But it does not prevent California from recognizing unions
formalized in other states _ a loophole that supporters of the
``California Protection of Marriage Initiative'' say must be
closed. Although same-sex marriages are prohibited in all 50
states, they warn that a recent Vermont Supreme Court ruling over
domestic partnership rights, under consideration by that state's
Legislature, could lead the way to weddings featuring two men or
two women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to define what a family is or what love is,
but we believe that the ideal for marriage is a man and a woman,''
said Robert Glazier, a spokesman for the Yes on 22 campaign. ``We
understand single-family homes, blended homes, extended familes,
but we believe that is the best way for children to be raised. It
sends a strong message.''
</P>
<P>
   The message, however, depends on the messenger.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say Prop 22, which is leading in the polls, would
change little, except to strengthen existing law. They note that 30
other states have passed definition-of-marriage laws, two of them
through ballot intitiatives such as California's.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Godfrey, a controller for a home remodeling contractor and
Yes on 22 advocate, says he is the one being discriminated against.
According to him, 17 of the signs he placed in front of his house
on a busy Fresno street were stolen, two were vandalized, and a
window was broken. He calls the response to his stance ``borderline
hate.'' Other Prop 22 supporters have reported similar incidents
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the idea of two men or women marrying because I'm
a Christian and in the eyes of God it's not correct, it's not
morally correct,'' said Godfrey, who has never before felt
compelled to get politically involved. ``But I do not discriminate
against gays. I have been taught to love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents scoff at those arguments, saying that Prop 22 would
legalize discrimination against them and possibly force them to
relinquish gains already made. They say the law could be used to
roll back gays' civil rights, overturn domestic partnership
benefits, and prevent hospital visitations where only immediate
family members are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 issue that people have to understand is that they
don't have to support gay marriage to be against the Knight
Initiative,'' said No on 22 campaign manager Mike Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents charge that antigay sentiment is at the root of
the measure, sponsored by a conservative Republican state Senator
William (Pete) Knight, who has tried without success to pass laws
against same-sex marriage and whose son is gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very cynical, trying to twist any fears people may
have about gay people into some triumph for them,'' said state
Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, who is a lesbian. ``The right wing,
frankly, doesn't care which community they're bashing in which
year. If people are worried about illegal immigration, boom, bring
on immigration as an issue. Now it's gay rights. It's really about
fund-raising and wedge-issue politics. It's ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   The divisions, in fact, have broken down along lines that are
sometimes predictable and sometimes not so predictable.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic, Southern Baptist and Mormon churches, for
instance, are pushing hard for passage, while several Jewish and
Protestant leaders have come out in opposition. The California
Republican Party has endorsed the measure. Most Democrats running
for office in California oppose it, as does actress and AIDS
activist Sharon Stone, who whipped off her fox coat at a recent
fund-raiser and auctioned if off for $16,000 to fight the iniative.
Talk radio's Laura Schlessinger, known as Dr. Laura, favors
passage.
</P>
<P>
   Less expected, a small group called Gays for 22 recently
declared its support for Prop 22, saying they favor state's rights
and see no harm in the initiative. A group of moderate Republicans
that includes Ward Connerly, who led the drive to abolish
affirmative action, oppose the measure as unncessary government
intrusion into people's private lives.
</P>
<P>
   David Knight, an Air Force Academy graduate and Gulf War fighter
pilot who has been all but estranged from his father since
announcing he was gay, has also spoken out against Prop 22 from his
home in Baltimore. The senator said foes of the measure ``should be
ashamed for exploiting a private family matter for political
gain.'' But the elder Knight has kept mostly quiet in the weeks
leading up to the election.
</P>
<P>
   A Field Poll conducted the last week of February showed the Yes
on 22 campaign leading 53 percent to 40 percent, virtually
unchanged since the previous poll. Other surveys, such as a
nationwide Harris poll earlier this year, have found little support
for legalizing same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Spiegel and his partner of 15 years, who had a religious
wedding ceremony that is not legally recognized, are raising a
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a simple issue, even if it seems that way,'' said
Spiegel, a real estate attorney in San Francisco. ``We've got to
make people understand that, and the only way we're going to change
their hearts and minds is if they can meet us and learn our stories
and see that they're not so different from their own.''

   It is not Vietnam, nor will it become so. But once again the

in southern Colombia, where an embattled president faces daunting

and the world's largest source of coca, the raw material for

   To bomb the Hezbollah guerrillas fighting Israeli occupation or
just to threaten to bomb? That seems to be the only question the
Israeli government asks itself about Lebanon these days. As a
result, Lebanese civilians suffer much more at Israeli hands than
vice versa. True, Hezbollah used to be an alarmingly active
terrorist group. But nowadays, things are not quite so simple.
Indeed, for all the talk of Lebanese terrorism, it is Hezbollah
that has looked the more disciplined force of late, and Israel that
has been making innocents suffer. &QL;

that. It was not just a Sister Souljah moment, mimicking Bill
Clinton's 1992 attack on black extremism, it was a brother,
grandmother and indeed entire Souljah family moment. &QL;

became bored and baffled by the legal intricacies of the case, and
lapsed into indifference. Chileans discovered that life without

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The Chronicle offers readers the recipe
for an outstanding dish at a Bay Area restaurant, plus the chef's
secrets for making it a success. Tips and recipe follow in optional
trim.  By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Fabrice Marcon was born and raised in France and
started cooking when he was 14, coming to the United States after
serving as a sous chef under Paul Bocuse. The guy knows how to
cook, which shows at the charming Hyde Street Bistro, which he
bought in 1997. Here he brings his talents to the table to create
simple, straightforward French-California food.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His Potato Roquefort Cakes are a great example of his cooking
philosophy. He mixes creamy mashed potatoes with crumbly Roquefort
cheese, forms them into patties and sautees them to crisp the
outside. He then puts them on a bed of greens studded with juicy
ripe pears, setting up a sweet-tangy contrast. To bring it all
together, he drizzles a little hazelnut oil over the salad, adding
a nutty nuance and creating a clever twist to the classic nuts,
cheese and fruit combination.
</P>
<P>
   The small, one-room restaurant is unpretentious yet charming,
with an alcove off to one side for larger parties. It's a perfect
neighborhood spot for rustic yet sophisticated country fare.

</P>
<P>
   8 ounces firm Roquefort cheese, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   11/2 ripe Anjou pears, stemmed, cored and diced

<P>
   Pierce the potatoes in several places, then bake in a preheated

supermarkets.  
 
 TASTER'S CHOICE: Spicy Pasta Sauces Can Empty Your Wallet   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  The booming market for pasta sauce shows no sign
of slowing, and the latest trend appears to be ``authentic''
varieties based on Italian recipes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year the panel tasted jarred  &LR; puttanesca &LR;  sauces, which
combine chopped tomatoes, capers, olives, garlic, anchovies and
spices. Today's panel tried another Italian classic:  &LR; arrabbiata &LR; ,
a spicy tomato sauce with chile peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of today's sauces were significantly more expensive than
regular jarred sauces, ranging from $5.89 for just over nine ounces
to a wallet-emptying $10.99 for 32 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists couldn't agree on a favorite, and weren't particularly
impressed with the category as a whole. The biggest complaint was
that the spice in many of the sauces was too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   First place went to  &UR; Rao's Homemade &LR;  (24 ounces, $10.99 at
Andronico's), the most expensive brand sampled. Panelists liked the
tomato flavor, but thought it wasn't spicy enough to be considered
an arrabbiata. Several disliked the texture, which they described
as gelatinous and floury. Three would buy it, one might buy it, and
one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Imported  &UR; Rustichella D'Abruzzo &LR;  (9.53 ounces, $5.89 at Whole
Foods) came in second. Two panelists liked the flavor, but others
found it acidic and metallic, and objected to an overly smooth
texture. One would buy it, two might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Third place was a tie between  &UR; Coppola Mammarella &LR;  (26 ounces,
$5.99 at Andronico's) and  &UR; Don Pomodoro &LR;  (25.4 ounces, $5.99 at
Andronico's).
</P>
<P>
   One panelist thought the Coppola sauce looked the most homemade,
but two others thought it looked and tasted watery. Many thought
garlic overpowered other flavors. Two might buy it; three would
not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were divided on Don Pomodoro, the other imported
brand. One thought it was too spicy and harsh, but two others liked
the spice. Still another thought it was too mild, tasting more like
stewed tomatoes. Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Coco Pazzo &LR;  (24 ounces, $7.49 at Rainbow
Grocery). Three panelists thought the sauce was so overseasoned
with dried herbs that it tasted bitter; one described it as
``oregano sauce with some tomato.'' One might buy it; four would
not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Roland Passot,
chef-owner of La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in Larkspur
and Menlo Park; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and Kirk
Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are
tasted blind.

   It is not Vietnam, nor will it become so. But once again the

and the world's largest source of coca, the raw material for
cocaine. &QL;

   To bomb the Hezbollah guerrillas fighting Israeli occupation or
just to threaten to bomb? That seems to be the only question the
Israeli government asks itself about Lebanon these days. As a
result, Lebanese civilians suffer much more at Israeli hands than
vice versa. True, Hezbollah used to be an alarmingly active
terrorist group. But nowadays, things are not quite so simple.
Indeed, for all the talk of Lebanese terrorism, it is Hezbollah
that has looked the more disciplined force of late, and Israel that
has been making innocents suffer. &QL;

that. It was not just a Sister Souljah moment, mimicking Bill
Clinton's 1992 attack on black extremism, it was a brother,
grandmother and indeed entire Souljah family moment. &QL;

became bored and baffled by the legal intricacies of the case, and
lapsed into indifference. Chileans discovered that life without

`EYES WIDE SHUT' OPENS ON DVD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' arrives on VHS and DVD on
Tuesday, marking the anniversary of the director's death on March
7, 1999. When the film was released, last August, it was greeted
with a host of negative reviews. Its theatrical run was over in two
weeks and, while it subsequently grossed a respectable $155 million
worldwide, it didn't live up to its prerelease hype.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD version is a remarkable way to appreciate a much
misunderstood masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD includes the 159-minute film and 42 minutes of brief
interviews with stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman and, for some
inexplicable reason, Steven Spielberg, conducted after the film's
release. It's also the American version, with the ``offending'' few
seconds of a couple doing the NC-17 obscured. (To protect
</P>
<P>
   EYES, Page N14 &QL; 
our Puritanical sensibilites, a pair of partygoers were digitally
readjusted.) Some may be disappointed that the DVD doesn't include
the uncensored, mature European version.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick masterfully weaves story, performance, language,
lighting, color, editing, framing, music, and camera movement into
a complex symphony about the infinite capacity of human beings to
hide their secrets, deceive themselves, and ritualize away their
own humanity.
</P>
<P>
   When the film was released, most critics were dismissive. They
evaluated ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' Kubrick's first film since 1987's
``Full Metal Jacket,'' as if it were just another Friday movie
opening. Many of them didn't even respect it enough to hate it.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Siegel, in a sharp, smart celebration of the film in the
October issue of Harper's, lined up a sampling of critics' quotes:
</P>
<P>
   --``This two hour and 39 minute gloss on Arthur Schnitzler's
fantasmagoric novella feels like a rough draft at best.'' J.
Hoberman in The Village Voice.
</P>
<P>
   --``Ridiculously though intellectually overhyped for the very
marginal entertainment, edification and titillation it provides
over its somewhat turgid 159 minute running time.'' Andrew Sarris
in The New York Observer.
</P>
<P>
   --``In `Eyes Wide Shut' nothing works.'' Louis Menand in The New
York Review of Books.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick, who died six months before the film's release, may have
foreshadowed the critical and commercial American reaction to his
final film when he named it ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A simple story &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The story is simple _ at least on the surface. Dr. Bill (Cruise)
and Alice (Kidman) are a well-to-do married New York couple. They
have, as the saying goes, everything going for them. Beauty.
Wealth. A healthy child. They go to an elegant Christmas party
where an elderly Hungarian flirts with Alice and two models flirt
with him. Downstairs, in the ballroom, the zombielike guests look
very much like the resurrected ghosts at the Overlook in ``The
Shining'' (1980). Upstairs, tucked away in a bathroom, a hooker is
passed out from an overdose. She's revived by Dr. Bill. But the
incident remains a secret between the doctor and his host, the
oleaginous Mr. Ziegler (Sydney Pollack).
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Dr. Bill and Alice are home in bed smoking
marijuana, she reveals a secret to him about a previous dalliance
she had with a sailor. This admission ignites a series of events
that involve Bill going on a dreamlike trip through a faux
Manhattan, much like the Nighttown sequence in James Joyce's
``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is set at Christmastime, and Kubrick opens virtually
every sequence with tired, lifeless Christmas trees _ reinforcing
the mood with Christmas cards and garish lights. Where's the peace?
Where's the good will? Gifts are no longer an expression of
generosity but a conditioned response to a tradition repeated so
many times it's lost its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   When the film came out in August there was a bellowing hue and
cry that Kubrick had promised a sexy film with Cruise and Kidman.
Frontal nudity. Hot stuff. Porno for the intelligentsia. First of
all, he promised no such thing. Even the film's most virulent
detractors would admit that if Stanley Kubrick wanted to make an
erotic film, he could have easily constructed the lustiest film
ever made.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a sexy film, but a film about sex. And Kubrick has some
very tantalizing notions on the subject. The only sexy scenes are
the black-and-white sequences featuring Alice and the naval officer
and, most important, imagined by her husband.
</P>
<P>
   In one of Kubrick's most brilliant touches _ the much-maligned
orgy sequence _ he manages to make gorgeous naked women dull. With
a faux Gregorian chant on the soundtrack and a central figure
dressed in red conducting the proceedings in a cathedral-like
rotunda, Kubrick suggests that even sex has become hammered into a
quasireligion. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A critical debate &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using sex, Kubrick shows us how that spontaneous event is
crushed by repetitive ritual.
</P>
<P>
   One of the critical debates involves whether the film is a total
or partial dream. Kubrick doesn't provide any obvious clues such as
out-of-focus cinematography or hazy imagery. But his New York City
is a quasi-Manhattan. There are identifiable landmarks such as
yellow cabs and newsstands, but the odd lighting and set designs
suggest a twilight zone somewhere between sleep and awareness. This
is the state where Kubrick seems most comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick has an undeserved reputation as a prefab director, that
is, a cold, calculating film scientist who forces the actors to go
through his minutely detailed, preconceived choreographed motions.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Casting Cruise and Kidman
was not for the obvious marketing appeal, but because Kubrick was
curious to find out what would happen when he put a celebrated,
married, acting couple through a film that centered on a
nightmarish marital crisis. He was genuinely curious about what
might transpire.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most difficult sequences, when Dr. Bill is
confronted by a gang of homophobic toughs, it's clear that Kubrick
is using the unsubstantiated rumors of Cruise's bisexuality to
inspire both the actor and character to new heights of
interpretation. Kubrick was using Cruise and Kidman as conduits to
the people he was really after _ the audience. He might have
thought that if he got the two stars to raise the bar, the viewers
would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick, according to Cruise in the DVD interview, told him,
``We've got to earn every scene with this character.'' And he did.
Kidman did as well. Courageous, tough, and sensitive, Kidman's
Alice, lost in wonderland, has moments when she sees through all
the conditioned behavior. And Kidman left the film with a profound
respect for its maker.
</P>
<P>
   As she relates on the DVD interview, ``Stanley lived films . . .
he loved films . . . he had a belief in the purity of filmmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicholson, who gave a stunning performance in ``The
Shining'' _ another film that wasn't given its artistic due until
years after its original release _ endorses Kubrick's working
methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanley invites you to participate in his films,'' he says.
``You're never allowed a shortcut. You can't go through the
motions. Not only was he a great filmmaker, he was also a great
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   A great audience is what ``Eyes Wide Shut'' deserves.
</P>
<P>
   One virtue of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' especially on DVD, is that,
like all of Kubrick's other films, it improves with each viewing.
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, there are clues to be left and plots to
be served and characters to be drawn, but what remains is an enigma
as puzzling as the apes confronting the monolith in ``2001: A Space
Odyssey'' (1968).
</P>
<P>
   In a piece of irony that would probably be too much for the
subtle Kubrick, the critical pounding delivered by critics to his
last film is a confirmation of his theme _ that we've become so
conditioned by the manipulative cliches of movies that when one
arrives that doesn't fit the mold, people don't know what to think.
Watch ``Eyes Wide Shut'' with both eyes wide open.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Clouds Hover Over Vintage '99  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Preliminary California wine-grape crush numbers
are in for vintage '99 and the news is mixed. On the upside, the
California Agricultural Statistics Service reports that some 2.6
million tons of wine grapes were crushed in 1999, up 3 percent from
1998's crush of 2.5 million wine-grape tons.
<P>
   The downside is that tonnage for Chardonnay, America's most
popular white wine, is off. Fact is, reports wine business
consultants Motto, Kryla &AMP; Fisher, 1999 Chardonnay tonnage
statistically was even with that of 1998, but did not reach the
same tonnage harvested in 1997. Eric Sims, of MK&AMP;F, says that
458,000 tons of Chardonnay were crushed in 1999, compared to
428,000 tons in '98 and 491,000 tons in '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that means,'' explains Sims, ``is that the demand for all
California wine, including Chardonnay, is greater than the
California wine supply.'' He adds that a fixed supply can mean only
one thing; ``Consumers can expect higher prices for California
wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims points out that coastal Chardonnay brands (Robert Mondavi
Coastal, Beaulieu Vineyard Coastal) will be hardest hit by the
lower '99 crush, the result of a cool summer, since the outp
</P>
<P>
   A`'or
Chardonnay in the Central Coast region that extends from Monterey
to Santa Barbara fell in '99. This is especially bothersome since
the region has experienced heavy grapevine plantings in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The sunny side of the 1999 California wine-grape picture, says
Sims, is consumers can expect some very good '99 wines at low
prices from the Central Valley. ``Central Valley wine-grape areas
like Lodi experienced excellent growing weather in '99, so I think
we'll see some outstanding wines, like Lodi Zinfandels, at very
good prices.'' Sims predicts that '99 Central Valley wines will be
of higher quality at lower prices than coastal wines.
</P>
<P>
   Red-wine drinkers, especially with a taste for Cabernet
Sauvignon above $10, also may be looking at higher prices. The
Agriculture Department report shows that the 1999 crop for Cabernet
Sauvignon in Napa, Sonoma and Monterey were all off _ a clear
indication, says Sims, that prices are likely to go up for premium
Cabernet Sauvignon. The Cabernet crop for 1999 was down 12 percent
in Napa County, 13 percent in Sonoma County and a whopping 26
percent in Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Meanwhile in Australia &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While California deals with a problematic 1999 wine-grape
vintage, Australia reports a record crush in 2000 of 1.2 million
tons, up from the 1.12 million tons posted in 1999. An official of
the Winemakers' Federation of Australia states, however, that the
record 2000 crush is about 8 percent less than earlier
expectations. Blame late-season cold weather for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Couple the healthy growth from the 2000 vintage in Australia
with the country's soaring wine exports and you have a new
competition to the already over-heated and over-priced U.S. wine
market. In less then 10 years, Australia doubled the area under
wine grapes and boosted wine production over the last 15 years from
10 million liters in 1985-'86 to approximately 200 million liters
in 1989-'99.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bragging Rights &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What winery, in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere, can
rightfully lay claim to the first wine released from grapes
harvested in the year 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood Ridge Vineyards, in Mendocino's Anderson Valley, will
release Year of the Dragon, a ``very, very, very late-harvest white
Riesling'' on March 15, saying the wine is the ``first enological
baby of the millennium.'' Late-harvest wines usually are picked
after the other grapes are in, sometimes as late as December, but
rarely into January of the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood Ridge 2000 Year of the Dragon Late Harvest Riesling,
will sell for $20 and be available throughout the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Merlot is fast becoming one of America's most popular red wines,
but it isn't without controversy. Once a blending grape in Bordeaux
that stood in the shadow of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot is more
widely planted there now than Cabernet. The shift is mainly due to
changing worldwide tastes for softer consumer-friendly red wines.
</P>
<P>
   Merlot from the best Pomerol chateau, such as Petrus, will age
for 30 years, producing an elegant wine with great depth. But
so-called New World Merlots, especially from California, are softer
and rounder.
</P>
<P>
   Merlot is grown in all of California's main wine regions and
does well in Eastern Washington, Southern Oregon and New York's
Long Island. Popular Merlots also are available from Chile and
Northern Italy. New Zealand Merlots and Merlot-Cabernet blends from
Hawkes Bay are the latest finds from the Southern Hemisphere.

 BEST WAY: How to Dress a Salad   By Margarita Camacho  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  The task of dressing a salad seems simple enough,
but the two basic methods of produce very different results.
<TEXT>
<P>
   To find out which way is best, The Chronicle Food department
began with two straightforward salads. Each was composed of 21/2
ounces of mixed baby greens, 1/2 thinly sliced cucumber, 1/2
julienned carrot and 11/2 medium tomatoes, cut into wedges. We then
made a basic vinaigrette using 1 part red wine vinegar to 2 parts
olive oil, and seasoned it to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   For the first salad, we mixed all the vegetables and greens
together, then added 21/2 tablespoons of the dressing. We tossed
it, seasoned it with two large pinches of salt and pepper, and
tossed again.
</P>
<P>
   For the second salad, we dressed each component individually. We
tossed the greens with 1 tablespoon vinaigrette and seasoned them
with a pinch of salt and pepper. We then tossed the carrot,
cucumber and tomatoes separately in their own bowls with 1 teaspoon
vinaigrette per bowl and very small pinches of salt and pepper.
Finally, we combined all the ingredients in one large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   We did not expect much difference between the two salads, but we
were wrong. With the first method, the salad looked good and tasted
fine, but was nothing special. But with the second method, where
the components were first dressed individually, the salad not only
looked better overall but each ingredient appeared brighter and
more appealing on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The second salad also had better flavor. The greens tasted
bright, the carrots were light, the cucumbers were refreshing and
the tomatoes seemed more tomato-y.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a difference in the wilt factor. After letting
the salads sit for a few hours, the first one was limp and looked
tired. The second one wilted a bit, but retained its bright
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Treat each component separately. Toss half the dressing with the
greens and use the remaining dressing on individual ingredients.
Finally, toss everything together. The taste and appearance are
worth the trouble.

FILLING IN THE CANVAS OF `ART' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN DEZELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Art'' is a play about three men, a painting, and lofty ideas
that blow a 15-year friendship apart.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly the standard stuff of contemporary stage comedy, it is
less so because the characters are middle-aged professional
Parisians; the painting is abstract; and the insults lobbed _ one
character calls another an ``enemy of modernism'' _ are not
fighting words, at least in most American vocabularies.
</P>
<P>
   But Paris-born playwright Yasmina Reza's ``Art,'' which won the
1998 Tony Award for best play and the Laurence Olivier Award for
best comedy in 1997, was a hit on Broadway and in London's West
End. It's been staged in more than two dozen countries in the past
three years. The touring production, starring Judd Hirsch, has been
playing to critical accolades and full houses in cities all over
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch plays Marc, an aeronautical engineer appalled that his
close friend Serge (Cotter Smith), a successful dermatologist, has
paid $40,000 for a monochrome painting.
</P>
<P>
   It's all white, sputters Marc. All right, it's got three
off-white lines in it. Whatever: It's still execrable, a bad joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marc believes that he's developed a certain taste in this
world which is worthwhile,'' Hirsch said recently over lunch in
Boston. ``He believes that he's not quite like everybody else. And
he's come to understand that there's a value in that. He's someone
who tests his identity by sort of exposing hypocrisy or exposing
anything that is less than honest.''
</P>
<P>
   As Marc sees it, Serge's pricey monotone canvas embodies the
essence of silly intellectual pretense. Worse, the work seems to be
an emblem of Serge's newfound identity _ his embrace of an
intellectual life and social set that doesn't involve his onetime
mentor, Marc.
</P>
<P>
   Serge gets upset, irritated, then angry with his friend's
response. He defends the painting on aesthetic grounds, pointing
out that the purchase is a good investment. That is yet another
signal, to Marc, that civilization as he likes to think of it has
come to an end. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A third opinion &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marc turns to their mutual friend, Yvan (Jack Willis), to
arbitrate. But Yvan considers himself ``a lightweight, I have no
opinions.'' Preoccupied with a new job and a marriage he probably
shouldn't be getting into, he tries to placate Marc and Serge _ and
ends up alienating both.
</P>
<P>
   On a night the three have plans to go out to dinner and a movie,
their differences over the painting devolve into a three-way
argument. Accusations are hurled, grievances unfurled. Serge and
Marc come close to blows and Yvan ends up mistakenly getting hit.
</P>
<P>
   Marc, Serge, and Yvan wonder what they have ever had in common,
and realize that their relationship has instinctively relied on
leaving vital things unsaid. Honesty is a form of betrayal among
these three. They're awed by the seeming impossibility of
maintaining close friendships over time _ but more so by the
prospect of not doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a relationship you would ordinarily run into,''
said Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   ``American men do have friendships, but they're not friendships
like this. There's nothing about sports in this whole damned thing.
There's nothing about competition in any other way. There's nothing
about going out in a boisterous way _ like to a sports bar.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled having ``relationships like this _ arguments like
this'' when he was a teenager and as an undergraduate at City
College in New York. ``When I was 19, 18, 20, my friends and I
would go to the movies, we would go to concerts, we'd sit home and
listen to symphonies. We'd go to the museum. And we had tremendous
arguments. When you're that age, the last thing you learned is the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very into sports, don't kid yourself. We were such
fanatics about baseball, basketball; the New York Knicks or the
Yankees, whoever was on. We had tremendous arguments about that.
But that didn't stop us from being about Nietzsche or Schopenhauer.
They were just about as important as baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Hirsch, 64, took a ``funny route'' from the
Bronx to Broadway, where he made his debut in ``Barefoot in the
Park'' in 1966. He took engineering courses at City College,
transferred to Cooper Union to study architecture, did a brief
stint in the Army, then went back to City. ``I put all the courses
together, got my degree in physics, and immediately walked into
acting school!'' He shrugged, and added: ``Ha!'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Heady times &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He sometimes wishes he had become a scientist or architect. He
designed a country house in upstate New York where he lives with
his wife and young daughter during the summer and on weekends
they're not in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But the late '50s and early '60s were heady times in New York
theater. ``At that time the off-Broadway scene was very active. New
playwrights were being born every five minutes. Styles were being
developed, companies were being formed, that would last anywhere
from 1 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so taken with what I saw off-Broadway _ I even saw
Eugene Ionesco plays _ where do you see Eugene Ionesco plays? I saw
these productions that you knew you had to do _ Eugene O'Neill's
``The Iceman Cometh.'' Four and three quarter hours at the old
Circle in the Square in New York. Jason Robards was in it. Anne
Meara was the girl at the bar, I think. Peter Falk was the
bartender. I didn't know who these people were at that time, and I
don't think they knew who they were either. I saw Edward Albee's
``The Zoo Story.'' That made me want to be an actor more than
anything I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were dynamic, thoughtful plays _ they were not about
great themes. They were personal. Language plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Plays like ``Art.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-time Emmy winner for ``Taxi,'' Hirsch is better known for
his TV work and films such as ``Ordinary People'' and ``Running on
Empty'' than stage acting. But his theater career has been
impressive. He won Tony Awards for ``I'm Not Rappaport'' and
``Conversations With My Father,'' both by Herb Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   He was willing to take on an increasingly rare role _ a star who
tours in a Broadway play _ because he finds ``Art'' unusually rich
and challenging.
</P>
<P>
   Reza provides the sketchiest of details about each of the
characters, he said. There's tremendous leeway for actors to
``investigate, to make up stuff.'' Marc, for example, talks about
Paula, who shares his life. ``It's up to the actor to decide
whether to play him married.'' Hirsch doesn't; others do.
</P>
<P>
   Each company that performs the show reads it very differently.
Brian Cox portrayed Marc as a curmudgeonly character on Broadway.
Others play him as a man who seldom questions the veracity of his
own opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's a maverick. He likes to think he does things that
are unexpected,'' said Hirsch. But the actor sees Marc as more of a
self-doubter. He wonders: ``Does he feel a little on the stale
side?'' His character is less an intellectual snob than someone who
thinks other people are trying to put one over on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who looks at a painting like this and says `Get me
the guy who did this!' ''
</P>
<P>
   A nimble 90-minute ensemblepiece that's both thought-provoking
and funny, the play is ``full of ideas and conflict and drama,''
Hirsch said. It's also open to interpretation _ ``as blank as the
painting in a lot of ways.''

THEY'RE THE NEW POP STARS, THEY'RE THE SCRATCH MASTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A thundering bass beat slams off the walls of the BBC
2000 club. Looking up from his turntables, the manic DJ Skribble
takes the crowd higher by shouting into the microphone: ``Make some
noise! Are you ready to blow the roof off this place?'' The answer
is immediate, as the youthful, audience starts shaking harder on
the dance floor and in every nook and cranny of the sold-out club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw your hands up!'' adds Skribble, a nonstop energy source
who flashes a big smile under his New York Yankees cap, knowing
that the crowd is now his.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, in this 1,500-capacity Saugus club north of Boston,
Skribble, a nationally known DJ who hosts ``MTV Jams,'' is besieged
by fans and autograph hounds. ``I come here every time he plays.
He's totally out of control. He really makes you want to move,''
says Scott Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him on MTV's NewYear's show. I just love him,'' says
Tammy Crane says of Skribble's house music and hip-hop fusion,
which he enhances by creating drum loops and on-the-spot remixes.
</P>
<P>
   Skribble, 26, a former bad boy who says he used to ``deface
public property and bomb trains'' during his youth in New York,
greets each smitten fan. ``I'm on the road every week _ next week
is Las Vegas, then Orlando, but hearing people say you did a good
job is worth more to me than any money I could get,'' he states.
</P>
<P>
   That's saying something, because these days, DJs are making
eye-opening incomes _ as much as or more than some rock stars, if
you factor in club appearances, chart-hit remixes for the likes of
Madonna, Celine Dion, and Whitney Houston; and fees for DJ
compilation albums, which can earn them $25,000 per album.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's hottest dance clubs _ including Boston's Avalon
and BBC 2000 in Saugus, and others in New York, Miami, Chicago,
London, and other dance meccas _ the top-name DJs now command
nightly paychecks of up to $15,000. That's a far cry from the $25
to $50 club fees they often took home during the disco era in the
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line: They are like rock stars now,'' says Tom
Calderone, vice president of MTV. ``They get picked up in
limousines, they get treated like kings.'' (Only occasionally are
DJs treated like queens. Jackie Christie and DJ Rap are two women
who tour at this level, but it's a world dominated by men.)
</P>
<P>
   When top DJs come to town, the clubs pay for their air fare,
hotels, and meals, according to Steve Adelman, executive director
of the Lyons Group clubs on Lansdowne Street, Boston's dance
epicenter, with Avalon, Axis, and the Karma Club.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the money the DJs make in clubs is mainly profit, except
for paying to upgrade their record collections and purchase the
special-effects units and remixers they might bring to the rooms.
(The clubs supply the turntables.) But the DJs don't have to divide
the money among musicians and roadies, hence their higher profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have 12 to 15 out-of-town DJs coming every month. It
has become quite an operation,'' says Adelman, who gets
particularly excited about the Friday ``Avaland'' series at Avalon.
It's a Studio 54-style night of DJ music and theatrics that often
includes scantily clad dancers hired to shimmy on platforms or
special chairs above the crowd. ``Anything to boost the energy,''
adds co-owner John Lyons, who notes that the DJs often feed off the
extra stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   The energy couldn't have been any higher than on a recent Friday
when New York-based Jonathan Peters, considered one of the top 10
DJs in the world, manned the club's turntables. His star rose last
year after he remixed Whitney Houston's ``My Love Is Your Love,''
which went to No. 4 on the Billboard charts. Peters has his own
label (Deeper Records) and two studios in New York, where he's also
remixed songs by Paula Cole, Jon Secada, and Montell Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a music producer, but I'm also all about the party,'' says
Peters, who thrilled the 2,000-strong capacity crowd at Avalon by
spinning trance music, house music (with a deep bass throb), and
what he calls ``cutting-edge Top 40,'' meaning songs that are
destined for Top 40 radio, but only after being played in the clubs
first. His Whitney Houston remix, for instance, was played at his
weekly Saturday gigs at the Sound Factory in New York a full six
months before it was released to radio. (A song that went a similar
route was Cher's ``Believe,'' which Peters didn't work on, but
which just won a Grammy for best dance recording.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Vocal House'' tune &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year veteran who can recall times when club owners paid him
nothing after a slow night, Peters is part of a growing breed of
DJs who bring their own music to clubs (in the form of remixes and
original songs), which further builds their mystique as stars. At
Avalon, Peters played an original ``vocal house'' tune, which
merged the deep groove of house with a gently soulful R &AMP; B vocal
layered on top by a young studio singer named Karessa Jones. Titled
``Corrupt,'' it sounded like another hit in the making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything changed after I worked with Whitney,'' says Peters.
``I've got major labels coming to me from all over now to remix
records. I can work around the clock if I want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Each Saturday, Peters does work around the clock at the Sound
Factory, where he starts his shift at 11 p.m. and doesn't finish
until 2 p.m. the next day. He touches on many styles of dance music
and will have 3,000 people partying in the club at 10 in the
morning. That's quite different from the parochial club times in
Boston, where he'll spin at Avalon from 11 p.m. to just 2 a.m., the
city-ordained closing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't condense 15 hours into 3 hours,'' says Peters.
``What you do is just try to make it a best-of for 3 hours. It's
hard, but it's still great to see people having a good time. Hey,
it's a blessing to be able to do this. Even when I made $100 a
night, I still loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many DJs who have paid their dues, Peters launched his
career despite the protests of his parents. ``My family 15 years
ago would say, `You want to be a DJ? What are you doing?' But now
that I've had a level of success with my remixes and touring, they
don't say that anymore.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All the world's a club &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real global scene now,'' adds John Digweed, a popular
British DJ who recently played at Axis. ``I go to South Africa and
to Russia now. There are so many countries to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, DJs are even more popular in Europe, where most name
DJs are booked six months in advance. Digweed, and his
oft-recording partner, Sasha, have more work than they can handle
there, but are also becoming increasingly popular in the States.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this last tour of America, I played to 25,000 people in two
weeks,'' says Digweed, whose specialty is fusing trance and house
music, which he did while accompanied by a spectacular light show
at Axis. ``It really has reached a point where DJs are looked upon
as the pop stars of the dance scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the 20-something fans at Axis chanted ``Digweed!
Digweed!'' as he finished his trippy set. ``It's a pretty big buzz
when you hear that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lot more respect these days,'' notes DJ Boris, a
transplanted Russian now based in New York. ``You are the act when
it comes to a club today. Just two years ago, you were still a
second-class citizen in many places. You seemed irrelevant to the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   That all changed with the remix phenomenon _ and the recent
emergence into the mainstream of Fatboy Slim (who spun at the Karma
Club before his dance-pop hits ``Rockafella Skank'' and ``Praise
You'' broke last year), the English techno group the Chemical
Brothers, and Moby, who came from the DJ culture and has also had
pop hits.
</P>
<P>
   More DJs are likewise part of touring bands. Where once drum
solos were obligatory parts of live shows, there's now the sight of
rock star Beck letting his DJ crank up a turntable solo. It's the
same with hip-hop queen Lauryn Hill, who holds a musical ``battle''
during her show by pitting her DJ's solo, improvised turntable
scratchings, against vocals from her singers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the record, on the road &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``rave'' culture of the late '80s and early '90s _ in which
all-night dance parties were held at various official and
unofficial sites _ also spurred the popularity of DJs. Two British
brothers, Steve and Jon Levy, who produced some of the early raves
in Los Angeles, now run Moonshine Music, which they tout as the
first DJ compilation record label, having begun in 1993. Their
roster includes DJs Micro, Carl Cox, Keiko, Cirrus, and Christopher
Lawrence. They will often sell between 100,000 and 200,000 copies
of each record _ not exactly Alanis Morissette numbers, but the
sales are growing with each release.
</P>
<P>
   Moonshine is also assembling its fourth annual tour, which will
feature many of its DJs going to clubs around the country in
September. And, for the first time, the Moonshine tour has a
sponsor _ Listen.com, a heavyweight Internet firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy to get such a major sponsor because it helps
legitimize what we do,'' says Steve Levy. ``It shows that the
corporate world wants to come into what is still a street-level
thing.'' In May Moonshine will launch a new Web site, djmixed.com,
a search engine for electronic music that will also feature a
DJ-mix radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the top-name DJs still come from the music-industry
centers of New York and London. One DJ hoping to buck this trend is
Boston's Chris DeSimone, 28, who spins every Thursday and Saturday
at the new Club Play in suburban Malden. ``The goal for me is to
produce remixes. When you become a producer, you get much bigger,''
says DeSimone, a go-getter who is making national contacts thanks
to just starting a once-a-month gig at the House of Blues in Los
Angeles. Last Sunday, DeSimone played there for an audience that
included actor Ben Affleck and singer Paula Cole. They had come to
see the latest hot-shot DJ from the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Today's all-star DJs are making money beyond their wildest
dreams, but many also know that, like rock stars, it can all vanish
in a hurry given the intense competition and fickle public tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that it's a gift to be doing this,''
concludes DJ Skribble. ``I've gotten to travel the world and things
have blossomed since I got on MTV, but I know that any second it
could be taken away from me.''

BLUE-CHIP TEAM TRIES TO MEASURE UP IN `TALLER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By all accounts, ``Taller Than a Dwarf'' is vintage
Elaine May: smart, savvy, and wonderfully funny. May's new comedy
has a gifted director in Alan Arkin. Stage and screen star Matthew
Broderick and indie-film It Girl Parker Posey lead the cast. Tony
Award-winning designer Tony Walton is creating the set. It's what
you call, according to producer Jon B. Platt, a blue-chip creative
team. Everyone is understandably thrilled to be working with
everyone else. It's stimulating. Exhilarating. Fun. But there's
another emotion running through the blue-blooded veins of this
production. Two and a half weeks into rehearsal, that other feeling
is just as vivid as the good cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scare the (expletive) out of me.'' That's Broderick
commenting on May and Arkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been dreaming that the world is ending,'' is how Posey,
preparing for her theatrical debut, explicates her anxiety level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I have to block a scene with six people, my heart
is in my mouth,'' says Arkin, who recalls that several years ago
Scorsese went through a similar crisis of self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Unpleasant as it may sound, this fear is a very good thing. It's
a testament to the enormous respect these enormously respectable
artists have for Elaine May, who has been writing, directing, and
performing comedy for the better part of five decades. Superlatives
like genius, formidable, and brilliant _ accompanied by awestruck
shaking of the head _ are used to describe her many times
throughout conversations with all of them. It also underscores the
standard of artistic quality to which they hold themselves,
something that seems to be magnified in one another's company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taller Than a Dwarf'' is set in New York, and is about an
average couple at the beginning of the millennium learning the new
rules of the American dream. So goes the impossibly cursory plot
description on the official press release. Broderick embellished
the story line at a sushi bar in Chelsea, near the rehearsal
studios where the play is being staged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play a guy who's an accountant, who wakes up one morning
late for work, and things escalate,'' Broderick begins, his voice
hoarse from a bad cold. ``He`s late, the shower won't work right,
there's a little boy who wants help crossing the street, a
policeman bothers him for littering. Things just add up. He goes
back to his house and decides not to get out of bed anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Broderick, who participated in a staged reading of the play last
year before being cast in the role of Howard Miller, says it
reminds him of comedies with serious themes like ``Prisoner of 2nd
Ave.'' and ``Barefoot in the Park.'' He calls the dialogue
delicious and the plot hilarious. But it's surprising to learn that
Broderick _ embraced for his boyish, good-natured appeal since
becoming a simultaneous theater and film star at age 19 in Neil
Simon's ``Brighton Beach Memoirs'' onstage and ``WarGames'' on
screen _ identifies with the lying, cheating character he plays. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Not a nice character &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to admit it, because he's kind of repellent, in a
way,'' says Broderick, now 37 and married to the actress Sarah
Jessica Parker. ``I mean, he lies the whole time. He tries to
finagle and wheedle out of everything. But it's because he wants to
please everybody all the time. That's what his wife can't stand
about him. It's something I try to avoid. But this really brings it
out in me.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Broderick says, he's really not so much the charming
fellow he seems to be. (Although you wouldn't know it from his
unfailingly sweet, affable manner over lunch, and his similar
behavior with a stranger who stops him on the street to inform him
with great enthusiasm that he looks just like ``Matthew
Broadway.'') ``If you talked with friends of mine, `nice' wouldn't
be the first word they'd use,'' Broderick insists. ``I'm probably a
little more hostile than some of the characters I've played. One
director called me `Stiletto Broderick' because I said so many
nasty things.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkin would beg to differ. The esteemed actor (``Catch-22,''
``The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!'') and director
(he staged the original ``Sunshine Boys'' and most recently 1998's
``Power Plays,'' his first collaboration with May) calls Broderick
shy, wonderful, open, and inventive. But it's precisely that
convoluted sense of identity, the complicated interface of image
and reality and the ensuing collision of the mundane and the
profound, that seems to be at the heart of this play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically about a really bad day this couple has, and how
it changes their lives,'' says Arkin, chatting in an empty room at
the Chelsea Studios. He's been a part of this project since its
inception. Arkin and May have a special chemistry _ based, the
director says, on a sense of humor that's rooted in the same view
of reality. Asked to characterize that view, Arkin will say only
that they laugh at the same things. He laughs, more in amazement
than amusement, when he confesses that sometimes ``I don't know
where to move'' the actors. He adds that every talented person he
knows goes through this. ``That's why I like to sit around a table,
reading, long enough so they know who they are as characters, and
then where they go onstage becomes easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Like May, Arkin says, he is consumed with the integrity of the
work. ``Things keep piling up and get worse and worse and worse and
the couple decide to completely revise their lives,'' Arkin says.
He loves this idea. ``My feeling is that generally, if you're not
in a constant state of change, then you're dying. The way these
people change their lives may not be the healthiest way in the
world, but it's better than what they were doing.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Posey's changes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parker Posey is no stranger to the concept of radical change.
During the past decade the 31-year-old actress has ricocheted from
college student at State University of New York at Purchase to soap
opera actress (``As the World Turns'') to indie goddess (30 films
in 8 years, including ``Party Girl,'' ``Dazed and Confused,''
``Waiting for Guffman'') to gypsy dropout (traveling the globe for
a year and a half) before landing in Hollywood to make ``Scream 3''
and stumble into her first stage role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, I check out a lot,'' Posey says, rummaging through
her huge, tattered blue purse for lip gloss, envelopes, and a pen
to doodle with throughout the interview. It's not hard to believe;
she's a true eccentric, a believer in the powerful winds of fate.
Posey hadn't given a moment's thought to the theater when Arkin
called her last fall. ``It was serendipity,'' Posey says about
being cast in the role of Selma Miller. ``Alan and I had a really
good talk. We just hung out, and I got cast.''
</P>
<P>
   Posey's casual attitude belies the enormity of this latest shift
in her professional life. Says Arkin, who cast Posey without an
audition after watching her work on film, ``She's inordinately
gifted. But it's different from anything she's done _
psychologically, sociologically, and every other way. So on top of
being afraid she's had to find her way into this milieu that was
completely foreign to her.''
</P>
<P>
   May, who gave the cast a week to get on their feet before coming
to rehearsals, is staying relatively hands-off, says Broderick.
``Sometimes she'll say `If you have a problem with anything, if you
feel uncomfortable, tell me. Because you'll take better care of
your characters than I'm able to right now. You'll know better than
me what doesn't work.' I don't know if she meant it, but it was
really nice,'' Broderick says.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, though, the critical work begins in Boston. ``There
are a lot of physical things, different things happening in
different parts of the stage,'' Arkin explains. ``It's painstaking
timing. But audience response will dictate a lot.'' Arkin and May
will be in the theater every night _ taking notes, marking where
the laughs come (and don't come), fine-tuning dialogue and delivery
before opening the show on Broadway March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the talent mounting this play, odds are it will be in
pretty great shape on arrival. Posey, for her part, is figuring out
how to ``be more free. It isn't the easiest thing in the world.''
Arkin is itching to get out of the studio and onto the stage, he
says, explaining that the Marx Brothers used to perform their
movies in front of audiences before filming them. ``I won't have
any perspective until we get to Boston,'' he insists. And
Broderick, despite his fame and acclaim, is wrestling with the
challenge of ``doing justice to this playwright's material. It's
amazing. That scares the hell out of me.''

THE BARBARIANS ARE COMING

<P>
   Good Lord, this man is funny. But as with the best comic
writers, the humor in David Wong Louie's fiction is an elegant
vessel for the rest of life: for its pure tragedies, half-baked
sorrows, and ordinary messes. His highly regarded 1991 story
collection, ``Pangs of Love,'' showcased his talent for the bleakly
absurd, casting the shadows of the multigenerational immigrant
experience onto the fictional milieu of alienation and flight.
``The Barbarians Are Coming'' is his first novel, and it uses those
thematic conceits with even greater virtuosity. By placing the
emotional nexus of his story between a Chinese-born father and his
only son, Louie has taken the love-hate tendrils of any
parent-child bond _ the shame, tenderness, and too-late silences _
and made them ache with longing and specificity.
</P>
<P>
   If every immigrant experience has to bear its particular burden,
in the Chinese-American family, it's the matter of honor _ which
can translate as redemption to one generation and a prison sentence
to the next. For Sterling Lung, the sense of duty that his parents,
Genius and Zsa Zsa, always hounded him about is merely another
obstacle to be cleared on his way out the door: away from creepy
Chinese medicinal herbs, arranged marriages to old-country brides,
the familiar smell (work and bleach) of his father's laundry in New
Jersey. Cruel irony, then, that Sterling finds himself flirting
with a parody of the yellow-peril fool that he and his parents most
feared. A Swarthmore graduate who eschews the medical career of his
parents' dreams for a stint at the Culinary Institute of America,
Sterling builds a life mainly characterized by its non-Chinese
qualities: a rich Jewish bride _ Bliss! _ whom he doesn't really
love, a job cooking fabulous French food for a bunch of
unappreciative WASP women in tony Connecticut. And before you can
say ``spicy three-flavor chicken,'' Sterling has his own cable-TV
cooking show _ where he's supposed to talk fast, chop faster, and
make jokes about his heritage, all under the umbrella of ``The
Peeking Duck.''
</P>
<P>
   The barbarians of Louie's title refer both to the Americans his
parents must endure and the potential dangers they believe their
children face: ``In their eyes I was a scoundrel,'' thinks Sterling
in his chef's apron, ``a dumb-as-dirt ingrate. This was their
reward for their sacrifice, leaving home for America, for lean
lives among the barbarians, so I might enjoy penicillin and daily
beef and be spared Mao and dreary collectivism.'' The knife
Sterling wields in the kitchen is barely a match for that of his
creator, whose sendups of the Richfield Ladies' Club and Sterling's
in-laws are as fiercely accurate as they are hilarious. When the
ladies get tipsy one night after a special meal, they begin to
guess the height of their little chef _ and decide, amid their
drunken gaiety, that the winner will get to take him home. And when
he still can't be corralled to cook won-ton cliches for them, they
replace him _ with an authentic Chinese guy they found washing
dishes at a place called the First Wok.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, comic novels can rely on humor as a facile shortcut,
thereby diminishing their emotional arc, but Louie's satire
achieves the opposite effect. If ``The Barbarians Are Coming''
weren't so funny, it would kill you. This perception dawns on you
slowly: Lulled into the easy framework of Bliss (a self-centered
dental student who's getting back at Daddy with her Chinese
boyfriend) and the Richfield Ladies, you don't see the freight
train of realism coming. With their all-consuming laundry and lousy
English and browbeating ways of communicating, Genius and Zsa Zsa
are depicted with a certain comic detachment; then their real
stories begin to unfold, and the intimate sorrows of their
histories are more stunning for the element of surprise they carry.
</P>
<P>
   Louie manages this feat by narrative sleights of hand. Opening
in 1978, when Sterling is 26, the novel begins in the present
tense, with Sterling as first-person narrator. As the story grows
more complex _ as Sterling marries Bliss, has two sons, moves away
from his parents _ the tenses and narrative perspectives change,
traveling back to Genius's immigration during World War II. And
most of the things that we (and Sterling) took for granted _ the
Americanized names of Genius and Zsa Zsa, for instance _ turn out
not to be so funny after all.
</P>
<P>
   So this is humor in the Swiftian sense: piercing and satirical
and delivering something far larger than comedy for its own sake _
heading, unerringly, toward that ``long, quiet, furious sorrow''
that both Genius and Zsa Zsa had to repress in order for each of
them to make it in America. If there is a weakness to Louie's
novel, it is more sophisticated than what normally befalls first
novels: His subplots are often too interesting for what turns out
to be their relatively inconsequential status. This is a matter of
priority: Next to, say, the multidimensional revelation of Genius
cursing out the window of an automobile, how much can we invest in
a couple of slapstick moments at the ladies' club?
</P>
<P>
   But every palpable image in ``The Barbarians Are Coming'' has a
reason for being here, from the cheap reproduction of
Michelangelo's David on the Richfield grounds to the gorgeous buck
on Bliss's father's estate _ a deer whose noble presence is
threateningly male, silent, and unafraid. The care taken in this
novel is mostly out of sight; it's obscured by Sterling's ongoing
saga and by the riveting farce-drama that constitutes the sometimes
mendacious prism of parental love. But careful it is,
excruciatingly so, and that quality is what paves the way for the
novel's final 100 pages _ toward this thudding realization that
Sterling finally allows himself to feel: ``At what age, into what
depth of despair must one sink before one realizes life's simplest
truth _ that it ends, and because it ends, one should live out
one's days with as much dignity as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody gets to learn that lesson until you've done
plenty of the opposite: wasted time, suffered foolishly, hurt the
people who love you, missed a hundred chances to make it right.
Sterling and his extended family have bountiful opportunity to
screw up, and a few moments, at least, to undo some of the damage.
Through it all comes the memory of Genius, on a boat out of China,
hearing the call of the ocean's waves: Do honor Do honor Do honor.
That litany both haunts and defines David Wong Louie's story, which
turns out to be as generously, utterly, American as it is
eloquently precise.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !! ``Agnes Browne'' Anjelica Huston directed and stars in this
comic melodrama about an Irish widow and mother of seven kids.
Agnes's struggles suggest ``Angela's Ashes'' Lite. You know the
Brownes are never going to come up against anything they can't
overcome in this upbeat film, whose idea of a fairytale finish is a
Tom Jones concert. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Beautiful People'' This optimistic, open-hearted film
throws desperate Bosnian refugees at a cross-section of Londoners
who become better people for helping them. Overloaded and
overextended, the film can flesh out only a few of its plot strands
in more than caricatured fashion _ but its commitment and energy
carry it past its shortcomings. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !! ``The Closer You Get'' Sweet but slight, this story about a
bunch of Irish bumpkins trying to rev up their sex lives in a
Donegal backwater is little ado about nothing. Its problem is not
so much with what's there (though a lot of it seems cluelessly
anachronistic) as with the fact that there's not enough of it.
(PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   (FR) !!! ``Drowning Mona'' A crude, vigorous, and funny comedy
of lowlifes who all become suspects when Bette Midler's bad-news
harridan drives off a cliff in her Yugo. The inventiveness and
flavor fall away at the end, but until then Casey Affleck, Danny
DeVito, Neve Campbell, and Jamie Lee Curtis deliver the gamy goods,
and the wacko gleam in undertaker Will Ferrell's eye is priceless.
(PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   !!! ``My Dog Skip'' Quiet, poignant, and character-driven, this
is a coming-of-age story set in the Mississippi Delta of the 1940s.
Taken from a memoir by Willie Morris, the movie sets an 8-year-old
boy and his Jack Russell terrier against the background of a tense
but loving family and a sleepy Southern town just emerging from the
Depression and beginning to engage with World War II. (PG) (Bruce
McCabe)
</P>
<P>
   ! 1/2 ``The Next Best Thing'' Madonna and Rupert Everett just
don't strike any sparks in this film about a yoga instructor whose
gay best friend becomes the father of her child during a
martini-filled night of Fred and Ginger routines. She seems
ill-at-ease, as well she might, given the script's way of
unerringly making wrong choices as it turns her character
unsympathetic and underlines the fact that Everett has been trained
to speak lines and Madonna hasn't. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   ! 1/2 ``Three Strikes'' Rap impresario D. J. Pooh directs his
first feature, an urban comedy whose funny moments are few and far
between. Brian Hooks plays the twice-convicted bumbler trying to
avoid the triple jeopardy of the title as he navigates an
all-too-familiar world of stereotypes _ homeboys, sex-starved
women, and trigger-happy cops. (R) (Paul Robicheau)
</P>
<P>
   !!! ``What Planet Are You From?'' This Mike Nichols comedy takes
the Mars-Venus stuff to new distances, if not new heights. Garry
Shandling is the alien dispatched to Earth to impregnate a woman to
keep his species going; Annette Bening is the needy recovering
alcoholic. What could have been a trenchant satire of man-woman
relations thins out into an ongoing penis joke as Shandling's alien
stands around looking as if his face is going to melt. Bening saves
the film with superb readings. (R)

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not Vietnam, nor will it become so. But once again the
United States is preparing to commit lots of cash, military
hardware and advisers to a battle in a foreign jungle.
</P>
<P>
   This one is in southern Colombia, where an embattled president,
Andres Pastrana, faces daunting problems. These include left-wing
guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence caused almost 300,000 Colombians to flee
their homes last year; the better-off have been terrorized by
kidnapping and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   The country is also home to the world's biggest illegal drugs
industry: it accounts for about 80 percent of the cocaine and some
of the heroin imported by the United States, and has displaced Peru
as the world's main source of coca, the raw material for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   This is the main front in the developed world's war against the
supply of drugs. And, to make matters worse, Colombia's economy is
reeling from its worst slump since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   On taking office in 1998, Pastrana boldly launched peace talks
with the FARC, the largest guerrilla group. But they have moved
slowly. The war continues, amid widespread skepticism about the
FARC's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pastrana has turned to the United States for
help. President Bill Clinton is sympathetic, and now Congress is
debating an administration request for more aid, which would take
total American assistance to Colombia to $1.6 billion over the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana leads a democracy, albeit an imperfect one, and
deserves international support. But the proposed aid is ambiguous
in purpose, and its results may disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   The largest chunk is to set up and train three special
anti-drugs battalions, equipped with 63 helicopters, including 30
fast, modern Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission is to ``push into the coca-growing regions of
southern Colombia,'' in mountainous jungles now controlled by the
FARC. Once secured, the police would go in to wipe out the coca
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Its backers present this as a plan to staunch the flow of drugs
to the United States. But the motivation seems to be a fear that
the FARC's insurgency is now out of control, and is a threat to
other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the new battalions' target will be the FARC. Since
the FARC gets lots of money (perhaps as much as $500 million a
year) from taxing and protecting the drugs trade, this new southern
push would not only help to prosecute the international war on
drugs but also weaken the guerrillas, persuading them to seek
peace.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the theory. Yet if the main aim were to
support the pursuit of peace, the aid proposal might look very
different. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To achieve peace, Colombia needs stronger democratic
institutions, capable of guaranteeing security and justice for its
citizens (including demobilized guerrillas). And it needs radical
reform of its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pastrana's efforts, they continue to suffer from two
serious failings. First, they remain a largely reactive force,
lacking mobility and relying too heavily on poorly trained
conscripts.
</P>
<P>
   Second, many military commanders retain close links with the
paramilitaries. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The belief runs deep that paramilitary violence will hasten
peace. In fact, it does the opposite. It is as unacceptable as the
violence of the guerrillas. Yet the American aid proposal looks as
if it will merely bolt three shiny new anti-drugs battalions on to
an abusive and unreformed military force. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That imbalance is familiar. After more than a decade of American
aid, Colombia's national police are capable of staging
sophisticated operations against drugs gangs, involving months of
surveillance and intricately coordinated raids.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they are incapable of acting as an efficient constabulary,
providing the average Colombian with security against crime,
kidnapping or assassination. That is not by chance. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aiding the Colombian police has been adopted as a political
cause by a group of congressional Republicans who believe that one
of the cheaper and more effective ways to deal with the United
States' addiction to drugs is to stop their production at source.
</P>
<P>
   That approach is also reflected in the annual ``certification''
process, which this week again saw the United States stand in
unilateral judgment over its neighbors' anti-drugs efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Belief in supply-side remedies has come to be shared by some
officials in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that the sharp fall in coca production in Peru and
Bolivia in recent years is proof that a combination of stepped-up
repression and programs to help former coca farmers can achieve the
complete elimination of coca in those countries _ and in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   It is a heady vision, but a flawed one. In fact, these policies
have fueled Colombia's conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in Colombian coca (and thus in the FARC's income)
is a direct consequence of its reduction elsewhere. That is just
the latest example of the ``balloon'' effect: squeeze the drugs
industry at one point, and it reappears somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Already drugs-trafficking gangs, with all their corruption and
violence, have spread across Latin America from Mexico to Brazil.
The reason is elementary. Demand calls forth supply.
</P>
<P>
   Prohibition and repression merely increase the price; and, where
cocaine is concerned, they have failed to increase it enough to
have any significant effect in reducing consumption.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade of the United States' war against
cocaine at the source, the price of the drug in the United States
remains stable, the supply abundant. The number of hard-core takers
remains stable, too, although casual consumption has been declining
since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Americans pay a high price for the drugs trade: it
corrupts their societies from top to bottom. If this price is ever
to be reduced, Americans will have to look not just at the supply
but also at the demand for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That means they will have to consider alternative policies at
home, even at decriminalization. This is a war that will not be won
with helicopters. &QL;

   Yet they are incapable of acting as an efficient constabulary,
providing the average Colombian with security against crime,
kidnapping or assassination. That is not by chance. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aiding the Colombian police has been adopted as a political
cause by a group of congressional Republicans who believe that one
of the cheaper and more effective ways to deal with the United
States' addiction to drugs is to stop their production at source.
</P>
<P>
   That approach is also reflected in the annual ``certification''
process, which this week again saw the United States stand in
unilateral judgment over its neighbors' anti-drugs efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Belief in supply-side remedies has come to be shared by some
officials in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that the sharp fall in coca production in Peru and
Bolivia in recent years is proof that a combination of stepped-up
repression and programs to help former coca farmers can achieve the
complete elimination of coca in those countries _ and in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   It is a heady vision, but a flawed one. In fact, these policies
have fueled Colombia's conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in Colombian coca (and thus in the FARC's income)
is a direct consequence of its reduction elsewhere. That is just
the latest example of the ``balloon'' effect: squeeze the drugs
industry at one point, and it reappears somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Already drugs-trafficking gangs, with all their corruption and
violence, have spread across Latin America from Mexico to Brazil.
The reason is elementary. Demand calls forth supply.
</P>
<P>
   Prohibition and repression merely increase the price; and, where
cocaine is concerned, they have failed to increase it enough to
have any significant effect in reducing consumption.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade of the United States' war against
cocaine at the source, the price of the drug in the United States
remains stable, the supply abundant. The number of hard-core takers
remains stable, too, although casual consumption has been declining
since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Latin Americans pay a high price for the drugs trade: it
corrupts their societies from top to bottom. If this price is ever
to be reduced, Americans will have to look not just at the supply
but also at the demand for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That means they will have to consider alternative policies at
home, even at decriminalization. This is a war that will not be won
with helicopters. &QL;

<P>
   Doubtless, Caio Koch-Weser is a jolly decent fellow. Germany's
finance state secretary could probably do all sorts of jobs,
perfectly competently or even brilliantly. The trouble is that
running the International Monetary Fund is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Summers, America's Treasury secretary, was both brave and
right to insist this week (via President Bill Clinton) that he will
not accept Koch-Weser in that post. Now he, together with his
European and Asian equivalents, need to agree upon a better way to
choose a new boss for the Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Love it or loathe it _ and it is easier to find people in the
second category _ the IMF is the world's most important
multilateral financial institution. At times of crisis, whether
global or regional, all eyes turn to the Fund.
</P>
<P>
   And, although getting domestic policies right should be the main
solution to financial instability, the IMF is also the best
multilateral hope for helping countries to avoid such crises in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   That is why finance ministers, from all around the world, have
recently devoted so many speeches to the topic known mind-numbingly
as ``international financial architecture,'' and which has at its
heart the future of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   So it is a disgrace and a pity that when it comes to choosing a
new boss to run that vital body, those same ministers have become
hopelessly paralyzed by national prejudice and regional vanity.
</P>
<P>
   The further pity is that there is little real room for dispute
about who is the best person for the job.
</P>
<P>
   It is Stanley Fischer, who is currently the IMF's deputy
managing director and, since Michel Camdessus stepped down a few
weeks ago, its acting head.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant economist but also a crystal-clear articulator of
policies and an adept diplomat, Fischer is even the favorite of
many developing countries, which is quite something for a man with
three disadvantages: being American, being an economist, and being
from the Fund.
</P>
<P>
   He is actually a naturalized American, who was born in Zambia,
and there lies his undoing: the Europeans think the job is theirs
by right, and another naturalized American already heads the World
Bank, the Australian-born Jim Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
   So what is to be done? On March 2, after The Economist went to
press, there was to be a straw poll among the IMF's executive board
over the merits of the three candidates: Koch-Weser, Fischer and
Eisuke Sakakibara, a former Japanese finance-ministry official
nominated by his own government.
</P>
<P>
   That is at least a semblance of democracy. But the likeliest
result was stalemate, with the Europeans loth to relinquish the
post and the Americans unwilling to push Fischer's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome, all precedent suggests, will be some sort of
compromise, less good than appointing Fischer but (it is to be
hoped) not disastrously so.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that the Europeans may agree to offer a
heavyweight politician instead of Koch-Weser, and then all will try
to persuade Fischer to stay at the Fund and run it from day to day,
while the politician deals with grand strategy and public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   That would not be a bad solution, since poor PR is part of the
Fund's problem, and since as well as having a good person running
the institution it is also desirable to have European support.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is also an opportunity to exploit that compromise.
Even as Summers magnanimously accepts a European candidate, he
could still insist on a change in the way the heads of bodies such
as the IMF are chosen in future.
</P>
<P>
   The best way would be to hand the task to a selection committee
nominated by the organization's governing body or by governments.
This would be charged with finding a short list of candidates and
interviewing them, perhaps in public.
</P>
<P>
   It would not eliminate politics, or national jealousies. But it
would make such forces less dominant, and provide a chance to
challenge the cozy idea of a permanent regional hold on particular
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Go on, Mr. Summers, take the opportunity. &QL;

<P>
   To bomb or just to threaten to bomb? That seems to be the only
question the Israeli government asks itself about Lebanon these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, it plumped for bombing, cutting off power to most
of the country. Last week, it settled for mere threats of bombing:
any retaliation against towns in northern Israel, said David Levy,
Israel's foreign minister, would mean that Lebanon would ``burn _
blood for blood, soul for soul, child for child.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, recruited his French
counterpart, Lionel Jospin, to label as terrorists the Lebanese
guerrillas fighting Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists they used to be, of course. Nowadays, though, things
are not quite so simple.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after a spate of Israeli air raids had killed some 200
Lebanese civilians, both the Israeli army and Hezbollah, its chief
adversary in southern Lebanon, agreed to restrict their battles to
uninhabited areas.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides now often accuse the other of cheating. Hezbollah is
said to use villages as cover to launch its attacks; Israel is said
to shell houses and farms along the front line.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas Hezbollah turns its fire on Israeli civilians only
when Lebanese bystanders have been injured or killed, Israel seems
to view any minor infringement of the 1996 deal as a reason to hit
civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Lebanese civilians suffer much more at Israeli
hands than vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 23 Lebanese civilians died, compared with just two
Israelis. And Hezbollah launched the rockets that killed those two
only after Israeli jets had started dropping bombs on Lebanese
bridges and power plants yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for all the talk of Lebanese terrorism, it is Hezbollah
that has looked the more disciplined force of late, and Israel that
has been making innocents suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The former hijackers and hostage-takers have dropped their more
questionable activities and concentrated instead on battlefield
training and hitting Israeli soldiers and their militia allies in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   They can now fire a missile or mortar inside one of the Israeli
forts in south Lebanon at the first shot. During the recent
flare-up, Hezbollah killed seven Israeli soldiers inside Lebanon
without sending a single bullet over the border. The best the
Israelis could do, it seems, was to put out the lights in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel's sorties against Lebanon, both verbal and airborne,
are not just destructive and dishonest. They are also futile.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing Beirut will not stop Hezbollah attacking Israeli
soldiers, or their allies, in south Lebanon. If anything, it will
strengthen Lebanese resentment and steel Hezbollah's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, to prove their indifference to bombing, the
guerrillas killed an Israeli soldier the day after the fiercest air
raids.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even if the Lebanese government wanted to rein
Hezbollah in, it does not have the power to do so. Syria dominates
Lebanese politics and controls the flow of weapons to the
guerrillas. It has long used Hezbollah as a means to press Israel
into concluding a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian regime does not care a jot if Beirut burns. In fact,
the Syrians treat Lebanon as a handy testing-ground, where they can
needle the Israelis without suffering any consequences.
</P>
<P>
   If Barak and Levy really want to end attacks on Israel's
soldiers in Lebanon, they must pursue a diplomatic offensive
against Syria, not a military one against the Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   Should that prove impossible _ the current, suspended, talks are
expected to start again in due course _ the Israeli government does
have another option. It can pull its troops out of Lebanon
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Israel has occupied Lebanese territory for almost 22
years in defiance of umpteen resolutions of the U.N. Security
Council, and Barak himself has said he wants to put an end to the
adventure by July. Many anguished Israeli mothers and conscripts
are behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, some of the most militant guerrillas might make
attacks over the border even after an Israeli withdrawal. But then,
at least, Israel would have better justification for retaliation _
and Levy more grounds for bellicosity. &QL;

   SEATTLE AND SPOKANE _ Four weeks ago Bill Bradley came within
four percentage points of beating a sitting vice president in the
New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 29 he trailed behind Al Gore in another stronghold of
independent voting and campaign-finance reform, Washington state,
by a humiliating 37 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington primary is an eccentric affair: a ``nonbinding
beauty contest'' that does not do anything so pedestrian as
allocate delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's decision to spend six consecutive days campaigning
there _ against the advice of his staff and leading supporters,
such as New York's retiring senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan _ not
only reduced the amount of time he could spend campaigning in the
bigger states that go to the polls on March 7. It turned what
should have been a minor contest into a major test of virility.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Democratic Party elders are urging Bradley
to end his agony and pull out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to broadcast a five-minute-long appeal to voters on
CBS on Thursday night (appropriately at the same time that most
viewers tune into ``ER'' on NBC) suggests that he will remain in
the race, albeit as a spent force, until Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Why did this former basketball star and Senate veteran turn out
to be such a dismal candidate?
</P>
<P>
   Not because of lack of money. Bradley, a darling of Wall Street,
had more cash on hand than Al Gore after the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Not because of lack of infrastructure. The Bradley campaign
spent a small fortune in Washington state on television advertising
(including ads questioning Gore's environmental record). Every day
it sends a torrent of e-mails and faxes to anyone who has ever
expressed a polite interest in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And not because of a lack of ideas. Bradley courageously tried
to make health care an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think that Bradley was simply mugged. A less
honorable man might have been quicker to espond to Gore's
truth-twisting attacks on his health-care policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was also partly a victim of his party's electoral
timetable, which left a month between New Hampshire and the next
Democratic primary. That period has given the vice president a
chance to armor-plate his lead, while the media have focused
exclusively on the helter-skelter of Republican races.
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger problem for Bradley is the fact that his
style is so boring.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Whitelaw, a British Tory grandee, once accused Labor
activists of going around the country ``stirring up apathy.'' That
has often seemed to be the essence of Bradley's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He is such a laconic speaker that one wonders whether the
candidate or the audience will fall asleep first. And he is such a
self-involved figure that he is incapable of connecting with his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The omens were bad last year when he gave a speech in Los
Angeles lamenting the growing divide between blacks and whites. The
audience, many of whom were Hispanic or Asian, looked on in
bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he attended one of those churches where everybody
claps their hands and sways their bodies. The impassive Bradley
could have been attending a Senate hearing on U.S.-Icelandic
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck with a group of sympathetic reporters in New Hampshire, he
would not even say what book he was reading, for fear of opening
up.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's failings have been rendered all the more transparent
by John McCain's successes.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley mumbles that Al Gore is not entirely honest,
McCain promises to beat the vice president like a drum on the
campaign-finance question; while Bradley bows the knee to Al
Sharpton in New York, McCain taunts the religious right for being a
bunch of bigots.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that floating voters should flock to the
charismatic arsonist rather than the dithering professor. Bradley
is an insurgent who has not bothered to insurge. &QL;

</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In general, Bradley's failing campaign has left Gore in a
remarkably strong position. Gore has proved that he can survive a
challenge by a well-funded and well-respected rival.
</P>
<P>
   He has survived it without leaving too many hostages to fortune
(forcing senior army officers to support gays serving openly in the
armed forces being an exception). And the Democratic machine is
solidly behind Bill Clinton's protege.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a few doubts remain. The fact that Bradley, a man whose ear
for politics now seems so tinny, could come so close to toppling
the vice president in New Hampshire suggests considerable
discontent about Gore.

</P>
<P>
   Gore may yet come to regret Bradley's disdain for street
fighting almost as much as Dollar Bill's supporters currently do. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As goes California, so goes the nation. Or so
Californians like to claim. Only three times in the past century
has a candidate won the presidential election without winning in
California.
</P>
<P>
   In November, with Florida and Texas likely to be solidly
Republican, California seems a particularly crucial piece of the
electoral map.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican nominee can win it, he will be practically
home and dry. Unless the Democrat holds on to it, he will have
little hope. For the Democrats, the Californian primary on March 7
looks likely to be Al Gore's coronation.
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, Bill Bradley's prospects in the state had
looked promising. In financial terms, he raised more than Gore in
Silicon Valley; Hollywood also seemed to be leaning in the former
senator's direction.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore now has both organization and momentum on his side. The
vice president has visited the state more than 60 times while in
office and he is supported by nearly all the state's leading
Democrats, including the governor, both senators, and the mayors of
San Francisco and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   His environmental enthusiasm and his interest in technology are
popular with Northern Californians, and the attention he gives to
education scores him points with Southern Californians fed up with
the Los Angeles Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll on March 1 showed him beating Bill
Bradley by 54 percent to 11 percent among registered Democrats in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   For California's Republicans, the choice between George W. Bush
and John McCain looks much more trickier. That is partly because of
the state of the national race.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Bush once again regained the initiative when he
trounced McCain not only in Virginia, where he was expected to win,
but also in Washington state. Even a few hours before the polls
closed in Washington, McCain's camp was claiming that Bush was a
purely Southern candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The McCainites seemed to have the wind behind them. Nobody who
went to McCain's rally at Bremerton, just outside Seattle, where
thousands of people chanted his name over the strains of the
``Rocky'' soundtrack, believed he could ever lose. But he did, by
20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if the national race were not so fratricidal,
California's Republicans would still find the choice between Bush
and McCain peculiarly awkward. They see themselves as the
intellectual arsenal of their party's conservative battalions.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan and the tax-cutting proposition movement both
emerged from Southern California. Around 40 percent of the state's
Republicans consider themselves to be part of the Christian right.
Even the so-called ``Southern strategy,'' focusing on white
conservatives, was, some say, concocted in the paleo-conservative
swamps of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Californian Republicans are now more
aware than most that this strategy has run its course. In 1998, Dan
Lungren lost the race to succeed his fellow Republican, Pete
Wilson, in the governorship to a Democrat, Gray Davis, by 20
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos, once a promising constituency for the Republicans, are
still furious about Wilson's own version of the Southern strategy,
embracing the anti-immigrant Proposition 187 in 1994.
Asian-Americans also seem to have defected.
</P>

   Bush at first seemed the dream candidate for the Californian
Republicans: a conservative with new ideas. In early 1999, a
delegation of Sacramento Republicans wrote to the Texan governor
asking him to stand for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a conservative who had won the trust of Latino voters
in Texas; he had tackled education, the top Californian issue, so
successfully that the state had sent several delegations to Texas
to study its approach to schools; and he looked a winner.
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning has been thrown into turmoil by two things. The
first is Bush's drift to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a South Carolina university that forbids interracial
dating was hardly likely to win Bush broad popularity in
California, where miscegenation is something of a state sport. &QL;

   The opinion polls now suggest that Gore would beat Bush in
California; but he would lose to McCain. The other thing is that
McCain has made the Republicans seem hip again. After falling for a
decade, the party's membership has surged.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bernd Schwieren of the Republican Assembly Caucus
in Sacramento, 21,000 new Republicans registered in the month
ending on Feb. 7. The party had lost 600,000 since 1996.
</P>

93,000. &QL;

<P>
   The way in which the primary will be conducted on March 7 seems
almost designed to play on the strains within the state's
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   All voters will be able to vote for any candidate, regardless of
party, by marking a single card on which they all appear. The two
main parties, however, will allocate their delegates on the basis
of only the votes of their registered members.
</P>
<P>
   There will thus be two results: an internal party one, and a
beauty contest that ranks all the candidates by their total number
of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush looks likely to win the internal race (he leads by 20
percentage points in the polls). In the absolute count, however, he
is only slightly in front of McCain (with a lead of two to six
points) and still around six points behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Bush might win all his party's delegates
but finish third in the popular vote may increase if many of the
independents and Democrats who had been leaning towards Bradley
defect to McCain, as they have done in other primaries.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that McCain, particularly in his strident remarks about
the party's fundamentalist wing, is already concentrating on coming
top in the everybody-can-vote count.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of both candidates claiming that they ``won
California'' has the makings of a Republican nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be yet another agony in store. The current
two-count system is an awkward compromise between California's
voters, who have twice voted for propositions requiring open
primaries, and the parties, which have passed rules trying to close
them.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tony Quinn, a Republican demographic analyst, the
legal stitching on this piece of political patchwork is weak: you
can amend an initiative only with another initiative.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain wins the beauty contest, he might take his challenge
to the courts. Such a clash would do little for the bid by
California's Republicans to reclaim a position at the front of
their party.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with the fact that California is already far more
multi-ethnic than most states will be in even 50 years' time, is
starting to make some people say that the state can no longer hope
to march at the head of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   That still seems wrong. First, the sheer weight of numbers
(California's population of 34 million today is projected to grow
to 50 million by 2030) is bound to make this a state with clout.
</P>
<P>
   And, second, the basic political question in California _ how to
attract suburbanite voters who are mostly conservative on fiscal
issues but liberal on issues like abortion _ is the same question
that politicians everywhere in America are facing.
</P>
<P>
   Alas for them, it is a question to which the Republicans have
yet to come up with a clear answer. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As goes California, so goes the nation. Or so
Californians like to claim. Only three times in the past century
has a candidate won the presidential election without winning in
California.
</P>
<P>
   In November, with Florida and Texas likely to be solidly
Republican, California seems a particularly crucial piece of the
electoral map.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican nominee can win it, he will be practically
home and dry. Unless the Democrat holds on to it, he will have
little hope. For the Democrats, the Californian primary on March 7
looks likely to be Al Gore's coronation.
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, Bill Bradley's prospects in the state had
looked promising. In financial terms, he raised more than Gore in
Silicon Valley; Hollywood also seemed to be leaning in the former
senator's direction.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore now has both organization and momentum on his side. The
vice president has visited the state more than 60 times while in
office and he is supported by nearly all the state's leading
Democrats, including the governor, both senators, and the mayors of
San Francisco and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   His environmental enthusiasm and his interest in technology are
popular with Northern Californians, and the attention he gives to
education scores him points with Southern Californians fed up with
the Los Angeles Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll on March 1 showed him beating Bill
Bradley by 54 percent to 11 percent among registered Democrats in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   For California's Republicans, the choice between George W. Bush
and John McCain looks much more trickier. That is partly because of
the state of the national race.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Bush once again regained the initiative when he
trounced McCain not only in Virginia, where he was expected to win,
but also in Washington state. Even a few hours before the polls
closed in Washington, McCain's camp was claiming that Bush was a
purely Southern candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The McCainites seemed to have the wind behind them. Nobody who
went to McCain's rally at Bremerton, just outside Seattle, where
thousands of people chanted his name over the strains of the
``Rocky'' soundtrack, believed he could ever lose. But he did, by
20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if the national race were not so fratricidal,
California's Republicans would still find the choice between Bush
and McCain peculiarly awkward. They see themselves as the
intellectual arsenal of their party's conservative battalions.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan and the tax-cutting proposition movement both
emerged from Southern California. Around 40 percent of the state's
Republicans consider themselves to be part of the Christian right.
Even the so-called ``Southern strategy,'' focusing on white
conservatives, was, some say, concocted in the paleo-conservative
swamps of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Californian Republicans are now more
aware than most that this strategy has run its course. In 1998, Dan
Lungren lost the race to succeed his fellow Republican, Pete
Wilson, in the governorship to a Democrat, Gray Davis, by 20
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos, once a promising constituency for the Republicans, are
still furious about Wilson's own version of the Southern strategy,
embracing the anti-immigrant Proposition 187 in 1994.
Asian-Americans also seem to have defected.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley types who would otherwise be natural Republicans
fume about the party's position on some moral issues, notably
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   California's Republicans have discovered the danger of looking
old, white and intolerant in a state that is getting younger and
browner by the day. Non-Latino whites will soon become a minority
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans account for only 35 percent of the registered
Californian electorate _ around ten percentage points less than the
Democrats _ which makes them even more dependent on the growing
number of independent voters. &QL;

<P>
   SHOLKOVSKOYE, Russia _ Stillness in this small muddy town on
Chechnya's eastern border stretches from morning to late afternoon,
punctured only by cattle ambling down the street and men smoking
and stamping their tired feet in the winter chill.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government calls Sholkovskoye a model village in
their campaign to win the hearts and minds of Chechen civilians,
and bring normal life back to this breakaway republic devastated
during six months of war between Islamic separatists and the
Russian army.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no shooting. Relations between the authorities and the
population are excellent,'' boasts Col. Sergei Mikhailov, Russia's
deputy commander in the region, as he sits in the sandbagged town
hall building under a portrait of acting Russian President Vladimir
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   But his words contrast those of civilians here, who say Russian
soldiers have brought only a mirage of stability, an uneasy peace
threatened by hostility between those who survived and those who
waged the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've created the appearance of normal life, but it's not
real,'' said Alimkhan Magomedov, an unemployed ethnic Chechen. ``We
have absolutely no rights _ they still treat all of us as if we're
bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's leadership announced the capture last week of the
village of Shatoi _ described as the last rebel stronghold _ and
vowed to wrap up their offensive quickly. But the rebels, who have
pledged to wage a guerrilla-type war against the Russians, said
they would continue to offer stiff resistance against the troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the days following the Russian announcement, federal forces
suffered two major setbacks in fierce battles both on the southern
front and in the Chechen capital Grozny, which the army had boasted
was completely subdued and safe.
</P>
<P>
   In a weekend interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.,
Putin repeated the military line that Russian forces have
effectively crushed rebel resistance. In addition, he stressed that
the primary task of the Russian forces would be to build peace in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Plans have been laid to decrease the Russian military presence
from the current 100,000 troops to about one-third that number, and
to slowly replace the Russian military commandant system governing
liberated villages like Sholkovskoye with new civilian
administrations and local militia forces.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Putin nor the Russian government has explained how
Russia will pay for the rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years between the first Chechen War and the second,
the Russian government transferred more than $2 billion to the
civilian Chechen government. The money was earmarked for rebuilding
infrastructure like electric and phone lines destroyed during the
first war, but most of it was embezzled Chechen officials.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Deputy Prime Minister Nickolai Koshman has said that
reconstructing Chechnya will cost Russia some 10 billion rubles
(US$400 million), but would not elaborate on what that figure
includes. Estimates for rebuilding the Grozny, where more than
600,000 people lived until the Russian air force flattened it in
devastating air attacks, run close to (US$1 billion) alone.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Russian federal budget only allocates 515 million
rubles (US$18 million) for Chechnya, an amount that compounds
cynicism among the civilian population in the war-torn region that
life will improve under Russian rule.
</P>
<P>
   This region on Chechnya's _ east bordering Dagestan _ is the
most pro-Russian part of Chechnya. It was one of the first areas to
be occupied by Russian forces after locals ran the Chechen rebels
out of the town of Sholkovskoye last October, and was spared the
destruction visited on cities like Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity and gas are working in the town, but food and work
are scarce. Along Sholkovskoye's two-lane unpaved main street the
only economic activity comes from kiosks selling Snickers, soda and
chewing gum. Other household items are nowhere to be seen on store
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some residents like pensioner Marina Kudelina, an ethnic
Russian, are satisfied with life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is better since (the Russian army) came and the bandits
left. We get our pensions and we sleep soundly in our beds,'' the
72-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone has pleasant things to say about the military.
</P>
<P>
   Luba Zagayeva is one of thousands of people who fled fighting in
Grozny and have taken shelter with relatives in the region
surrounding Sholkovskoye. Zagayeva said she lost all her identity
papers in the rush to flee the relentless air raids on her home.
Without the documents, she can't receive any food aid or travel to
another town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got nothing left there, and nothing to feed my children
here,'' Zagayeva said, standing in the town square hoping to catch
the attention of military officials entering and exiting the city
hall building.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For the four months she has lived in Sholkovskoye with her
children, the commandant's office refused to replace her family's
documents, making life harrowing for her husband and older son. The
lack of identity papers is grounds for arrest by the Ministry of
Interior soldiers that patrol the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's constant harassment. They take our men on the pretense
that they have fought for the rebels. It's no good to tell them
they have never lifted a weapon. We either pay to get them out of
jail, or they take them away and we never see them again,''
Zagayeva said.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Mikhailov denied that his men make unwarranted arrests
among the Chechen civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chechens like to work in armed forces. We must remain vigilant
and keep discipline or else peace will break down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the four months the Russian military has controlled the town,
50 criminal cases have been opened against townsfolk, with charges
ranging from robbery to drug possession to loitering. The
defendants must be transferred to the Russian town of Krasnodar,
because Sholkovskoye has no working court system.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhailov said the best long-term solution for peace in Chechnya
would be to replace the Russian troops with a local police force
that will defend the rule of law. He has already appointed a
Chechen chief of police for Sholkovskoye. So far, 180 people have
completed applications to join the local militia. No one's been
hired yet, because there's no money to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   For some Chechens, who have witnessed war for most of their
lives, the answer is much more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were independent, it was all a big mess and we
starved,'' says Abdul Magomedov, an 18-year-old chewing sunflower
seeds in Sholkovskoye's main square. ``Now (the Russians) think
they can give us bread and we'll all be happy again. But they're
wrong. We still want our own government, our own president. We
still want freedom.''

There's not much doubt who will win Tuesday's primaries in Georgia;
both Bush and Gore are enormously popular here, and none of the
four major candidates has even bothered to campaign here on a
regular basis. But neither inevitability nor prosperity seems to
have dimmed Newton County's interest in this election. No one here

   NKOREA-INVEST (Onjungri, North Korea) _ A few miles north of the
demilitarized zone that has divided the Korean peninsula for half a
century, Hyundai, South Korea's largest corporation, has spent more
than $1 billion to install deepwater docks, build a spa with a
glass atrium, pave roads and string electric cables. It has plans
for a 1,000-room seaside hotel, 45-hole golf course and ski slope
in a desolate North Korean village. The reason, Hyundai says, is
corporate good will, which as the maxim goes, makes good business
sense. But not everyone agreed that Hyundai should invest so
heavily in a country where the risks far outweigh the potential for
return. ``I admire what Hyundai is doing in North Korea but the

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As goes California, so goes the nation. Or so
Californians like to claim. Only three times in the past century
has a candidate won the presidential election without winning in
California.
</P>
<P>
   In Noveber, with Florida and Texas likely to be solidly
Republican, California seems a particularly crucial piece of the
electoral map.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican nominee can win it, he will be practically
home and dry. Unless the Democrat holds on to it, he will have
little hope. For the Democrats, the Californian primary on March 7
looks likely to be Al Gore's coronation.
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, Bill Bradley's prospects in the state had
looked promising. In financial terms, he raised more than Gore in
Silicon Valley; Hollywood also seemed to be leaning in the former
senator's direction.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore now has both organization and momentum on his side. The
vice president has visited the state more than 60 times while in
office and he is supported by nearly all the state's leading
Democrats, including the governor, both senators, and the mayors of
San Francisco and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   His environmental enthusiasm and his interest in technology are
popular with Northern Californians, and the attention he gives to
education scores him points with Southern Californians fed up with
the Los Angeles Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll on March 1 showed him beating Bill
Bradley by 54 percent to 11 percent among registered Democrats in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   For California's Republicans, the choice between George W. Bush
and John McCain looks much more trickier. That is partly because of
the state of the national race.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Bush once again regained the initiative when he
trounced McCain not only in Virginia, where he was expected to win,
but also in Washington state. Even a few hours before the polls
closed in Washington, McCain's camp was claiming that Bush was a
purely Southern candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The McCainites seemed to have the wind behind them. Nobody who
went to McCain's rally at Bremerton, just outside Seattle, where
thousands of people chanted his name over the strains of the
``Rocky'' soundtrack, believed he could ever lose. But he did, by
20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if the national race were not so fratricidal,
California's Republicans would still find the choice between Bush
and McCain peculiarly awkward. They see themselves as the
intellectual arsenal of their party's conservative battalions.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan and the tax-cutting proposition movement both
emerged from Southern California. Around 40 percent of the state's
Republicans consider themselves to be part of the Christian right.
Even the so-called ``Southern strategy,'' focusing on white
conservatives, was, some say, concocted in the paleo-conservative
swamps of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Californian Republicans are now more
aware than most that this strategy has run its course. In 1998, Dan
Lungren lost the race to succeed his fellow Republican, Pete
Wilson, in the governorship to a Democrat, Gray Davis, by 20
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos, once a promising constituency for the Republicans, are
still furious about Wilson's own version of the Southern strategy,
embracing the anti-immigrant Proposition 187 in 1994.
Asian-Americans also seem to have defected.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley types who would otherwise be natural Republicans
fume about the party's position on some moral issues, notably
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   California's Republicans have discovered the danger of looking
old, white and intolerant in a state that is getting younger and
browner by the day. Non-Latino whites will soon become a minority
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans account for only 35 percent of the registered
Californian electorate _ around ten percentage points less than the
Democrats _ which makes them even more dependent on the growing
number of independent voters. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush at first seemed the dream candidate for the Californian
Republicans: a conservative with new ideas. In early 1999, a
delegation of Sacramento Republicans wrote to the Texan governor
asking him to stand for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a conservative who had won the trust of Latino voters
in Texas; he had tackled education, the top Californian issue, so
successfully that the state had sent several delegations to Texas
to study its approach to schools; and he looked a winner.
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning has been thrown into turmoil by two things. The
first is Bush's drift to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a South Carolina university that forbids interracial
dating was hardly likely to win Bush broad popularity in
California, where miscegenation is something of a state sport. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The opinion polls now suggest that Gore would beat Bush in
California; but he would lose to McCain. The other thing is that
McCain has made the Republicans seem hip again. After falling for a
decade, the party's membership has surged.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bernd Schwieren of the Republican Assembly Caucus
in Sacramento, 21,000 new Republicans registered in the month
ending on Feb. 7. The party had lost 600,000 since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Even more pleasingly, the Democratic registration tally fell by
93,000. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850, OR CONTINUE TO 1,325 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The way in which the primary will be conducted on March 7 seems
almost designed to play on the strains within the state's
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   All voters will be able to vote for any candidate, regardless of
party, by marking a single card on which they all appear. The two
main parties, however, will allocate their delegates on the basis
of only the votes of their registered members.
</P>
<P>
   There will thus be two results: an internal party one, and a
beauty contest that ranks all the candidates by their total number
of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush looks likely to win the internal race (he leads by 20
percentage points in the polls). In the absolute count, however, he
is only slightly in front of McCain (with a lead of two to six
points) and still around six points behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Bush might win all his party's delegates
but finish third in the popular vote may increase if many of the
independents and Democrats who had been leaning towards Bradley
defect to McCain, as they have done in other primaries.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that McCain, particularly in his strident remarks about
the party's fundamentalist wing, is already concentrating on coming
top in the everybody-can-vote count.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of both candidates claiming that they ``won
California'' has the makings of a Republican nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be yet another agony in store. The current
two-count system is an awkward compromise between California's
voters, who have twice voted for propositions requiring open
primaries, and the parties, which have passed rules trying to close
them.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tony Quinn, a Republican demographic analyst, the
legal stitching on this piece of political patchwork is weak: you
can amend an initiative only with another initiative.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain wins the beauty contest, he might take his challenge
to the courts. Such a clash would do little for the bid by
California's Republicans to reclaim a position at the front of
their party.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with the fact that California is already far more
multi-ethnic than most states will be in even 50 years' time, is
starting to make some people say that the state can no longer hope
to march at the head of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   That still seems wrong. First, the sheer weight of numbers
(California's population of 34 million today is projected to grow
to 50 million by 2030) is bound to make this a state with clout.
</P>
<P>
   And, second, the basic political question in California _ how to
attract suburbanite voters who are mostly conservative on fiscal
issues but liberal on issues like abortion _ is the same question
that politicians everywhere in America are facing.
</P>
<P>
   Alas for them, it is a question to which the Republicans have
yet to come up with a clear answer. &QL;

<P>
   MIAMI _ Three months after Elian Gonzalez, a six-year-old Cuban
boy, was rescued from the sea off Miami, his story resembles the
fanciful tele-novelas that Latinos love to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter child-custody case between the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS), which wants to send Elian back to his
father in Cuba, and his relatives in Miami, who want him to be
given political asylum, has now been through six judges of various
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Great-uncles have been rushed to hospital with chest pains; nuns
have changed their stories; and one of the INS's main men in Miami
has been arrested on charges that he spied for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``The Curse of Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   But these comic undertones distract attention from the weighty
issues involved in the affair. The most obvious, and tragic,
surround the fate of the wretched Elian himself.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a growing sense that the story is not playing
out in the way that Miami's hard-line Cuban-American leaders had
intended.
</P>
<P>
   A new federal judge is due to hear Elian's political-asylum case
on March 9. Bernard Perlmutter, a family-law expert at the
University of Miami, thinks the Miami relatives' case looks
extremely weak.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father has been deemed a fit parent by INS agents who
interviewed him in Cuba, and there is no legal precedent for
denying parental rights over a child of such tender years.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge does indeed send him back, this will be a further
blow for the Miami Cubans' political leaders. With Fidel Castro
poised to outlast his ninth American president, Elian's case was
supposed to reinvigorate anti-Castro feeling in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, opinion polls say that 67 percent of Americans feel
that he should be sent home. This reflects a general softening of
attitudes in the United States towards Castro's Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The spy case aside, American-Cuban relations have been gradually
defrosting. Talk of ending the 30-year economic embargo is no
longer unrealistic. Travel restrictions have been loosened.
</P>
<P>
   The number of direct charter flights to Havana has increased, as
have family remittances. American academics and students now travel
for study to Cuba. Cuban musicians tour the United States. The two
countries' governments cooperate on issues such as immigration and
drugs. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The furor over Elian has caused a few flickerings. The Clinton
administration has temporarily shelved a plan to ease food sales to
Cuba. But, in most other respects, both governments have kept their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Cuba permitted an American trade fair in Havana, the
first of its kind in four decades, to go ahead. The Clinton
administration has backed the Cuban government's demand to have the
boy returned. Even the spy business has not had as explosive an
effect as it might have done.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think the handling of the Elian affair reveals a new
maturity on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ``if there's been a problem in one area, everything
else is shut down,'' says John Kavulich, director of the U.S.-Cuba
Trade and Economic Council. ``Now everyone is determined that
everything around this child continues uninterrupted.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 150-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 900) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of driving a wedge between Washington and Havana, the
Elian case may end up driving one between Washington and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   An attempt in Congress in February to introduce legislation to
make Elian an instant American citizen fell flat on its face.
``There's no one left in this city who has any sympathy for the
Miami Cubans after what they have done to that boy,'' says Robert
White, the head of the Washington-based Center for International
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the Elian affair has led people to wonder whether
the hard-line anti-Castro Cubans in Miami are losing their clout.
</P>
<P>
   In the days when Jorge Mas Canosa, a telecommunications magnate,
ran the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), the largest
exile organization, few politicians questioned his will. But since
he died in 1997 much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   The CANF, which models itself on the pro-Israel lobby, is still
a formidable fund-raising machine. But its reputation has suffered
from allegations that its members were involved in a series of
mini-bombings in Havana in 1998, and other anti-Castro shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   The CANF's new leader, Mas Canosa's son, Jorge Mas Jr., now
spends more of his time with the family business.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over Elian has been led by other groups, such as the
Democracy Movement and Brothers to the Rescue. But their street
protests and traffic disruptions have alienated many of Miami's
non-Cubans, and even some of its Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   The gamble that failed Miami is changing. Latinos are expected
to make up 69 percent of the population of Miami-Dade County by
2020. But most of the additions will either not come from Cuba at
all, or will be second- and third-generation Cuban-Americans who
have been educated in the United States and feel less vengeful
about Castro than their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The young mayor of Miami-Dade, Alex Penelas, a Democrat, makes
dutiful noises about Elian, but he chiefly wants to build a modern
American city, not depose Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans are a minority even in Miami-Dade and barely a
20th of Florida's electorate (though that can still make a
difference in a close race).
</P>
<P>
   By separating a six-year-old boy from his father, the
hard-liners may have overreached themselves. If so, the irony is
that they will have helped Castro. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ One of the most remarkable features of the
presidential campaign so far has been the change in the scope of
John McCain's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican senator began his quest for his party's
presidential nomination by attacking the ``iron triangle'' of
lobbyists, zillion-dollar political contributors and corrupted
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   He is ending it (assuming next week's national primary does
indeed end it, one way or another) by attacking influential members
of his own party as ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Most paid-up members of the Republican Party establishment (that
is, elected officials in national and state governments) have a
ready explanation for what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, they have known all along, is mad, bad and
dangerous to know.
</P>
<P>
   The party will close ranks around George W. Bush. And the
Arizonan maverick's attacks will have no effect on Republican
electoral prospects come November.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are right about one thing: McCain's behavior
bears the hallmarks of reckless political courage.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing the Reverend Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian
Coalition, in his own hometown of Virginia Beach, Va., was a
remarkable moment in recent Republican history. Never before has a
presidential candidate nominee castigated the religious right like
this.
</P>
<P>
   There were tactical reasons for doing it, of course. Most
Christian conservatives are voting against McCain anyway, so
branding their leaders as bigots helps reduce the legitimacy of
some of Bush's victories.
</P>
<P>
   But still, McCain was addressing the foot soldiers of the
Republican Party. They account for around a fifth of all party
members and a third in many states' primary electorates.
</P>
<P>
   This was not just a Sister Souljah moment, aping Bill Clinton's
1992 attack on black extremism; it was a brother, grandmother and
indeed entire Souljah family moment.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans are surely wrong when they imply that the
episode is merely an example of McCain going over the top. In fact,
there is a direct link between his attacks on lobbyists and his
attacks on the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Christian organizations have been among the most ferocious
critics of McCain's campaign-finance proposals because they see his
reforms as a threat to their political survival.
</P>
<P>
   They are right to be worried. Over the past few years, a cozy
back-scratching arrangement has grown up by which the religious
right helps get Republicans elected; Republicans set up various
fund-raising mechanisms and these bodies give money to religious
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's proposals would tear down these whited sepulchres. The
logic of his campaign means that there would have been a
confrontation between the two sides whatever the senator's own
temperament.
</P>
<P>
   That logic applies not just to the religious right but,
increasingly, to other sections of the Republican Party. &QL;

   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For weeks it has been clear that the Arizona senator _ without
understanding exactly how _ has been seeking a ``new governing
majority'' in his quest to reinvent Republicanism.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind his actions _ or at least his angry gut
instinct _ is that to attract moderate voters in the suburbs (and
win elections), you have to break the control of the
special-interest groups that dominate the party.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear how, in McCain's mind, the religious right is one
such group. They have regularly caricatured him as a traitor to his
party and a friend of abortionists. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trouble for McCain is that, as the election season has gone
on, the entire Republican establishment itself has come to look
more and more like another special-interest group.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how completely the establishment rallied behind
Bush, it was inevitable that McCain would have to confront it at
some point.
</P>
<P>
   What was not so inevitable was that when he did so, they would
have the backing of so many ordinary Republicans, who have voted
for Bush in primary after primary by margins of two to one.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, has been an extraordinary outcome. The Republican
Party has always been a fractured and fractious coalition. It
contains Protestant evangelicals and Catholic moderates;
country-club businessmen and moral ideologues; fiscal conservatives
and supply-side tax cutters.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable is not that these divisions have widened in
the wake of the party's electoral troubles in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable thing is that the establishment and two-thirds of
the party have held together in the face of the biggest challenge
to Republican orthodoxy for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   This coherence does not guarantee that Bush will win his party's
nomination, though it must make that outcome more likely. But it
certainly means that whoever wins the nomination will then find the
task of going on to take the presidency harder than he would
otherwise have done.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain prevails, he will face a huge task of damage
limitation inside his own party. The religious right may well have
written him off already.
</P>
<P>
   After his attacks this week, many of their leaders would prefer
to lose with Bush than win with McCain. But the party establishment
too may be reluctant to support a man who is running so openly
against them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush is right: this is a hostile takeover of the party. That
does not mean it is unjustified. Hostile takeovers justify
themselves if they increase shareholder value (i.e., voter appeal).
But as with all such bids, this one would require a good deal of
managerial skill afterwards if it were to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush wins, his position will be akin to that of many a
struggling chairman who has just survived a takeover bid: once the
battle is over, he will have to start doing all the things he
denounced during the bid.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain is right, too: you cannot hope to win the presidency
with Republican votes alone (the party amounts to little more than
a third of the electorate). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush has time to change course. He has started to distance
himself from his moral-majority supporters. And he has a record (in
Texas, at least) of attracting new voters.
</P>
<P>
   But if the campaign has shown anything so far, it is the deep
disillusion with Bush that exists among independent and Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Having dug itself in around Bush, his party is now less well
placed than it was to win back the swing voters it will need in
November.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's wrath may be instinctive; but it is not unjustified. &QL;

MOVIE ACADEMY PUTS FOCUS ON SCI-TECH OSCARS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before the glitz and glamour of Oscar night (still a few
weeks away, folks), a round of plaques and commendations bearing
the motion picture academy's seal gets handed out to a group of
folks most of us have never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   These are the awards for scientific and technical achievement
(or Sci-Techs), which the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences bestowed Saturday night on the developers of camera
lenses, film projectors and filters.
</P>
<P>
   Will you recognize the winners' names? Probably not. But their
equipment has greatly helped the makers of such recent movies as
``The Thin Red Line'' ``Mighty Joe Young,'' ``Saving Private Ryan''
and ``Eyes Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be anything without the actors,'' admitted camera
designer Fritz Gabriel Bauer, who picked up his third Sci-Tech
award during the black-tie affair at the Regent Beverly Wilshire
Hotel. ``But they wouldn't be anything without us, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who developed one of the world's smallest and lightest
sound cameras _ the Moviecam Superlight _ was one of 12 Sci-Tech
recipients. The Gordon E. Sawyer award, Sci-Tech's lifetime
achievement award, went to former Eastman Kodak pioneer Roderick T.
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   The task of explaining the winners' achievements _ with the aid
of video clips _ fell to actress Salma Hayek, who admitted that she
was a slightly unusual choice to host a tech awards presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I have an engineering background,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayek labored at times while reading off reams of complicated
names and technical terminology from a TelPrompTer, but the star of
``Wild Wild West'' and ``Fools Rush In'' proved to be a good sport,
willing to laugh at herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I make a mistake,'' she told the audience, ``I want
you to pretend you're me and that you're up here doing this in
Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills-based Panavision Inc. was recognized for its
contribution to developing the Millennium Camera System viewfinder.
Panavision engineer Takuo Miyagishima also received a John A.
Bonner Medal of Commendation.
</P>
<P>
   FPC Inc.'s Barry M. Stultz and Milton Jan Friedman received a
special award of commendation for their creation of an
environmentally responsible program to recycle and destroy film. &QL;

   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For weeks it has been clear that the Arizona senator _ without
understanding exactly how _ has been seeking a ``new governing
majority'' in his quest to reinvent Republicanism.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind his actions _ or at least his angry gut
instinct _ is that to attract moderate voters in the suburbs (and
win elections), you have to break the control of the
special-interest groups that dominate the party.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear how, in McCain's mind, the religious right is one
such group. They have regularly caricatured him as a traitor to his
party and a friend of abortionists. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trouble for McCain is that, as the election season has gone
on, the entire Republican establishment itself has come to look
more and more like another special-interest group.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how completely the establishment rallied behind
Bush, it was inevitable that McCain would have to confront it at
some point.
</P>
<P>
   What was not so inevitable was that when he did so, they would
have the backing of so many ordinary Republicans, who have voted
for Bush in primary after primary by margins of two to one.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, has been an extraordinary outcome. The Republican
Party has always been a fractured and fractious coalition. It
contains Protestant evangelicals and Catholic moderates;
country-club businessmen and moral ideologues; fiscal conservatives
and supply-side tax cutters.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable is not that these divisions have widened in
the wake of the party's electoral troubles in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable thing is that the establishment and two-thirds of
the party have held together in the face of the biggest challenge
to Republican orthodoxy for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   This coherence does not guarantee that Bush will win his party's
nomination, though it must make that outcome more likely. But it
certainly means that whoever wins the nomination will then find the
task of going on to take the presidency harder than he would
otherwise have done.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain prevails, he will face a huge task of damage
limitation inside his own party. The religious right may well have
written him off already.
</P>
<P>
   After his attacks this week, many of their leaders would prefer
to lose with Bush than win with McCain. But the party establishment
too may be reluctant to support a man who is running so openly
against them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush is right: this is a hostile takeover of the party. That
does not mean it is unjustified. Hostile takeovers justify
themselves if they increase shareholder value (i.e., voter appeal).
But as with all such bids, this one would require a good deal of
managerial skill afterwards if it were to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush wins, his position will be akin to that of many a
struggling chairman who has just survived a takeover bid: once the
battle is over, he will have to start doing all the things he
denounced during the bid.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain is right, too: you cannot hope to win the presidency
with Republican votes alone (the party amounts to little more than
a third of the electorate). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush has time to change course. He has started to distance
himself from his moral-majority supporters. And he has a record (in
Texas, at least) of attracting new voters.
</P>
<P>
   But if the campaign has shown anything so far, it is the deep
disillusion with Bush that exists among independent and Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Having dug itself in around Bush, his party is now less well
placed than it was to win back the swing voters it will need in
November.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's wrath may be instinctive; but it is not unjustified. &QL;

   MEXICO CITY _ It is known as the ``February surprise.'' Every
year, shortly before the United States government announces on
March 1 which countries it ``certifies'' as willing allies in the
war on illegal drugs, Mexico unveils a new and bold anti-drugs
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, the surprise was on Mexico. Two days after
President Ernesto Zedillo announced a new push against organized
crime and trafficking in the border state of Baja California,
gunmen killed Alfredo de la Torre, the police chief of Tijuana, the
state's largest city, as he drove to his office on a Sunday without
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Tijuana, just across the border from San Diego, Calif., is home
to the Arellano Felix gang, one of Mexico's two main drugs mobs.
Its leaders are thought to have ordered the murder of a previous
police chief six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The death of de la Torre, just three days before U.S. President
Bill Clinton's decision to certify Mexico again, cast an ironic
light on that cynical diplomatic exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has never been decertified (which would mean a cut in
American aid), despite campaigns by some American congressmen and
its continued inability to make a dent in drugs-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   This year, trying to preempt the annual pantomime, officials on
both sides started hinting back in January that certification for
Mexico was a sure thing, and played up the extent of cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The ``dialogue of the deaf '' was over, said Rosario Green,
Mexico's foreign minister. It was not.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the Tijuana shooting, Jeffrey Davidow, the
United States' ambassador in Mexico City, commented that countries
such as Mexico were to drug trafficking what Sicily was to the
Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials had remained mute when Barry McCaffrey,
Clinton's anti-drugs czar, noted that half the cocaine entering the
United States did so through Mexico. But Davidow's less tactful
comments provoked an inconveniently timed row.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is spectacularly sensitive to American criticism of its
struggle against drugs, which it sees as hypocritical given the
United States' poor record in stemming drugs consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials proudly trumpet that seizures of all kinds of
illegal narcotics were higher last year than in 1998. A truer
measure of success, though, would be progress in dismantling drugs
rings and putting corrupt police and officials in jail. There,
things are gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   As Senator Jesse Helms pointed out, the drugs barons continue to
operate ``with virtual impunity'' in the border cities.
</P>
<P>
   American drugs fighters wonder why Jorge Carrillo Olea, a former
state governor suspected of protecting kidnappers and traffickers,
is still free nearly two years after he stepped down, and why Mario
Villanueva, another state governor suspected of trafficking, has
not been found since he fled last March, just before his governor's
term (and immunity from arrest) ended.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of de la Torre is a timely reminder that the
impunity continues. Predictably, it triggered a new declaration by
the Mexican government of a new war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And, just as predictably, it did not prevent President Clinton
this week from certifying Mexico, yet again. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO _ As the news came through in the middle of the
Santiago night that Britain was dropping extradition proceedings,
and that General Augusto Pinochet was finally going home, a small
group of his supporters staged a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents were dismayed. But after being detained for 17 months
in London, Chile's former dictator was returning much diminished
</P>
<P>
   Until his arrest, General Pinochet loomed over Chile as a
dominant and divisive figure, who still wielded political influence
even after a decade of democratic government. But during his
detention, most Chileans quickly became bored and baffled by the
legal intricacies of the case, and lapsed into indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Across the spectrum, politicians discovered that life without
the general was not only possible, but preferable.
</P>
<P>
   Even the extreme right-wing Independent Democratic Union party,
to which many former officials of the dictatorship belong, has said
that it will not be organizing a welcome-home ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, General Pinochet was likely to receive a subdued
reception, probably at a military air base, and then go to a
military hospital for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Chile's center-left government, and especially Ricardo Lagos, a
moderate socialist who takes over as the country's president on
March 11, will hope that the general then retires for a long, and
preferably permanent, rest.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, will the right-wing opposition, for whom he has become
a liability. But General Pinochet is an inveterate political
meddler.
</P>
<P>
   Even if only symbolically, he could attempt to take up again his
seat in Chile's Senate, awarded to him for life under his
dictatorship's own constitution.
</P>
<P>
   However, the general's legal troubles are not over. Over the
past two years, almost 60 cases have been filed against him in
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman, who is investigating the accusations, has
made far greater progress in the general's absence than even most
human-rights lawyers dared to hope. He has charged several senior
retired army officers allegedly involved in mass executions after
the 1973 military coup.
</P>
<P>
   But charging the dictator himself would be a very different
matter. He is, of course, in failing mental health, according to
the medical report done for the British authorities, but in Chile,
to escape trial, he would have to be certified as insane by
government forensic doctors. That is a humiliation he would be
unlikely to relish.
</P>
<P>
   So will he face a court? As a senator, he is immune from
prosecution. The first test of judicial resolve will come,
therefore, when prosecutors ask the Appeals Court to lift his
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they succeed, the Supreme Court might well overrule it.
The Supreme Court would require evidence that General Pinochet
ordered the executions, rather than just bearing the responsibility
of a commanding officer or head of state. That could be hard to
prove.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, during Chile's summer holidays, the government has
been quietly pushing through Congress a new bill that would grant
blanket immunity to former heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the general were somehow tried and convicted, an
amnesty law, passed by his own regime, still stands between the old
dictator and the inside of a Chilean prison.
</P>
<P>
   But for the man who once boasted that not a leaf moved in Chile
without his knowledge, political isolation now beckons. &QL;

&HT;     CALIFORNIANS ARE BUMMED OUT THAT THE CANDIDATES KISSED OFF THE
STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO_ Two major changes in California law transformed
Tuesday's primary and prompted the presidential candidates to
briefly focus their attention here, even if their natural instinct
was to ignore this unfathomable state and its unmapped new-economy
politics.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Californians get to vote early in the
presidential primary, and they get to vote for any candidate
regardless of party. Both of these changes seemed a perfect fit for
the Golden State: Virtually ignored on the national primary stage
every four years, the state and its increasingly independent
electorate would have a voice for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's real money being spent on real TV ads. There are real
live bodies campaigning in California _ that's something we haven't
seen in long, long time,`` said Tony Quinn, a Republican political
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But with the exception of a few rallies with mariachi bands and
Vietnamese dragon dances, the political discussion in California
has focused almost entirely on issues raised in earlier primaries
from smaller states that hardly represent the country's diversity.
Candidates have come through California on an assembly line,
dragging with them the confederate flag and the leadership of Bob
Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   In two separate statewide votes _ Proposition 198 in 1996 and
Prop. 3 in 1998 _ Californians said they wanted a truly open
primary, which would allow them to pick any candidate from any
party. But the rules were changed in the Legislature, because what
voters wanted conflicted with the rules of the establishment
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a two-tier voting system where anyone can vote for
any candidate _ the so-called ``beauty contest'' _ but only votes
of registered Republicans and Democrats will count in selecting
delegates. This system favors Bush and Gore because they long ago
wrapped up the establishment of their parties.
</P>
<P>
   The state could find itself in the strange position of having
one candidate _ McCain _ win the popular vote, but lose all 162 GOP
delegates to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President pro tem John L. Burton, D-San Francisco, the
most powerful Democrat in the Legislature, and Assembly Speaker
Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, who has endorsed Gore, helped
the Republican and Democratic front-runners get their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the national parties that rejected outsider's picking
their presidential candidates. This system has bothered McCain, who
notes Republicans make up only 35 percent of the electorate in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think they would want to actually win an election for a
change,`` he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest growing voting bloc in the state is voters who
decline to state their party. The new primary system shuts out this
entire population of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is a feeling of disconnect: The voters are
going in one direction, and the party regulars want to maintain
control,`` said Ann Crigler, director of USC's Jesse Unruh School
of Government. ``It seems to me there is this great effort by the
parties to control their power. But it's a little too late for that
. . . . The public is feeling frustrated, and they don't know what
to do, and this builds further on the lack of trust people have
with elected officials.``
</P>
<P>
   And Californians got little chance to hear the candidates' views
on state issues such as offshore oil drilling or former Gov. Pete
Wilson's controversial initiative to stiffen sentences for young
criminals. Instead the discussion focused on national issues and
national campaign tactics, fueled by the establishment national
media.
</P>
<P>
   And while the candidates did spend time in California before the
New Hampshire primary, they rushed through the state in the days
leading to Tuesday because the early primary has compacted the
whole election.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this one of the most confusing ballots in state history.
While the initiative system supposedly gives power back to the
people, it's really special interest groups and lawmakers who have
twisted Tuesday's election into a knot of new electoral rules and
old problems voters may have thought they took care of in previous
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Want to annoy the insurance industry? Then vote ``yes'' on the
two initiatives they put on the ballot. That's right, they want you
to vote against them, to repeal current law. Remember Indian
gaming? It's back on the ballot _ twice. Most Indian tribes want
you to vote for the first measure on the ballot, and reject the
older second measure, even though they appear on face value to be
virtually identical.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the way Californians vote and how they monitor
politicians keep getting changed. Once again Tuesday, there is a
campaign finance reform measure on the ballot, even as the last
campaign finance measure, Proposition 208, is being debated in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think you need a Ph.D. to cast a ballot in
California,'' said Kim Alexander, president of the nonpartisan
California Voter Foundation, which produces an online voter guide.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the California primary really mattered was in
1972, when George McGovern beat Hubert Humphrey and went on to win
the Democratic nomination. That extended fight lasted through the
California primary and into the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Republican primary in California mattered was in
1964 when Barry Goldwater beat Nelson Rockefeller, signaling the
shift of GOP power from the East Coast establishment to the Sun
Belt states.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this year's candidates have spent little time on state
issues, voters don't seem to mind much. Recent polls show that
three-quarters of California voters say they are paying close
attention to the presidential races.
</P>
<P>
   If Secretary of State Bill Jones is right, 52 percent of state
voters will cast ballots, which would be the largest turnout in 16
years in California.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen states will vote in primaries or caucuses Tuesday, what
some have called the country's first national primary. In a system
where each state vies to be the earliest, candidates are forced to
veer right in the South, move left in the North and in the West -
all in the same week. It's called the ``windshield wiper effect.''
</P>
<P>
   This windshield wiper system favors establishment candidates
like Gore because when things start moving quickly, ground-level
operations and special interest support provide invaluable help in
making phone calls, putting literature on doors, fanning out
high-powered endorsers all over the state to build media attention.
The result also is that candidates don't have time to focus on the
issues of each state or each region of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this any way to elect a president?'' asked Mark Petracca, a
political scientist at UC-Irvine. ``(What) people need to
understand is that it's not just that we in California want the
attention. They key difference is what are we going to talk about?
What difference does it make to Californians whether or not South
Carolina flies the confederate flag?''

<P>
   SANTIAGO _ As the news came through in the middle of the
Santiago night that Britain was dropping extradition proceedings,
and that General Augusto Pinochet was finally going home, a small
group of his supporters staged a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents were dismayed. But after being detained for 17 months
in London, Chile's former dictator was returning much diminished
</P>
<P>
   Until his arrest, General Pinochet loomed over Chile as a
dominant and divisive figure, who still wielded political influence
even after a decade of democratic government. But during his
detention, most Chileans quickly became bored and baffled by the
legal intricacies of the case, and lapsed into indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Across the spectrum, politicians discovered that life without
the general was not only possible, but preferable.
</P>
<P>
   Even the extreme right-wing Independent Democratic Union party,
to which many former officials of the dictatorship belong, has said
that it will not be organizing a welcome-home ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, General Pinochet was likely to receive a subdued
reception, probably at a military air base, and then go to a
military hospital for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Chile's center-left government, and especially Ricardo Lagos, a
moderate socialist who takes over as the country's president on
March 11, will hope that the general then retires for a long, and
preferably permanent, rest.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, will the right-wing opposition, for whom he has become
a liability. But General Pinochet is an inveterate political
meddler.
</P>
<P>
   Even if only symbolically, he could attempt to take up again his
seat in Chile's Senate, awarded to him for life under his
dictatorship's own constitution.
</P>
<P>
   However, the general's legal troubles are not over. Over the
past two years, almost 60 cases have been filed against him in
Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman, who is investigating the accusations, has
made far greater progress in the general's absence than even most
human-rights lawyers dared to hope. He has charged several senior
retired army officers allegedly involved in mass executions after
the 1973 military coup.
</P>
<P>
   But charging the dictator himself would be a very different
matter. He is, of course, in failing mental health, according to
the medical report done for the British authorities, but in Chile,
to escape trial, he would have to be certified as insane by
government forensic doctors. That is a humiliation he would be
unlikely to relish.
</P>
<P>
   So will he face a court? As a senator, he is immune from
prosecution. The first test of judicial resolve will come,
therefore, when prosecutors ask the Appeals Court to lift his
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they succeed, the Supreme Court might well overrule it.
The Supreme Court would require evidence that General Pinochet
ordered the executions, rather than just bearing the responsibility
of a commanding officer or head of state. That could be hard to
prove.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, during Chile's summer holidays, the government has
been quietly pushing through Congress a new bill that would grant
blanket immunity to former heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the general were somehow tried and convicted, an
amnesty law, passed by his own regime, still stands between the old
dictator and the inside of a Chilean prison.
</P>
<P>
   But for the man who once boasted that not a leaf moved in Chile
without his knowledge, political isolation now beckons. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Making money and making war have long been related
activities. That soldiers loot and arms manufacturers turn a profit
is hardly new. But is competition for wealth and resources becoming
the major cause of new wars around the world?
</P>
<P>
   Where tribal violence, independence struggles or Cold-War
rivalry were once blamed for wars, now bandits, traders and some
businesses are being fingered, especially in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Though some conflicts are ethnic or religious clashes (as in
Kosovo) or stem from scraps over influence (a concern of Uganda in
Congo), many of today's wars, especially civil ones, have a strong
commercial element too often ignored by analysts outside, though
not by businessmen willing to profit from war.
</P>
<P>
   Prolonged internal violence in countries with rich natural
resources but corrupt or weak governments may best be understood as
battles for money or resources, suggests a report to be published
by the International Committee of the Red Cross this month.
</P>
<P>
   Some wars are caused in a large part by corruption and banditry
(Sierra Leone), whereas others which may have begun as ethnic or
ideological conflicts, are now sustained in part by illicit trading
(opium in Afghanistan, cocaine in Colombia).
</P>
<P>
   Rebels, governments and even peacekeepers have fought for
diamonds, minerals and timber in recent wars in Liberia and Sierra
Leone. In the latter, peace was won only when the rebels' leader,
Foday Sankoh, was given a say in the country's mining industry.
</P>
<P>
   A long-running war in Angola, once seen as ideological, is
condemned by its people, foreign observers and governments as, to a
large part, a scramble for oil (by the government) and for diamonds
(by the rebels).
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of this, the rebels have even been offered
permission to operate the diamond mines legally, if they would come
to terms, which they would not.
</P>
<P>
   In Indochina, illegal logging can be as valuable as drugs: the
Khmers Rouges financed their later campaigns in Cambodia from
timber.
</P>
<P>
   Wars in such countries serve some participants well. Violence
provides a cover for the extraction and smuggling of resources, and
armies, either private or national, give the means to control
workers, transport and territory.
</P>
<P>
   War itself can be the means of getting rich (for example, in
trading arms or by fighting as a mercenary) or of survival (bands
of ill-educated young men recruited into armies in Sierra Leone or
in Colombia make guerrilla warfare a way of life).
</P>
<P>
   Such participants may continue to exploit a war rather than win
it and end it. For outsiders who want to encourage peace, wars for
resources may therefore be particularly hard to bring to an end.
</P>
<P>
   If the belligerents have no political goals, they may have no
interest in negotiation. Those who benefit from war will not
welcome mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, international efforts to stop the supply of arms to
private armies, to forbid trade in diamonds mined in war zones, or
to tackle the demand for illegal drugs may be more effective.
</P>
<P>
   But sanctions offer the powerful _ those with guns and armies
again _ the chance to make even more money, by smuggling goods in
and out of war zones and then charging high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Busting sanctions can be a lucrative business. ``Remember, this
war is about making money,'' explained a Sierra Leonean journalist
in Freetown during that country's war, before ticking off the
interests of fighters, mercenaries, peacekeepers, aid workers and
other hangers-on at the war's edges.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of money in war, says the report, should be borne in
mind by outsiders whose spending may cause inflation, whose aid may
feed rebels and whose trading may prolong the fighting
indefinitely. &QL;

UPN, FOX MANAGE TO KILL EVEN MORE BRAIN CELLS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Tonight is TUESDAY, March 7 in this story. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 1 star for ``Secret Agent Man,'' 2 stars for ``Family
Guy'' 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fox and UPN, understanding just how cynically apolitical the TV
viewing populace really is, has prepared some
lowest-common-denominator counterprogramming for us while the
networks report on Super Tuesday. The best that can be said of this
fare: Even something as tediously trivial as the future of our
country looks good by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   First up: ``Secret Agent Man,'' UPN's long-delayed action series
whose relationship with the `60s Patrick McGoohan series begins and
ends with the theme song (the title sequence is replete with
Bondian flourishes in the music and silhouettes of cavorting
babes). Whatever UPN has been doing since it took it off the fall
schedule _ allowing it to age on the shelf, or copiously
rejiggering it _ hasn't had much of an effect on the quality, or
lack of same.
</P>
<P>
   Like the already-canceled ``The Strip,'' ``Secret Agent Man''
boasts semi-coherent storytelling, witless wit and the one thing
that's supposed to atone for its multitude of sins _ ample
pulchritudinous bosoms and bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Our hero is Monk (Costas Mandylor, which, if you think about it,
is actually a better name for a hero in an idiotic action series
than Monk), who, like most secret-agent men, has a spiffy suit, a
little black book the size of the Manhattan Yellow Pages and a
propensity for fighting in slo-mo with the occasional inexplicable
freeze-frame. He works for some vague organization that has a lot
of cool, giant, high-tech computer screens on the walls and sultry
employees who coolly cascade through the background in short black
cocktail dresses.
</P>
<P>
   In tonight's pilot, he meets up with an on-the-lam exotic
foreign spy with whom he apparently has a history, and there's this
group that wants her back and has this sci-fi-looking gizmo that
makes electricity go crazy and they'll do bad things if Monk
doesn't sacrifice this exotic foreign spy, as we noted, with whom
he apparently has a history. His vague organization, not wanting
electricity to go crazy anymore, decides to sell out Monk, even if
he is their absolute best agent, and so Monk's partner Holiday
(Dina Meyer) and buddy Davis (Dondre T. Whitfield) are torn between
their semi-fierce loyalty to Monk and the prospect of having to
find new jobs where they won't likely get to wear spiffy suits and
black cocktail dresses.
</P>
<P>
   See, even if this is the first episode of this series, these
interconnected relationships are supposed to resonate with us so
deeply that we'll care about this exotic spy, his vague
organization's selling him out and his partner's semi-fierce
loyalty. But not even the actors bother trying to sell us the
premise !ital!or the tongue-in-cheekiness _ and not one of them
exudes the sort of cool, intelligent charisma that one expects from
a spy (although the bad guy with the electrical gizmo, played by
Jesus Garcia, is fun and should be given an expanded role in the
series). Bottom line: It's as bad as everything else on UPN. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
`FAMILY GUY'
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Over on Fox comes the re-relaunch of ``Family Guy,''
Wunderkind animator Seth McFarlane's deadpan, low-brow but
high-concept series. The problem with the show isn't that it's not
funny enough _ though it often isn't _ but that its funniest bits
are the throwaway parodies, with virtually no attention spent on
making the story or characters interesting.
</P>
<P>
   So, tonight, there are pretty wicked little riffs on ``Mr.
Rogers' Neighborhood'' and ``The Jetsons,'' but the actual story _
Brian the family dog has some bizarre pseudo-Oedipal crush on the
lady of the house, while evil, Peter Lorre-esque infant Stewie
stews about menacingly in the background _ is a snoozer. And the
characters, Xeroxes of Xeroxes of an army of semi-eccentrics from
countless other shows, don't exactly inspire or invite repeat
viewings. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Secret Agent Man.'' &QL; 
What: Action-adventure series. &QL; 
Who: Costas Mandylor, Dina Meyer, Dondre T. Whitfield. &QL; 
Where: UPN. &QL; 
When: 8 tonight. &QL; 
Our rating: 1 star &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Family Guy.'' &QL; 
What: Animated series about a family that may be dysfunctional, but
can do gross-out gags with the best of `em. &QL; 
Where: Fox. &QL; 
When: 8:30 tonight. &QL; 
Our rating: 2 stars &QL;

<P>
   BRATISLAVA _ Mikulas Dzurkinda, the Slovak prime minister,
winces when asked what he thinks of Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very hard question,'' he says after a long pause. ``I'm
certain Austria will stay democratic. But,'' he adds, ``demagogues
are frightening. Imagine the trouble they could cause if they got
hold of our Gypsy question.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. If the politics of hate were to make a comeback in lands
to the east of the present EU, Gypsies could be prime targets.
</P>
<P>
   When Haider's supporters deride Slovakia, they invariably have
Gypsies in mind. If Slovakia joined the Union, say some Haiderites,
incoming Slovakian Gypsies would become a problem for Austria.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, several thousand of them have sought
asylum in the EU, particularly in Finland and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Though Romania has the largest number of Gypsies (also known as
Roma) in Europe, Slovakia has the highest proportion: some say they
are nearly a tenth of Slovakia's population of 5 million.
</P>
<P>
   And the average of 4.2 children per Gypsy family, compared with
1.5 for other Slovaks, means that by the last quarter of this
century there might be as many Gypsies as ethnic Slovaks.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of Slovakia's Gypsies has long been grim. But since
communism ended, it has become even grimmer.
</P>
<P>
   Four out of five have no job. Life expectancy is falling,
illiteracy rising, crime rife. Tuberculosis is again common in
Gypsy villages. Large families, sometimes 14-strong, often cram
into squalid shacks that used to house three or four people.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsy children are particularly vulnerable. Few get much
education. One study reckons that only 3 percent of them finish
secondary school.
</P>
<P>
   In primary school, they start off with social and linguistic
disadvantages that are hard to redress. Some speak little Slovak,
are ill-fed and do not know how to use soap or cutlery.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them, including bright ones, are summarily dumped in
special schools for the mentally handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   An extra foundation year at the start of primary school, known
as ``zero grade,'' has been tried successfully in some places, so
the government hopes to offer it to Gypsy children across the
country, starting this autumn. But persuading their parents to keep
them at school after 14 is harder.
</P>
<P>
   Slovakia's president, Rudolf Schuster, thinks that special
boarding schools might be set up. ``It's often impossible for Gypsy
children to learn at home,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in 1998, the ruling coalition government,
which replaced a more nationalistic one that included a virulently
anti-Gypsy (and anti-Hungarian) party, has tried to tackle the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the EU will not let Slovakia into its club
until it is satisfied that the country's Gypsies are being given a
fair deal. So Slovakia has held international conferences on the
matter, has listened hard, and doled out cash for schemes approved
by Gypsies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gypsies do not always help their own cause. Slovakia's
have at least 13 political parties, which spend as much time
fighting each other as trying to improve their people's lot.
</P>
<P>
   And, abject as most Gypsies are, for many of them theft is,
sadly, a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Dzurinda recounts, with evident sympathy, how poor Slovak
farmers often accost him with tales of how crops and animals, even
pet dogs, have been stolen by Gypsies. ``They have tears in their
eyes. They want to know who will pay for their chickens.''
</P>
<P>
   All the same, most Slovaks still seem loath to give their Gypsy
citizens a chance. Michal Vasecka, who studies Gypsies at a Slovak
think-tank, tells how people, in reply to his questionnaires, often
add their own suggestions: ``Send them to the gas chambers!'' or
``Back to India!'' or ``Kill them!'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the better-disposed sort of Slovak politicians, such as
Dzurinda and Schuster, flatly deny that their countrymen are
prejudiced against the Gypsies at all. &QL;

&HT;     NO NEED TO SABOTAGE THE REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One month a Republican, and I can't wait to get
back to the party of Hillary and Bill and Al and the other Bill,
the one who used to have an outside shot. That's how painful this
presidential primary has been.
</P>
<P>
   How backward is the Republican Party? The GOP has taken us into
a new millennium with a primary based on religious warfare _ and
between different groups of Christians, of all things.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush spoke at South Carolina's Bob Jones University,
whose president, Bob Jones III, described Catholicism and Mormonism
as ``cults which call themselves Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Bush was speaking at a ``university'' opposed to universal
human and religious rights. John McCain and the press hung him out
to dry for it. Over and over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Never trust a university that calls itself Bob.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since that speech, Bush has been defending himself, saying
he isn't an anti-Catholic bigot, and finally apologizing to the
nation and especially Cardinal O'Connor of New York, a state filled
with voting Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Just when I thought Bush was toast, up popped McCain from the
other slot in the toaster. He condemned the fundamentalist
influence on the Republican Party and called Pat Robertson and
Jerry Falwell ``evil.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of lefties might agree. But Robertson and Falwell are just
attention-getting buffoons, not Hitlers or even Darth Vaders.
Falwell is afraid of Teletubbies, for crying out loud.
</P>
<P>
   And believe it or not, most fundamentalist Christians are good
people, not to mention good Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Is McCain as crazy as Bush is stupid? Does McCain think we're
stupid? He claimed he was just joking when he called Falwell and
Robertson ``evil.'' You know, like when he jokes around with that
word ``gook.''
</P>
<P>
   Give us a better excuse, John. How about ``my speech writer
misspelled it. I meant `vile,' not `evil.' No, no, I meant
`live.'''
</P>
<P>
   What the heck is going on in this party, and why do they call it
conservative?
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain are fighting for the right to be called the true
heir to Ronald Reagan. When I think of that most genial of
presidents, I'm glad of one mercy. At least he's not following any
of this.
</P>
<P>
   My original motivation in registering Republican was not just to
lower my handicap or increase my net worth. The idea was to
sabotage the Republican leadership that gave us a disgusting
impeachment and a nonentity son of a Bush to be coronated as
president.
</P>
<P>
   The only votes that counted toward delegates in Tuesday's open
primary were votes by registered Republicans, so I thought I'd vote
for the insurgent against the anointed.
</P>
<P>
   I knew McCain is just as conservative as Bush, if not more so.
He's against gay rights and women's right to abortion, and he
received a 100-percent rating from the Christian Coalition,
presumably in one of its less evil moments.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is interesting _ too interesting, as it turned out.
The insurgent surged as the nation grasped for a genuine hero as
president. Americans periodically do that, usually getting a
Franklin Pierce or a Ulysses S. Grant, and only once getting a
George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has the appeal of a straight-shooter, even if he
occasionally shoots straight from the lip to the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and independents have turned out in droves for the man
who would beat the Bush, and could put Al Gore through the
wood-chipper.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain's victory in Michigan I thought I'd better vote for
Bush as the lesser of the two candidates who would pack the Supreme
Court with Clarence Thomases.
</P>
<P>
   Boy George is so painful to listen to (what does he store in his
mouth, pecans?) that by November voters will be screaming for Al
Gore to loosen the collar on that earth-tone shirt and tell them
all about what he and Tipper think about clinical depression.
</P>
<P>
   Now I don't think I'll vote for either Bush or McCain. They
don't need me to sabotage them.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't talked much about issues that Californians care
about. In fact, they barely came to California, and during
Thursday's debate, McCain appeared via television screen like Bill
Gates without the charisma.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, we've heard more about Bob Jones University
than health care, Social Security and the high price of putting
kids through real universities, like the University of California,
which many Republicans consider useful only as an affirmative
action punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   By now I doubt that McCain and Bush want to continue their
little religious war, but if they do, it'll be like Iran versus
Iraq. I won't choose sides.
</P>
<P>
   I can't quite stomach being a Gore Republican either. Maybe I'll
vote for the Green Party guy in the black suit, Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   If I want to mix religion with politics, I'll take a real
puritan.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On the Internet, naming your start-up can be
more arduous than financing it. This is because most Internet
addresses, known as domain names, have been taken.
</P>
<P>
   In the .com domain, the most desirable online real estate,
almost every recognizable word has been claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs often have no choice but to buy an address from
the person who occupies it, sometimes paying tens of thousands of
dollars in cash or shares. Such deals have become a sort of tax on
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A solution may be at hand. Next week, the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which oversees the domain
name system (DNS), is meeting in Cairo, to discuss adding new
``top-level'' domains, the global designations such as .com and
country-specific ones such as .uk (for Britain).
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake. If the name space of the Internet cannot grow,
e-commerce could suffer. Furthermore, this week's meeting could
make or break ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   If the organization can broker an agreement, it will establish
itself as a part of the machinery of Internet governance. If not,
many on the Internet will conclude that ICANN is beholden to
business _ and start thinking about an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   When Internet pioneers devised the DNS in the mid-1980s, their
goal was, in the words of the late Jon Postel, their leading light,
to create ``a reasonably large and appropriately structured naming
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to link user-friendly names to the baffling strings
of numbers that identify computers online.
</P>
<P>
   The top-level domains, such as .com, were subdivided into
second-level domains (networks), which were in turn split into
third-level domains (host computers), and so on.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail in 1984 Postel wrote that his online address might
one day be ``postel &LR; isi.usc.edu,'' where ``.edu'' stands for
educational organization, ``usc'' for University of Southern
California and ``isi'' for Information Sciences Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But Postel and his colleagues did not foresee the explosive
growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And many businesses and people wanted their own second-level
domains, in particular those ending with .com, a trend promoted by
Network Solutions, a company that until June 1999 had the monopoly
of supplying .com registrations.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1999 there were about 7.2 million .coms, compared
with roughly 1.8 million .net and .org addresses. All this has made
the scarcity of names more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Offline, companies can share a name, so long as they are in
different markets. Online, one name can serve only one company,
since a Web address is a unique locator.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, businesses need a good Web name, because it attracts
traffic. One reason why Barnes &AMP; Noble struggled against Amazon was
that its initial address, now www.bn.com, was ungainly.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, you can easily add new domains _ as happens
whenever a country claims its two-letter code. The DNS, experts
say, could safely support several thousand top-level domains.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Postel proposed adding 150 new domains as early as 1996.
But his plan was fiercely contested _ for the very same reasons
that ICANN's plans could today come to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The main objections come from the owners of trademarks. They
have invested a lot of money in their names and have often fought
or bought off ``cybersquatters,'' people who register Web addresses
merely to sell them later.
</P>
<P>
   New domains risk diluting these brands and might also increase
the costs of policing them. So before ICANN creates new domains,
trademark-owners argue, all the names in existing domains should
first be used.
</P>
<P>
   But others retort that corporate intellectual property should
not be protected by unnecessary limits on the name space of the
Internet. Anyway, they argue, business exaggerates the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Domain disputes can be settled according to a set of rules,
called the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy, which was established
by ICANN and has successfully resolved eight cases.
</P>
<P>
   Policing costs could be reduced if top-level domain registries
made their databases easy to search, so that potential conflicts
were automatically identified.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these differences, a working group within ICANN has
hammered out a consensus to create some new global top-level
domains. To start with, these would number only six to ten, and
more would not be created without careful study.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is still lots to disagree over. Trademark-owners
want certain safeguards, such as protection of famous and
well-known trademarks in all domains.
</P>

   On the other hand, with too many domains, the Internet risks
becoming so confusing that consumers will react by sticking more

   SAN FRANCISCO _ On the Internet, naming your start-up can be
more arduous than financing it. This is because most Internet
addresses, known as domain names, have been taken.
</P>
<P>
   In the .com domain, the most desirable online real estate,
almost every recognizable word has been claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs often have no choice but to buy an address from
the person who occupies it, sometimes paying tens of thousands of
dollars in cash or shares. Such deals have become a sort of tax on
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A solution may be at hand. Next week, the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which oversees the domain
name system (DNS), is meeting in Cairo, to discuss adding new
``top-level'' domains, the global designations such as .com and
country-specific ones such as .uk (for Britain).
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake. If the name space of the Internet cannot grow,
e-commerce could suffer. Furthermore, this week's meeting could
make or break ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   If the organization can broker an agreement, it will establish
itself as a part of the machinery of Internet governance. If not,
many on the Internet will conclude that ICANN is beholden to
business _ and start thinking about an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   When Internet pioneers devised the DNS in the mid-1980s, their
goal was, in the words of the late Jon Postel, their leading light,
to create ``a reasonably large and appropriately structured naming
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to link user-friendly names to the baffling strings
of numbers that identify computers online.
</P>
<P>
   The top-level domains, such as .com, were subdivided into
second-level domains (networks), which were in turn split into
third-level domains (host computers), and so on.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail in 1984 Postel wrote that his online address might
one day be ``postel &LR; isi.usc.edu,'' where ``.edu'' stands for
educational organization, ``usc'' for University of Southern
California and ``isi'' for Information Sciences Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But Postel and his colleagues did not foresee the explosive
growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And many businesses and people wanted their own second-level
domains, in particular those ending with .com, a trend promoted by
Network Solutions, a company that until June 1999 had the monopoly
of supplying .com registrations.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1999 there were about 7.2 million .coms, compared
with roughly 1.8 million .net and .org addresses. All this has made
the scarcity of names more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Offline, companies can share a name, so long as they are in
different markets. Online, one name can serve only one company,
since a Web address is a unique locator.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, businesses need a good Web name, because it attracts
traffic. One reason why Barnes &AMP; Noble struggled against Amazon was
that its initial address, now www.bn.com, was ungainly.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, you can easily add new domains _ as happens
whenever a country claims its two-letter code. The DNS, experts
say, could safely support several thousand top-level domains.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Postel proposed adding 150 new domains as early as 1996.
But his plan was fiercely contested _ for the very same reasons
that ICANN's plans could today come to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The main objections come from the owners of trademarks. They
have invested a lot of money in their names and have often fought
or bought off ``cybersquatters,'' people who register Web addresses
merely to sell them later.
</P>
<P>
   New domains risk diluting these brands and might also increase
the costs of policing them. So before ICANN creates new domains,
trademark-owners argue, all the names in existing domains should
first be used.
</P>
<P>
   But others retort that corporate intellectual property should
not be protected by unnecessary limits on the name space of the
Internet. Anyway, they argue, business exaggerates the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Domain disputes can be settled according to a set of rules,
called the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy, which was established
by ICANN and has successfully resolved eight cases.
</P>
<P>
   Policing costs could be reduced if top-level domain registries
made their databases easy to search, so that potential conflicts
were automatically identified.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these differences, a working group within ICANN has
hammered out a consensus to create some new global top-level
domains. To start with, these would number only six to ten, and
more would not be created without careful study.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is still lots to disagree over. Trademark-owners
want certain safeguards, such as protection of famous and
well-known trademarks in all domains.
</P>
<P>
   Their opponents want ICANN to declare that it will gradually add
500 new domains in the next three years. To complicate things
further, ICANN also faces disputes about the administration of the
new domains.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed arguments are likely over how ICANN should select new
domains and how to define which companies should keep the
registries of addresses that they contain.
</P>
<P>
   Should registries operate on a nonprofit basis? Can any firm
make a business from allotting names a new domain? Whatever the
outcome, ICANN should not forget the poor old Internet user.
</P>
<P>
   More top domains promises more choice and innovation. The
European Union could fulfil a dream by launching .eu as a
competitor to .com. Sites with .con could be for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami, is
proposing .tel, so that consumers could look up a number in a
telephone book, type www.(telephone number).tel into a browser, and
call up the subscriber's Web page.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, with too many domains, the Internet risks
becoming so confusing that consumers will react by sticking more
fiercely to the familiar .coms. Even online, governance is an
exercise in compromise. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ When the Gettys sold the family business to Texaco
in 1984, Mark Getty, one of J. Paul's grandsons, realized they had
lost more than a company: they had given up the knowledge and the
contacts available only to an industry insider.
</P>
<P>
   He made up his mind to become an insider again, without knowing
what industry he would go into, and persuaded three-quarters of the
family _ his father, two uncles and 13 of 18 cousins _ to back him.
</P>
<P>
   He set up in London with a colleague from Hambros, an investment
bank where he had been working, and started to look around.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many deals he was offered was the Telegraph
newspaper's library of color photographs. He liked the idea; was
outbid, and started looking at other libraries.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in his 14th acquisition in five years, he finally
bought the Telegraph library: it is part of Visual Communications,
for which he paid United News and Media $220 million.
</P>
<P>
   Once the takeover is complete, Getty Images will have around 70
million images, making it bigger than its main competitor, Bill
Gates's privately-held Corbis, which has 65 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Gettys who supported Mark have done better since Getty
Images floated in 1998 than they would have if they had left their
money in oil.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Getty like the idea of photography? Partly because of
its obscurity. ``There was this whole industry there, and nobody
had heard of it. Even the people working in it didn't think it was
a very interesting business.''
</P>
<P>
   Its fragmentation increased its appeal. Getty looked at the way
the business worked, concluded that there was no good reason for it
to be fragmented, and set about consolidating it.
</P>
<P>
   He also spotted that there was scope for increasing efficiency
by digitizing the business and putting it on the Internet _ and
that, as it was modernized, the economies of scale would increase.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning images, giving them key words so that researchers can
find them, creating data centers and Web sites, building thick
pipes for downloading images, all raise the fixed costs of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Getty Images has spent around $30 million in the past two years
on building its electronic infrastructure. Scanning and giving key
words for each picture costs around $45. Some 1.2 million out of a
planned total of 3 million have been done so far.
</P>
<P>
   Small firms cannot afford that sort of investment. So Getty is
integrating the companies he has bought (with some difficulty,
since most used to be rivals), putting the most valuable images
online and building four Web sites through which different markets
will gain access to them: Gettyone for advertisers, Gettysource for
editorial, Gettyworks for small businesses and art.com for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Customers on the Web sites will be offered not only photographs,
but also software and data _ a range of intellectual property, in
other words, all of it belonging to Getty Images.
</P>
<P>
   So is Getty simply doing what oilmen have always tried to do _
corner the market in a scarce resource?
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see the vulpine grandfather in this friendly,
thoughtful 39-year-old, but Getty acknowledges some similarities: a
voracious appetite for irrelevant knowledge and a business dealing
in the lifeblood of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intellectual property,'' he says, ``is the oil of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the richest men a hundred years ago: they all made
their money extracting natural resources or moving them around. All
today's richest men have made their money out of intellectual
property.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there, he reckons, the similarities end, because the kind of
organization that was needed to drill oil was very different from
the kind of organization needed to generate and manage intellectual
property.
</P>
<P>
   In the oil business, the capital is in the ground; in the
intellectual-property business, it is in people's heads.
</P>
<P>
   J. Paul could afford to be autocratic (``One is very nearly
always let down by underlings,'' he said), mean (he once fired all
his employees and rehired them at lower salaries) and distant (for
the last 20 years of his life, he did not once visit his company
headquarters in Los Angeles).
</P>
<P>
   Mark cannot. He has shifted his headquarters from London to
Seattle, keeps his family in London and travels to and fro about
once every two weeks. His employees are fulsome about him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, says Getty, you can't corner the market in photographic
imagery. Pictures are not a finite resource.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some areas we have more images than the rest of the market
put together. But libraries are being built up at a terrific pace.
A photographer in a lifetime will produce maybe a million images,
and there are about 15,000 professionals at work out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the famous images, such as Henri Cartier-Bresson's
pictures, that form the bulk of the consumer business are in
limited supply. And Getty is busy building other barriers to entry
to his business.
</P>
<P>
   Just as scale was the barrier to entry in the oil business,
because of the high costs of finding the stuff, so it is in the
expensive world of digitized photography, because of the costs of
reliable technology, a big library and establishing a strong
brand. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,025 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the small libraries disappear, the rivalry between Getty
Images and Bill Gates's Corbis is getting as sharp as that between
the old oil magnates, especially now that Corbis is moving into the
profitable advertising market that Getty seemed to have conquered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going after them,'' says Leslie Hughes, of Corbis
Images.
</P>
<P>
   Getty has the advantage of a roaring share price to finance
acquisitions. But Corbis has Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Given Getty's emphasis on the differences between him and J.
Paul, it seems curious that he has chosen the Getty name for his
brand. No other Internet mogul has done this. Nor, for that matter,
did any of the other oil magnates. Odd, that. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ When the Gettys sold the family business to Texaco
in 1984, Mark Getty, one of J. Paul's grandsons, realized they had
lost more than a company: they had given up the knowledge and the
contacts available only to an industry insider.
</P>
<P>
   He made up his mind to become an insider again, without knowing
what industry he would go into, and persuaded three-quarters of the
family _ his father, two uncles and 13 of 18 cousins _ to back him.
</P>
<P>
   He set up in London with a colleague from Hambros, an investment
bank where he had been working, and started to look around.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many deals he was offered was the Telegraph
newspaper's library of color photographs. He liked the idea; was
outbid, and started looking at other libraries.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in his 14th acquisition in five years, he finally
bought the Telegraph library: it is part of Visual Communications,
for which he paid United News and Media $220 million.
</P>
<P>
   Once the takeover is complete, Getty Images will have around 70
million images, making it bigger than its main competitor, Bill
Gates's privately-held Corbis, which has 65 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Gettys who supported Mark have done better since Getty
Images floated in 1998 than they would have if they had left their
money in oil.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Getty like the idea of photography? Partly because of
its obscurity. ``There was this whole industry there, and nobody
had heard of it. Even the people working in it didn't think it was
a very interesting business.''
</P>
<P>
   Its fragmentation increased its appeal. Getty looked at the way
the business worked, concluded that there was no good reason for it
to be fragmented, and set about consolidating it.
</P>
<P>
   He also spotted that there was scope for increasing efficiency
by digitizing the business and putting it on the Internet _ and
that, as it was modernized, the economies of scale would increase.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning images, giving them key words so that researchers can
find them, creating data centers and Web sites, building thick
pipes for downloading images, all raise the fixed costs of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Getty Images has spent around $30 million in the past two years
on building its electronic infrastructure. Scanning and giving key
words for each picture costs around $45. Some 1.2 million out of a
planned total of 3 million have been done so far.
</P>
<P>
   Small firms cannot afford that sort of investment. So Getty is
integrating the companies he has bought (with some difficulty,
since most used to be rivals), putting the most valuable images
online and building four Web sites through which different markets
will gain access to them: Gettyone for advertisers, Gettysource for
editorial, Gettyworks for small businesses and art.com for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Customers on the Web sites will be offered not only photographs,
but also software and data _ a range of intellectual property, in
other words, all of it belonging to Getty Images.
</P>
<P>
   So is Getty simply doing what oilmen have always tried to do _
corner the market in a scarce resource?
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see the vulpine grandfather in this friendly,
thoughtful 39-year-old, but Getty acknowledges some similarities: a
voracious appetite for irrelevant knowledge and a business dealing
in the lifeblood of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intellectual property,'' he says, ``is the oil of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the richest men a hundred years ago: they all made
their money extracting natural resources or moving them around. All
today's richest men have made their money out of intellectual
property.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there, he reckons, the similarities end, because the kind of
organization that was needed to drill oil was very different from
the kind of organization needed to generate and manage intellectual
property.
</P>
<P>
   In the oil business, the capital is in the ground; in the
intellectual-property business, it is in people's heads.
</P>
<P>
   J. Paul could afford to be autocratic (``One is very nearly
always let down by underlings,'' he said), mean (he once fired all
his employees and rehired them at lower salaries) and distant (for
the last 20 years of his life, he did not once visit his company
headquarters in Los Angeles).
</P>
<P>
   Mark cannot. He has shifted his headquarters from London to
Seattle, keeps his family in London and travels to and fro about
once every two weeks. His employees are fulsome about him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, says Getty, you can't corner the market in photographic
imagery. Pictures are not a finite resource.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some areas we have more images than the rest of the market
put together. But libraries are being built up at a terrific pace.
A photographer in a lifetime will produce maybe a million images,
and there are about 15,000 professionals at work out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the famous images, such as Henri Cartier-Bresson's
pictures, that form the bulk of the consumer business are in
limited supply. And Getty is busy building other barriers to entry
to his business.
</P>
<P>
   Just as scale was the barrier to entry in the oil business,
because of the high costs of finding the stuff, so it is in the
expensive world of digitized photography, because of the costs of
reliable technology, a big library and establishing a strong
brand. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 300-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,025 WORDS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the small libraries disappear, the rivalry between Getty
Images and Bill Gates's Corbis is getting as sharp as that between
the old oil magnates, especially now that Corbis is moving into the
profitable advertising market that Getty seemed to have conquered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going after them,'' says Leslie Hughes, of Corbis
Images.
</P>
<P>
   Getty has the advantage of a roaring share price to finance
acquisitions. But Corbis has Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Given Getty's emphasis on the differences between him and J.
Paul, it seems curious that he has chosen the Getty name for his
brand. No other Internet mogul has done this. Nor, for that matter,
did any of the other oil magnates. Odd, that. &QL;

   A SOUTH AFRICAN AIR FORCE HELICOPTER OVER MOZAMBIQUE _ A scarlet
shawl on a stick poked out from the leaves and waved. The pilot saw
it and went down.
</P>
<P>
   The blast from the helicopter's rotors flattened the boughs to
reveal 22 Mozambicans clinging to a single tree to avoid the
churning waters below.
</P>
<P>
   South African airmen pulled them on board, where they huddled in
an exhausted daze clutching bags of half-rotten maize. They were
the lucky ones. There are not enough helicopters to reach everyone
who needs to be rescued.
</P>
<P>
   As the worst floods in living memory continue to swirl, parts of
South Africa, Zimbabwe and especially Mozambique need help to stop
the death toll from climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclone Eline and heavy rain have swamped countless villages and
left perhaps 1 million people homeless. The usually placid Limpopo
and Zambezi Rivers have swollen to rushing torrents up to 125km (80
miles) wide, sweeping away buildings and hurling livestock into the
Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   More storms are forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Rain is supposed to fall on rich and poor alike, but this deluge
has hit hardest those least able to cope. Mozambique, the poorest
country in the region, is the worst affected.
</P>
<P>
   This is a cruel reward for all the efforts which had helped to
turn this unlucky country into one of the world's fastest-growing
economies, at last giving hope to a people who had been reduced,
many of them, by two decades of civil war to wearing tree bark and
eating wild berries.
</P>
<P>
   The floods have pushed back into poverty large numbers of
Mozambicans who had recently begun to lift themselves out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Just as bad, the flooding has almost certainly dislodged
thousands of landmines and carried them into places previously
considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambican peasants usually plant some of their crops on low
ground, which is damper and more fertile, and some higher up, in
case nearby rivers flood. But this year's floods are so much
heavier than usual that not only have the low fields been turned to
muddy porridge but much of the hillside crop has also been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Medecins sans Frontieres, a French charity, estimates that
220,000 Mozambicans will need food aid in the next three months, a
figure that will rise if the waters do not recede before the
planting season, which should begin in April.
</P>
<P>
   The Mozambican government estimates that 900,000 of its citizens
will need assistance of some sort, and has asked donors for $65
million. Only $13.5 million had been pledged by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Things in Zimbabwe are better, but not all that much. The floods
have killed at least 60 people and affected the lives of perhaps
another 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Maize production, which fell short of domestic demand last year,
will fall even shorter this year. President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe declared a state of emergency in three of his country's
eight provinces on Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign donors are starting to send food and logistical support,
but hesitate to offer much cash to a government with a reputation
for squandering it on perks for ministers and a dubious war in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is better able than its neighbors to cope with the
flooding especially as a smaller proportion of its territory is
affected, but it is still struggling.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 people have died, mainly from drowning, in the
Northern Province. Perhaps 80,000 are homeless, and several small
towns have been cut off from the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, Zimbabwe and neighboring Zambia have all opened
some of the floodgates on their dams to lower the water level
upstream. Unfortunately, this has released more water into
Mozambique, making the rescue work there even harder.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to fly food and vaccines to the needy are hampered
because the victims are scattered in small groups around a vast
area, and are constantly on the move to escape the shifting waters.
</P>
<P>
   And water is not the only peril they face. The floods bring
disease with them. Vast stretches of new swampland are a
breeding-ground for malarial mosquitoes. Torrents of filthy water
can spread cholera.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger and exhaustion among those clinging to trees or bridges
lower their resistance to disease. And, since between an eighth and
a quarter of adults in the flooded countries are HIV-afflicted,
that resistance is often not very great to start with. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are consolations. Mozambique's Mozal aluminium smelter,
the country's largest foreign investment, has lost less than a
week's work.
</P>
<P>
   A toll road connecting Maputo, Mozambique's capital and most
useful port, with Johannesburg will still probably be completed on
time.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's factory outside Maputo has been submerged beneath
two meters of dirty water, and its staff have had to throw away
millions of bottles, most of their computers and thousands of tons
of contaminated sugar; but the plant should soon be working again.
</P>
<P>
   For the very poor, which means most of the flood's victims, it
will take longer to mend the damage. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000 WORDS) &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Some have managed to save a few of their possessions _ pots,
blankets, bags of maize flour _ by hauling them up trees. Others
have lost everything.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to roads makes it hard to get food to them. Much of
Mozambique is close to chaos. Prisoners have been released from
jail lest they drown in their cells.
</P>
<P>
   Many families, having been evacuated from their homes in
separate helicopters, now find themselves in different refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
   With admirable determination, people are striving to rebuild
their lives. In Palmeira, north of Maputo, one of several places
where Mozambique's main north-south highway has been broken by the
deluge, trucks and earth-movers strain to reconnect the severed
parts.
</P>
<P>
   While they labor, hundreds of petty traders risk the arrival of
another torrent by wading, up to their necks in brown water and
balancing bulging packages of goods on their heads, towards the
villages on the distant shore. &QL;

   As the worst floods in living memory continue to swirl, parts of
South Africa, Zimbabwe and especially Mozambique need help to stop
the death toll from climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclone Eline and heavy rain have swamped countless villages and
left perhaps 1 million people homeless. The usually placid Limpopo
and Zambezi Rivers have swollen to rushing torrents up to 125km (80
miles) wide, sweeping away buildings and hurling livestock into the
Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   More storms are forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Rain is supposed to fall on rich and poor alike, but this deluge
has hit hardest those least able to cope. Mozambique, the poorest
country in the region, is the worst affected.
</P>
<P>
   This is a cruel reward for all the efforts which had helped to
turn this unlucky country into one of the world's fastest-growing
economies, at last giving hope to a people who had been reduced,
many of them, by two decades of civil war to wearing tree bark and
eating wild berries.
</P>
<P>
   The floods have pushed back into poverty large numbers of
Mozambicans who had recently begun to lift themselves out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Just as bad, the flooding has almost certainly dislodged
thousands of landmines and carried them into places previously
considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambican peasants usually plant some of their crops on low
ground, which is damper and more fertile, and some higher up, in
case nearby rivers flood. But this year's floods are so much
heavier than usual that not only have the low fields been turned to
muddy porridge but much of the hillside crop has also been
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Medecins sans Frontieres, a French charity, estimates that
220,000 Mozambicans will need food aid in the next three months, a
figure that will rise if the waters do not recede before the
planting season, which should begin in April.
</P>
<P>
   The Mozambican government estimates that 900,000 of its citizens
will need assistance of some sort, and has asked donors for $65
million. Only $13.5 million had been pledged by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Things in Zimbabwe are better, but not all that much. The floods
have killed at least 60 people and affected the lives of perhaps
another 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Maize production, which fell short of domestic demand last year,
will fall even shorter this year. President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe declared a state of emergency in three of his country's
eight provinces on Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign donors are starting to send food and logistical support,
but hesitate to offer much cash to a government with a reputation
for squandering it on perks for ministers and a dubious war in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is better able than its neighbors to cope with the
flooding especially as a smaller proportion of its territory is
affected, but it is still struggling.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 people have died, mainly from drowning, in the
Northern Province. Perhaps 80,000 are homeless, and several small
towns have been cut off from the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, Zimbabwe and neighboring Zambia have all opened
some of the floodgates on their dams to lower the water level
upstream. Unfortunately, this has released more water into
Mozambique, making the rescue work there even harder.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to fly food and vaccines to the needy are hampered
because the victims are scattered in small groups around a vast
area, and are constantly on the move to escape the shifting waters.
</P>
<P>
   And water is not the only peril they face. The floods bring
disease with them. Vast stretches of new swampland are a
breeding-ground for malarial mosquitoes. Torrents of filthy water
can spread cholera.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger and exhaustion among those clinging to trees or bridges
lower their resistance to disease. And, since between an eighth and
a quarter of adults in the flooded countries are HIV-afflicted,
that resistance is often not very great to start with. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are consolations. Mozambique's Mozal aluminium smelter,
the country's largest foreign investment, has lost less than a
week's work.
</P>
<P>
   A toll road connecting Maputo, Mozambique's capital and most
useful port, with Johannesburg will still probably be completed on
time.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's factory outside Maputo has been submerged beneath
two meters of dirty water, and its staff have had to throw away
millions of bottles, most of their computers and thousands of tons
of contaminated sugar; but the plant should soon be working again.
</P>
<P>
   For the very poor, which means most of the flood's victims, it
will take longer to mend the damage. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000 WORDS) &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some have managed to save a few of their possessions _ pots,
blankets, bags of maize flour _ by hauling them up trees. Others
have lost everything.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to roads makes it hard to get food to them. Much of
Mozambique is close to chaos. Prisoners have been released from
jail lest they drown in their cells.
</P>
<P>
   Many families, having been evacuated from their homes in
separate helicopters, now find themselves in different refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
   With admirable determination, people are striving to rebuild
their lives. In Palmeira, north of Maputo, one of several places
where Mozambique's main north-south highway has been broken by the
deluge, trucks and earth-movers strain to reconnect the severed
parts.
</P>
<P>
   While they labor, hundreds of petty traders risk the arrival of
another torrent by wading, up to their necks in brown water and
balancing bulging packages of goods on their heads, towards the
villages on the distant shore. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Why does it cost more to wipe your bottom in Britain
than in any other country in the European Union?
</P>
<P>
   According to John Bridgeman, the outgoing director general of
fair trading, it is because British consumers are extremely fussy
when it comes to toilet paper. British bums, in short, demand and
get the best.
</P>
<P>
   Five-star treatment, however, comes at a price. A recent
government survey of international prices found that the British
pay twice as much as the Germans and the French, and nearly
two-and-a-half times as much as Americans for a standard four-roll
pack of toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this discrepancy is that British consumers insist
on a softer, more luxurious texture than their less discriminating
continental and American cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The average British toilet roll is also 14mm longer and 2mm
wider than a continental roll. British toilet paper is four grams
heavier per square meter because it contains more fiber than
European tissues. The British product also has 40 more sheets per
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Plotkin, consumer sales director of Fort James, which
supplies British and European supermarkets, says these differences
are rooted in history.
</P>
<P>
   The market leader, Andrex, now owned by America's
Kimberly-Clark, with over a third of the market, has set standards
which private-label brands have had to copy.
</P>
<P>
   Focus groups and extensive consumer testing have established
that British consumers are not willing to be fobbed off with less.
One other factor distinguishes the British toilet-paper-roll
market.
</P>
<P>
   Go to any supermarket and you will be confronted by an
extraordinary choice of more than 50 colors, sizes and brands.
Honeysuckle, warm pink, summer peach, pearl white, meadow green,
breeze blue and magnolia are just some of the shades on offer.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this variety is apparently that the British
shopper insists that her toilet paper matches the color scheme of
her bathroom. On the continent, consumers settle happily for white,
with pink thrown in as a wild alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin waxes lyrical about the state of the market in Britain.
``It is 50 years of heritage and tradition,'' he says, insisting
that no one should underestimate the importance of toilet paper to
the nation's well-being. &QL;

   &UR; DR. WEIL'S WISDOM: SIZING UP FAD DIETS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DR-WEIL-HEALTH-LIFEBEAT _ Three new studies on Americans and
weight gain were released last fall, and the news wasn't good. The
verdict: Not only is obesity on the rise _ from 12 percent of the
population in 1991 to almost 18 percent in 1998, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention _ but more than half of
the adults in this country are now considered at least moderately
overweight. All this, despite the fact that total fat consumption
in the United States has decreased over the past decade. What's
going on here? And what to do about it? By Dr. Andrew Weil, written
with Joseph V. Amodio. (1,500 words and 3 sidebars, all in one
file.)

   &UR; STURDY YELLOWWARE HAS SERVED AMERICANS WELL FOR 200 YEARS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES-YELLOWWARE-LIFEBEAT _ When shipments of English
yellowware crossed the Atlantic early in the 19th century,
Americans eagerly made room in their cupboards. More durable than
redware and less cumbersome than stoneware, the newfangled goods
were handsome to behold and inexpensive to buy. Today, yellowware
remains functional, but it's also fun to collect. By Debra Muller
Price. (550 words.)

   &UR; HONEY, I'M HOME ... FOR TWO DAYS ANYWAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRAVELING-PARENT-LIFEBEAT _ Not very long ago, my 5-year-old
daughter, Willa, held a birthday party for her doll Lucy. Willa
played Lucy's mom, while I played Lucy's grandmother, and my
3-year-old son, Devin, was her uncle. Someone, however, was
missing. ``My husband is away on a trip,'' Willa explained, as she
blew out Lucy's candles. ``He travels a lot for work.'' This hit
suspiciously close to home. My husband, Austin, travels for his job
_ a lot. By Laura Hilgers. (1,300 words, optional add.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOR DOGS WHO CAN'T PLAY SOLITAIRE, INTERACTIVE PLAYTIME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOG-DAYCARE-LIFEBEAT _ Dogs are social beings. They need
company. Well-socialized pets _ dogs that respect and interact
comfortably with people as well as other dogs _ are happy and
responsive. But because today's families tend to spend less and
less time at home, their gregarious canine companions sometimes
miss out on the socializing they crave. In order to develop into
friendly companions, young animals need extended interactive
playtime. Thus the ultimate in surrogate pet parenthood _ day-care
facilities for dogs _ is quickly becoming a solution. By Toni
Gardner. (925 words)

   IRISH-TREATS-LIFEBEAT _ The music of tea splashing into a
porcelain cup has been known to soothe an Irish soul long before
the amber liquid even touches the lips. But as a new generation of
innovative Irish chefs have come into their own, teatime sweets
just may upstage the ritualistic afternoon cuppa. Comes with three
recipes that are just right for St. Patrick's Day pages. (1,200

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
<P>
   Three new studies on Americans and weight gain were released
last fall, and the news wasn't good. The verdict: Not only is
obesity (the state of being more than 30 percent above one's ideal
body weight) on the rise _ from 12 percent of the population in
1991 to almost 18 percent in 1998, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention _ but more than half of the adults
in this country are now considered at least moderately overweight.
All this, despite the fact that total fat consumption in the United
States has decreased over the past decade. What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's no great mystery. While we grasp the
importance of limiting fat intake, we still eat too much and move
around too little. It's that simple. We're gobbling up low-fat or
no-fat cookies, chips and cakes as if they're full of air, not
calories.
</P>
<P>
   One more truth about Americans: We're addicted to the quick fix,
some magical diet that will help us shed those excess pounds
without pain. Perhaps that's why bookstores are bursting with
guides to seductive programs like high-protein, low-carb diets that
let you eat bacon and burgers by the plateful while shunning pasta
and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   While some diets are downright ridiculous (the chocolate lovers'
diet springs to mind) and can be unhealthy in the long run, there
is a kernel of truth behind many of the best-selling diet books and
weight-loss supplements. And let's face it, some of us find a
structured program helpful in kicking off a weight-loss effort and
staying on track.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the theories behind some of the most popular
plans and pills and what you can learn from them, as well as some
healthy long-term solutions to weight management.
</P>
<P>
   A LOOK AT THE BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   Protein Powerhouses
</P>
<P>
   Theory: Programs outlined in books such as ``Dr. Atkins' New
Diet Revolution,'' ``The Carhohydrate Addict's Diet'' and ``Sugar
Busters!'' are all based on the same underlying principle _ when
you eat lots of carbohydrates, insulin production in the body
spikes, which in turn promotes fat storage, harms cardiovascular
function, and in some cases, can even lead to adult-onset diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Where they fall short: Dieters are allowed to load up on foods
like bacon, steak and cream, which are high in saturated fat and
should be consumed only in moderation. The high levels of protein
in these diets can also stress the liver, kidneys and immune
system, and increase calcium loss from bones. High-fat,
high-protein foods also tend to crowd out all the protective
nutrients in fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Golden nugget: For carbohydrate-sensitive people _ maybe 25
percent of the population _ restricting certain carbohydrate-rich
foods, such as potatoes, bread and other products made from flour
and sugar, is sensible advice. But eating those foods will not
disturb insulin production if you are not in that group.
</P>
<P>
   If you are tempted to try these plans, keep total fat
consumption to no more than 30 percent of calories and saturated
fat intake at 5 percent (go easy on the meat, butter, cream and
cheese). Instead of avoiding carbohydrates altogether, include some
healthy ones like starchy vegetables, fruits, whole-wheat pasta and
chewy, multigrain breads.
</P>
<P>
   Percentage Players
</P>
<P>
   Theory: According to high-protein diets like the one laid out in
``The Zone,'' by Dr. Barry Sears, when you eat the ``right''
combination of foods _ in the Zone's case, 40 percent of calories
from carbohydrates, 30 percent from protein, 30 percent from fat _
your body will reach a metabolic state that works at peak
performance, keeping you thin.
</P>
<P>
   Where they fall short: Sears' basic plan provides 900 calories a
day, which means starving yourself. I would lose weight if I ate
900 calories of pure fat a day and nothing else. In addition, very
low-calorie diets promote loss of lean muscle mass as well as body
fat. The Zone philosophy only applies strictly to that minority of
the population that is carbohydrate-sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   And looking at food as a drug to manipulate your hormonal
chemistry, as Sears advises, does not seem to me to be a healthy
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Golden nugget: I think Sears is right when he calls attention to
the glycemic index _ a measure of how quickly particular
carbohydrates are converted to blood sugar. High-glycemic foods
like rice cakes, bread and potatoes are probably chief culprits in
obesity for many of us. And Sears' discussion of good fats and bad
fats is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   A better way to apply this philosophy is to keep fat intake to
30 percent of calories or below, carbohydrates in the 50 percent to
60 percent range, and protein to 10 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fat Fighters
</P>
<P>
   Theory: Dietary fat is the real villain when it comes to weight
gain and overall health, says Dr. Dean Ornish, whose ``Eat More,
Weigh Less'' whole-foods, plant-based diet gets no more than 10
percent of its daily calories from fat.
</P>
<P>
   Where they fall short: The palatability of food falls off
sharply as fat calories drop below 20 percent. Unless people are
facing medical crises, it is unlikely that they will be able to
follow a 10-percent-fat, vegetarian diet without the help of a
professional chef. These diets also greatly increase the risk of
deficiency of essential fatty acids, particularly the valuable
omega 3s that are present in fatty fish and egg yolks.
</P>
<P>
   Golden nugget: Ornish's emphasis on a plant-based diet with
plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, beans and soy products has a
scientific basis. Initially devised as a way to help reverse the
symptoms of coronary heart disease, it has received the backing of
the medical community as an effective cholesterol-lowering and
weight-loss plan, albeit one that's not easy to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Body Shape Adherents
</P>
<P>
   Theory: The foods you eat (and your exercise choices) should be
based not on personal preference but on your genetically determined
build, according to dietary guides like ``The Body Code'' by Dr.
Jay Cooper and ``Dr. Abravanel's Body Type Diet and Lifetime
Nutrition Plan,'' an update of the 1984 text by Dr. Elliot D.
Abravanel.
</P>
<P>
   Where they fall short: Some of the recommendations go against
conventional wisdom. For instance, on Cooper's plan, the Warrior
types are prescribed little or no strength-training (because it
supposedly bulks you up), whereas experts acknowledge that some
level of weight training is important for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Nurturers should ideally exercise in the morning, says
Cooper, a recommendation that is both odd and unrealistic; one's
exercise schedule should be based on personal preference rather
than genetic makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Golden nugget: This plan _ loosely based on the principles of
Ayurveda _ acknowledges that no single diet works for everyone. And
each of the guidelines for the four body types is really quite
nourishing, based on a whole-foods diet with some healthy fats and
lean meats.
</P>
<P>
   Dieting Done Right
</P>
<P>
   So how does one diet safely and effectively? Ignore the fads
that sound too good to be true (they usually are), and instead pay
attention to these two tried-and-true tenets _ eat less and
exercise more. Here's how to do it:
</P>
<P>
   MAKE CALORIES COUNT. Determine your caloric requirements
(usually 2,000 to 3,000 calories a day, depending on gender, body
size and level of activity). Keep fat intake to 30 percent (or
less) of total calories (with no more than 5 percent from saturated
fat). Eat 50 percent to 60 percent of calories as carbohydrates,
mostly whole foods like grains rather than floury, sugary fare.
Keep protein in the 10 percent to 20 percent range, emphasizing
fish and soy products. Eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits,
and avoid alcohol, which promotes the storage of excess calories as
fat.
</P>
<P>
   Get moving. Exercise is an essential component to any
weight-loss plan. Start off with a 10-minute walk, five days a
week, and increase the time by 5 minutes each week, till you are
walking 45 minutes at a stretch. Add one to two days of resistance
training each week to increase lean muscle mass (which will help
you burn more calories at rest).
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Be aware of the motional aspects of weight
control. Rather than feeding their bodies, compulsive eaters are
often attempting to feed their souls, filling an emptiness inside.
Eating may also be a way of coping with anxiety. I urge you to try
stress-reduction exercises (like yoga or meditation), which also
encourage mindful eating.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, consider whether you really need to lose as much as you
think. If your weight is not threatening your health, then try to
accept your body as less than perfect but beautiful just the same.
</P>
<P>
   THE SKINNY ON SUPPLEMENTS
</P>
<P>
   Even after the drug cocktail Fen-Phen was linked to heart-valve
defects and taken off the market, some people just won't give up
their search for the ``Magic bullet.'' Below are a few of the more
popular options:
</P>
<P>
   CONJUGATED LINOLEIC ACID
</P>
<P>
   Claims: CLA, a fatty acid, supposedly prevents fat from being
deposited in cells by speeding fat metabolism. According to two
small studies, subjects who consumed varying amounts of CLA noted a
reduction in body fat and an increase in lean tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: To get the desired effects, you must exercise and
change your diet, which makes CLA no better than standard
weight-loss techniques. Plus, long-term side effects are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   PYRUVATE
</P>
<P>
   Claims: Proponents say that this naturally occurring enzyme _ a
key player in the metabolic process that transforms nutrients into
energy _ can help with weight loss, increase stamina and decrease
cholesterol without side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: Supplemental pyruvate does not cross easily from the
bloodstream (where it goes after digestion) into cells (to be used
in the transformation process), so even taking a large amount will
have little effect on fat-burning.
</P>
<P>
   CHROMIUM PICOLINATE
</P>
<P>
   Claims: Chromium, a trace mineral found in foods like whole
grains, cheese, nuts and spinach, is said to increase muscle mass
and reduce body fat by enhancing insulin sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: While chromium is used by the body for insulin
metabolism and does play a role in energy production, unless you're
deficient in the mineral _ and most people aren't _ supplemental
chromium won't do anything for you.
</P>
<P>
   SIZE MATTERS
</P>
<P>
   The problem for many dieters isn't what they eat, but how much.
These days, everything from bagels to beefsteak is served
oversized. Want to keep closer tabs on portion sizes? Just hold out
your hand:
</P>
<P>
   1) Your palm is roughly the size of 3 ounces (one serving) of
fish, meat or poultry.
</P>
<P>
   2) Your cupped hand can hold about 2 ounces (about two servings)
of nuts.
</P>
<P>
   3) Your thumb tip represents a teaspoon (remember that as you
swipe your finger in the peanut butter jar). Three thumb tips equal
a tablespoon.
</P>
<P>
   4) Your thumb, measured from second joint to end, represents
about one tablespoon of liquid (one serving of oil or dressing) or
an ounce Of cheese.
</P>
<P>
   5) Your fist equals one cup (one serving of cereal, pasta or
rice).
</P>
<P>
   FAKE FATS
</P>
<P>
   Olestra is a fatlike substance that cannot be absorbed by the
intestinal tract, and so is eliminated from the body. It is
currently used as an ingredient in fat-free potato and corn chips
and may soon be approved for use in other foods. Products made with
this fake fat need to be fortified with the fat-soluble vitamins
(A, D, E and K) because it carries away some of these nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Olestra can also wreak havoc on the intestines of certain
individuals. The real problem I see with it is that it encourages
greater consumption of low-quality, carbohydrate-rich foods that
promote obesity in many people and fail to provide the protective
elements found in higher-quality snack choices like fruits and
vegetables.

STURDY YELLOWWARE HAS SERVED AMERICANS WELL FOR 200 YEARS

Syndicate is for use by LIFEBEAT clients. Nonsubscribers can use

<P>
   When shipments of English yellowware crossed the Atlantic early
in the 19th century, Americans eagerly made room in their
cupboards. More durable than redware and less cumbersome than
stoneware, the newfangled goods were handsome to behold and
inexpensive to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Potters in England developed yellowware late in the 18th
century. Working with buff-colored clay that gives the ware its
name, they made useful forms and fired them at high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-19th century, a thriving American industry was under
way. Potteries in Ohio, New England, the mid-Atlantic and the South
churned out pudding molds, canisters and colanders _ but the deep,
easy-to-handle mixing bowls became the enduring favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Made well into the 1930s and beyond, these simple vessels have
been used by cooks to serve up countless batches of biscuits,
cookies and bread dough.
</P>
<P>
   Today's collectors value them for the warm color they bring to a
room. Yellowware really enhances a setting, said John Gallo, an
Otego, N.Y., antiques dealer. ``It makes a cupboard come to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dating a piece of yellowware becomes easier if you brush up on a
few key characteristics. The first bowls were thrown by hand on a
potter's wheel, but the majority of yellowware from the late 19th
and early 20th centuries was produced with the use of molds.
</P>
<P>
   Molds gave birth to a variety of embossed and impressed designs
with floral, geometric and scenic motifs. The lip on a bowl also
hints at the age: Pieces from the 19th century often feature rolled
lips, while 20th-century examples tend to have a less-rounded lip
or a wide collared rim.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   NESTING INSTINCTS
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned collectors focus their energies on finding graduated
sizes of the same pattern for nesting. Not only do they enjoy the
thrill of the hunt, but sets of bowls also bring more money than
individual ones.
</P>
<P>
   Though bowls are commonly seen in nests of five, many were
actually produced in eight to 12 different sizes, ranging from
about 4 inches in diameter up to 17 inches or more. The most
valuable pieces generally fall at either end of the spectrum.

FOR DOGS WHO CAN'T PLAY SOLITAIRE, INTERACTIVE PLAYTIME
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times
Syndicate is for use by LIFEBEAT clients. Nonsubscribers can use
this article only by special arrangement with the Syndicate. For
purchase information, see end of text.  (ART ADV: Can be
illustrated with colorful photos of dogs interacting in your

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dogs are social beings. They need company. Well-socialized pets
_ dogs that respect and interact comfortably with people as well as
other dogs _ are happy and responsive.
</P>
<P>
   But because today's families tend to spend less and less time at
home, their gregarious canine companions sometimes miss out on the
socializing they crave. More often than not, a chewed-on slipper or
a mess on the floor signals a lack of social stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   Boredom-busting strategies that may soothe the sensitive or
older pet include leaving toys and treats out or scheduling midday
walks with a pet sitter.
</P>
<P>
   Some dogs, however, simply can't play solitaire. In order to
develop into friendly companions, young animals need extended
interactive playtime. Thus the ultimate in surrogate pet parenthood
_ day-care facilities for dogs _ is quickly becoming a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Dog day care got its start in 1987, when Joe Sporn, then a pre-
vet student and dog groomer in New York City, founded what would
become the Yuppie Puppy in his basement by helping out his
neighbors with their pets.
</P>
<P>
   Sporn's example quietly gathered force for a few years until the
San Francisco SPCA opened its Doggy Daycare Center in 1994. It
began as a projected five-year pilot program and has since become a
worldwide model.
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind dog day care is simple: Dogs meet, greet and
play the day away. Animal behaviorist and trainer John Bohnenkamp,
of Perfect Paws in San Francisco, believes that day care for dogs
provides a beneficial environment when ``the dogs are closely
supervised. Dogs need someone to create activities,'' Bohnenkamp
says, ``and manage any potential problems that may arise, like
possessiveness over toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Bisgyer, owner of Dog-ma Daycare for Dogs, in
Washington, D.C., begins each day with a group activity intended to
establish her position as the pack leader. Although dogs at
Bisgyer's facility are screened for temperament before being
accepted, this routine morning exercise helps to keep dominance
conflicts among the pets to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, dogs break off into impromptu smaller groups for
continued play. Troublemakers receive ``time-outs'' in specially
designated areas. And all dogs at Dog-ma can have their own
downtime in specified napping areas.
</P>
<P>
   With 30-minute pet-sitter visits running in the $12-$20 range
around the country, the $15-$25 price tag for a full day of dog day
care would make it seem like a virtual bargain.
</P>
<P>
   But, when tallied at $5,000 a year, the amount tops my
children's annual parochial-school tuition, even considering the
fact that the dogs spend more hours in day care than the kids do at
school. Many centers do, however, accept dogs part time (the hourly
fee may be higher), and some also offer boarding.
</P>
<P>
   Most dog day-care centers require an interview with both you and
your dog. This is the time to examine the entire facility and get a
feel for the amount of attention your dog will receive.
</P>
<P>
   Bisgyer gives the following tips: Rules, and all age and health
requirements, should be clearly posted. A mission statement is a
good sign; extreme cleanliness, plenty of water and an adequate
dog-to-human ratio are even better. The space should not be overly
noisy _ that would be stressful to any dog. Try to find out how
much the caretakers know about dog behavior and psychology, what
their methods of discipline are, what they know about your breed
and how they would interact with your dog on an individual level.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, check out the other dogs as well. Do they
seem to be suitable playmates for your canine pal? Will your dog be
overwhelmed? If so, how would the center ease your dog into the
routine? Should your pet not be accepted into a program because of
a behavior or attitude problem, by all means enroll in an obedience
class immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Once dogs familiarize themselves with a program, Bisgyer
explains, it's easy to tell whether they are enjoying it. For
example, your dog should look forward to getting into the car in
the morning to go to ``school.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kelliher, manager of the San Francisco SPCA's Doggy Daycare
Center, reports that when one of his client's dog sees the dog
lunch bag come out of the breakfast cabinet at home on Friday
mornings (for her once-a-week attendance), ``the dog goes
absolutely nuts with excitement.'' At night, dogs should be
thoroughly and blissfully exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Some pet owners may consider the notion of dog day care
extravagant; others will view it as part of responsible pet
ownership. But wherever or however you socialize your dog _ long
afternoon walks, Frisbee chasing in the park or action-packed dog
day care _ it can only benefit both you and your pet. No matter how
the days play out, there are always the evenings to spend together.

FOR DAMP DAYS, 3 PERFECT PARTNERS FOR A SOUL-WARMING CUP OF TEA

<P>
   The music of tea splashing into a porcelain cup has been known
to soothe an Irish soul long before the amber liquid even touches
the lips. But as a new generation of innovative Irish chefs have
come into their own, teatime sweets just may upstage the
ritualistic afternoon cuppa.
</P>
<P>
   By making good use of the Emerald Isle's culinary history and
rich dairy products, baked goods once meant merely to sustain have
gained recognition as combinations of farm-fresh ingredients and
unpretentious country charm. Starting off with three classic
recipes, we've transformed each one into a delicious and comforting
sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, traditional quick-leavened soda bread suffers from a
dry texture, owing to the low gluten content in Irish flour. Using
sugar, butter, eggs and a generous amount of buttermilk results in
a tender, cakelike loaf with a fine, moist crumb.
</P>
<P>
   Bread pudding is anything but humble when enhanced with
semisweet chocolate and baked in a rich custard; an ample drizzling
of whiskey sauce adds a spirited finish.
</P>
<P>
   Making sweet use of potatoes, ``pratie apple'' is apple pie with
a light mashed-potato crust, and the filling is infused with a
mixture of butter and brown sugar as it bakes. These easy-to-make
treats don't stray too far from their heritage _ part of what will
delight you when teatime rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLE SODA BREAD
</P>
<P>
   Sweet chewy currants provide the perfect counterpoint to
fragrant caraway seeds. Baking this soda bread in a cast-iron
skillet instead of on a baking sheet gives it its shape and ensures
even cooking.
</P>
<P>
   MAKES 8 SERVINGS
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   3 cups unsifted all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups currants or raisins
</P>
<P>
   1 3/4 cups buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon caraway seeds
</P>
<P>
   1) Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 10-inch cast-iron skillet
with 1 tablespoon butter. Line the bottom of skillet with waxed
paper and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2) In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt
and baking soda. Stir in the currants.
</P>
<P>
   3) In a small microwave-safe dish or small saucepan, melt 2
tablespoons butter. In a medium bowl, mix together the buttermilk,
eggs and the melted butter. Stir buttermilk mixture into flour
mixture just until combined. Fold in caraway seeds. Pour batter
into prepared skillet and dot top with the remaining 2 tablespoons
butter.
</P>
<P>
   4) Bake until a cake tester inserted in center comes out clean _
about 1 hour. Let cool 10 minutes before serving. Nutrition

   1 1-pound loaf challah or French bread, cut into 2-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   Shaved chocolate and confectioners' sugar (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1) Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 2-quart baking dish and
set aside. In a 6-quart saucepan, combine milk and half-and-half.
Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally. Add
granulated sugar and chocolate; stir until melted. Bring mixture to
boil; cook 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   2) Beat yolks in a small bowl. Slowly whisk in 1/4 cup of milk
mixture. Whisk egg mixture into remaining milk mixture until well
combined and thickened. Stir in butter, vanilla and salt. Fold in
bread; spoon pudding into dish. Let soak 1 hour at room

</P>
<P>
   3) Bake until knife inserted in the center comes out clean-
about 50 minutes. To serve, spoon into bowls; garnish with shaved
chocolate and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar, if desired.

HONEY, I'M HOME ... FOR TWO DAYS ANYWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not very long ago, my 5-year-old daughter, Willa, held a
birthday party for her doll Lucy. Willa played Lucy's mom, while I
played Lucy's grandmother, and my 3-year-old son, Devin, was her
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Someone, however, was missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is away on a trip,'' Willa explained, as she blew
out Lucy's candles. ``He travels a lot for work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a lot of trips, too,'' Willa said. Then, as if to
expose my fantasies, she added, ``When I'm away, my husband watches
the kids. And he cooks, too!''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Willa's ``spouse,'' my husband, Austin, does not cook,
unless you count burnt grilled-cheese sandwiches. He does, though,
travel for his job _ a lot. As a writer for Sports illustrated,
Austin travels 30 to 40 weeks a year, three to five days at a time,
to cover football or hockey or to take on hardship assignments like
interviewing half-naked swimsuit models.
</P>
<P>
   He receives an assignment from his editor on Monday, departs
Wednesday or Thursday, early, and returns around dinnertime on
Monday. He misses every other Thanksgiving with us, and most
Easters. And without fail, he's gone for New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Austin was traveling this much when I started dating him, but
before we had children, I liked his absences. I'd kiss him goodbye,
tell him how horribly I'd miss him, and then spend the next five
days seeing movies, going out with friends and staying in bed all
Saturday morning, reading.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when I kiss him goodbye and tell him how horribly
I'll miss him, I mean it. When he walks out the door for a five-day
stint, I pretty much want to sit down and cry.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no time: Willa is yelling for more butter on her
waffle. Devin has dragged a chair to Austin's dresser and shoved
off the change jar. Willa won't dress for school and whines so
loudly that Devin whacks her with a dump truck. I separate them and
look at the clock: It's not 8 a.m. yet. Only 105 hours to go!
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, we have no monopoly on domestic chaos. But what's
tough for us _ and much, much tougher for truly single parents _ is
that there's not much relief. Austin is usually gone on weekends,
which means that we are alone on Saturdays and Sundays, when
there's no preschool, no daytime baby sitter and not many friends
hanging around. (They're spending time with their own families.)
</P>
<P>
   And, because both Willa and Devin are so young, we can't ever do
things like go to restaurants (Devin never sits longer than 90
seconds) or to the movies (``much too scary,'' says Willa) or even
to the zoo (just another opportunity to run away, in Devin's book).
Often our weekends alone are about as relaxing as a visit to the
mall on the day before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, I wondered why other mothers seemed so much
calmer, so much more organized than I was, until I realized its
just harder when you're on your own. You can't get anything done
except watch the lads.
</P>
<P>
   This might be fine if I were one of those Zen, go-with-the-flow
moms, but I'm not. I like order. I like solitude. So, slowly, I'm
learning how to get through the single-mom marathons, my sanity
nearly intact.
</P>
<P>
   First, in order to always get a break Willa, Devin and I stick
to a fairly regimented schedule. On Friday night, we have ``movie
night,'' the one night each week the kids get to watch videos. On
Saturday morning, we go to the gym, and I check them into childcare
while I work out. On Sunday morning, we divide up at church: Devin,
to childcare; Willa, to Sunday school; and me, to a pew for an hour
of solitude. I'm still trying to figure out whether I go to worship
or simply to be alone.
</P>
<P>
   I also accept, or hire, as much help as possible. We have a baby
sitter who comes three-and-a-half days a week, during which time I
try to work, although that time is too often eaten up by bill
paying or grocery shopping. I hire a college student to come every
other Saturday night, so I can go out, sometimes by myself. I
always accept invitations to people's houses, if anyone's crazy
enough to invite us. And I beg Austin's sister, Gibby, to help me
Sunday afternoons, by which time I'm convinced I'm suffering from
chronic fatigue syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Now our weekends are chock-full of activities, many of them
enjoyable. But the fact remains, we're still without Daddy.
Recently, I told Willa that Austin was going to be gone for two
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two whole days?!'' she said. ``That's OK,'' I replied, ``Mommy
will still be here.'' ``Yeah,'' she said, ``but with Daddy we do
more funner things.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true. Austin is Mr. Fun, which is why I married him. The
kids quickly sniffed him out as a fun-loving, slow to-discipline
sucker, an image only reinforced by the way he deals with his
absences. He showers Willa and Devin with presents (courtesy of
airport gift shops) and lets them watch TV, eat sweets and stay up
well past their bedtimes. Then he departs, leaving me with fired,
sugar-hyped, materialistic kids. I've tried lecturing him, but it's
slow going. (Remember, he's Mr. Fun.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the excruciating pleasure deprivation, however, Willa
and Devin don't seem to truly suffer when Austin's gone. I think
this is because I've tried to create consistency for them. I work
at home because I believe that with Austin gone, they need me
around more.
</P>
<P>
   And I constantly remind them that Austin's absence is temporary.
Even when Willa was tiny, I would tell her and, later, Devin,
``Daddy leaves, but he always comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the kids are old enough, Austin tries to call them each
night. Devin says, ``I got a green lollipop.'' Willa laments, ``My
new Barbie dress got torn.'' They're funny conversations, but
comforting: Daddy is still there.
</P>
<P>
   As for Austin, he misses us, but he's usually ensconced in a
nice hotel room (with room service!), and he's quick to admit that
I have the tougher job. Even if he doesn't mean it, he has to say
it.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen how hard it is to raise kids on your own without words
of gratitude. After my parents' divorce, my mother raised four
teen-agers alone, a feat that still astounds me and points up how
lucky I am to have a spouse who supports us financially and
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, someday Austin may say the same of me. I recently had
a psychic reading done, and for what it's worth, the psychic told
me that in 10 or 15 years, I'd be the one traveling all the time.
On the craziest days alone with the kids, I savor that thought. I
just hope Austin learns how to cook.
</P>
<P>
   HOW BEST TO SURVIVE THE FREQUENT ABSENCES OF ONE PARENT
</P>
<P>
   1) Stay in touch with the family. Kids need to know that a
traveling mom or dad is still part of their lives. If you travel a
lot, send your child a postcard from the airport before leaving (so
that it will reach home quickly). Jot down a schedule of some of
your child's day-to-day activities, such as a spelling test on
Monday or swimming lessons on Thursday, so you can discuss
important events when you call home.
</P>
<P>
   2) Take it easy with the gifts. Too many, too frequently, lead
to high expectations. Then if you do show up without presents, your
children may be disappointed. They should be happy to see you _
without toys and candy.
</P>
<P>
   3) Be smart about what you can accomplish if you're on your own.
You're one person; you can't do it all, but you can do your best.
</P>
<P>
   4) Try to understand how the absences affect your spouse. The
on-the-road parent needs to recognize how tough it is for everyone
at home and, more important, to verbalize it. Likewise, if you're
the one at home, it may seem like your spouse is on vacation, but
it's important to acknowledge that most business trips are tough,
too.

<P>
   The string of victories for George W. Bush in the Republican
primaries last Tuesday has left John McCain, his challenger,
apparently sprawled on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the electoral fat lady has not yet sung. Not until
today's (Tuesday's) Super Tuesday _ a bumper crop that includes
California, New York, Massachusetts and nine other states _ do we
reach the generally agreed point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has confounded expectations before. The scale of his
victory in New Hampshire stunned Bush's supporters. He was written
off after his defeat in South Carolina _ and returned from the
political dead in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the fact that Bush won not just Virginia and North
Dakota but also the state of Washington suggests that the era of
McCain excitement may be drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The race in Washington was expected to be close; in reality,
Bush achieved victory by a triumphant 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means that U.S. politics is returning to a sense of
steady-as-she-goes. The potential shake-up elements have fallen by
the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   Oddball candidates such as the billionaires Steve Forbes and
Donald Trump are gone. On the Democratic side, the outsider Bill
Bradley _ whose remarkable successes made the vice president, Al
Gore, feel uncomfortable in recent months _ now seems out for the
count.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made an all-out bid in Washington state; he was defeated
there by a crushing margin of more than two to one.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the outsider is doomed to remain on the outside.
Even Bradley's spokesman admitted to being ``a little
disappointed'' _ political-speak for ``The end is nigh.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the darkish horses is a pity. It is always fun to
feel that drastic upsets may be on the way. More important, though,
the substantive reasons why Bradley and McCain both seem to have
ended in the out pile must be regretted.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, it was (of course) a question of money. George W., son
of George, and Gore, the White House darling, have much larger war
chests to draw on than the outsiders could dream of.
</P>
<P>
   But it was more than that. Many voters liked the
tell-it-as-it-is breath of fresh air that McCain, a former prisoner
of war in Vietnam, brought to the campaign _ but too many remained
wary of what he stood for.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, he put an electoral foot wrong when he attacked the
powerful Christian coalition, describing them as ``agents of
intolerance.'' As the description was fair, it is regrettable that
too many Republican voters seem unenthusiastic about such home
truths.
</P>
<P>
   Many important issues, including foreign policy and the death
penalty, have scarcely figured in the campaign so far. Now, the
tragic shooting of a six-year-old child by another six-year-old in
Michigan serves as a reminder of the madness of American gun law _
a laxity that Bush, as governor of Texas, has supported.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hoped that Bush will be partly wrong-footed by the
shooting, though it is too much to hope that further evidence of
gun lunacy will lead to an outbreak of sanity.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, it seems that America may be coming back to the
number it first thought of _ Gore, who only a few months ago seemed
irrevocably tarred by the scandals of Bill Clinton's White House,
but who is now seen as Mr. Dull, Dependable and Clean.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be exciting. But countries have faced worse problems
than that. &QL;

<P>
   The string of victories for George W. Bush in the Republican
primaries last Tuesday has left John McCain, his challenger,
apparently sprawled on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the electoral fat lady has not yet sung. Not until
today's (Tuesday's) Super Tuesday _ a bumper crop that includes
California, New York, Massachusetts and nine other states _ do we
reach the generally agreed point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has confounded expectations before. The scale of his
victory in New Hampshire stunned Bush's supporters. He was written
off after his defeat in South Carolina _ and returned from the
political dead in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the fact that Bush won not just Virginia and North
Dakota but also the state of Washington suggests that the era of
McCain excitement may be drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The race in Washington was expected to be close; in reality,
Bush achieved victory by a triumphant 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means that U.S. politics is returning to a sense of
steady-as-she-goes. The potential shake-up elements have fallen by
the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   Oddball candidates such as the billionaires Steve Forbes and
Donald Trump are gone. On the Democratic side, the outsider Bill
Bradley _ whose remarkable successes made the vice president, Al
Gore, feel uncomfortable in recent months _ now seems out for the
count.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made an all-out bid in Washington state; he was defeated
there by a crushing margin of more than two to one.

&HT;     CUBA: COMMUNIST STATE OPENS ITS HEART TO CAPITALIST VISITORS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KATE GURNETT  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Two words of advice on traveling to Cuba: Go. Now.
</P>
<P>
   Go before Burger Kings mar the Malecon or someone slaps up a Gap
at the Plaza de la Revolucion. Go while Russian-built Ladas still
whisk past the plaza's mammoth image of Che Guevara. Catch a fading
glimpse of the Western Hemisphere's last Communist state _ for
better and for worse. Yes, some things are better. And many things
are worse.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is complex, a country for the curious and the thoughtful.
It is no place for the dispassionate. They have Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   This magical, sad communist land boasts blocks of majestic
colonial structures now converted into crumbling solarios, the same
buildings chopped into tiny rooms to house families. Hustlers
(jineteras) sit shamelessly on sloppy laps of German tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But people keep their sense of humor. They have a joke about
camellos, the overcrowded hump-backed city buses. Borrowing the
current warning against movies, Cubans use the phrase to warn bus
riders: Sex, violence and adult language.
</P>
<P>
   These days, with dozens of delegations and U.S. college
exchanges arriving monthly, Havana's resemblance to a live history
lab is heightened. Every day an essay question. Compare and
contrast a six-hour Fidel Castro anti-Yanqui speech with the old
Cuban man on his stoop in a Cleveland Cavs cap.
</P>
<P>
   Complexities of Cuban life emerge at breakfast at the
marble-floored luxury Melia Cohiba hotel. A well-vested violin,
accordion and bass trio plays ``Unforgettable'' for Italian and
Spanish tourists who circle a buffet table larger than most Cuban
living rooms. The food could feed the average Habanero for a month.
</P>
<P>
   Compare and contrast Cuba's socialist past with its new
capitalist cloak.
</P>
<P>
   Waves splash over the Malecon, Havana's famed nine-mile seaside
walkway, as two colleagues and I leave the hotel. A bici-taxi
(bicycle pulling two canopied seats) driver offers a ride. We
stroll the tree-lined streets of Vedado, home to embassies and
government officials. Trees abound here; Fidel Castro loves trees.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately a young Cuban hustler named Armaro walks up,
offering a tour, a good restaurant, a club. Thousands of Cubans
grab their share of dollars this way. Castro allowed dollars into
the country in 1993. Today they all but dominate, placing this
socialist land in the position of a Santiago pet pig. Part of the
family, but about to be eaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The embargo gives us time to get ready for the time when the
big flush of American investments comes,'' Havana's urban
development Director Mario Coyula had told us earlier. ``Because
everything can be lost over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Already in Varadero, where 50 international tourist hotels reign
over the island's best beaches 90 minutes east of Havana and where
Cubans, essentially, are not allowed, Cuba already has its Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shouldn't you be careful?'' I ask Armaro in quiet Spanish as
we approach a corner policeman in green fatigues, beret and a
pernicious stare. The police are known to harass unofficial tour
guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't bother me,'' Armaro boasts. ``I'm not black.''
</P>
<P>
   Compare the revolutionary integration of Afro-Cubans to past and
present racism.
</P>
<P>
   Armaro's uncle lives in Miami and owns a restaurant. He sends
his seven relatives $50 each at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a cheap uncle,'' I joke. ``Tell him to send more.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs and points at an elementary school with no windows.
The bell rings. After the Soviet Union collapsed, he said, ending
$5.5 billion in annual Cuban subsidies, the bells broke and there
was no money to fix them. Teachers were a comical sight, he
remembered, as they stood in front of classrooms, hollering
``Change classes!''
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned by the Russians, Cuba is for the first time in history
truly independent. No longer a Spanish colony, no longer dominated
by the United States, no longer a Soviet welfare client. Seemingly
without regret, it moves forward, carefully picking its economic
partners.
</P>
<P>
   And Cubans love to discuss where they went wrong, openly and
honestly, even at high levels of government. (Compare that to your
average U.S. politician.)
</P>
<P>
   We leave Armaro and head for the dollar supermarket _ there is
nothing for sale in the peso market. We need rum and chicken, two
rarities we plan to share at dinner with some newfound Cuban
friends. They have no rum. They have no chicken. They have no
cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
   But still they invited us to dinner after we met their son
Miguel on the street. He bought us a glass of white rum and asked,
apropos of nothing, ``Do you want to meet my parents?''
</P>
<P>
   This is NOT uncommon. Cubans love people.
</P>
<P>
   Their flat was up a dark staircase, crowded with dusty brown
books, a fig tree and wall posters of Che Guevara and swimsuit
models, reflecting the two generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Che is my heart,'' Miguel's mother said. American poster babes
are her son's.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel's father, a professor, poured the first bit of brown
Havana Club rum from the new bottle into the fig tree, an offering
to a Santeria god belonging to the pantheon of the Afro-Caribbean
religion practiced by many Cubans. He told us how the revolution
changed his life. Before Castro, his Jamaican heritage brought
discrimination, he said. After, he found good jobs and social
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Cubans, he asked us not to print his name. The press
is government-run and people do not speak freely. I chose a
pseudonym for his son.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE . . . MORE)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAVANA: x x x for his son. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the older generation still believes strongly in the
revolution and the guerrillas who tossed out the corrupt dictator
Fulgencio Batista. They appreciate the free health care, the free
university educations. But dollars entice their children, who know
nothing of Batista and were raised on scarcity and tired communist
slogans. Miguel's mother lives in fear that he will take a boat to
Miami, as his best friend did a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some older professionals are disgruntled, too. Castro ``comes
between a man and his wife,'' said one man who wants to play the
forbidden American radio in bed at night. His wife, afraid the
neighbors will hear, won't let him. So he retires to the living
room. Contrast social progress with lack of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, American culture pervades. Rare is the cabdriver who
doesn't blast American hits of the 1980s, from Michael McDonald to
Air Supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the music of my teen-age time,'' said Cesar Font, 36, a
Havana cabbie. ``Billy Joel was very famous in Cuba. He did come
here in 1979 ... Christopher Cross. Kool and the Gang. In my casa I
have 80 minutes live (of Kool and the Gang).''
</P>
<P>
   The songs helped Font learn English. In the land of salsa, he
prefers Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just music. They love the people. And despite the flap
over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, they bear us no grudge. Marching
100,000 strong during our visit, their demand that Elian return was
sincere, even if they were bused in by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are surprised they don't find a hostile
population,'' Coyula said. ``We never talk much officially, but we
have American culture in everything, in films and in music. More
people are coming here; they're really sympathetic with the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrill for many Americans who visit Cuba in greater numbers
each year is that access has been denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Prohibition,'' said Wayne Smith, chief of the U.S.
Interests Section from 1979 to 1982. ``The forbidden fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Many who come sympathize with the revolution. Like Al Lewis, the
Green Party candidate for New York governor best known for his
portrayal of ``Grandpa'' on the hit '60s television series ``The
Munsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Leftists love Cuba. After all, this is the country that granted
asylum to some Black Panthers. Joanne Chesimard, former head of
Black Liberation Army who escaped from prison in 1979, won
political exile and is still here.
</P>
<P>
   We met three other Green Party members in Santiago de Cuba on
the island's eastern end at a modest bed-and-breakfast run by Zaida
Moraleza, a retired doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago is poorer than Havana. Here young boys playing street
ball use a splintered piece of wood and a bottle cap. People from
this part of the country are so impoverished that if they move to
Havana, Habaneros dub them ``Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   But life here is good, according to Moraleza's daughter, also
named Zaida Moraleza, who helps her mother run the
bed-and-breakfast. She wishes the economy was robust enough for
Cubans to travel to Europe and Central America. ``Then they would
see that we live comfortably here. Now they can't compare.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicine may be plentiful in the United States, Moraleza said,
but it isn't cheap. A cousin in Texas who had a kidney transplant
died because he couldn't afford the $200 a week for medicines, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, more and more Americans visit the island, joining the
Canadians and Europeans who have been coming here for a decade.
More than 1.7 million tourists came in 1999, up from 500,000 in
1993. Two million are expected in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moraleza complained about foreign tourists coming here to have
sex with 14-year-old prostitutes. ``It's horrible,'' she said. Cuba
does not yet compare to Acapulco or Bangkok, where such abuse of
children is rampant. But prostitutes openly greet foreign tourists,
often in their hotel lobbies. The government does make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have harassed the prostitutes,'' said Julio Espinoza, the
National Assembly's International Relations Committee coordinator
general. ``But it persists. Is the solution to bring all of them to
jail? It would be very easy. But our objective has to be persuasion
and to offer them jobs. And that is combined with harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course the ultimate question: Will history absolve Fidel
Castro?
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that so many Americans have is that this is just a
total failure,'' Wayne Smith said. ``But they did produce the most
egalitarian society I think this hemisphere has seen. There is no
freedom of expression, no freedom of the press, but it is
egalitarian. They did provide free health care to everyone, free
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he hopes the United States will ease the embargo,
prompting Cuba to move toward democracy. ``There's no place quite
like it in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And whether or not history repeats itself, the best time to
visit Cuba is now.

&HT;     NO NEED TO SABOTAGE THE REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One month a Republican, and I can't wait to get
back to the party of Hillary and Bill and Al and the other Bill,
the one who used to have an outside shot. That's how painful this
presidential primary has been.
</P>
<P>
   How backward is the Republican Party? The GOP has taken us into
a new millennium with a primary based on religious warfare _ and
between different groups of Christians, of all things.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush spoke at South Carolina's Bob Jones University,
whose president, Bob Jones III, described Catholicism and Mormonism
as ``cults which call themselves Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Bush was speaking at a ``university'' opposed to universal
human and religious rights. John McCain and the press hung him out
to dry for it. Over and over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Never trust a university that calls itself Bob.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since that speech, Bush has been defending himself, saying
he isn't an anti-Catholic bigot, and finally apologizing to the
nation and especially Cardinal O'Connor of New York, a state filled
with voting Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Just when I thought Bush was toast, up popped McCain from the
other slot in the toaster. He condemned the fundamentalist
influence on the Republican Party and called Pat Robertson and
Jerry Falwell ``evil.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of lefties might agree. But Robertson and Falwell are just
attention-getting buffoons, not Hitlers or even Darth Vaders.
Falwell is afraid of Teletubbies, for crying out loud.
</P>
<P>
   And believe it or not, most fundamentalist Christians are good
people, not to mention good Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Is McCain as crazy as Bush is stupid? Does McCain think we're
stupid? He claimed he was just joking when he called Falwell and
Robertson ``evil.'' You know, like when he jokes around with that
word ``gook.''
</P>
<P>
   Give us a better excuse, John. How about ``my speech writer
misspelled it. I meant `vile,' not `evil.' No, no, I meant
`live.'''
</P>
<P>
   What the heck is going on in this party, and why do they call it
conservative?
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain are fighting for the right to be called the true
heir to Ronald Reagan. When I think of that most genial of
presidents, I'm glad of one mercy. At least he's not following any
of this.
</P>
<P>
   My original motivation in registering Republican was not just to
lower my handicap or increase my net worth. The idea was to
sabotage the Republican leadership that gave us a disgusting
impeachment and a nonentity son of a Bush to be coronated as
president.
</P>
<P>
   The only votes that counted toward delegates in Tuesday's open
primary were votes by registered Republicans, so I thought I'd vote
for the insurgent against the anointed.
</P>
<P>
   I knew McCain is just as conservative as Bush, if not more so.
He's against gay rights and women's right to abortion, and he
received a 100-percent rating from the Christian Coalition,
presumably in one of its less evil moments.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is interesting _ too interesting, as it turned out.
The insurgent surged as the nation grasped for a genuine hero as
president. Americans periodically do that, usually getting a
Franklin Pierce or a Ulysses S. Grant, and only once getting a
George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also has the appeal of a straight-shooter, even if he
occasionally shoots straight from the lip to the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and independents have turned out in droves for the man
who would beat the Bush, and could put Al Gore through the
wood-chipper.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain's victory in Michigan I thought I'd better vote for
Bush as the lesser of the two candidates who would pack the Supreme
Court with Clarence Thomases.
</P>
<P>
   Boy George is so painful to listen to (what does he store in his
mouth, pecans?) that by November voters will be screaming for Al
Gore to loosen the collar on that earth-tone shirt and tell them
all about what he and Tipper think about clinical depression.
</P>
<P>
   Now I don't think I'll vote for either Bush or McCain. They
don't need me to sabotage them.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't talked much about issues that Californians care
about. In fact, they barely came to California, and during
Thursday's debate, McCain appeared via television screen like Bill
Gates without the charisma.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, we've heard more about Bob Jones University
than health care, Social Security and the high price of putting
kids through real universities, like the University of California,
which many Republicans consider useful only as an affirmative
action punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   By now I doubt that McCain and Bush want to continue their
little religious war, but if they do, it'll be like Iran versus
Iraq. I won't choose sides.
</P>
<P>
   I can't quite stomach being a Gore Republican either. Maybe I'll
vote for the Green Party guy in the black suit, Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   If I want to mix religion with politics, I'll take a real
puritan.

   COLONIE, N.Y. _ In a cramped, windowless room at Colonie Police
Headquarters, Detective Lt. Thomas Breslin gingerly taps a keyboard
as he converses in an Internet chat room with an older man from
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Breslin's undercover screen name isn't enticing _ it's actually
very plain _ and when asked, the detective tells the man that he is
a 14-year-old female just home from school.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, the man has downloaded a naked photograph of
himself to Breslin's computer and types a message to the fictitious
teenager: ``So you like older guys? ... You'd be my secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new era of pedophilia, where predators no longer
risk staking out playgrounds or video arcades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them just want to talk dirty,'' Breslin says as his
computer screen suddenly fills up with messages from other people
in the chat room hoping to strike up a conversation with the teen.
</P>
<P>
   The Colonie department is one of the few local forces that use
the Internet to nab suspects beyond its borders. During the past
three years, police have lured about half a dozen people from as
far away as Virginia and Connecticut who were seeking sex with
minors.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say such police tactics border on entrapment and
infringe on privacy rights, and that departments should focus on
crimes in their own back yard. But advocates of the approach say
pedophiles and other criminals have saturated the Internet, where
police jurisdictional boundaries disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always controversy about police sting operations and
allegations of entrapment, but the thing that you have to remember
is these subjects are predisposed to do this type of criminal
activity,'' said Richard Bernes, who retired as head of the FBI's
high-tech crimes squad in 1997. ``All the police departments are
doing is allowing themselves to become the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Breslin and two other middle-aged Colonie detectives spend their
``spare time'' browsing chat rooms posing as teenagers. And they
are no slouches
</P>
<P>
   when it comes to knowing their teenage lingo. They know the
names of the popular teenage band members and use hip language like
``phat'' when describing something as cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've also had numerous cases with child pornography
distribution from out of state, with suspects trading it
electronically over the Internet,'' Breslin said.
</P>
<P>
   Colonie decided to police the Internet after the department
received numerous complaints from local residents or businesses
about computer-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't say to people we don't do computer stuff here,''
Breslin said. ``We finally got to the point where we had to go
further with our training or get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The three detectives who do the work in Colonie _ Breslin and
detectives Steve Tanski and Mike Tully _ usually spend no more than
a half-hour each day browsing questionable chat rooms, the
lieutenant said. They go online when they have time to kill in
between their normal police duties, unless actively working a
strong case.
</P>
<P>
   Breslin couldn't say how much it costs the department.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Spina, who has prosecuted many of
Colonie's cases, said he has turned away cases on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very strict guidelines they have to follow to avoid
any type of entrapment,'' Spina said. ``We have to be the
receivers. If they've been too suggestive, I won't pursue the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   In several of the cases that Spina successfully prosecuted, he
said, the accused had a history of child molestation or dealing in
child pornography. ``They were predisposed to this type of
activity, so there is no entrapment.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The only ballot measure petition I will ever
sign is one that proposes a moratorium on ballot measures.
</P>
<P>
   Each California election gets worse. The list of complex,
confusing propositions grows more unwieldy. Millions of dollars are
wasted as big industries like tobacco or insurance put self-serving
propositions on the ballot and ragtag citizens groups fight them.
</P>
<P>
   We are stuck with this beast _ 20 of them statewide. Here are
some that deserve a ``no'' vote in Tuesday's election:
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 21 _ It should be enough to know that this is a
left-over from former Gov. Pete Wilson's silly attempt to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   Filled with dangerous, sweeping generalizations _ any juvenile
gang member convicted of murder would qualify for the death penalty
_ its sledgehammer centerpiece is mandated sentencing, which disses
the experience of the state's 227 juvenile court justices.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 21 also would ensure that thousands of kid felons go
straight to adult prison. And it would cost us close to $430
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 22 _ California law already says a legal marriage is
between a man and a woman. Bankrolled big-time by the Mormon and
Catholic churches, 22 is the work of state Sen. William ``Pete''
Knight. He wants to slam the door forever on gays and lesbians who
are working toward some kind of official recognition of their
domestic unions.
</P>
<P>
   Such a stance is not only unkind, it denies two major realities:
</P>
<P>
   _ Thousands of California gays and their children already live
in stable, healthy, community-enhancing families; they deserve the
same rights and benefits as heterosexual couples enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite all the high-minded talk about the ``sanctity'' of
male-female marriage, it is hardly a perfect haven of family bliss.
Spouses and children in heterosexual families are battered and
abused every day, and about half of all guy-gal marriages end in
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't society need all the loving, committed domestic unions
it can find?
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 28 _ One fact should suffice as reason enough to
reject this colossal time-waster: The man who got it on the ballot
is president of a mega-chain of stores called ``Cigarettes
Cheaper!''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, California voters did the right thing and imposed a
50-cents-per-pack tax on cigarettes. The money, about $670 million
a year, is largely controlled by local commissions for use in their
own areas to promote child development and education programs and
to fight smoking by children.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cigarettes Cheaper wants to repeal the tax for several
altruistic reasons, he says. Among them: The folks in charge of
spending the money are taking too much time deciding which programs
will make the best use of the dough.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. You alleged liberals and fed-up Democrats who
like John McCain's straight-shooter style and find him
``refreshing''? Do me a favor. Sit down and look at his voting
record.
</P>
<P>
   All the charm and honesty in the world can't wipe out the fact
that McCain is rabidly anti-choice, anti-gun control, anti-gay
rights, anti-environmental protection and about as hawkish in
foreign policy as Gen. Jack C. Ripper in ``Dr. Strangelove.''
</P>
<P>
   Wake up! This guy could make Reagan look like F.D.R.

 &HT;     VETS SAY THEY ADMIRE McCAIN  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Veterans from an Army battalion that spent more
time in Vietnam than almost any other during the war have nothing
but respect for John McCain, the former Navy flier who spent six
years in a North Vietnamese prison.
</P>
<P>
   But they're not sure he should be president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ``seems to be able to say the right things to people who
are fed up with the establishment, and he undeniably has the aura
of a hero. But I still have some concerns,'' said Tim Swett of
Bethesda, Md., the first commander of the 5th Battalion of the 7th
Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator's campaign for the GOP nomination against
Texas Gov. George W. Bush has emphasized his biography,
particularly the story of his capture and survival as a POW, as it
targeted veterans for support.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Dzikas, 54, of West Haven, Conn., a sergeant in
headquarters company in 1966-67, cautioned against putting too much
emphasis on McCain's status as a veteran. ``Personally, I hope they
don't vote with that veteran thing in mind,'' he said. ``A guy can
be a veteran and still be a bum. Vietnam was a long time ago . . .
don't sit back on your laurels, don't think something you did 30
years ago makes you a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   American voters have agreed with Dzikas in the last two
elections, choosing Bill Clinton, who had no battle experience,
over highly decorated World War II veterans George Bush and Bob
Dole. The election also seemed to mark a generational change of
leadership for Americans from those steeled by World War II to
those who came of age during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain, too, is part of the Vietnam generation, he fits
the mold of the decorated war veteran-turned-politician.
</P>
<P>
   How much that personal history counts with voters will be seen
in large part on Tuesday, when 613 Republican delegates are
contested in 16 primaries and caucuses across the country including
California. In an attempt to gauge the importance of McCain's
veteran credentials, The Examiner spoke with vets In some of those
states who served in the 5th of the 7th _ a battalion that was in
Vietnam from 1966-71, longer than almost any other infantry unit.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporaries of the senator, most of them pushing 60, the
veterans offered views on McCain that ranged from enthusiastic to
lukewarm, with M.D. ``Papa Doc'' Maxwell of St. Joseph, Mo., a 5th
of the 7th medic in 1966-67, arguing the hardest for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give me a choice between (Democratic Vice President Al)
Gore, Bush and McCain, and I'll take McCain _ all you got to do is
look in his eyes,'' he said. ``I'd rather have McCain because he
looks at somebody straight across the table. He looks you straight
in the face and says, `This is what I'm going to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell, 59, awarded five Purple Hearts during his Vietnam tour,
said, ``Tell you what, if vets get off their dead butts and do
something for once, McCain would win this presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time this country stood up to the world and said, `Hey,
we've had enough,'''he said. ``We're not going to send our kids to
Kosovo, we're not going to send kids to die when they don't even
know what's going on. I think McCain feels the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Nunez, 55, of Orange, Calif., ``I'll probably vote McCain,
but I don't think he'll win. The guy gives direct answers, and I
like honesty. I was talking with some other vets and we'd like to
see Bush make him secretary of State or vice president, but I don't
think their egos would let them do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunez rued what he thinks is a missed opportunity for McCain in
California's primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think McCain has really pushed for California at all.
I've heard very little down here,'' said Nunez. ``I wish the
candidates would stop beating each other up and just stick to the
issues. I'm going to have grandkids here in June and I want to hear
what they have to say about education and Social Security, things
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Brostrom, who served in the same squad of Charlie
Company in 1967 with Nunez, said, ``As much as I respect McCain, it
doesn't affect my affinity for the Democrats, particularly Gore,
who I think also had an honorable wartime record (in Vietnam).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer in the political process, so I hope McCain
stays in the race, even if he loses Tuesday,`` said Brostrom. ``I'd
like to see a horse race in the Republican Party. I like what
McCain can inject into the campaign.'' Brostrom, who spent his
Vietnam tour living out of helicopters and jungle holes, said,
``McCain seems to have real candor and honesty, even filtered
through the press.``
</P>
<P>
   Wes Westmoreland, 62, who works for Thomas Steel in Warren,
Ohio, said 180 of the 500 men at the mill are veterans who are
following McCain closely. ``People are saying his chances are less
than 50 percent,'' said Westmoreland, a sergeant major with the 5th
of the 7th who did three tours of Vietnam. ``But they've been wrong
before, and I hope they're wrong this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnamese gave him an opportunity to leave prison but he
stayed with the rest of the guys and went through a hell of an
ordeal. I have a lot of respect for him.''

REFORMERS JILTED BY MCCAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. -- John McCain is not alone out here as an
insurgent trying to steer his party in a less exclusive direction.
He just acts that way, which is one reason his survival as a
presidential candidate is in such doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is there are Republican insurgencies all over this
megastate today, as you'd expect in a party that got beat badly for
governor two years ago, hasn't won a US Senate election in a dozen
years, and was trounced twice by Bill Clinton in the '90s. The
California insurgencies are very much like McCain's _ less
right-wing on social issues, less doctrinaire on domestic topics,
beginning with taxes, more hospitable to reform of the campaign
money system, but still unmistakably Republican.
</P>
<P>
   By making the presidential campaign too much about himself and
about George W. Bush's crude efforts to crush him, especially in
the month since his dramatic launch out of New Hampshire, McCain
has lost a golden opportunity to plug into something that, as he
says in his stump speech, is greater than his own self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   Right here in the center of California Republicanism, Orange
County is full of reformers attempting to burrow into the source of
lasting grass-roots power _ county Republican committees whose
members are elected.
</P>
<P>
   For decades these institutions have been dominated by a
hard-working, superconservative organization called the California
Republican Assembly. And from them have come the legislative and
county candidates who have formed the conservative core of the
state party. This year the assembly is being challenged all over
the state. In Orange County, insurgents are challenging for 42 GOP
committee slots in seven legislative districts, seeking to dislodge
many of the 36 incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, in Riverside County to the east of Los Angeles, 31 more
candidates are scrambling to fill slots in four more districts. The
insurgents go by different names _ Republicans for New Directions
and the New Majority Committee, for example.
</P>
<P>
   They resemble McCain's insurgency in every important way but
one: Many are supporting Bush, won over back in the days when the
Texas governor was a ``compassionate conservative'' or upset that
McCain has reached outside the party and not made common cause with
them.
</P>
<P>
   The best examples involve umbrella volunteer organizations that
have competed against the right-wingers in California for years.
The biggest, the California Congress of Republicans, has actually
endorsed Bush along with Senate candidate Tom Campbell, a moderate
on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has also failed to penetrate the other large home for
raging moderates, the California Republican League. This
organization is more openly ideological. It is prochoice on
abortion and is a rallying point for GOP environmentalists. Most
relevant to McCain, it views paying off the national debt as a
higher priority than slashing income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The league's members complain that McCain has done nothing to
reach out to them. Some also complain about his statement of
support for a ballot initiative intended to oppose gay marriages.
The only link to a presidential campaign on the league's Web site
is to Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   I was with McCain last fall when he went to Sacramento to
endorse a campaign finance reform initiative similar to efforts
that have succeeded in other states, notably Maine and Arizona, and
supported by a politically hyperactive high-tech businessman, Ron
Unz, who in turn supported McCain. Since then the reform effort has
been hit from the left as well as the right, and it may fail.
McCain has done virtually nothing since his first visit to link his
national crusade to that of the California reformers. Many of the
reformers say McCain's statewide vote will fall well short of their
initiative's.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also expected to come in well below the overall vote
for Tom Campbell's long-shot (in November) effort to unseat Senator
Dianne Feinstein. The Silicon Valley congressman and former state
senator is one of the last of the true-believing supply siders: He
favors abolition of the income tax and its replacement by a
national sales tax exempting food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In the primary, however, he is soft-pedaling economics in favor
of his moderate reformer issues: against the anti-gay marriage
proposition, for gun control, abortion rights, normal trade
relations with China, and campaign finance reform. He is heavily
favored in the open primary (where all votes count, in contrast to
the party-rigged presidential voting) to beat two right-wingers for
the right to face Feinstein in the fall. He is also favored to
outperform McCain substantially despite the fact that their basic
appeal is to the same constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign McCain has waged down the stretch _ about Bush's
smash-mouth tactics and the hateful attacks against McCain by the
religious right _ has succeeded only in mobilizing the right.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the Bush vote will be conservatives. But if McCain
loses the overall vote and any rational basis for staying in the
race, the margin of defeat will come from many of those earnest
Republicans battling the right-wingers for slots on the Orange
County central committee. His campaign should have been about them;
instead it was about him.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, March 7:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRENNER-BIOTECH (La Jolla, Calif.) _ Sydney Brenner, who is
now the inventor-guru of a new biotechnology company after retiring
from the British Medical Research Council, has been a leading
molecular biologist for nearly half a century. In a career of
unquenchable creativity, he has always kept moving, searching for
new and different problems to tackle, founding a new field as soon
as old one seemed stale. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GAMMA-RAYS (Undated) _ While the fate of the crippled
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory remains up in the air, NASA moved
last week to ensure the continued study of the powerful and
mysterious radiations that appear to signal the most violent
phenomena in the distant universe by selecting Stanford University
to develop and build the main instrument for the Gamma Ray Large
Area Space Telescope, better known by the acronym GLAST. By John
Noble Wilford.
</P>
<P>

call for stronger government regulation of their manufacture and
sale, but concede that `the horse is out of the barn' as far as
their popularity among consumers goes. By Denise Grady. (1600
words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT1.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SLEEP-LEARNING (Undated) _ Scientists have discovered a new
link between sleep and memory that seriously challenges the wisdom
of skimping on snooze time each night. Experiments show that when
people learn a new skill, their performance does not improve until
after they've had more than six and preferably eight hours of
sleep. Without adequate sleep, researchers say, skills and even new
factual information may not get properly encoded into the brain's
memory circuits. By Sandra Blakeslee. (1330 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LONGEVITY-ETHICS (Philadelphia) _ As scientists work hard to
figure out how cells, organisms or even people might become more or
less immortal, ethicists meet to declare that life expectancies in
the U.S. are long enough already and that tinkering with death
could have disastrous consequences. 900 words. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-QUANTUM-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ Talks at a recent quantum
computer conference centered on algorithms for quickly solving
problems thought infeasible for ``classical'' computers,
understanding the limits of the computational power of quantum
computers, various approaches to building a practical device and
methods for correcting computational errors. The week culminated in
a series of presentations to a financing agency of the Defense
Department. By Sara Robinson. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHAUCER (Undated) _ With the sweet showers of April soon to
arrive, piercing the drought of March as little birds make melody,
scientists are longing to make pilgrimmages into the works of
Geoffrey Chaucer, who wrote on highly technical subjects as well as
penning The Canterbury Tales. By James Glanz. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FIRES-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ Researchers at the National
Institute of Standards and Technology have a new sophisticated
computer model to reconstruct fatal fires and to perform other
complex fire-related problems including predicting the performance
of ceiling sprinklers and to explaining why a sprinkler next to one
already active fails to open in proper sequence _ a phenomenon
known as sprinkler skip. By Mark Derr. (1575 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT3.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RHYTHMIC-CLAPPING (Undated) _ Researchers in the United
States, Romania and Hungary think they understand why order can
arise spontaneously in a cheering crowd. The phenomenon of rhythmic
clapping, the scientists reported last month in the journal Nature,
follows a mathematical model for what are known as coupled
oscillators. But it also has cultural roots. By Henry Fountain.
(850 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on new
insights on development of tools and other implements in China,
sonar fish surveys and rediscovered moons of Uranus. By Henry
Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-REITERS-DISEASE (Undated) _ One of the greatest honor for
doctors and researchers is having something named after them,
including a disease. Now, some in the field are calling for
Reiter's syndrome to be renamed. First, Dr. Reiter didn't really
discover it in the first place. And, he was heavily involved in
deadly human experiments in Nazi death camps, new evidence reveals.
By Lawrence K. Altman. (1780 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PLASTINATING-BODIES (Undated) _ The University of Michigan
has begun carrying out a process known as plastination on a
larger-scale basis, plastinating an entire human body. Usually,
only parts are involved, then sold for study to medical students.
By Mary Roach. (1480 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CIRCUS-CLASSES (Undated) _ Adults can indulge in childhood
fantasies and join the circus, for an hour or so in circus classes
that focus on acrobatics. By Alison Hendries. (745 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: Far too many
parents fail to use proper restraints when their children ride in a

serious with children ages 4 to 8, who have outgrown their safety
seats. By Jane E. Brody. (1175 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hunger in the womb may contribute to adult-onset diabetes,
according to a group of Chinese and British researchers
investigating the rise in insulin resistance that has been found to
accompany improving diets in developing countries. (200 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving teen-age girls a seven pound doll prone to burst into
shrieks intermittently day and night did little to deter the girls,
who lived in neighbhoods with high rates of teen-age pregnancy,
from wanting their own babies. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ The shift from small, family-owned tobacco farms to larger
operations dependent on migrant labor is causing an increase in

peers to engage in sexual intercourse. But a North Carolina study,
published last week in the Journal of Adolescent Health, included
two findings that didn't fit that picture. (320 words).
</P>

&HT;     STRIKING IT RICH IN THE BAY AREA'S OUTDOOR JACKPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The treasures of the newest recreation area in
the San Francisco Bay Area are known to few, yet are surveyed
without hardly a thought from afar by thousands each day.
</P>
<P>
   This area covers 13,000 acres, highlighted by 10,000 acres of
wetlands and an intricate web of waterways that can be accessed by
canoe, kayak or power boat, along with dirt roads on levees that
can be used as trails that are ideal for biking, hiking and
birdwatching. There are also several of the better shoreline
fishing spots in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Where? While relatively few have learned of these places, it is
likely that millions of Bay Area residents have driven right by it
on Highway 37 between San Rafael and Vallejo: It is the Napa-Sonoma
Marshes Wildlife Area, the centerpiece of the Department of
California Fish and Game's new multiple-use wildlife ethic.
</P>
<P>
   My recent visit showed that it isn't fishing and hunting that is
attracting most of the people who love this place. Rather, it's
hiking, biking and birdwatching drawing people who love nature and
open spaces in a peaceful setting with the chance of something
special.
</P>
<P>
   The Napa-Sonoma Marsh is shaped like a giant square and roughly
bordered by Highway 37 to the south, Highway 12 to the east,
Highway 121 to the west and Highway 12/121 to the north. There are
five access points, two well-signed parking areas off Highway 37
and another three near cut-off roads from Highway 12/121, as well
as two public boat ramps. A map is advised, available from the
Department of Fish and Game at the address at the end of this
story.
</P>
<P>
   The network of rivers, sloughs, creeks, tidal-influenced
brackish water lakes and ponds _ often bordered by levees for
hiking or biking access _ makes this among the most unique
recreation sites in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful white egrets are commonly seen poking about for food,
along with dozens of waterfowl species, including all the major
duck and geese species, with hawk sightings also common. At a pond
west of the Buchli Station Road access, there is a rookery of 15 to
20 black-crowned night heron, those lovable fellows who look like
cartoon characters by the way their head seems to sit on neck-less
bodies. In addition, fishing for striped bass is often good in
spring and fall at a spot called Salt Pond No. 1, as well as at the
neighboring San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge near the mouth
of Sonoma Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The best jump-off point for hikers and bikers is the Buchli
parking lot, with access to a series of connected roads and routes
set on levees. To reach the Buchli parking lot: From Highway 121/12
(the road that connects Sonoma and Napa), drive to Duhig Road, turn
south, and drive to Las Amigas Road. Turn left (east) on Las Amigas
and drive to Buchli Station Road. Turn right (south) and drive to
the parking lot at the end of the road just over the railroad
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   On our visit, the weather was unsettled, with dark, billowing
cumulus clouds towering over Mount Tamalpais and the surrounding
foothills and occasional surprise rainbows brightening the
landscape. A refreshing 10-knot breeze was being sent out of the
south. It added texture to a habitat known for its understated
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In a canoe, it can seem as if you are a million miles away from
San Francisco, paddling about, exploring vast wetland communities.
A complex web of navigable waterways includes Sonoma Creek, Napa
Slough, several unnamed brackish-water ponds, and fingers of the
Napa River. You can even get lost! Imagine that: Getting lost in
the Bay Area?
</P>
<P>
   It's possible here, that is, without a navigation chart.
</P>
<P>
   While this is accessible by power boat, DFG senior biologist Jim
Swanson, who commonly surveys the area with a Boston Whaler, also
advises careful use of a tide book to stay clear of being grounded
by low tides.
</P>
<P>
   One of Swanson's challenges is to convert old salt ponds here to
viable wetland habitat. It may seem a formidable task, but
Swanson's first try has been a success after only a year of work,
with a former salt pond already filled with plants, clams and
invertebrates, and in turn, all the wildlife that depends on them.
It has become a model for salt ponds in other regions.
</P>
<P>
   This wildlife area has come together piece by piece over the
past 15 years with purchases paid for by the State Wildlife
Conservation Board. A key missing piece of the land puzzle was
found in 1994, when the state was able to buy salt ponds located
roughly in the center of the complex. Much of the money that has
made this refuge possible has come from penalties paid by Shell Oil
as damages for an oil spill in the mid-1980s near Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the best things the DFG has done in the Bay Area in
the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   For a map/brochure, write to the Department of Fish and Game,
P.O. Box 47, Yountville, CA 94599, or phone 707-944-5500. It can
also be picked up in person at the DFG regional office at 7329
Silverado Trail in Napa.

 &HT;    Christian right can't intimidate this GOP candidate
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Sen. John McCain tells the big money boys that
their campaign donations are corrupting government.
</P>
<P>
   Then he tells Iowa corn farmers that ethanol subsidies are a
waste of taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
   Next he takes a whip to the ``union bosses'' of the Christian
right in South Carolina and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is not your father's Republican. He's not typical of any
political species.
</P>
<P>
   No one would be surprised if McCain refused to kiss a baby and
say it's a stupid practice. Besides, the woman's baby was ugly.
</P>
<P>
   In the temple of the Christian right, McCain lambastes Pat
Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition, and Jerry
Falwell, the founder of the Moral Majority.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that it was time for the Republican Party to stop
bowing to these ``union bosses who have subordinated the interests
of working families to their own ambitions.'' He denounced
Robertson and Falwell as ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of division and slander are not our values,''
McCain told a Virginia Beach crowd a short distance from the
Christian Coalition headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father before him, Gov. George W. Bush wants the votes
that Robertson and Falwell can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cannot argue that division and slander are Republican
values. He also cannot easily dispute that Robertson and Falwell
have built their extremely lucrative preaching careers based on
division and slander. Better to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   After two long terms with Bill Clinton as president, Americans
want the next occupant of the White House to be guided by higher
values than ``what the definition of `is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the candidates in this presidential race have
attempted to convince the voters that they are tight with Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to name his favorite philosopher in one debate, Bush
quickly said Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   If the candidates think that parading their religion
demonstrates values higher than Clinton's, they have not considered
that Clinton does the same.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan's handlers first hit upon the idea of inviting the
fundamentalist Christian leaders into the Republican tent.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for political support from the televangelists, the
Republicans promised to champion favorite pulpit issues utilized by
the preachers.
</P>
<P>
   This was a match made in heaven for the Gipper, the Moral
Majority and the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   When it was his time to run, former President Bush honored the
deal struck with the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the Father, like Reagan, went to South Carolina to speak at
Bob Jones University, an institution renowned for its religious and
racial intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the Boy did the same. That's when McCain first lashed out
against the practice of courting religious bigots in exchange for
their political support.
</P>
<P>
   Bush carried South Carolina and steadfastly defended his
appearance at Bob Jones University until McCain whipped him in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush admitted that he should have separated himself from
some of the bigoted beliefs associated with the fundamentalist
university.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't enough for McCain, who has been targeted with a
morally despicable telephone campaign by Christian right
fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was careful to not condemn all conservative Christians,
only those ``self-appointed leaders'' who preach intolerance and
bigotry and have become a ``corrupting influence on religion and
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a problem-solver,'' Bush said in response to McCain's
attack of his powerful supporters. ``It sounds like he's a
finger-pointer.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, finger-pointing might be the right medicine for
the Republican Party.

&HT;     IN TATTOO BUSINESS, IT'S NO PAIN, NO GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANK BLACKMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Generations of parents have warned their
children about tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   It's painful to put them on. There's the risk of infection. And,
once on, it's too late for regrets because a tattoo can never come
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't no lie, it hurts,'' Golden State Warriors forward
Donyell Marshall said. ``The first time I got mine, I almost passed
out in the chair.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyle Tuttle is the proprietor of a tattoo shop. He has been in
this line of work for 50 years and has seen more than his fair
share of clients squirm, moan and whimper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neither excruciating nor entertaining,'' Tuttle said.
``It's something in between. Tattoos have a good brisk sting to
them. But if didn't sting, even wimps would get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle wanted to dispel one myth, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can truthfully say I've never once seen an infected tattoo
caused by the tattoo artist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intricate, time-consuming needle work gets expensive. A large
tattoo might take three or four hours to put on. The going rate in
San Francisco is $125 per hour. A top artist will charge $200 per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Business always has been good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a segment of society that gets tattoos,''
Tuttle said.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, it was returning GIs who made up the bulk of
the tattoo customers. The golden age of body art began with the
women's movement in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened up half the human race to tattooing,'' Tuttle said.
``That was a big shot in the arm. The next shot in the arm was the
cross-over into the black community. It started through black
athletes. Everybody needs role models.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, some people become disenchanted with their tattoos. A
relationship that was supposed to last a lifetime ends. Or a large
tattoo that inspired oohs and aahs in high school produces frowns
in the workplace a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   That is when it is time to visit someone like Dr. David Laub. He
is a board-certified dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon with an
office in Mill Valley. He can undo what Tuttle did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, technology has improved,'' Laub said. ``Years
ago, the only way to remove a tattoo was to excise it off or use a
dermabrader to take it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``With lasers, we can choose the proper wave length for each
color. So we can not only remove black but blue and red, too. Black
is the easiest, green is the most difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Until laser surgery became commonplace, it was only possible to
remove small tattoos, and they either had to be removed with a
scalpel (excised) or scraped off (dermabrasion).
</P>
<P>
   ``With the advent of lasers you can do the procedure over
several months,'' Laub said. ``The tattoo will start lightening in
color. Depending on the tattoo, it will go away 100 percent or 80
to 90 percent. That depends on the color.''
</P>
<P>
   This procedure, in addition to being time-consuming, is
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   A small tattoo could require anywhere from five to 10 20-minute
sessions to remove, costing up to $300 for each visit. For a large
tattoo, each session will last 45 minutes, and the cost will be
proportionately higher.
</P>
<P>
   So before visiting a tattoo artist, it might be a good idea to
consider the consequences of changing your mind later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spoken in high schools about this,'' Laub said. ``When I
talk to students, I always tell them they should start with a small
one. It should be one color, preferably black. The reason for that
is that it's much easier to take off one color and a smaller one is
easier to take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the trend is toward larger and larger tattoos
that are pretty ornate. And the larger they are, and the more
colors they have, the harder they are to take off.''

   SCI-BRENNER-BIOTECH (La Jolla, Calif.) _ Sydney Brenner, who is
now the inventor-guru of a new biotechnology company after retiring
from the British Medical Research Council, has been a leading
molecular biologist for nearly half a century. In a career of
unquenchable creativity, he has always kept moving, searching for
new and different problems to tackle, founding a new field as soon

</P>
<P>
   SCI-SLEEP-LEARNING (Undated) _ Scientists have discovered a new
link between sleep and memory that seriously challenges the wisdom
of skimping on snooze time each night. Experiments show that when
people learn a new skill, their performance does not improve until
after they've had more than six and preferably eight hours of
sleep. Without adequate sleep, researchers say, skills and even new
factual information may not get properly encoded into the brain's
memory circuits. By Sandra Blakeslee. (1330 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LONGEVITY-ETHICS (Philadelphia) _ As scientists work hard to
figure out how cells, organisms or even people might become more or
less immortal, ethicists meet to declare that life expectancies in

could have disastrous consequences. 900 words. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-QUANTUM-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ Talks at a recent quantum
computer conference centered on algorithms for quickly solving
problems thought infeasible for ``classical'' computers,
understanding the limits of the computational power of quantum
computers, various approaches to building a practical device and
methods for correcting computational errors. The week culminated in
a series of presentations to a financing agency of the Defense
Department. By Sara Robinson. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHAUCER (Undated) _ With the sweet showers of April soon to

scientists are longing to make pilgrimmages into the works of
Geoffrey Chaucer, who wrote on highly technical subjects as well as
penning The Canterbury Tales. By James Glanz. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FIRES-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ Researchers at the National
Institute of Standards and Technology have a new sophisticated
computer model to reconstruct fatal fires and to perform other
complex fire-related problems including predicting the performance
of ceiling sprinklers and to explaining why a sprinkler next to one
already active fails to open in proper sequence _ a phenomenon

   SCI-RHYTHMIC-CLAPPING (Undated) _ Researchers in the United
States, Romania and Hungary think they understand why order can
arise spontaneously in a cheering crowd. The phenomenon of rhythmic
clapping, the scientists reported last month in the journal Nature,
follows a mathematical model for what are known as coupled
oscillators. But it also has cultural roots. By Henry Fountain.

sonar fish surveys and rediscovered moons of Uranus. By Henry
Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-REITERS-DISEASE (Undated) _ One of the greatest honor for
doctors and researchers is having something named after them,
including a disease. Now, some in the field are calling for
Reiter's syndrome to be renamed. First, Dr. Reiter didn't really
discover it in the first place. And, he was heavily involved in
deadly human experiments in Nazi death camps, new evidence reveals.
By Lawrence K. Altman. (1780 words)

<P>
   SCI-PLASTINATING-BODIES (Undated) _ The University of Michigan

larger-scale basis, plastinating an entire human body. Usually,
only parts are involved, then sold for study to medical students.
By Mary Roach. (1480 words)

   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: Far too many
parents fail to use proper restraints when their children ride in a

serious with children ages 4 to 8, who have outgrown their safety
seats. By Jane E. Brody. (1175 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hunger in the womb may contribute to adult-onset diabetes,
according to a group of Chinese and British researchers
investigating the rise in insulin resistance that has been found to
accompany improving diets in developing countries. (200 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving teen-age girls a seven pound doll prone to burst into
shrieks intermittently day and night did little to deter the girls,
who lived in neighbhoods with high rates of teen-age pregnancy,
from wanting their own babies. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ The shift from small, family-owned tobacco farms to larger
operations dependent on migrant labor is causing an increase in
green tobacco sickness, a form of nicotine poison caused by contact

published last week in the Journal of Adolescent Health, included
two findings that didn't fit that picture. (320 words).

WE'RE NOT SHAKEN OR STIRRED BY `SECRET AGENT'
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry Sonnenfeld and Barry Josephson have shrunk their
blockbuster film ``Men in Black'' into ``Secret Agent Man,'' the
new UPN series, but there are no demons and no witty retorts. The
only thing you'll recognize are the black suits worn by the
crimefighters. And even those look like they're straight off the
clearance rack.
</P>
<P>
   Dina Meyer, also in black but with no tie and her shirt
unbuttoned just enough to suggest cleavage, joins Costas Mandylor
and Dondre T. Whitfield as agents working for a top-secret arm of
the government, tracking bad guys with high-tech toys and
high-stakes espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Mandylor is the James Bond type named Monk, and I suppose the
secret agent man referred to in the title. Considered ``the best in
the world,'' he's also a charming, confident ladies' man able to
get himself out of any dangerous mess with the least amount of word
usage.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer is Holiday, ``a skillful agent,'' but she's already
defined by gender. She has the hots for Monk but refuses to let him
in on it, instead tracking his whereabouts from a small room full
of high-tech monitors in the name of protection. Yeah, right. Look
at her face when she sees him locking lips with some women, and
there you have her reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield is Davis, a gadget mastermind who, at least in
Tuesday's pilot episode, serves as the loyal sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ``Secret Agent Man,'' premiering Tuesday, is
reminiscent of Mandylor's last series, ``Players,'' without the
low-brow fun of seeing rapper Ice T go undercover as a country
singer. Presenting this as a somewhat serious undertaking with
occasional one-liners could be the kiss of death, considering how
difficult it is to mix the two.
</P>
<P>
   Example: A sniper kills his intended victim and cracks, ``Wow.
That musta hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, boy. Even Will Smith couldn't have saved this.

&HT;     NEW YORK'S PRIMARY IS MOST SUSPENSEFUL OF SUPER TUESDAY RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A neck-and-neck race among Republicans and a
last-ditch effort by a Democrat have turned New York's presidential
primary into the most suspenseful of the 16 Super Tuesday contests.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic get-out-the-vote efforts by Democrats Bill Bradley and
Al Gore and Republicans George W. Bush and John McCain culminate
Tuesday in the biggest primary day of the 2000 presidential race.
One-third of the delegates who will nominate presidential
candidates will be selected on a single day.
</P>
<P>
   And New York _ second only to California in the number of
delegates at stake _ has emerged, for the first time in years, as a
crucial primary state.
</P>
<P>
   But while polls and political analysts have called Vice
President Gore and Bush, the Texas governor, the all-but-certain
winners in California, New York is still up for grabs, at least
among the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show GOP voters nearly evenly divided between Bush and
McCain, the Arizona senator who was 20 points behind in New York
just six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shootout,'' said Jay Severin, a New York-based GOP
consultant. ``New York will be the life-saver for McCain if he can
pull it out. It would be beating Bush where Bush was supposed to be
the prohibitive favorite. If he wins New York, it's an indication
that he, not Bush, can win the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Severin adds, ``California is the sizzle, but New York is the
steak.''
</P>
<P>
   An Albany Times Union-Buffalo News poll released Sunday shows
Bush and McCain running neck-and-neck among enrolled Republicans
who say they are likely to vote Tuesday. The poll, conducted Feb.
29 to March 3 by Zogby International, shows McCain at 43 percent
and Bush at 40 percent _ within a 3.3 percent margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats, the poll had Gore leading Bradley, the former
New Jersey senator, by a decisive 58 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A large voter turnout should be an advantage for Bush and Gore,
both of whom have their respective parties' organizations to get
voters to the polls, said Buffalo-based GOP analyst Jack Cookfair.
New York primaries, however, even when they are contested, have
traditionally yielded low turnout _ 26 percent among Democrats in
1992, and 36 percent among Republicans in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is going for broke in New York, which many observers say
he must win to remain competitive. By the time polls close Tuesday,
the former New York Knicks basketball star will have spent five of
the previous six days in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also is spending significant time in the Empire State. But
his visits to Florida last week and to his home state of Tennessee
on primary night signal that he already is looking ahead to the six
primaries in ``Southern Super Tuesday'' on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore have each unleashed multimillion-dollar ad
campaigns in New York over the last 10 days with at least two
television spots each running in all of the state's urban media
markets. Both are blanketing Democrat-rich New York City and
courting suburban swing voters with visits and get-out-the-vote
telephone calls targeted to reach up to 500,000 Democratic
households.
</P>
<P>
   Although young voters account for a meager estimated voter
turnout of 8 percent, Bradley is appealing to them to boost his
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They respond to Bill's message of change and hope and
integrity,'' said Bradley's national deputy campaign manager,
Jacques Andre DeGraff. ``A list of 600 endorsements doesn't move
somebody who's 22 years old,'' he added, taking a jab at the
state's pro-Gore Democratic establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore meanwhile, is reaching out to traditional Democratic voting
blocs _ labor unions, minorities and women _ and sticking to
traditional Democratic themes: the environment, health care and
education. He also is looking past the primary process to zone in
on the GOP opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the Republican candidates _ they have both supported
draining money away from public schools at a time when more is
needed,'' the vice president said last week at P.S. 163 on
Manhattan's Upper West Side. ``They seem to think that just because
New York schools begin with `P.S.' that education is an
afterthought.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain seem too busy duking it out with each other to
notice. McCain has touted himself as the candidate with the best
chance of defeating Gore but has had his hands full in the face of
TV and radio attacks on his Senate voting record on the environment
and breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush budgeted $1.5 million for TV and radio spots in New York to
pump up his record in Texas _ and deflate McCain's in the Senate.
Bush also started airing a radio spot Saturday attacking McCain's
education record, in a move analysts said was aimed at women
voters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Texas-based group calling itself ``Republicans
for Clean Air'' shelled out another $1.5 million in the state on
Bush's behalf. Their ad, which the Bush campaign says was done
without its knowledge, paints a harsh picture of McCain while
lauding the Texas governor's environmental record. The Sierra Club
described the ad as full of ``half-truths.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has had problems in his own ranks, most notably the past
week's rift between Gov. George Pataki and New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who have often clashed over the years. Though
both have endorsed Bush, Giuliani has refused to join in attacks on
McCain, whom he calls a personal friend. That prompted Pataki aide
Zenia Mucha to accuse the mayor of being disloyal to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The rift, which drew attention away from the candidate and
toward the local politicians, surely doesn't help Bush in the
waning days of a campaign where a solidified Republican
establishment was supposed to provide Bush's political muscle.

REINDEER RELATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Are caribou the same as reindeer? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They are very closely related, so closely that they are now
usually considered different races of the same species, Rangifer
tarandus, according to The Macmillan Illustrated Animal
Encyclopedia. Even the somewhat smaller domesticated reindeer are
part of the same group.
</P>
<P>
   Caribou coloration varies widely, from nearly black to brown to
gray to almost white, and some populations migrate hundreds of
miles, with some preferring the Arctic tundra for summer and the
edges of woodlands for winter. Their coats may vary from mostly
brown in summer to gray in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Caribou or reindeer range from Scandinavia, European Russia and
Siberia to Greenland and have been introduced into Alaska and
Canada. They have even been introduced into the island of South
Georgia in the South Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Encyclopedia of Mammals (Facts on File) says that there are
nine races or subspecies of caribou or reindeer and points out that
many of the European races are domesticated.
</P>
<P>
   Reindeer are the only deer in which both sexes have antlers,
which they shed at different times of the year. It has been
suggested that the females' antlers help them compete for food in
the unusual herds that reindeers form, which are both large, with
up to 40 females per male, and coed, though adult males are often
solitary until it comes time to gather a harem. &QL;

CHINESE MILITARY TAKES AIM AT TAIWAN POLITICS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In one of the most strident statements yet on Taiwan,
the Chinese military said on Monday that it would ``spare no effort
in a blood-soaked battle'' to protect China's territorial integrity
and that China would not be tricked into negotiations with Taiwan
leaders who secretly oppose re-joining the motherland.
</P>
<P>
   While it did not mention by name any candidates in Taiwan's
March 18 presidential election, the warning, in an editorial of the
Liberation Army Daily, seemed aimed at Chen Shui-bian, the
candidate of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Chen and his party campaigned for Taiwan's formal
independence from China, which considers the island an integral
part of the nation that was separated by civil war. Chen has
recently moderated this position, saying that a formal declaration
would not be necessary because Taiwan already enjoys de facto
independence. He promises that, if elected, he would seek deeper
economic ties and peace talks with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   But in language clearly intended to describe Chen, Monday's
editorial said that Taiwan leaders who ``consistently pushed for
independence'' have used ``sweet-sounding rhetoric to bluff that
they want to have `benevolent harmony, positive cooperation and
lasting peace' with the mainland _ all to swindle the Taiwan
populace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must on no account be dazzled by the pretty phrases,'' the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial from the military's official mouthpiece was
reprinted in People's Daily and other newspapers, indicating that
the views had been approved at the highest levels of the Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
   While the editorial appeared to single out Chen, neither of
Taiwan's other two leading candidates has accepted what China calls
an unshakable precondition for talks: agreement that Taiwan is
legally part of ``One China.''
</P>
<P>
   Some creative compromises in language will be needed if the
hopes in Taipei and Beijing for renewed dialogue later this year,
with a new Taiwanese president, are to be realized.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's military editorial was part of an orchestrated barrage
of warnings from senior leaders here as Taiwan's election
approaches, the American Congress debates a proposal for closer
military ties with the island, and the Clinton administration
weighs Taiwan's request for advanced weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It will be many years before China has the military capacity to
mount a blockade of Taiwan, let alone invade it, foreign analysts
say. But the Chinese leaders have clearly decided that they must
pressure the island now to halt a slide toward independence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a policy statement on Feb. 21 that created new worries in
Taipei and Washington, China said more clearly than before that
Taiwan's indefinite foot-dragging in negotiations, as well as
outright independence, could trigger an attack. The report also
stressed China's desire for a peaceful settlement and its
willingness to grant Taiwan extraordinary autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   That report gave no deadline for talks and none of the
subsequent statements indicate changes in the basic
carrot-and-stick policy it outlined. But all the recent
pronouncements have stressed China's desire to secure the return of
Taiwan ``at an early date.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Sunday, while emphasizing the desire for a peaceful
settlement, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who is considered a moderate
on the issue, said China ``will not sit idly by and watch any
serious separatist activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's newspapers featured a speech by President Jiang Zemin
in which he restated China's preference for negotiations but also
the threat of ``drastic measures'' if Taiwan delays indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to legislators on Sunday, Gen. Zhang Wannian, a top
military leader, said: ``The two sides of the strait cannot remain
perpetually divided'' and ``Taiwanese independence means war.''
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan, the three major presidential candidates have all
described themselves as peacemakers, promising to encourage
economic ties and engage in talks with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, none has disowned President Lee Teng-hui's
assertion that Taiwan's dealings with the mainland should be
conducted on a state-to-state basis. Lee's assertive stance has
been popular and it appears to be politically impossible for any
candidate to backtrack too far.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Vice President Lien Chan, the candidate of the
governing Nationalist Party, warned voters that it would be
reckless to elect Chen because of his ``independence platform.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lien also said: ``The so-called state-to-state relationship
is the constant policy of my country and my government,'' repeating
the phrase that so outraged Beijing, when Lee first used it last
summer.

CHILDREN'S SAFETY OFTEN NEGLECTED IN CARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all the concern most parents express about the safety of
their children, it is surprising _ no, shocking _ that so many
parents are so casual about a proven safety measure that could make
a life-or-death difference: the consistent use of proper child
restraints in motor vehicles, especially for children who are too
old for infant and child safety seats and too young for adult seat
belts.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, parents cannot take a newborn home from the
hospital in a car without a proper car safety seat. All states have
laws requiring children under 4 to be restrained while riding in a
car, and 25 states require that children up to 16 be restrained at
all times.
</P>
<P>
   And, after a series of deaths caused by air bags, parents have
been advised to place all children 12 and under in the rear seat,
where the risk of death in an accident is 35 percent lower than it
is among front-seat occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite all the laws and warnings, motor vehicle accidents
remain the single largest cause of death among children 15 and
younger.
</P>
<P>
   Analyses of fatal accidents have shown that there are many a
slip between the law and the proper use of restraint systems,
especially once children outgrow their child safety seats.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, there are many gaps in the laws for children aged 4
through 8. In 19 states, children in this age group can ride
unrestrained in the back seat of a motor vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   And no state requires the use of booster seats for children who
have outgrown their car seats, even though booster seats, which
raise youngsters high enough so that the adult lap-and-shoulder
belt can be used safely, is the only proper way to protect children
in this age group.
</P>
<P>
   ``After age 3, child safety seats are pretty much out of the
picture,'' said Dr. James Nichols, director of research and traffic
records at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
``Children are either not restrained at all or they are put _
improperly _ in adult seat belts.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, many youngsters are allowed to ride in
the front seat, where the impact from an air bag can kill them if a
crash doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The safety agency has just begun a $7.5 million nationwide
campaign, ``Don't Skip a Step,'' to alert parents to the urgency of
using booster seats for children weighing 40 to 80 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been a decline in crash-related deaths among
infants thanks to greatly increased use of infant safety seats
(which should always be placed in the back seat facing the rear of
the vehicle), fatalities among children ages 4 to 8 have remained
stable since the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   In a new study of fatal crashes conducted by the National Center
for Injury Prevention and Control, from 1994 through 1998, there
was little change in the death rate, the use of restraints or the
seating position among children in the 4 to 8 age group who were
killed in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by Steve Trockman and Dr. Ann Dellinger of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, found that
the death rate, adjusted for age, remained about 2.6 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Of those killed, only 35.2 percent were using some kind of
restraint in 1994, a figure that climbed minimally to 38.1 percent
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of children killed while sitting in the back seat
was 50.1 percent in 1994 and 53.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   During the study period, 14,411 children ages 4 through 8 were
involved in vehicle crashes in which one or more fatal injuries
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Of these, 2,549 _ 17.7 percent _ died. In other words, each year
motor vehicle accidents took the lives of about 500 children in
this age group, at least half of whom would have survived had they
been properly restrained when the crash occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration cites even
more frightening data.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the latest year for which statistics are available,
only 4 percent of 5-year-olds who were involved in fatal crashes
were in any form of child restraint, and of those children who died
in the crashes, fewer than 2 percent were in appropriate safety
seats at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Of 609 5-year-olds involved in fatal crashes that year, 211 had
no restraint at all and 262 were using some sort of seat belt,
which is an inappropriate restraint for their size and can result
in serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our observational studies, seldom do we find more than 6 or
7 percent of 5-to-8-year-olds in a booster seat,'' Nichols said.
``It's always less than 10 percent of the children who are in a
seat that is appropriate for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when parents are surveyed, Nichols said, most feel that they
already know all that they should know about keeping their children
safe in motor vehicles. ``Almost no one wants to know anything more
about child safety seats, and specifically about booster seats,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the following
guidelines. From birth and until children weigh at least 20 pounds
and reach 1 year of age, they should ride in an infant car safety
seat facing the rear of a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   This reduces the risk of spinal injury in case of a crash and
avoids the risk of injury from an inflating air bag.
</P>
<P>
   Infants who reach 20 pounds before age 1 should still ride
facing the rear in either a convertible safety seat or in an infant
seat approved for the higher weights.
</P>
<P>
   Children older than 1 who weigh 20 to 40 pounds can ride in a
child safety seat facing forward, as long as it is still in the
back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Once a child is too big for a child safety seat but still too
small to use an adult safety belt, a belt-positioning booster seat
should be used. This allows the shoulder harness of the vehicle's
safety belt to cross the child's chest and the lap belt to fit
across the upper thighs.
</P>
<P>
   If a shoulder strap rides too high on the child, he could be
strangled during an accident. And if the lap belt crosses the
abdomen, serious internal injury could result upon impact.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols notes that many booster seats come with their own
harnesses, which should be used to restrain the children until they
are big enough for shoulder-and-lap belts to be positioned
properly. Of course, the booster seat itself must be secured by a
lap belt in the rear of the car.
</P>
<P>
   The pediatric academy strongly advises against the use of add-on
devices (not those that are built into the vehicle) that try to
reposition the shoulder portion of the safety belt so that it fits
correctly on passengers who are short.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get children always to use proper vehicle
restraints is for their parents to buckle up themselves and for
parents to insist that the children be properly restrained before
turning on the engine. And though many youngsters may clamor to sit
in the front, the academy insists that the back seat is ``the
safest place for children of any age to ride.''

MARDI GRAS ALSO A DAY FOR CONFESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAIME JORDAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Episcopalian priests have a slogan when it
comes to confessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``All can, some should, none must,'' said Father Mark Cannaday,
rector at St. Alban's Episcopal Church in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Next week marks the beginning of a season of confession for many
faithful. Lent begins on Ash Wednesday and continues until Easter,
on April 23. Christians observe this time with fasting, abstaining
from various foods or activities, and confession.
</P>
<P>
   Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, marks the day before Lent. Although
now associated with revelry and bawdy high jinks, this has not
always been the case. The archaic name for Mardi Gras, Shrovetide
or Shrove Tuesday, reflects a more spiritual focus. ``Shrive'' is a
verb meaning to hear a confession and grant absolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Catholics, this is an experience of emptying out our sins
so we can be filled with grace,'' said Father Jim Gigliotti of St.
Maria Goretti Catholic Church in Arlington. ``For the Catholic,
that opens up the door that is called the faith formation.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Episcopalians, for whom confession is a sacrament of the
church but not a requirement, the catechism states that Roman
Catholics must go to confession at least once a year. According to
the Second Vatican Council, a person should not miss more than
three months and preferably should go at least monthly, Gigliotti
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, guilt drives people to confession, Cannaday said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, it's a secret that people can't share anywhere
else,'' Cannaday said. ``They can't tell it to their wife or
husband or children or best friend. Or maybe they've told it to
someone and they say, `Why don't you go make a confession?' Their
ashamedness brings them into confession. Sometimes they're in the
midst of their sin, trying to find a way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Churches conduct confessions in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Father Tom Hightower of St. Peter and St. Paul Episcopal Church
in Arlington does his by appointment. He takes the parishioner into
the church, locks the door and has the person kneel before the
altar. Hightower sits on a chair with his back to the confessor so
they're not face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   Other churches have confessional booths, often portrayed in
movies, in which a priest sits in one compartment and the confessor
in another, with a divider in between to allow for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cannaday admits he sometimes recognizes voices in the
booth, it's easier to put a person's identity out of his mind when
he doesn't see a face.
</P>
<P>
   The priest's job in that booth is tougher than one might think,
Gigliotti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they just take my breath away,'' Gigliotti said.
``Believe me, they do tell you what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But hearing the gory details isn't always the toughest part.
Sometimes the most difficult part of the job is convincing a person
that his or her horrendous sin is forgivable, and reminding people
of the compassionate and merciful God, Gigliotti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to fight the God of the imagination and you have to
give them the God of the Scriptures, and you only have so many
minutes to do this because there's a line out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In many Episcopalian churches, confession is built into the
services.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Henderson, a Fort Worth lawyer and Episcopalian who
divides his time between San Juan Apostle and Trinity Episcopal in
Fort Worth, said that confession with a priest has never been part
of his routine.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has come to welcome the general confession built
into the worship service. Members repeat general phrases of
forgiveness ``then everybody crosses themselves and they feel a lot
better afterward,'' he said. ``I will say (that) when we have the
service where they skip the confession, it is almost as though
something is missing when we go up for Communion.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're performing it right, relief is exactly what one should
feel after confession, Hightower said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my experience that if someone comes to confession, they
walk away relieved,'' he said. ``What I basically teach about
confession is that we are all sinners, so we all need to confess,
either directly to God or in the presence of a priest.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Albrecht, director of the Pastoral Counseling and
Information Center in Dallas, said many of the modern-day
counseling principles have roots in the Catholic tradition of
confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it really interesting as you read history at the
decline of the Catholic Church in Europe and the rise of Freudian
psychotherapy,'' he said. ``I think there is a parallel between
confession and psychotherapy. Therapy has been the modern role of
what used to be the confessional booth. I really do believe that
where the confessional rite is properly used, it's very, very
helpful to people.''

   &UR; Insight Into Ancient China &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Stone Age technology, it seems, Africa and
Eurasia were something of a Silicon Valley, while eastern Asia,
until recently, was considered more like a Rust Belt. Human
ancestors in Africa and Eurasia were making relatively advanced
large stone tools like axes and cleavers hundreds of thousands of
years ago. But no similar tools from that time had been found in
eastern Asia, supporting a theory that the region was
geographically, and thus culturally and perhaps genetically,
isolated.
</P>
<P>
   That theory has now taken a pounding, after the announcement, in
the current issue of the journal Science, of the discovery of large
stone tools in South China. The tools, cobbles and large stone
flakes that had been extensively chipped into cutting shapes, were
dated to about 800,000 years ago. So it appears that the hominids
of eastern Asia were as technologically advanced as their
counterparts in Africa and Eurasia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, advanced tools have now been found from only one date in
eastern Asia, while in Africa and Eurasia they range over about a
million years. The authors of the Science paper suggest why this
might be: the hominids at the Chinese site might have been taking
advantage of a change in their local environment.
</P>
<P>
   Found among the sediments at the site were tektites, glassy
objects that can result from a catastrophic event like a meteorite
impact, as well as much charcoal. The researchers suggest that the
event that created the tektites would have caused wide burning and
destruction of forests, exposing cobble outcroppings. The early
humans then eventually came to make use of the available stone.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Advancing Fish Surveys &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In order to manage and conserve the world's fish stocks, it
helps to know where they are and in what numbers. One way of doing
that is by using sonar equipment operated from research ships. The
devices send acoustic pulses straight down into the water, and the
intensity of the returning echo is used to calculate the abundance
of fish.
</P>
<P>
   A great idea, save one thing: it has been thought that the noise
of a moving ship would scare away schools of fish, skewing the
results. It's a marine version of the uncertainty principle: trying
to take a measurement affects the measurement.
</P>
<P>
   New research, however, has shown that fish surveyors have little
to worry about. In a brief report in the journal Nature, scientists
in Scotland describe how they used an extremely quiet robot
submersible to conduct sonar surveys of schools of herring in the
North Sea. The results were not appreciably different from surveys
taken a short time later from a much noisier boat.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers say their work also demonstrates that
submersibles are robust enough for extensive surveying on their
own. The craft offer an advantage over surface vessels because they
can dive down to take acoustic measurements near the particular
species that is targeted. This might help, for instance, in taking
accurate surveys of bottom fish.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Recovered Moons &LR;
</P>
<P>
   From the galactic Lost and Found Department comes this bit of
good news: astronomers have relocated two tiny moons of Uranus
after 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   The moons, Cordelia and Ophelia, were discovered in 1986 by the
Voyager spacecraft. The moons orbit just inside and outside the
planet's main ring, so they are believed to be shepherd moons,
meaning their gravitational influence keeps the ring intact.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a University of Arizona researcher, poring over Hubble
Space Telescope images taken in 1997, found Ophelia. He then
contacted astronomers at Wellesley and Cornell, who have studied
the edges of the ring for signs of gravitational disturbances such
as would be caused by the moons. Ophelia, it turned out, was right
where it should be if it was acting as a shepherd. His East Coast
colleagues then told the Arizona astronomer where Cordelia should
be, and sure enough, he found it.

FOR BETTER LEARNING RESEARCHERS ENDORSE `SLEEP ON IT' ADAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have discovered a new link between sleep and memory
that seriously challenges the wisdom of skimping on time spent
sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments show that when people learn a new skill, their
performance does not improve until after they have had more than
six and preferably eight hours of sleep. Without adequate sleep,
researchers say, skills and even new factual information may not
get properly encoded into the brain's memory circuits. Moreover, a
person's intelligence may be less important than a good night's
sleep in forming many kinds of memories.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments, described in the March issue of The Journal of
Cognitive Neuroscience, point to a new hypothesis for memory
formation involving the interaction between two stages of sleep,
one that occurs at the beginning of the night and one early in the
morning. During both periods the brain undergoes physical and
chemical changes whose interaction may be what strengthens memory
traces. The research was carried out by Dr. Robert Stickgold, an
assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and his
colleagues in the Laboratory of Neurophysiology at the
Massachusetts Mental Health Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first study to show that humans have a sleep
window for learning and memory,'' said Dr. Carlyle Smith, a
professor of psychology at Trent University in Peterborough,
Ontario, Canada and a sleep study expert. ``It means that people
who cut their sleep short for the last couple of hours each night
generally won't do as well as those who get a full night's sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The study is intriguing,'' said Dr. Chris Gillin, a professor
of psychiatry at the University of California in San Diego and
Veterans Administration Hospital. It's ``the most believable data
ever collected that a specific memory function is associated with
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The research also has important implications for institutions
like universities, medical schools and the military that often
train people amid long bouts of sleep deprivation. That is, more
sleep might improve students' performance.
</P>
<P>
   To explore the link between learning and sleep, the researchers
trained Harvard undergraduates to spot visual targets on a computer
screen and to press a button as soon as they were certain they had
seen one. At first, it might take 400 milliseconds for a target to
reach the students' conscious awareness, Stickgold said. But with
an hour or so practice they could reliably see the targets much
faster. For example, at the end of training a student might
accurately press a button in 75 milliseconds.
</P>
<P>
   Students who are trained to do this task and are retested from 3
to 12 hours later on the same day show absolutely no improvement in
speed beyond their best time at the end of training, Stickgold
said. And students who sleep six hours or less after training also
show no improvement the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Only those who sleep more than six hours seem to improve. For
example, someone whose best time was 75 milliseconds at the end of
training might, after a good night's sleep, reliably perform the
task in 62 milliseconds. This improvement in speed and accuracy is
somehow consolidated during sleep, Stickgold said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just any kind of sleep that matters. Students who
improved the most slept for eight hours, during which they got
solid bouts of two kinds of sleep as measured in a sleep
laboratory. The first two hours of the night were spent in deep,
slow-wave sleep. The last two hours were spent in rapid eye
movement sleep when vivid dreams occur. People needed both kinds of
sleep to do better on what they had learned the day before, he
said. Moreover, the good night's sleep continued to pay dividends.
Well-rested students tested two days to a week after training could
do the visual task even faster.
</P>
<P>
   Stickgold has a hypothesis about the need for the two types of
sleep. During the first two hours of slow-wave sleep, he said,
certain brain chemicals plummet and information flows out of a
memory region called the hippocampus and into the cortex. During
the next four hours, he theorizes, the brain engages in a kind of
internal dialogue that distributes this new information into
appropriate networks and categories. A slow process of protein
synthesis begins to strengthen connections between nerve cells that
have newly acquired information. ``It's as if you have to wait for
the dough to rise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two hours of sleep, brain chemistry and activity
again change dramatically as the cortex goes into an active
dreaming state. The hippocampus is shut off from the cortex as the
brain literally re-enacts the training and solidifies the newly
made connections throughout its memory banks. ``As I tell students,
this is one of those `your-mother-was-right' studies,'' Stickgold
said. ``If you don't get good sleep and enough sleep after you
learn new stuff, you won't integrate it effectively into your
memories. The six-hour cutoff really scares students.'' Many
college students suffer from a kind of sleep bulimia in which they
binge and purge sleep time, Stickgold said. They get by on three to
five hours a night during the week and binge on weekends thinking
that they will be fine. But much of the information learned during
a sleep-deprived week will not be well-integrated into memory
circuits. After a few days, facts memorized during an ``all
nighter'' tend to fade away. It seems that REM sleep is important
for integrating all kinds of information into the brain over the
long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study also challenges expectations and prejudices about
what makes a smart student,'' Stickgold said. ``How well Harvard
undergrads do the next day on a retest does not depend on what prep
school they went to, their SAT scores or how hard they tried.
Rather, it mostly depends on how well they slept.''
</P>
<P>
   While the visual task was set up for the laboratory, it has
implications for things people do in the real world, Stickgold
said. The study shows that learning a task involving skilled
movements and memories for procedures _ things like mastering a
sport or playing a musical instrument _ will definitely be helped
by a good night's sleep. But so will other types of learning,
including some kinds of rote memorization, he said. To learn and
remember new things, many parts of the brain are called into play.
</P>
<P>
   Students admit that facts stuffed into their heads, after the
proverbial all nighter, tend to fade away in two to three days.
Long-term memory and learning involve putting all the facts and
procedures together in novel ways, Stickgold said. ``In any kind of
learning it's a great idea to sleep on it.''

MAKING ORDER OUT OF CHAOS WHEN A CROWD GOES WILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An adolescent's bedroom notwithstanding, order can develop out
of chaos. Take the universe, for example: it began in violent
disarray, but over time has resolved itself into stars, galaxies,
clusters and other structures.
</P>
<P>
   Or take a concert hall at the end of a great performance. While
not quite cosmic in scale, something of a big bang occurs there as
well _ wild clapping by an appreciative audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, this applause usually remains random and
disorderly until it dies out. But in some cultures, particularly in
Eastern Europe, it is common for an audience's clapping to become
synchronized into waves of rhythmic applause.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers in the United States, Romania and Hungary think
they understand why order can arise spontaneously in a cheering
crowd. The phenomenon of rhythmic clapping, the scientists reported
last month in the journal Nature, follows a mathematical model for
what are known as coupled oscillators. But it also has cultural
roots.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, Dr. Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, an associate
professor of physics at the University of Notre Dame, and
colleagues, studied ``oscillators'' _ in this case, people clapping
_ in concert halls in Romania and Hungary and in a laboratory.
Barabasi said that they discovered that clapping has two modes:
fast, as occurs immediately at the end of a performance, and slow,
as people cut the rate, or frequency, of their claps roughly in
half.
</P>
<P>
   Within the two modes, of course, individuals clap at slightly
different rates. But the range of rates is markedly different
between the two modes. When people clap fast, Barabasi said, there
is a wide range of rates; when they slow down, the variability all
but disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers applied this change in variability to a
mathematical model for synchronization developed by a Japanese
physicist, Yoshiki Kuramoto. Using this model, they discovered that
when the range of rates is wide, as during fast clapping,
synchronization is impossible. ``But when the audience slows down,
it meets the mathematical conditions for synchronization,''
Barabasi said. In fact, he noted, under such conditions
synchronization becomes inevitable, and the audience appears to
clap as one.
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps one of the more unusual examples of
synchronization in nature but it is by no means unique, said Dr.
Steven Strogatz, a professor of applied mathematics at Cornell, who
is familiar with the work of Barabasi's team. Among other examples,
Strogatz said, is the synchronization of thousands of pacemaker
cells in the heart, each of which produces an electrical discharge.
And women who live together, he noted, often find that their
menstrual cycles become synchronized over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been recognized for 40 to 50 years that there's a
mathematical unity to these phenomena,'' Strogatz said. ``It's a
beautiful part of mathematics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see this phenomenon documented,'' he added,
referring to Barabasi's work.
</P>
<P>
   Synchronization is not limited to humans, or even to living
things. In parts of Southeast Asia, male fireflies sitting in the
same mangrove tree will synchronize their flashes, creating a
pulsing beacon that can be seen for miles. And synchronization was
first observed not among creatures but among clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Christiaan Huygens, the 17th century Dutch mathematician and
astronomer, noted that pendulum clocks on the same wall would
eventually become synchronized. Vibrations carried in the wall did
the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike clocks or fireflies, rhythmic applause appears to have a
basis in culture as well as physics, Barabasi said. The reason it
occurs so frequently in Eastern Europe is that concertgoers know
how to play the ``game'' of slowing down to achieve
synchronization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen in America because people don't slow down,''
Barabasi said. ``They are not aware of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in an Eastern European audience, however, the rhythmic
applause usually lasts only 10 or 15 seconds. It breaks down as
synchronization is lost, often to be regained again, and can cycle
this way over and over.
</P>
<P>
   The rhythm breaks down, the researchers theorized, because
although synchronized clapping is distinctive, it is not
particularly noisy _ there are fewer claps in a given time period
because the audience has slowed down. So enthusiastic members of
the audience start to clap faster to raise the noise level,
increasing the variability in clapping rates and destroying the
conditions for synchronization.

   The only way rhythmic clapping could continue unabated, Barabasi
said, would be if the audience was polite but unenthusiastic _ if
it was satisfied with the relative quiet of synchronized applause.
Barabasi, who was born and raised in Romania and left for the
United States in 1991, suggested that this was precisely what
happened during speeches by totalitarian Eastern European leaders.
They were met with prolonged, rhythmic applause, but seldom with
enough enthusiasm to create chaos.

 &HT;    COURIC URGES LAWMAKERS TO HELP PROMOTE COLON CANCER SCREENING
 &HT;    By ANGEL WILSON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Katie Couric, co-host of NBC's ``Today'' show, told
a Senate committee Monday that the entertainment industry is
mobilizing to raise national awareness of colon cancer, and urged
lawmakers to help.
</P>
<P>
   Couric, whose husband, Jay Monahan, was diagnosed with colon
cancer in 1997 and died nine months later at age 42, has become the
main spokesperson for the National Colon Cancer Research Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance was formed a week ago by Couric; Lilly Tartikoff,
widow of former NBC entertainment chief Brandon Tartikoff, who died
of lymphatic cancer at age 48, and the Entertainment Industry
Foundation. The goal of the NCCRA is to provide research and raise
public awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have put together public service announcements from Dennis
Franz of 'NYPD Blue,' Judge Judy, baseball player Eric Davis and
Sean Ferrer, Audrey Hepburn's son,'' Couric told the Senate Special
Committee on Aging. ``Those ads have already begun airing on
television stations nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Hepburn also died of colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the importance of early colon cancer screening,
Couric said she would show her own screening Tuesday morning on the
``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   The more people learn there is nothing embarrassing about
screening tests such as sigmoidoscopies and colonoscopies, Couric
said, the more likely they are to take them.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Medicare, along with many HMOs, provide for these
screenings, and said such simple measures could save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person screened is a potential life saved,'' Couric
said. ``Nobody needs to die of embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses, including colon cancer victim Shirley Heiligman
of New York City, and Dr. Bernard Levin of the University of Texas
Anderson Cancer Center, urged Congress to provide more money for
the battle against colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad irony is that cancer of the colon is probably the most
treatable and survivable of all cancers, if it is detected early
through proper screenings,'' Levin told committee members. ``We
must find ways to heighten public awareness about this disease and
to remove any barriers that may exist for the access to regular
screening procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Colon cancer is currently the second leading cancer killer,
surpassed only by lung cancer. About 130,000 people are diagnosed
with colon cancer annually, and 56,000 of them die. While colon
cancer is usually associated with older white males, women are
diagnosed at a slightly higher rate than men. Blacks are at an even
higher risk, and around 13,000 people under the age of 50 are
diagnosed every year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Disease Control, 60 percent of
people who should be screened never have been. When detected
through early screening, the survival rate is over 90 percent.

IN CHAUCER TALE, A CLUE TO AN ASTRONOMIC REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JAMES GLANZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the sweet showers of April soon to arrive, piercing the
drought of March as birds make melody, scientists are longing to
make pilgrimages into the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, who wrote on
technical subjects as well as penning ``The Canterbury Tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chaucer, a courtier, diplomat and customs official who
was born around 1340, wrote a treatise on the astrolabe, an
instrument used for navigating by the stars, the passages that have
caught the attention of scientists are in ``The Canterbury Tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, a physics professor at Southwest Texas State
University in San Marcos, has suggested that a squire's success in
``removing all the rocks from the coast of Brittany'' at the behest
of his beloved Dorigen in ``The Franklin's Tale'' is more than the
product of Chaucer's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tide rises and falls on the coast, it has never in
memory been ``so great that by at least five fathoms it oversprings
the highest rock in Brittany,'' an occurrence that the squire,
Aurelius, asks a magician to bring about.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Dr. Donald W. Olson, has calculated that one of
the most uncommon of astronomical alignments, favoring extremely
high tides, actually occurred around Chaucer's year of birth and
could have covered the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the April issue of Sky &AMP; Telescope, Olson and
two colleagues at Southwest Texas State _ Dr. Edgar S. Laird, an
English professor, and Thomas E. Lytle, a physics graduate student
_ argue that several clues in the tale show that Chaucer was
probably referring to an event that took place on Dec. 19, 1340.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very rare celestial alignment occurred in the 14th
century,'' Olson said. ``We think he's actually describing a real
event in `The Franklin's Tale.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sigmund Eisner, an emeritus professor of English at the
University of Arizona, said that the conjecture was plausible.
``Every year or two I find some other spot in the works of Chaucer
where he uses his knowledge of astronomy,'' Eisner said. ``Don
Olson's article confirms one more.''
</P>
<P>
   Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the
Sun. The highest tides occur at new and full moon, when the Earth,
Moon and Sun are approximately aligned. But several effects can
cause even higher tides. When the Moon is at perigee, its closest
approach to Earth, the gravitational pull is greater and the tides
are higher. Similarly, Earth's being at perihelion in its orbit
around the Sun enhances tides.
</P>
<P>
   Another circumstance that can affect tides is an alignment of
the Sun, Moon and Earth that is more perfect than usual, and which
leads to a solar or lunar eclipse. But these factors, Earth and
Moon at perigee during an eclipse, happen at most once or twice a
century, and sometimes more than a thousand years can pass without
such a coincidence. But one took place on that day in late December
1340.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomical considerations are significant, since in the
tale, the clerk whom Aurelius pays to work ``magic'' on the tides
actually does some heavy celestial calculations to predict when the
highest of high tides will occur. ``Ful subtilly he kalkuled all
this,'' Chaucer wrote, referring to the subtle calculations, while
giving details on the astronomical tables, equations and celestial
positions that were called for.
</P>
<P>
   Among those details was that the Sun had entered Capricorn,
which occurred around Dec. 13 in Chaucer's day, Olson said. There
was also a reference to Christmas, further fixing the month, and
indications that the clerk was actually computing some of the
special alignments that would be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the high tide appears in the tale, and the characters
display nobility in extricating themselves from an uncomfortable
situation that astronomical forces have made possible. Dorigen
confesses her rash promise to her husband, a knight who travels a
lot; Aurelius releases her from the deal; and the clerk waives his
hefty fee.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the weakest link in Olson's reasoning is the supposition
that Chaucer knew about the rare event, since it occurred around
the year of his birth. But he argues that someone with Chaucer's
obsession with astronomy would have calculated his horoscope,
revealing the special conditions then. And as controller of the
customs office and a member of various royal committees, Chaucer
oversaw repair and construction of wharves, walls and ditches along
the Thames, making it likely that he would have familiarized
himself with the local history of the tides.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said he became interested in such arcane literary problems
through people he met at academic gatherings he attended with his
wife, Dr. Marilynn Olson, who is a professor of English at
Southwest Texas State. Aside from the light his study has thrown on
Chaucer's thinking, he said that his motivation was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lowly physicist; I don't do literary references very
well,'' he said, adding that the project ``gives me an excuse to
read the Tales in great detail.''

LIFE IS GOOD FOR A GROWN-UP DAVID CROSBY AND FRIENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask a simple question, get a simple answer: When David Crosby is
questioned about the difference between the Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP;
Young of old and the CSNY of now, he doesn't even hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had to grow up some, and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is both a funny thing to hear from a 58-year-old man in a
band where the youngest member (Neil Young) is 54 _ and extremely
telling.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young were the biggest band in the world
for the few years they were together in the '70s, a
supergroup/summit meeting of four musicians who had already made
their bones as rock stars and knew they would be successful the
minute they opened their mouths to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Nash had been in the Hollies. Crosby had been a Byrd.
Stills and Young had been in Buffalo Springfield, and Young had
already released his landmark ``Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere''
LP. And, of course, Crosby, Stills and Nash had already released an
eponymous record that included soft-rock staples such as ``Suite:
Judy Blue Eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the battles between the four were
legendary. Outsize egos, tons of money and a desire among all four
to do solo recordings _ all split up CSNY after precisely one
studio LP, ``Deja Vu,'' and a self-indulgent double-live set,
``Four-Way Street.''
</P>
<P>
   CSNY burned hot and flamed out quickly, and though CSN regrouped
several times (and joined with Young for 1988's ``American Dream''
after Crosby kicked a long dependency on crack cocaine) a
full-fledged CD-and-tour CSNY reunion looked highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But it happened, says Crosby, largely because all four are now
old and wise enough to appreciate each other. Released last Oct.
26, ``Looking Forward'' includes two Crosby songs, four by Young
(which, no surprise here, are the strongest), two by Nash, three by
Stills _ and one, the closing ``Sanibel,'' by Nash's friend Denny
Sarokin.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby's two songs, ``Stand and Be Counted'' and ``Dream for
Him,'' are all about making a difference and trying to make the
world a better place.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the same things that I've always said,'' he says.
``That love is the most important thing. No question. We're saying
family is a deep running thread in all of us now. But some of the
things that moved us then moved us now _ having the courage to
stand on your convictions, loyalty, love _ are the same things I've
always been about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking Forward'' began with songs Young was writing for
himself, and soon evolved into all four singing together at the
microphone, just like 'way back when.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built the record together,'' says Crosby. ``It was a very
organic process. We had a blast in the studio. We laughed our way
through the whole thing. Frankly, I think it was such a good
experience we'll do it again. There was a lot of give-and-take, a
lot of honesty, a lot of respect, and a lot of hilarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there was not a lot of interest elsewhere.
Despite significant promotion by Reprise Records tying the CD into
the group's first tour in 25 years, ``Looking Forward'' was gored
by critics (including me) and quickly slunk off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the current hoopla surrounding the band's pricey U.S.
arena tour (more on this later), ``Looking Forward'' is not even in
the ``Billboard'' Top 200 album chart, and hasn't been for weeks.
Crosby's opinion that the CD would rebound _ he did this interview
more than a month ago _ has not proved to be true.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the biggest buzz surrounding CSNY doesn't have
anything to do with the CD or the tour _ rather, it's Crosby's
sperm that's been making headlines.
</P>
<P>
   A recent ``Rolling Stone'' cover story revealed that the Cros is
the biological father of two boys being raised by Melissa Etheridge
and Julie Cypher.
</P>
<P>
   This revelation seems especially poignant because back in 1996,
just before he received a new liver, Crosby was reunited with a
son, James Raymond, whom he had never known about. The two play
together in CPR, a band that also includes Jeff Pevar. Crosby also
has a 4-year-old son, Django.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Melissa and Julie's children,'' he says. ``That's
their family and their job to raise them and they're doing an
excellent job. I feel immensely blessed to have James in my life _
I'm greatly blessed with children.''
</P>
<P>
   He also says he has been pleasantly surprised by the public's
reaction to the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I've been amazed at how positive it's been,'' he
says. ``I thought all the Neanderthals on the right would have
raised a flag of protest. But when I was on ``Larry King,'' all the
calls were positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the prices for CSNY tickets has been a different
story. Even in an era of wildly escalating prices, the top ticket
price ($201) seemed a little _ or, perhaps, a lot _ ridiculous,
especially given the paucity of good new material on ``Looking
Forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after months of carping (much of it, again, from the press)
Crosby still defends the ticket prices. He notes, first of all,
that this is a one-time-only event _ the four, he says, will
``never'' tour again. Second, the show is more than three hours
long, and fans on various band Web sites have been raving.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just focusing on the most expensive tickets,'' he
notes. ``There are a lot more $30 tickets. I've been on the Net a
lot and the universal answer was, `I went and it was money well
spent.' People who walked out of the shows will never forget them.
That's what I'm hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he's asked, don't the high prices mean that a lot of
working-class people won't be able to go?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a valid argument,'' he says. ``All they have to do
is buy a less-expensive ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   And so far, they have: Of the 10 shows reported so far in
``Billboard'' magazine, seven have sold out, each with a gross of
more than $1 million per night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about it,'' says Crosby; one can almost see
him smile through his big walrus mustache. ``I'm not worried about
a damn thing.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ I never dreamed of running off to join the circus. A
childhood trip to the Big Top was thrilling but when the spotlight
hit the daring young men and women on the flying trapeze, I hardly
imagined myself hurtling through space in a sequined skirt. I like
my feet firmly planted on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, do I manage to be among the first in line when the
circus class comes to town? Certainly, boredom with the same old
step aerobics and stair-climber is a compelling motive. Mostly,
though, I wanted to impress my kids with some cool moves. And over
the last few months, sports clubs, ever seeking newer and more
unusual offerings, have begun to offer classes in circus skills.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, visions of high wires and elephants
dancing in my head, I arrived at Crunch Fitness here and shed my
shoes to the irresistible sounds of calliope circus music. Like
most of my classmates, I am no performer but consider myself fit.
The next hour, however, is as much about mental strength as
muscles. Fear is a palpable part of acrobatics as the nervous
laughter among the group attests. We are here not only to build
strength and flexibility, we are told, but to face our fears and
learn to trust our bodies and our acrobatic partners not to let us
down _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   Short, sturdy or slight, there is a place for everyone in circus
sports, an instructor assures us. All shapes and sizes are needed
for tumbling, flying, juggling or simply holding up the human
pyramid. The only requirement is confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Following the requisite warm-up, we head right into the very
backbone of circus acrobatics: the handstand. It's not easy.
Putting our weight on our hands, we slowly walk our feet up the
wall until we are upside down, holding for 30 seconds, which, from
this angle, is a very long time. I'm thankful when we move on to
backbends. Pushing off from the wrist through the forearm and up to
the shoulders, a row of arched backs grudgingly raises along the
floor to a chorus of grunts. This move, an instructor confides,
takes many months to master.
</P>
<P>
   Because so much of circus acrobatics is done upside down, we are
told that our arms must become like legs. The wrists take the brunt
of the workout initially, but the entire upper body musculature is
at work, controlling each movement and distributing the weight
evenly. Eventually, the acrobat learns to shift the center of
gravity through the torso, lightening the load on the hands until
they can carry the bulk like feet.
</P>
<P>
   Acrobats use these basics to create what an instructor, Tanya
Gagne, calls a ``dance-movement vocabulary with acrobatics.''
Pairing off, we begin a bizarre pas de deux as one partner lifts
the other into the air using only leg strength and balance. The
goal is to rest atop your partner's feet, arms spread-eagle and
toes pointed. From this, we contort into the shoulder stand,
placing our weight and our trust into the hands of the partner
below. I'm doubtful and scared, but with a rush of adrenaline I am
airborne, upside down and held only by my shoulders and perhaps a
spotter's hand. But I have done it, and upon landing, we high-five
each other, with bravado, disbelief and pride.
</P>
<P>
   The trapeze, quintessential circus prop, poses a greater
challenge. The simple act of hoisting one's own body weight is
surprisingly difficult and my hands slip as I grip the thin metal
bar. With help, I finally hang by my knees and even perform a
reverse arch before collapsing from fatigue and sore palms. As we
await another turn and respectfully watch a classmate flawlessly
execute the more aerial feats, we juggle. Or try. The comic relief
eases the strain and draws us closer, like a real circus family.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the point. Circus acrobatics is a confrontational,
in-your-face art form in which the physical closeness and
dependence not only create, but demand a bond. Already, I feel
closer to my 19-year-old partner, an NYU student. A giant,
12-person pyramid is our grand finale and we leave with confident
smiles, no longer the audience, but the center ring.
</P>
<P>
   And while I probably will not be doing back flips at my
daughter's next birthday party, I may just entertain the troops
with a little juggling.
</P>
<P>
   Not, however, upside down.

NEW STUDENT AID: PLASTIC BODY PARTS, MADE FROM THE REAL THINGS
</HEADLINE>
  
(Attn: Germany, Mich.) (The Science Times)  
(DW) 
 By MARY ROACH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ When a person dies in Detroit and no one
claims the body, an interesting thing may happen to it. The cadaver
may wind up being donated to the University of Michigan Medical
School's plastination laboratory and turned into an eternity-ready
version of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Plastination is the process of taking organic tissue _ a
rosebud, say, or a human head _ and replacing the water in it with
a liquid silicone polymer. The polymer hardens after the
application of a catalyst, permanently preserving the deceased
entity.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, plastination has been carried out on a relatively
small scale on cadaver parts and organs, which are then sold to
universities and medical schools for use in anatomy classes. But
last month, for the first time in North America, an entire human
body was plastinated.
</P>
<P>
   The project took place at the plastination laboratory at the
University of Michigan, opened in 1989 and run by Dr. Roy Glover,
an associate professor of anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   Plastination was invented in 1981 by Dr. Gunter von Hagens, a
German chemist. When his patent expired, Dow Corning modified the
process, making it cheaper and faster.
</P>
<P>
   Glover said he could plastinate a human heart in 24 hours, but a
week is needed with the von Hagens' method. Von Hagens plastinates
in sub-freezing conditions to keep the catalyst from hardening
prematurely; Dow Corning figured out a way to add the catalyst
after the body is impregnated with the polymer, so the entire
process can be done at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   As teaching aids, plastinated organs offer advantages over
models and organs preserved in formaldehyde, the traditional
method.
</P>
<P>
   Formaldehyde is unpleasant and toxic _ so much so that federal
authorities regulate its use in laboratories _ and organs
deteriorate quickly when taken out of the liquid. Plastinated
organs are nontoxic, durable, dry to the touch, and have no smell.
They can be written on and, if the client wishes, custom-dissected
to highlight specific structures.
</P>
<P>
   For the communication disorders program at Calvin College in
Grand Rapids, Mich., Glover created a plastinated bisected head and
neck, which affords a cutaway view of the human vocal apparatus.
While plastic models of this structure exist, they often distort
sizes and positions of parts for the sake of clarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are amazed to see the real thing,'' said Dr. Judith
Vander Woude, an assistant professor at the college. ``It's been
absolutely wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Michigan Medical School, plastinated organs
are being used in tandem with ``virtual anatomy'' computer
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can actually hold the specimen in your hand and study the
computer program at the same time,'' Glover said. ``It's a powerful
learning tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their advantages, whole plastinated cadavers are
unlikely to replace whole embalmed cadavers in medical school gross
anatomy labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plastinated parts are useful in gross anatomy for
demonstrating specifics,'' said Dr. Arlen Severson, head of the
department of anatomy and cell biology at the University of
Minnesota Duluth School of Medicine. ``But the plastic makes the
body too stiff.'' This makes it impossible for medical students to
do dissections.
</P>
<P>
   Also standing in the way is the cost of large-scale plastination
_ Glover's lab charges $13,000 to process a whole corpse _ and the
shortage of facilities and qualified plastinators. Worldwide, there
are 50 to 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, all the people that can do it are teaching
professors,'' said Dan Corcoran, president of Corcoran
Laboratories, a Bay City, Mich., company that supplies plastination
chemicals and equipment. ``They don't have time.''
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran estimated that of the 157,000 medical schools in the
world, perhaps 100 to 200 are using plastinated body parts.
</P>
<P>
   The intact corpses in Glover's lab today are not destined for
medical schools. They will become the main attraction at a
traveling anatomical museum, being developed by Glover and
Corcoran, with help from Dow Corning. Beginning this summer, the
exhibit will be available to tour natural history museums and
universities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Glover showed a visitor the fourth whole human body
his lab plastinated as the process was under way. It was on its
back in a stainless steel tank of acetone, which filled the lab
with a powerful smell of nail-polish remover each time Glover
lifted the lid. The acetone drives water from the body's tissue,
readying it for impregnation with the silicone polymer. The man in
the acetone was in his 60s when he died. He had a mustache and a
tattoo, both of which will survive the plastination process. (Skin
plastinates as well as any other organ.)
</P>
<P>
   Each of the museum's bodies will be used to highlight a
different biological system or set of systems: digestive, nervous,
cardiovascular-respiratory, reproductive and musculoskeletal.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies will look pretty much as they did on the day of
death, with minor cosmetic enhancements. Muscle and skin
discolorations may be touched up with dye, and veins injected with
a colored version of the polymer. On some of the bodies, Glover
plans to remove the chest wall and reattach it with a hinge, so it
will swing open like a refrigerator door, revealing the organs
within. Both male and female corpses are being prepared, and no
changes will be made in the name of modesty. From the acetone bath,
bodies are transferred to the whole-body plastination chamber, a
cylindrical stainless steel tank filled with liquid polymer. A
vacuum attached to the tank lowers the internal pressure, turning
the acetone to a gas and drawing it from the body. As the acetone
is drawn out of the tissue, the silicone polymer is drawn in to
take its place.
</P>
<P>
   Glover handed his visitor a flashlight to see the view through a
porthole on the top of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   When the acetone gas stops bubbling _ usually after about two
weeks _ the body is removed from the chamber. All that remains is
to pose the body, set the polymer with the catalyst, and mount the
finished specimen on a display stand. Glover uses a plant mister to
apply the catalyst, which starts a chain reaction that works its
way through the entire body, hardening it to a firm but sliceable
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies being plastinated for the anatomical museum are
unclaimed dead, people with no known next of kin. Glover did not
use bodies of people who had elected to donate their remains to
science because the families often wanted the deceased's ashes
(which come primarily from bone), and in this case he would be
unable to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   Donated bodies are, however, used for plastinating organs and
body parts. Potential donors are given a form allowing them to
authorize or forbid the university's various scientific uses of
human remains, including plastination. (The checklist uses the term
``permanent preservation.'')
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The commercial potential of plastination could be sizable. It
could be used in lieu of taxidermy for natural history museum
specimens.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   If care is taken to wipe down the fur with acetone after
plastination, it remains soft and pliable. It also stays in place
longer than on taxidermy specimens, because the plastination
process locks it into the epidermis. The only thing standing in the
way of commercial plastination of museum specimens is, again, lack
of facilities and people to perform the procedure. ``We could
probably do an elephant or a whale if we had a big enough tank,''
Corcoran said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran suspects that one day soon, some enterprising mortuary
scientist will build a factory-scale plastination facility for
human bodies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   (Think what plastination could have done for Lenin.) The way
Corcoran sees it, the demand is already there.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a gentleman who does mummification somewhere,'' he
said. ``He does one a week, at $60,000 a body. And he's got a
backlog. There's enough eccentric people in the world that someone
would do quite well with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, it could be Corcoran himself. ``If the museum doesn't
take off, maybe I'll build some tanks and do that.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glover isn't interested in the noneducational aspects of
plastination. He politely refused a request from a woman who wanted
her dead Yorkshire terrier plastinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do those kinds of personal things,'' he said. He
makes exceptions for science students, though. On the white board
in his office is a note to himself: ``Maria Lopez _ brain for
daughter _ science fair.''

<P>
   The fire began when a cigarette ignited the couch. Within
minutes flames leaped to the drapes and the fire raged until,
deprived by closed windows and doors of the oxygen needed to
flourish, it subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the smoldering fire continued to raise the temperature in
the room, bringing furniture, papers and candles close to their
ignition points. Arriving some time later, firefighters burst
through the door, and oxygen-rich air poured in with them.
</P>
<P>
   The room appeared to erupt into flames _ a phenomenon called
``flashover'' _ as the smoldering fire revived and, in rapid
succession, papers, candles and other furnishings ignited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have flashover, you generally lose the structure and
lives,'' said Dr. Kevin McGrattan, a mathematician with the
Building and Fire Research Laboratory at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
   This fire was hypothetical, created on a computer program that
McGrattan and his colleagues, Dr. Ronald Rehm and Dr. Howard Baum,
designed to simulate the behavior of fire in a building in precise
three-dimensional detail, and to evaluate systems for detecting and
extinguishing the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Fire Dynamic Simulator, the program is to be posted
soon for distribution on the Web site of National Institute of
Standards and Technology (fire.nist.gov). The program is the most
sophisticated and powerful of its kind, said Dr. Richard G. Gann,
senior research scientist at the lab.
</P>
<P>
   As part of continuing official investigations, researchers at
the laboratory have already used the computer model to reconstruct
fatal fires that occurred in Washington and Brooklyn in 1998. The
researchers have also used the program to predict the performance
of ceiling sprinklers in fires and to explain why a sprinkler next
to one already active fails to open in proper sequence, a
phenomenon known as sprinkler skip.
</P>
<P>
   Structural fires cost the American economy about $128 billion
annually in property damage, maintaining fire departments and
insurance. On average each year, 4,000 civilians die and 40,000 are
injured in fires, primarily in their homes; among firefighters, 80
to 90 die and 80,000 to 90,000 are injured. Nearly 75 percent of
fire fatalities occur in flashovers, Gann said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, fire codes and designs aimed at preventing such
losses were based on the accumulated wisdom of firefighters, basic
mathematical calculations and laboratory tests of materials, Gann
said. But in the 1980s, researchers at the laboratory began
developing a computer program that would model the behavior of fire
in an enclosed space, using data on the type, amount and ignition
temperatures of whatever flammable materials were present. The
model drew on abundant data from tests of ignition temperatures and
burning times of new materials.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with another model anticipating the behavior of people
in the presence of fire, this so-called ``zone'' model gave
specialists a powerful tool for determining the layout of
evacuation routes, as well as the placement and timing of fire
alarms and sprinklers in buildings, railroad cars and planes.
</P>
<P>
   First released for use on a desktop computer in 1983, it is also
widely used by fire investigators, said Richard W. Bukowski, a
senior engineer at the fire research laboratory, who helped create
the ``zone'' model.
</P>
<P>
   But the model provides only a one-dimensional view of a room,
showing the vertical distribution of hot and cooler air, not its
horizontal movements. Unable to model the flow of air, it cannot
anticipate the behavior of fire in more complicated spaces, like
rooms with exposed beams or odd shapes. Although it can make rough
calculations about the changing intensity and size of the fire over
time, the program cannot determine its location in a room.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire Dynamic Simulator solves those problems by dividing a
room into cubes six inches on each side, McGrattan said. Using the
staggeringly complex equations of computational fluid dynamics, it
then maps in three dimensions the fire and the flow of heated air
through the room.
</P>
<P>
   Heat causes materials, like wood, candle wax or fabrics, to
release gases, which then fuel the fire in the presence of oxygen.
(Thus, water puts out a fire by cooling, not drowning, it, while
depriving a fire of oxygen smothers it.) The dynamic model takes
days to run through its calculations, making it less user friendly,
if more precise, than its predecessor _ but it has already proved
its worth.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, McGrattan ran the program before the test burning of
an actual building at the Underwriters Laboratory. The experiment
was designed to examine the workings of roof vents, sprinklers and
draft curtains, which hang from the ceiling of large buildings,
like warehouses, and are designed to funnel smoke from a fire
inside the building toward the vents.
</P>
<P>
   The computer model predicted that the draft curtains and, to a
lesser degree the roof vents, would actually interfere with the
working of sprinklers by delaying their opening and by blocking the
full distribution of water from them. Draft curtains and roof vents
are frequently required in existing fire codes, which are developed
locally, and sometimes by insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But a model unified national fire code now under development for
large buildings would drop the demand for draft curtains, McGrattan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The model has also explained a number of flukes in the behavior
of fire alarms and sprinklers. For example, in fire tests in a
basement with exposed ceiling beams, the sprinkler farthest from
the fire consistently ignited before those directly over the
flames.
</P>
<P>
   A computer simulation revealed that the beams were acting as a
conduit and were channeling heat from the fire to the distant
sprinkler so fast that the sensor on the nearest sprinkler never
became warm enough to activate it.
</P>
<P>
   The model showed that in sprinkler skip, water from one
sprinkler cools the heat sensor on its neighbor so that the second
sprinkler is not activated, thus increasing the possibility that
the fire will spread. Adjusting the sensitivity or placement of the
sprinklers solves the problem.
</P>
<P>
   A similar computer model developed in the late 1990s
demonstrated that under specific sea and wind conditions, burning
the oil spilled from a tanker caused less environmental damage,
despite the smoke and air pollution, than removing it after it has
washed ashore. Experiments confirmed the model, and since then
spilled oil has been burned at sea off Alaska in 1998 and after an
oil tanker, the New Carissa, foundered off Coos Bay, Ore., in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Simulations now play an equally crucial role in developing,
designing and testing new kinds of fire codes, based not on
requirements for number and placement of exits, sprinklers,
extinguishers and the like but rather on fire safety goals.
</P>
<P>
   These performance-based codes set specific goals for fire
safety, including the amount of time needed to warn and evacuate
the building's occupants, and the efficiency of the smoke detection
and sprinkler systems, but leave up to the design team the how to
meet those goals.
</P>
<P>
   Bukowski estimated that these codes, being developed in Japan,
Australia, New Zealand and parts of Europe, can cut the cost of
fire protection in a new building _ now set at 15 percent or 20
percent of the construction cost _ by a third, while improving
safety. The fire research laboratory is working on a model
performance-based code of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Fire Dynamic Simulator cannot yet predict when
flashover will occur because of the sheer complexity of calculating
the interactions of hot and cold air, radiant temperatures and the
ignition points of multiple materials over a long period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fire modeling is like predicting the weather,'' McGrattan
said. ``We're pretty good in the short term, but not in the longer
term. We can predict the first couple of minutes of a fire
successfully, but after that, things become more dicey.''
Nonetheless, he said he expected in the next five years to be able
to ``confidently predict for any given room what the flash point
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the progress made in bringing their models to fire
engineers, the researchers admit that firefighters are reluctant to
embrace the technology, preferring in most cases to rely on their
experience and traditional methods. Still McGrattan expects
computer simulations to be widely used in training, because they
can provide a clearer view of fire than video cameras or eyes
blinded by smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Building and Fire Research Laboratory also
hope within four years to have built a control panel that has
embedded in it a ``zone'' model for tracking the progress of a fire
in a building in real time. Sensors monitoring temperature,
occupancy, smoke alarms, sprinklers, ventilation and other systems,
would relay information back to the program, which would also have
an inventory of material in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Constantly updating its data, the computer would determine the
location and intensity of a fire, as well as movement, and feed
that information directly to firefighters, in all likelihood saving
lives and reducing injuries.

&HT;     THE BRADLEY BLUES

   WASHINGTON _ Goodbye, Bill Bradley. We barely knew ye.
</P>
<P>
   Your quixotic adventure is over. You never won a primary and on
Tuesday elections across the country will reaffirm the polls that
show you badly trailing Vice President Al Gore in every primary
state voting that day.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley himself virtually conceded defeat in a Sunday television
appearance, claiming that he had not given up hope but sounding as
though he actually had.
</P>
<P>
   Next will come the armchair generals to second-guess the reasons
for the quick demolition of a challenge that had once seemed so
promising. But the Democratic presidential election was never
Bradley's to lose.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gore's to win. And he did. It was a rough but clean
fight, compared to the ruthless, dirty brawl on the Republican
side.
</P>
<P>
   The underestimation of Gore by pundits and politicians is the
Democratic story of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore went after Bradley's expensive health plan, mocked his
premature departure from the Senate and compared his relatively
passive support for women, racial minorities and labor to Gore's
own long record in the trenches for those causes. Bradley endlessly
complained that Gore was distorting his record, but Gore was
careful not to go too far. It was more a matter of spin. And that
is fair game in competitive politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has emerged as an aggressive, intelligent, engaging and
energetic politician, characteristics that were largely suppressed
in his role as veep. Forget wooden.
</P>
<P>
   The dull speaker in this campaign was Bradley; Gore has learned
how to shout, laugh and wave his arms around. It's a little
disconcerting but better than being put to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's early verbal gaffes and dramatic organizational shake-up
contributed to a mistaken impression that he could be easily
outwitted and outcampaigned by a liberal Democrat who merely
offered himself as the non-Gore. The fact that he is at the top of
his game came as quite a shock.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic primaries, Gore's eight-year service as
President Clinton's subservient sidekick was not the liability that
it might eventually become in a general election. Gore's
controversial role in the 1996 campaign finance controversies and
his praise for Clinton despite Clinton's dalliance with Monica
Lewinsky were never major issues with the Democrats. Those problems
are left for the Republicans to raise in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Clinton fatigue did Bradley no good. On the
contrary, Gore's experience as second in command in the White House
and his resultant expertise in foreign and domestic policy were
assets. He simply knew more than his rival about the issues they
were discussing, and it showed.
</P>
<P>
   Where Bradley was fuzzy about what he might do in the White
House, Gore was relentlessly specific. He has a plan and a program
for everything, something for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was not helped by the excitement generated by Republican
Sen. John McCain, who attracted many independents who might
otherwise have gone to the Democrat. But it was not McCain who did
him in; it was Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bradley did Gore a favor by doing so well initially.
Gore had been coasting to the nomination, untested and unfit for
battle. The possibility of defeat galvanized him into action.
</P>
<P>
   He got serious about his campaign, sharpened his attack mode and
came out fighting. He was ridiculed for moving his headquarters to
Tennessee and adopting informal earth-tone clothes, but they were
outward symbols of a transformation from a vice presidential
mentality to a campaign mode. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   It was never clear why Bradley ran in the first place. He didn't
seem to want the White House job all that badly. The campaign had
the aspect of an exercise conducted just to see what would happen
if a candidate took the high road.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, a road trod only by angels is not the path to a party's
presidential nomination. And as his campaign faltered, Bradley
strayed from his original abstract ideal to trash Gore for
legislative inconsistency and supposed character faults. But
Bradley's heart never seemed in it.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley reverted to a conciliatory attitude in his final debate
with Gore, suggesting that he means to exit the field with dignity.
He said that he would support Gore if Gore wins the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Very civilized, really. And an outcome that positions Bradley
for an important role in a Gore administration, if there is one.
The vice presidential nomination, however, is likely to go to a
fresher face who is a proven vote-getter.

 `SMELLS AND BELLS' OF LENT CAN'T BE FOUND ON THE WEB
 (Commentary)   &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York
Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A recent survey found that those who are online enjoy less human
contact than those who are not. Does this electronic trend toward
isolation threaten religious life that traditionally has been
centered on congregations?
 &HT;    Journalist Mary Alice Williams, on the PBS program ``Religion
and Ethics Newsweekly,'' recently observed that ``With tens of
thousands of religious Web sites and a home page for every
organized faith group and then some, people can get a dose of
religion without ever getting out of their jammies.
 &HT;    ``Some prophesy the Web will reduce us to a virtual community of
believers practicing a kind of `McFaith' _ fast, convenient, but
hardly nourishing.''
 &HT;    Web-McFaith stands in stark contrast to the upcoming church
season: Lent. Beginning with Ash Wednesday on March 8, Christians
will make their annual liturgical pilgrimage toward Good Friday and
Easter.
 &HT;    Every year, the spiritual practices of those 40 days impinge on
my hectic spring schedule _ they are neither fast nor convenient.
 &HT;    But they are nourishing. With varying degrees of success or
commitment over the last two decades, I have tried to take Lent
seriously. Most years I find Lenten spirituality difficult; some
years easy. But nearly every year, I have come to understand
myself, God, liturgy, scriptures, and my church community in
greater spiritual depth through Lent.
 &HT;    I know many Christians who eagerly await Lent. Some actually
converted or returned to faith as a result of Lenten observance.
Their faith stories are often quite similar: Lent introduced them
to ``real church,'' a serious, rigorous and intentional spiritual
community.
 &HT;    What observers have failed to notice is that as our society
speeds up (the Internet being only the latest technological
manifestation of such) religious faith and practice must slow down.
 &HT;    Admittedly, there are nearly 30,000 religion Web sites with
nearly 25 million regular visitors. I'm one. But where do I go for
``serious'' spirituality? Not to the Web. I go to church.
 &HT;    It seems almost deviant to say so, but traditional church
appears to be making a comeback among computer savvy baby-boomers
and Generation Xers. In contrast to the disembodied spirituality of
cyberspace, people seem eager for sensual religious experience _
kneeling, incense, bread and wine, fasting, communal prayer,
congregational singing. The more ``smells and bells'' the better.
Thus, the Internet actually creates a need for human connection to
the divine. The stuff of traditional religion _ from liturgies to
pie suppers _ cannot (yet) be experienced over the Web. It exists
only in musty old buildings whose wood is scented with decades of
candle smoke; through whose windows colored light plays across the
carpet.
 &HT;    Something mystical and mysterious happens inside those
buildings_ something beyond our greatest technological
achievements. Those old buildings are sacred space, places where
the human and divine have touched for generations.
 &HT;    And I mean really touched.
 &HT;    Last year, the Benedictine monks of St. John's Abbey in
Collegeville, Minn., unveiled the first page of a new hand-written
Bible they have commissioned. It is the first hand-written Bible to
be produced in the West since the introduction of the printing
press and will not be completed until 2004.
 &HT;    The St. John's Bible is not intended to glorify a fading past,
but rather it is meant to be a ``21st-century Bible for the 21st
century.'' The monks want to ``link human imagination and the human
hand with the word of God'' thus making the ``word of God live on a
page.''
 &HT;    The primary artist, English calligrapher Donald Jackson, says
the quill pen is ``part of yourself; made of the same stuff as
fingernail.'' Like all artists' tools, it is ``an extension of
one's own fingers.'' And in the touching of finger to page, the
word of God creates a ``visual harmonic'' which strikes a
``universal chord.''
 &HT;    Human touch _ whether a hand-written Bible, Bach played on the
organ, or bread baked for the Eucharist_ is the only real access we
have to the divine. Because spirituality is itself disembodied, it
needs human bodies to be known.
 &HT;    The Internet, itself disembodied, cannot ultimately serve this
purpose. It does not come through the touch of a keyboard. We human
beings need material stuff to know that which is Spirit; we need
one another to touch the Divine.
 &HT;    Like the St. John's Bible, like Lent, spirituality cannot be
fast. Wisdom, insight, knowing oneself and God, serving and caring
for one another, marriage, friendship, parenthoodall take time.
 &HT;    The Internet may be a clever tool to assist our quests, but it
is not the artist's tool, it is not the community found in the
fellowship hall, and it is not the joy found through the rigor of
lifelong Lenten discipline.
 &HT;    You do not need high-speed access to find it; you only need go
down the street.

EXPERTS RE-EXAMINE DR. REITER, HIS SYNDROME AND HIS NAZI PAST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The ultimate tribute for doctors is to have an ailment, microbe,
instrument or anatomical area named after them, and medical
journals and textbooks are sprinkled with hundreds of such eponyms.
Many are rewards for providing the first description of a disease
or type of cell, focusing new attention on a previously obscure
condition or group of symptoms, or devising an instrument adopted
by others.
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally a tribute proves embarrassing because of an
inadequate search into medical history or the background of the
honoree.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is a common condition of unknown cause that
affects the joints, eyes, urethra and skin and known as Reiter's
syndrome. It is named after a German doctor, Hans Conrad Reiter,
who reported a case in a military officer in 1916. The eponym was
adopted in English language journals in the early 1940s. But by
then Reiter had become an early disciple of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Now, new attention to his career shows that his involvement in
Nazi atrocities was deeper than previously known.
</P>
<P>
   Two arthritis experts at the University of California at Los
Angeles have added further evidence of Reiter's role as a Nazi
leader who helped plan and approve ``human experiments'' in
concentration camps. Writing in the current issue of The Journal of
Clinical Rheumatology, Dr. Daniel J. Wallace and Dr. Michael
Weisman, renewed calls made over the last quarter of a century to
drop Reiter's name from the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Reiter may have earned the highest marks for his teaching and
service to the community, the doctors said. But, they asked,
``Should a war criminal be rewarded with eponymous distinction?''
</P>
<P>
   The precise steps needed to get rid of an eponym are unclear and
vary with who uses them. Many eponyms disappear from usage over
time as scientific advances clarify a condition. Some specialties
have committees that officially approve eponyms, but the one for
the American College of Rheumatology has been inactive for many
years, Wallace said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The numerous medical eponyms vary in usage by specialty,
nationality and other factors. Some are used widely.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most famous are Alzheimer's disease, a form of
dementia named for Dr. Alois Alzheimer, who described it in a
medical journal in 1906, and Hodgkin's disease, a cancer of the
lymph system named for Dr. Thomas Hodgkin, the British physician
who discovered it in 1832.
</P>
<P>
   Two other famous eponyms involve the adrenal gland, which
produces vital hormones. Addison's disease, which describes adrenal
insufficiency, is named after a British physician, Dr. Thomas
Addison, who described it in 1855. Cushing's syndrome is the
opposite, resulting from an overproduction of adrenal hormones, and
is named for Dr. Harvey Cushing, an American, who reported it in
1930.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors have been honored with more than one eponym. For
example, the name of the 18th century Czech scientist Jan
Evangelista Purkinje is attached to certain cells in the brain and
fibers in the heart that he described.
</P>
<P>
   Purkinje also showed, from experiments on himself, how one could
see the blood vessels in the back of the eye when light is focused
on the white of the eye, a phenomenon known as Purkinje's tree.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors often prefer the simplicity of eponyms. For example, it
is easier to say Reiter's syndrome than subacute infectious
polyarthritis with mucositis, or the many other tongue-twisting
medical terms for it.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism also plays a significant role in the use of eponyms
because they often vary by country. Reiter, for example, expressed
displeasure that French doctors called it by another name,
Fiessinger-Leroy syndrome, after two French doctors who reported
cases within weeks after Reiter's report in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   Some eponyms honor patients, like Lou Gehrig, who developed a
previously known neurological disease (amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis). Others are named after patients who were among the
first in whom a condition was identified, like Christmas disease, a
bleeding disorder also known as hemophilia B that was found in a
member of the Christmas family.
</P>
<P>
   Other eponyms relate to geography. For example, Lyme disease is
named for the Connecticut town where a number of children suffered
what was believed to be a new form of arthritis when reported in
the 1975. But Lyme disease is the same condition that European
doctors reported much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As fond as doctors are for using eponyms to honor their mentors
and authors of significant earlier papers, successive generations
of doctors often do not know who they were, largely because current
interest in medical history is so lagging.
</P>
<P>
   Authors often create eponyms and editors of peer reviewed
journals and textbooks publish them without fully checking the
biographies of the honoree and without official sanction. But once
eponyms are established, editors are uncertain of their role in
getting rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William J. Koopman, editor of the modern version of probably
the first English language arthritis textbook to list Reiter's
syndrome, said in an interview that he was ``at most vaguely aware
of'' Reiter's past before his attention was called to the new
report from Wallace and Weisman. ``It is not a simple matter to
substitute'' a new name for a well-established eponym, and inertia
plays a role, said Koopman, who also is chairman of the department
of medicine at the University of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Also, when a doctor earns a degree of recognition for a
scientific contribution, Koopman said: ``Do you drop the name
because of something else they did? There's not a broad consensus
on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiter's name was first attached to the syndrome, at least in
the English language, in an arthritis textbook in 1941 and a
journal article in 1942 by Dr. Walter Bauer and Dr. Ephraim P.
Engleman of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the UCLA article, Engleman, now 88, said in an
interview from his office in San Francisco that he and Bauer named
the syndrome ``in deference to'' Reiter ``because Reiter was the
guy that we thought originally described it'' in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors had been describing the syndrome since at least the
early 1500s.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors now use the eponym almost daily on rounds and it appears
in virtually every medical textbook, even health care books written
for the public. Some texts also call Reiter's syndrome reactive
arthritis because doctors have learned that the joint inflammation
seems to be an immunologic reaction to a sexually transmitted
infection or dysentery among people who have a genetic
predisposition to it.
</P>
<P>
   Engleman also said that in 1942 he did not know about Reiter's
Nazi involvement.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new and earlier reports and interviews, Reiter
was a vocal proponent of the eugenics movements of the early 20th
century who joined other professors to swear an oath of allegiance
to Hitler in 1932. As president of the Reich Health Office in 1937,
Reiter declared a fundamental task of the Nazi health leadership
was to stop further transmission of inferior genes.
</P>
<P>
   Engleman said that if he and Bauer had known about Reiter's
Nazism, ``we probably wouldn't have called it Reiter's syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, the co-author of the new report, said that after
treating Reiter's syndrome for more than 20 years at Cedars Sinai
Hospital in Los Angeles, he first learned about Reiter's past in a
book about Nazi medicine that a patient gave him two years ago.
Wallace, who nearly became a historian, was shocked that doctors
would honor someone with such a past. So he interviewed key sources
and researched the eponym's history in medical and military
libraries. There, Wallace found evidence not reported in medical
journals that Reiter reached the pinnacles of power in Nazi
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   He found that Reiter had sanctioned ``medical experiments'' that
killed thousands of concentration camp prisoners, that he was
included in a book of the top 5,000 Nazis and that he was detained
by American officials for two years after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Reiter ``devised orders, supervised medical atrocities and gave
the stamp of approval for them,'' Wallace and Weisman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Reiter played an important role in a number of decisions that
involved medical experiments in Nazi concentration camps. In one
Reiter-approved vaccine ``experiment,'' 250 prisoners at Buchenwald
died after they were purposely infected with rickettsia, a type of
microbe.
</P>
<P>
   Reiter was not convicted of any crime. But that may have been
partly because of the difficulty obtaining proof: the two
top-ranking Nazi doctors, with whom Reiter had planned experiments
at Buchenwald, committed suicide in 1945, according to the new
report and other articles.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Reiter continued publishing research papers and
practiced medicine in Kassel. He died at 88 in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Reiter had achieved some recognition early in his career as a
microbiologist for a role in identifying a bacterium that causes a
form of leptospirosis, which can affect the liver.
</P>
<P>
   Reiter also studied the spirochete bacterium, which causes
syphilis, and his name is attached to a strain that he helped
identify as unusually severe.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Even if Reiter had not been a Nazi, it is not clear why he
deserved having his name attached to the arthritis syndrome.
Reiter's report was not the first, and he drew a serious, erroneous
conclusion about his patient's diagnosis. Reiter initially
concluded that the syndrome was caused by a spirochete, which he
found in the military officer's blood, and named it spirochetosis
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   But when the symptoms failed to respond to the then-standard
anti-syphilis drugs, Reiter abandoned his belief in a spirochetal
cause and concluded that his patient had something else _ now known
by his name.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Dr. Verna Wright, a British rheumatologist, repeating a
comment made 12 years earlier in another scientific report, wrote:
``Reiter's paper made a negligible, if not somewhat misleading,
contribution to the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the UCLA letter, the Spondylitis Association of
America, a patient advocacy group that represents people with
Reiter's syndrome, recently voted to call Reiter's syndrome
reactive arthritis. Editors and other medical leaders might follow
its leadership.

 `SMELLS AND BELLS' OF LENT CAN'T BE FOUND ON THE WEB
 (Commentary)   &HT;    (To purchase this ``separate buy'' article from the New York

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A recent survey found that those who are online enjoy less human
contact than those who are not. Does this electronic trend toward
isolation threaten religious life that traditionally has been
centered on congregations?
 &HT;    Journalist Mary Alice Williams, on the PBS program ``Religion
and Ethics Newsweekly,'' recently observed that ``With tens of
thousands of religious Web sites and a home page for every
organized faith group and then some, people can get a dose of
religion without ever getting out of their jammies.
 &HT;    ``Some prophesy the Web will reduce us to a virtual community of
believers practicing a kind of `McFaith' _ fast, convenient, but
hardly nourishing.''
 &HT;    Web-McFaith stands in stark contrast to the upcoming church
season: Lent. Beginning with Ash Wednesday on March 8, Christians
will make their annual liturgical pilgrimage toward Good Friday and
Easter.
 &HT;    Every year, the spiritual practices of those 40 days impinge on
my hectic spring schedule _ they are neither fast nor convenient.
 &HT;    But they are nourishing. With varying degrees of success or
commitment over the last two decades, I have tried to take Lent
seriously. Most years I find Lenten spirituality difficult; some
years easy. But nearly every year, I have come to understand
myself, God, liturgy, scriptures, and my church community in
greater spiritual depth through Lent.
 &HT;    I know many Christians who eagerly await Lent. Some actually
converted or returned to faith as a result of Lenten observance.
Their faith stories are often quite similar: Lent introduced them
to ``real church,'' a serious, rigorous and intentional spiritual
community.
 &HT;    What observers have failed to notice is that as our society
speeds up (the Internet being only the latest technological
manifestation of such) religious faith and practice must slow down.
 &HT;    Admittedly, there are nearly 30,000 religion Web sites with
nearly 25 million regular visitors. I'm one. But where do I go for
``serious'' spirituality? Not to the Web. I go to church.
 &HT;    It seems almost deviant to say so, but traditional church
appears to be making a comeback among computer savvy baby-boomers
and Generation Xers. In contrast to the disembodied spirituality of
cyberspace, people seem eager for sensual religious experience _
kneeling, incense, bread and wine, fasting, communal prayer,
congregational singing. The more ``smells and bells'' the better.
Thus, the Internet actually creates a need for human connection to
the divine. The stuff of traditional religion _ from liturgies to
pie suppers _ cannot (yet) be experienced over the Web. It exists
only in musty old buildings whose wood is scented with decades of
candle smoke; through whose windows colored light plays across the
carpet.
 &HT;    Something mystical and mysterious happens inside those
buildings_ something beyond our greatest technological
achievements. Those old buildings are sacred space, places where
the human and divine have touched for generations.
 &HT;    And I mean really touched.
 &HT;    Last year, the Benedictine monks of St. John's Abbey in
Collegeville, Minn., unveiled the first page of a new hand-written
Bible they have commissioned. It is the first hand-written Bible to
be produced in the West since the introduction of the printing
press and will not be completed until 2004.
 &HT;    The St. John's Bible is not intended to glorify a fading past,
but rather it is meant to be a ``21st-century Bible for the 21st
century.'' The monks want to ``link human imagination and the human
hand with the word of God'' thus making the ``word of God live on a
page.''
 &HT;    The primary artist, English calligrapher Donald Jackson, says
the quill pen is ``part of yourself; made of the same stuff as
fingernail.'' Like all artists' tools, it is ``an extension of
one's own fingers.'' And in the touching of finger to page, the
word of God creates a ``visual harmonic'' which strikes a
``universal chord.''
 &HT;    Human touch _ whether a hand-written Bible, Bach played on the
organ, or bread baked for the Eucharist_ is the only real access we
have to the divine. Because spirituality is itself disembodied, it
needs human bodies to be known.
 &HT;    The Internet, itself disembodied, cannot ultimately serve this
purpose. It does not come through the touch of a keyboard. We human
beings need material stuff to know that which is Spirit; we need
one another to touch the Divine.
 &HT;    Like the St. John's Bible, like Lent, spirituality cannot be
fast. Wisdom, insight, knowing oneself and God, serving and caring
for one another, marriage, friendship, parenthoodall take time.
 &HT;    The Internet may be a clever tool to assist our quests, but it
is not the artist's tool, it is not the community found in the
fellowship hall, and it is not the joy found through the rigor of
lifelong Lenten discipline.
 &HT;    You do not need high-speed access to find it; you only need go
down the street.

   &UR; NUTRITION: Prenatal Hunger Tied to Adult Diabetes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hunger in the womb may contribute to adult-onset diabetes,
according to a group of Chinese and British researchers
investigating the rise in insulin resistance that has been found to
accompany improving diets in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   In research published last monthin the Annals of Internal
Medicine, epidemiologists culled obstetrical records from the
Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 1948 and 1954, a
period of chronic deprivation in China. They were able to trace and
test 627 grown children of women whose records were available.
</P>
<P>
   What they found was a strong correlation between undernourished
mothers and children who as adults, if their diets improved,
developed insulin resistance syndrome, a condition that is usually
a precursor to diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fetal adaptations to undernutrition may permanently change
metabolism,'' the article said. That can be a problem, the
researchers speculated, when diets improve, as indicated by the
fact the children, unlike their mothers, were not stunted as
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of difficulty in metabolizing fat and rising
caloric intake could play a significant role in the increasing
rates of diabetes in countries attaining prosperity, they said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PATTERNS: When Strokes Discriminate by Race &LR;
</P>
<P>
   More African-American men who suffer strokes die from them than
do their white counterparts. Researchers have long suspected that
the reason could simply be that their strokes are more severe. A
new study from nine Veterans Administration hospitals found that
the strokes blacks suffer are indeed worse, but not by enough to
explain the difference in death rates.
</P>
<P>
   The study, in the journal Stroke, examined the records of 984
patients (30 percent of whom were black, scoring their initial
symptoms on a scale on which lower numbers indicated greater
severity. The average score for the black patients was 7.96; for
whites, 8.32. Patients arrived at hospitals about the same time
after the strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The lead author, Dr. Ronnie D. Horner of Duke, said that while
the difference was significant, it was not enough to account for
the differing outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEHAVIOR: Of Sex, Smarts and the Teen-age Mind &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between intelligence and sex among teen-agers
is more complicated than it seems, according to a new study from
the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   A number of earlier studies had determined that adolescents who
measured higher on intelligence tests were less likely than their
peers to engage in sexual intercourse. That led some researchers to
speculate that their generally higher levels of aspiration led to
greater caution.
</P>
<P>
   But the Carolina study, published last week in the Journal of
Adolescent Health, included two findings that did not fit that
picture. (The study combined data from a national survey of 12,000
adolescents and a more detailed look at the behavior of 300 North
Carolina teen-agers). One was that among students older than 15,
those at the very low end of the test's scale were as likely as
those at the upper reaches to abstain. The other was that
intelligent students were not just avoiding intercourse: they were
less likely to be kissing, petting or even holding hands.
</P>
<P>
   The study's lead author, Dr. Carolyn Halpern of the university's
Department of Maternal and Child Health, wrote that the data
indicate that teen-agers at the opposite ends of the spectrum
probably had different reasons for making the same decision. Girls
of lower intelligence might be shielded from opportunities for sex
more vigilantly, for instance, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Halpern suggested that the data showing that
smarter teen-agers are postponing holding hands and kissing cast
doubt on the idea that their sex lives are governed by fears of the
possible consequences of intercourse. That would imply a kind of
``extremely farsighted concern that is hard to take seriously,''
she said. Finding effective techniques to promote abstinence may
require more research into how teen-agers are actually making up
their minds.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ADOLESCENCE: Unleashing the Power of a Screaming Doll &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Some research produces new ideas. And some research tries to
figure out whether those ideas actually work, like a study released
yesterday on an approach to discouraging teen-age pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The new idea is the Baby Think It Over Doll, a 7-pound surrogate
that bursts out wailing at intervals ranging from 15 minutes to 4
hours, 24 hours a day, and can be quieted only by a key attached to
the user's wrist. The hope is that a few days of this more onerous
version of Tamagotchi, combined with sex education, will
deromanticize young dreams of maternal bliss.
</P>
<P>
   But when Judith Krawlewski, a nurse, and Dr. Catherine
Stevens-Simon, a pediatrician at the University Health Sciences
Center in Colorado, signed up sixth- and eighth-grade girls from a
neighborhood with a high teen-age pregnancy rate to spend three
days and two nights with the dolls, the findings were
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the journal Pediatrics, they reported that the
experience did not change the intentions of those girls who hoped
to become mothers before the age of 20; in fact, it swayed 3 of the
109 girls in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   The doll did expose unrealistic thinking on the part of those
girls: they were the ones who found taking care of it harder than
they expected. But they were also more likely to think that their
child would somehow be easier.
</P>
<P>
   Given the propensity of adolescents to believe that nothing bad
can happen to them, the authors wrote, ``Pregnancy prevention
programs that only try to discourage parenthood are apt to be
ineffective.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Lambert, a spokeswoman for Baby Think It Over Inc. of Eau
Claire, Wis., called the study an unfair because researchers did
not follow the curriculum that accompanies the ``baby simulators.''
``It's an entire program, not just the baby,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAZARDS: An Illness Strikes at Big Tobacco Farms &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The shift from small family-owned tobacco farms to larger
operations dependent on migrant labor is causing an increase in
green tobacco sickness, a form of nicotine poison caused by contact
with wet plants, according to a study in last month's issue of the
American Journal of Industrial Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, Dr. Sara A. Quandt, an epidemiologist at Wake
Forest University School of Medicine, said that 41 percent of the
farm workers she surveyed _ most migrant Mexican workers _ reported
having green tobacco sickness at least once a summer. The disease
is characterized by headaches, nausea, vomiting and dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Only 9 percent of the workers sought medical care, she said,
because they feared losing their jobs if they missed a day in the
field or worked too slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Quandt said the principal cause of the increase appeared to be
greater exposure levels for migrant workers than for the family
members or hired hands who used to tend smaller amounts of crops on
smaller farms. Another factor is a shift toward planting rows of
tobacco plants more closely together to increase yield.

HARRY POTTER'S MAGIC BEWITCHES CHILDHOOD'S IMAGINATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past year, J.K. Rowling's series of Harry Potter books
has topped the New York Times best seller list _ 18.5 million
copies in print in America. The books have been published in 29
countries; and in the United States, the books have been challenged
or banned in at least 26 schools, so far.
</P>
<P>
   Children across America have turned off their TV sets and turned
the pages of ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' ``Harry
Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' and ``Harry Potter and the
Prisoner of Azkaban.'' And as they wait impatiently for the
promised fourth book in the series, they turn to other children's
fantasy literature _ C.S. Lewis's ``Chronicles of Narnia'' and
Lloyd Alexander's ``Chronicles of Prydain.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Eager's ``Half Magic,'' Madeleine L'Engle's ``Wrinkle in
Time'' and J.R.R. Tolkein's classic trilogy, ``Lord of the Rings,''
are also enjoying a resurgence of sales. Children are reading again
_ with a passion.
</P>
<P>
   They have spread the word about the fledgling wizard Harry
Potter.
</P>
<P>
   So why are members of the religious right, the organization
called Family Friendly Libraries and other conservative groups
pushing to have the books removed from school reading lists and
school libraries?
</P>
<P>
   In one word, ``magic.'' Their protests against the Harry Potter
books are sparked by their objections to sorcery, the magic arts,
wizards, warlocks and witches. They don't like 11-year-old Potter
using magic to solve his problems. They have forgotten what it is
like to be a child.
</P>
<P>
   All children believe in magic. It's a way to explain the world.
It's a way to have some power over the world around them. It's a
way to overcome the fears children have. Fantasies and fairy tales
and stories about magical powers are important to the development
of a healthy psychological state.
</P>
<P>
   What child doesn't have an uncle who pulls quarters out of the
air or out of an ear to the delight of his nieces and nephews?
</P>
<P>
   What child hasn't talked to and for his or her dolls or stuffed
animals or toy soldiers? What child hasn't fantasized about being a
knight, a king or queen, or a superhero? What child has not thought
of incantations that would make some improbable or even impossible
event happen _ in an attempt to control the world around them?
</P>
<P>
   A rich fantasy life invigorates the imagination. Fantasy and
fairy tales acknowledge the fears and conflicts children have. And
they can provide answers or resolutions to a child's inner
problems.
</P>
<P>
   What child hasn't felt like ``The Ugly Duckling'' or felt
unfairly burdened by chores set by a parent as in ``Cinderella''?
The inherent lessons of these stories are not lost on children.
</P>
<P>
   In the first Harry Potter book, Muggles are defined as
``nonmagic folk.'' In reality, Muggles are those whose imaginations
have been so suppressed they cannot see the joy in pretending nor
the complex reasons for children's fantasies. Those who want the
Harry Potter books banned are threatened by an active imagination.
They are the real Muggles.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a deeper reality involved here. Tens of thousands
of years ago, early humans created a magical universe to explain
the planets, stars and natural phenomenon like lightning, eclipses,
floods and volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   Humankind sought connections between events by creating a
magical universe. Much like we do, early humans sought answers to
the problems the world threw at them. Their approach was through
magic.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Lascaux cave paintings have been interpreted as
hunting magic _ the portrayal of a desired event would bring it
into reality.
</P>
<P>
   The arrow struck the reindeer or bison in a painting, thus it
would come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   In the magical universe, when two things look alike _ the magic
of similarities _ they share some interior properties that can be
used to bring health or illness. A leaf from the liverwort plant
looks like a liver and thereby was thought to be an effective cure
for liver ailments. Like conceives like: A cave painting if
rendered carefully brought about the portrayed event.
</P>
<P>
   Those immersed in the magical universe know that if two things
in the world have once touched one another, they are always in
contact. In voodoo, for instance, a single hair or fingernail
paring taken from a person can be used to cast a spell on that
person _ for the hair or nail clipping is always in touch with the
person from whom it was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists have never found a culture that didn't create
its own magical universe. Magical connections are inherent in our
thought patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The magical universe inhabits the twilight of our psyches.
</P>
<P>
   The magical universe was gradually shoved out of its position of
prominence by the rise of the religious universe. Later, the
scientific universe eventually came to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these three universes seeks different ways of explaining
the world around us. They ask different questions and arrive at
answers by very different approaches.
</P>
<P>
   When lightning strikes a tree on a plain and kills the herder
sitting beneath it, a person imbedded in the magical universe would
explain that someone put a spell on the herder so that he was
killed by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   A religious person could interpret the event as a sign that
divine retribution will fall upon those who commit a sacrilege or a
violation of holy covenants.
</P>
<P>
   A scientist, however, would explain that the tree as the tallest
conductor of electricity in the locale _ because of the sap or
because it was wet with rain _ would draw lightning to it. The
herder sitting beneath the tree should have known better and was
killed because of his ignorance of natural phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   While it may no longer be a dominant perspective, the magical
universe still prowls in our minds, our thought processes, our way
of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   We all have some belief in magical connections and intuitions
that defy religion and science.
</P>
<P>
   The Harry Potter books acknowledge the thirst children have for
magic and fantasy. Children already fantasize about their lives.
These books give them the security that other children fantasize,
too. And that makes their own fantasies less fearful.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy and imagination are crucial to our growth as human
beings. We gradually outgrow our childhood fantasies, but the
pathways they constructed to enrich our imaginations and to tap our
deepest fears are invaluable in helping us reach our fullest
potential as adults.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Harry Potter books, magic is the spell that subdues
childhood's fears, summons new life for the imagination and
conjures up a world of excitement.

<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Chatting with the man who sat next to her on
an airplane a year and a half ago, Dr. Leonore Arab could not help
noticing that his skin had a telltale orange tinge.
</P>
<P>
   As they talked, he revealed that he was 38 and had lung cancer,
and in addition to undergoing standard treatment had consulted an
``herbalist,'' who had told him to drink three glasses of carrot
juice a day, eat little else and take herbs and other supplements,
including beta carotene, a yellowish-red nutrient that is converted
into vitamin A in the body.
</P>
<P>
   The carrot juice alone contained enough carotene to turn his
skin orange, a harmless though certainly odd looking condition. But
the herbalist's advice was not harmless. Indeed, Arab, a professor
of epidemiology and nutrition at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill, found it troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was heart-rending,'' she said, adding that she did not want
to destroy his hopes, but felt an obligation to tell him that he
might be harming himself.
</P>
<P>
   She warned the man, as gently as possible, that research had
linked beta carotene to an increased risk of lung cancer in men who
smoked, and that the substance might not be safe for someone who
already had lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she told him, cancer patients needed far more
nourishment than they could get from a diet of carrot juice, herbs
and vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   That experience, and similar encounters with other patients
taking herbal products with unknown ingredients and unknown
effects, recommended by people with unknown credentials, led Arab
to organize a scientific meeting on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day conference, ``The Efficacy and Safety of Medicinal
Herbs,'' which wrapoped up Friday in Chapel Hill, was among the
first in the U.S. to gather mainstream researchers from respected
universities and to apply rigorous scientific standards to
evaluating studies of herbal products. Duke University and the
National Institutes of Health were co-sponsors, along with the
University of N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientific scrutiny is a bit late. ``The train has left
the station,'' Arab said, noting that Americans are already engaged
in a vast, uncontrolled experiment. They spend $4 billion dollars a
year on herbal remedies, which are not regulated by the Food and
Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not turning to health professionals,'' Arab said.
``They go to magazines for information.'' Many do not even tell
their doctors what they are taking.
</P>
<P>
   But even if people did ask their doctors about herbs, most
doctors could not answer. There is little information about herbs
in the scientific literature in the U.S., and American medical
schools do not teach students about them. Speakers at the
conference included several researchers from Germany, where herbal
medicines have been studied more extensively than in the U.S. and
are regulated like drugs by the government, which monitors growing,
harvesting and processing.
</P>
<P>
   Popular herbs got mixed reviews at the conference. More than 20
controlled studies of mild depression have shown that St. John's
wort works as well as some prescription drugs, with fewer side
effects. The herb is the best-selling antidepressant in Germany,
and health insurance covers it there as well as in Switzerland and
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   It is also used widely used by Americans who want to treat their
own depression, but Dr. P. Murali Doraiswamy, a psychiatrist at
Duke University who spoke at the conference, had reservations about
it.
</P>
<P>
   He said some of the studies were too small to be reliable, that
long-term data were lacking and that the herb had not been compared
to the more effective prescription drugs like Prozac and Zoloft.
Scientific reviewers called St. John's wort promising but unproven,
he said, adding that many of his own patients had tried it, but
often irregularly and at incorrect doses. Because depression is a
serious illness and a major cause of suicide, he said the trend to
self-medicate was worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, cases have been reported in which St. John's wort has
had dangerous interactions with other drugs, including those used
to treat HIV infection and to prevent rejection in transplant
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies of St. John's wort are now in progress, one
sponsored by the NIH and one by the drug company Pfizer. In the
meantime, Doraiswamy said, the jury is still out.
</P>
<P>
   The herb saw palmetto, taken by many men to relieve symptoms of
prostate enlargement like frequent urination, got a more positive
report. Dr. Timothy J. Wilt, of the Veterans Affairs Center for
Chronic Diseases in Minneapolis, evaluated 18 studies, and found
that saw palmetto worked better than a placebo and as well as a
prescription drug for the condition, finasteride, also called
Proscar.
</P>
<P>
   The herb had fewer side effects and cost $15 a month, compared
to $68 for the prescription drug. But Wilt said long-term studies
were needed to find out whether saw palmetto would keep working and
whether it might help men postpone or delay prostate surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Ginseng does appear to have antioxidant properties, according to
studies by Dr. David Kitts, of the University of British Columbia
in Vancouver. Antioxidants are thought to prevent certain types of
cell damage associated with aging, but their usefulness has not
been proved and it is not clear whether they are safe for cancer
patients, Arab said.
</P>
<P>
   Another herb, comfrey, was condemned by Dr. Felix Stickel, of
the University of Erlangen in Heidelberg, who said the herb had
been banned in Canada and Germany because it can cause liver
failure. It has not been banned in the U.S., though manufacturers
have voluntarily removed it from products like herbal teas because
its toxicity is widely known. Previously, it had been recommended
both here and overseas to treat inflammation and constipation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other herbs received cautiously positive reviews. Arab reported
that epidemiologic studies, in which researchers survey people's
diets and health, indicated that eating cooked or raw garlic _ but
not garlic supplements _ was linked to a decreased risk of stomach
and intestinal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edzard Ernst, of the University of Exeter, in Devon,
England, analyzed a series of studies of the herb feverfew, and
concluded that it could be somewhat helpful in preventing, though
not treating, migraine headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Ginkgo biloba appeared to slow mental decline slightly in about
a third of patients in a placebo-controlled study of 137 people
with dementia, Dr. Pierre LeBars of New York University said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the first to show any benefit, was published in 1997
in the Journal of the American Medical Association. But the herb
did not improve memory in healthy people, and LeBars said more
studies were needed to find out whether it would really be of use
in treating dementia. The form used in the study differed from the
version usually sold in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Certain echinacea extracts are accepted as treatment for colds
in Germany, reported Dr. Rudolf Bauer of Heinrich-Heine University
in Dusseldorf, who described several controlled studies showing
that the herb could shorten the duration by a few days and ease
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But there are three different species of echinacea, and many
different processing methods, and the effectiveness of different
products may vary, he said, adding there was no evidence that any
form of the herb could prevent colds or other infections.
</P>
<P>
   Positive findings on herbs would be great news if Americans
could obtain reliable products with known doses of substances that
have medicinal effects. But what is actually in many of the items
sold as dietary supplements in the U.S. is anybody's guess: some
may actually contain none of what is promised on the label.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Varro E. Tyler, a distinguished professor emeritus of
pharmacognosy at Purdue University, called the status of medicinal
herbs in the U.S. a ``scandalous situation'' that has left the
public bewildered, scratching their heads and trying to figure out
things like which of a dozen different echinacea products might
work. He also warned that anybody can call himself or herself an
``herbalist'' and offer all sorts of advice to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler, who has written more than 30 books about herbs, describes
them as ``dilute drugs,'' and he said they should be regulated as
drugs by the FDA so that manufacturers are required to produce
uniform batches with known ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   But under the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act,
herbal medicines are classified as supplements, not drugs, which
means there is no FDA monitoring of quality control. The act also
prevents manufacturers from saying on labels that their products
can prevent or treat specific diseases or symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Tyler said, the market has been flooded with ``junk
products'' that are a waste of money. He denounced the growing
trend to add herbs like St. John's wort and echinacea to iced tea,
soft drinks and other foods. The herbs are drugs and should be
treated with respect, he said, and do not belong in canned soup any
more than Prozac does.
</P>
<P>
   He faulted greedy manufacturers, as well as the FDA. He said
that to approve an herbal product as a drug, the FDA insisted that
its manufacturer provide the same proof of safety and efficacy as
other new drugs. But that requirement is unrealistic, he said,
becaue the testing process can cost hundreds of millions of
dollars, and herb manufacturers do not attempt it because their
products are generally not patentable and they will never recoup
the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Given that herbs have been around for so long and the vast
majority have few or no side effects, Tyler said the rules should
be relaxed for them, to require strong proof of safety and
``reasonable'' proof of efficacy, which he said could be obtained
with two well designed, placebo-controlled trials that would cost a
few million dollars, instead of hundreds of millions.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that FDA-approved herbal drugs would prove so
popular that people would flock to them, forcing manufacturers to
submit to the process just to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for the FDA said that changing the standards
for approval would take an act of Congress.

<P>
   There is an error in the StarBeat story ``A QUIZ FOR THE
ALSO-RANS: ON OSCAR NIGHT, WHAT COUNTS ISN'T HOW YOU PLAY THE
GAME'' that moved earlier today.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 7 should read: What pair of sisters were nominated
for playing a nun in 1985 and a floozy in 1994, but lost both
years?
</P>
<P>
   The answer should read: Meg Tilly was nominated for Best
Supporting Actress for ``Agnes of God'' (1985), while her sister
Jennifer was nominated for ``Bullets over Broadway'' (1994). Both
lost.
</P>
<P>
   We regret any inconvenience.

   COX-RADIO _ Cox Radio enters definitive agreement to buy three
radio stations in Houston and four radio stations in Richmond for
$380 million in cash from Clear Channel Communications. Deal
expected to close in second half. Cox Radio cites demographics of
the markets for its purchases and said the stations to be acquired

   OVERTIME-ABUSE _ Here's the flip side of the booming economy:
there's an increase in the number of workers suing their employer
for failure to pay overtime. Atlanta attorney David Worley said
he's filed twice as many overtime lawsuits in the last two years
than in the past. The most recent involves five CVS pharmacists who
allege they've been forced to work 70 hour weeks on a regular basis
without overtime pay. Overtime abuse is occurring in all kinds of
industries, including health care, schools, accounting and even
places like Coca-Cola. A look at this situation. (Joyner, Atlanta

   BBN-BRAVES _ Javy Lopez has worked hard throughout the offseason
to recover from a knee injury that forced him to miss the end of
last season. But his return to the lineup at catcher will send his
best friend - fellow catcher Eddie Perez - back to the bench.
Although Lopez feels bad that his presence cuts into Perez's

   BKC-SEC-KENTUCKY _ ATLANTA _ Despite a SEC co-championship, it
has not been a smooth season for Kentucky. But this is March and
the Wildcats have never lost at the Georgia Dome. Of course, that
means even more pressure for coach Tubby Smith in the SEC
Tournament. Despite an NCAA title, Smith is still proving himself

the Blue Grass State. (Bunn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 22.

   FOOTBALL/NFLLEWIS-VICTIMS _ ATLANTA _ Expect the victims in the
murder case against Baltimore Ravens' All-Pro linebacker Ray Lewis
to be ``put on trial'' as the defense attorneys do everything they
can to present them as the bad guys, the aggressors. It'll be the
crux of a self-defense strategy. This has worked well in some cases
. . . but it can backfire. (Torpy, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   FBC-APPLEWHITE _ He stands on the sidelines sometimes lost in

recovering from knee surgery. However, the pairin from the knee
surgery likely doesn't compare with the pain of watching heralded
sophmore Chris Simms work with the first team unit during spring
practice. The two were sharing playing time in the Cotton Bowl
against Arkansas when Applewhite went down with the knee injury.
Time and the maturity of Simms will tell if Applewhite returns to
his old form and position. Developing. (Wangrin, Austin

   BASS-OKEECHOBEE _ After a quarter-century of watching Lake

fabled bass-fishing haven in January. His verdict: ``That's pretty
ugly-looking water,'' said Shupp, national conservation director of
the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society, the nation's largest bass
fishing organization. He was astounded by the water's pollution-fed
murk, and the loss of the fish-nurturing grasses along much of the
lake's shore. (King, Palm Beach Post).

to be ``put on trial'' as the defense attorneys do everything they
can to present them as the bad guys, the aggressors. It'll be the
crux of a self-defense strategy. This has worked well in some cases
. . . but it can backfire. (Torpy, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   FBC-APPLEWHITE _ He stands on the sidelines sometimes lost in

recovering from knee surgery. However, the pairin from the knee
surgery likely doesn't compare with the pain of watching heralded
sophmore Chris Simms work with the first team unit during spring
practice. The two were sharing playing time in the Cotton Bowl

Time and the maturity of Simms will tell if Applewhite returns to

   BASS-OKEECHOBEE _ After a quarter-century of watching Lake

ugly-looking water,'' said Shupp, national conservation director of
the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society, the nation's largest bass
fishing organization. He was astounded by the water's pollution-fed
murk, and the loss of the fish-nurturing grasses along much of the
lake's shore. (King, Palm Beach Post).

   &UR; NATIONAL FORECAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Record warmth will envelop the Plains Tuesday as breezes from
the south transport very mild air to the north. Some places will be
as much as 25 degrees above normal Tuesday afternoon. The mild
weather will spread to the East Coast where readings in the 70s
will be common in the Middle Atlantic States as high pressure
promotes abundant sunshine. Many spots in the Southeast will have
readings over 80 degrees which are more typical of the summer
rather than early March.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will also turn unseasonably mild, although some
clouds will stream to the southeast over New England. Meanwhile, a
cold front crossing northern Maine will bring cloudy skies and
isolated showers and flurries to the higher elevations of Maine and
New Hampshire. Noticeably cooler air will press to the south behind
this front.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will develop in the southern Plains
ahead of a cold front moving out of the southern Rockies. In the
wake of the front, showers will also reach western Texas. Cold air
in the mountains will combine with moisture being forced up the
sloping terrain to bring patches of snow to the highlands of
northern Arizona along with the Wasatch and San Juan mountains.
Farther to the north, skies will be partly cloudy across the
Dakotas as high clouds stream to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, showers will brush the Northwest coast as moisture
arrives from the Pacific. Winds will increase with gusty breezes
buffeting the shore. To the south, Southern California will turn
sunny once again.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOCUS: News Maker &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There is an adage in weather forecasting that a storm which
makes news in the West will do so again before it reaches the East.
This past weekend's storm in California brought nearly two inches
of rain to Los Angeles and heavy snow around Flagstaff, Arizona.
Tuesday, the disturbance will approach the western Plains where
warm, humid air is streaming north from the Gulf. The unusual
intensity of the disturbance when combined with unseasonable warmth
in the Plains and Mississippi Valley should produce a noteworthy
outbreak of strong thunderstorms late Tuesday and Wednesday.

`CIDER HOUSE' DIRECTOR LASSE HALLSTROM ENJOYING ALL THE HOOPLA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Is that Kate Capshaw?'' Lasse Hallstrom wondered aloud during
a mid-afternoon chat in the Beverly Hills Hotel's Polo Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't, but that's not important. What's interesting, and
rather endearing, is that Hallstrom, whose ``The Cider House
Rules'' is up for seven Academy Awards, including best picture, was
rubbernecking for celebrities like an ordinary tourist.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish director lives in upstate Bedford, N.Y., about
midway between his homeland and Los Angeles, and the way he talks
about the U.S. movie business suggests a distance from it that is
more than geographic.
</P>
<P>
   That distance safeguards Hallstrom somewhat from getting caught
in the middle of the debate over whether Miramax Films essentially
paid for the ``Cider House'' nominations with its high-gear ``for
your consideration'' campaign in the trade papers.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry observers and insiders have complained that
Miramax pumped up the volume for its sole serious contender among
its few fall releases, bringing ``Cider House'' more attention from
Oscar voters than it was due and reaping the rewards in a bouquet
of nominations last month.
</P>
<P>
   They blame the same type of advertising effort for Miramax's
``Shakespeare in Love,'' claiming the best-picture award last year
over DreamWorks' ``Saving Private Ryan.'' The ``Shakespeare''
campaign has been estimated at $15 million, a figure Miramax says
is overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``Cider House'' drew positive reviews from major dailies,
but it neither hit that four-star pinnacle nor claimed best-picture
prizes from critics' organizations. And Hallstrom is not in the
running for the Directors Guild of America award this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be terrible if this whole marketing (issue), the war
between DreamWorks and Miramax, and the claim about the advertising
push, is going to overshadow what the movie's all about,''
Hallstrom said. ``I really feel so proud of this film, and I have
seen this movie with audiences, and I just know that audiences love
this movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response is so emotional,'' he said. ``People seem so
genuinely moved by it. That's the ultimate reward for me as a
director, and I think that's the ultimate attraction to this movie
_ that people are actually moved without getting a bad taste,
because the movie is not pushing buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to have an advertising campaign sort of diffuse those
facts, or soil it _ that would upset me if that came into play.''
</P>
<P>
   Would he like to see those Oscar promotional ads go by the
wayside?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not enough of an expert on this,'' he said with diplomatic
tact.
</P>
<P>
   On the day nominations came out, Hallstrom said he was looking
forward to the pre-Oscar period for the opportunity it affords to
relive the pleasure he had making ``Cider House'' with writer John
Irving, stars Tobey Maguire, Michael Caine and Charlize Theron, and
the rest of the company.
</P>
<P>
   His comments at the time gave the impression that he was
genuinely surprised with the best-picture and director nominations
(``Yes, I was,'' he said on reflection), and that he didn't really
expect to win those categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're completely out of it,'' Hallstrom now
says, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that new-found optimism stems from encouraging word of
mouth, Las Vegas odds that put ``Cider House'' at even money with
DreamWorks' ``American Beauty,'' or even if Hallstrom himself has
succumbed to Miramax's publicity efforts, it has encouraged the
53-year-old director to dive into awards-season mania like never
before.
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom, a former TV director in Sweden who established
himself making promotional shorts for the rock band ABBA in the
pre-music-video '70s, first came to the wide attention of American
moviegoers with ``My Life as a Dog,'' his warm account of a
mischievous 12-year-old boy sent to live with relatives in rural
Sweden in the 1950s. The Swedish movie garnered 1987 directing and
screenplay Oscar nominations.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Hallstrom hung back in Sweden, avoiding the pre-Oscar
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here two days before the awards ceremony, but then
again, it was `My Life as a Dog,''' he said. ``I could tell those
odds were different, so I didn't worry too much about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, he's working the ballroom circuit, appearing
on behalf of his film at assorted functions. On the day of this
interview, he had just attended the E Pluribus Unum awards luncheon
(``October Sky'' won), and later he would pick up a tuxedo for the
Producers Guild Awards that night (``American Beauty'' claimed the
top prize).
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he'll be among the hopefuls at the annual Oscar
nominees luncheon, and on March 25 there's the Maggie Award to pick
up from Planned Parenthood in Washington for the film's treatment
of the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to all the fun. I'm going to enjoy it all
this time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't in town just to bask in the ``Cider House'' glow,
though. Hallstrom is gearing up for another Miramax film,
``Chocolat,'' set in France in the late '50s and starring Juliette
Binoche, Johnny Depp, Alfred Molina and Hallstrom's wife, Lena
Olin. He came looking for a 7-year-old girl to play Binoche's
daughter and to fill other roles for the picture, based on Joanne
Harris' novel. It begins filming in May in France and England.
</P>
<P>
   After that comes ``The Shipping News,'' a co-production of
Columbia Pictures and Miramax of E. Annie Proulx's 1994 best seller
about a hack writer who returns to his roots in coastal
Newfoundland to write about car crashes and the shipping business
for the town's pitiful local paper.
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom last made waves in 1993 with ``What's Eating Gilbert
Grape?'' which brought little-known Leonardo DiCaprio a
supporting-actor Oscar nomination. He had a four-year gap between
his last project, 1995's ``Something to Talk About,'' and ``Cider
House.'' Now he seems to be picking up the pace considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my main ambitions is to work back-to-back the way I did
in Sweden, where I made a movie at least every second year, whereas
here the business side of it all is still a mystery, and I've been
having some projects fall apart or postponed,'' he said. ``But I
hope to work continuously from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Some European directors have become caught up in the appeal of
Hollywood _ the money, the big budgets, the internationally known
actors, the huge audience _ leading them far afield from their
original work. For example, there is no straight line between Paul
Verhoeven's ``Soldier of Orange'' and ``Showgirls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ingmar) Bergman, whom I don't know, sent me a letter saying,
`Watch out for the meat grinder of American filmmaking,'''
Hallstrom said. ``So he was very worried that I would be chopped
up, which was a nice concern.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hallstrom says his selectivity in choosing projects that
appeal to him _ the character-driven stories _ has kept that from
happening to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The others that are plot-driven very often sacrifice
characters for plot,'' he said. ``I realize I'm not as interested
in telling stories as I am getting caught up in detail and
observations of small things, and I end up making all these
observations add up to films that are not strong on story but
hopefully are strong on other things.'' &QL;

   Wal-Mart's plan to transfer meat-cutters to other departments at
180 supercenters, including the East Texas store where butchers
voted for a union, is aimed at stifling gains by labor, a union
organizer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I believe they are shooting themselves in their own
feet,'' said Brad Edwards, a Fort Worth-area-based official of the
1.4-million-member United Food &AMP; Commercial Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said that the union has been deluged with calls and
Internet inquiries from angry Wal-Mart employees since the
Arkansas-based retailer announced the decision at a hearing last
week in the East Texas town of Palestine, where 18 seafood workers
and meat-cutters have petitioned for a union vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife hasn't had a good night's sleep since the
announcement,'' said Richard Rogers, whose wife is a seafood worker
at the Wal-Mart in Palestine. ``She is very, very concerned about
the plight of her co-workers and their skills.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 17, seven of 10 Wal-Mart meat-cutters in nearby
Jacksonville voted for union representation. It was the first
successful union vote at a U.S. Wal-Mart and was considered a major
organized labor victory. For decades, the nation's largest retailer
had prevented inroads by unions through its ``open door'' labor
relations policy and stock purchase plans.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said that meat-cutters and mechanics at six Texas
Wal-Marts will similarly petition for a union vote in coming
months. United Food &AMP; Commercial Workers won the right to organize
unions among ``appropriate'' units of skilled workers within a
store last year.
</P>
<P>
   As for the move to change meat-cutters' duties, he said, ``We
feel it is just some kind of scheme to railroad the workers who are
trying to organize.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart spokeswoman Jessica Moser said that the shift from
in-store preparation to prepackaged ``case-ready'' meat reflects a
retail trend and was not aimed at quieting union organizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working on this for several months,'' Moser said
from company headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. ``It had nothing to
do with the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Moser said that meat-cutters will keep their pay scale and be
able to discuss new job preferences. Wal-Mart meat departments in
Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Louisiana and Kansas would be
affected, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The move stems from a pilot project in northeast Arkansas, where
customers preferred prepackaged meat and poultry, the spokeswoman
said. The move will bring no savings in labor costs and no layoffs,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said that meat-cutters, who earn $10-$12 an hour, are
upset because they will be transferred to departments where they
will compete for work hours with co-workers earning less than $7 an
hour. In some stores, ``full time'' may mean less than 30 hours a
week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wal-Mart may have had plans to do this,'' Edwards said of the
transfers. ``But they're doing this much, much quicker because of
the response the union has gotten over the last month or two.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizer said the transfers would likely be piecemeal and
would not affect what unions are formed inside stores.

HAVEL URGES ALBRIGHT TO SEEK CZECH PRESIDENCY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HODONIN, Czech Republic _ On a day devoted to the commemoration
of Czechoslovakia's first democratic president, its second, Vaclav
Havel, pressed Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Monday to
consider succeeding him.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, born in Czechoslovakia and fluent in the language, has
said that she is not interested in the post, elected by parliament,
which Havel holds until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But Havel, organizing a question about her candidacy from Czech
television as she stood next to him, urged her to consider the job,
in what was seen as a commentary on the current state of Czech
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally would consider it excellent because, into this
rather stale provincial environment, this would bring an
international spirit,'' Havel said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright did not respond, but her aides referred journalists to
statements last week in which she said her loyalties were with her
adopted country, the United States, and that she was flattered, but
did not want the job.
</P>
<P>
   Havel, a playwright and dissident, became president of the
post-Soviet Czechoslovakia almost by acclimation in 1989, and he
has been instrumental in bringing the Czech Republic _ formed in
the division of Czechoslovakia in 1993 _ into NATO and other key
Western institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But with the gloomy elegance for which he is known, Havel has
criticized the current crop of Czech politicians, in particular
former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, as unwilling to take on global
or even regional responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Czech population is still ambivalent about NATO
membership and about NATO's war last year in Kosovo, both projects
Havel pushed hard.
</P>
<P>
   Havel thus used Albright's presence here and the reverence for
Tomas Masaryk, the scholar-statesman who presided over the country
from 1918 to 1935 and was married to an American, to urge Czechs to
look to a wider world.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech here at a monument to Masaryk on the 150th
anniversary of his birth, Havel praised the earlier president's
tolerance and humanity, his devotion to freedom and democracy, and
his willingness to defend them, by force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back at Masaryk's legacy,'' he said, ``we inevitably
feel compelled to put to ourselves the unpleasant question whether,
and how vigorously, we are at present capable of defending the
freedoms we enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Albright praised Havel for his own exercise of
international responsibility, most recently in canceling a
$30-million contract between Russia and a Czech company to provide
air-conditioning equipment for a nuclear reactor in Iran that
Washington fears is being used for weapons production.
</P>
<P>
   She said that halting the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a
priority for NATO, and in a speech at Masaryk University in Brno,
said: ``As with any goal worth achieving, it is not without cost.''
To protect sensitive technology, American companies also have had
to forego contracts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   After her speech, two self-described anarchists, both 22, threw
eggs at Albright. Her bodyguards were hit directly, and Albright
received a small spatter.
</P>
<P>
   Before the speech, she met with Roma, or Gypsy, activists and
students, who described the persistent discrimination that faced
them in Czech society and the region. Albright urged them to fight
for their rights and to educate their fellow citizens to reduce
prejudice.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Republicans in California
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A feisty John McCain labeled George W. Bush ``so Clinton-esque
it's scary.'' Both Bush and McCain were making a final push Monday
in California, where 162 delegates to the GOP nominating convention
are the biggest prize of Super Tuesday voting. Bush has the inside
track on those delegates, but McCain is hoping for a symbolic
victory in the nonbinding popular vote. A confident Bush began the
healing process Monday by dismissing the rift between him and
McCain as a minor fracture in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore and Bill Bradley were both in the Big Apple on Monday,
ahead of today's big primary day. Gore was courting Jewish
activists, while Bradley, trying to revive his sagging campaign in
the Super Tuesday contests, greeted commuters in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   EMPHASIS ON FEMALE VOTE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's plan to finish off John McCain has included in
recent days an appeal to women voters that he believes will carry
over to his November showdown with Al Gore. The Washington Times
noted that Bush has placed a renewed emphasis on education, an
issue that rates highly with women, and that Elizabeth Dole has
been especially prominent on the campaign trail for Bush in the
past five days.
</P>
<P>
   SUPER LEAD IN `SUPERDELEGATES'
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has pledges of support from more than 400
``superdelegates,'' the Democratic Party leaders and elected
officials who will help choose a nominee at this summer's national
convention, according to The Associated Press. The support gives
Gore a big jump toward the 2,170 delegates needed to seal the
nomination. Gore has won 42 delegates in presidential contests so
far and is sure to pick up more in Tuesday's primaries. His
delegate count dwarfs that of rival Bill Bradley, who has won no
delegates in contests and just 27 superdelegates in the AP's
survey. On Tuesday, 1,315 Democratic delegates are at stake in
contests in 15 states and American Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   COULD MCCAIN PULL OUT WASHINGTON IN OVERTIME?
</P>
<P>
   Long after the media reported a win for George W. Bush in
Washington state's Feb. 29 primary, the laborious counting of
hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots is showing that Bush
might not be the winner there after all. The online magazine Salon
reports that as of Saturday, Bush led John McCain by fewer than
7,000 votes _ 351,881 to 344,933 _ with roughly 20 percent of the
ballots still to be counted.'' Salon notes that more than half of
the 188,000 absentee ballots that remain come from King County
(Seattle), where McCain led 32 percent to 26 percent. If that
pattern holds in the ballots yet to be counted, McCain could easily
overtake Bush.
</P>
<P>
   OH YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, HE USED TO PLAY BALL
</P>
<P>
   In an ad broadcast in New York only, Bill Bradley's campaign has
teamed up two quintessential New Yorkers, former Mayor Ed Koch and
film director Spike Lee, who's a renowned Knicks fan. The two men
try to top each other with assertions about what a great guy
Bradley is. Lee punctuates the point by taking a faux jump shot
that seems to remind any voter who may have forgotten that among
Bradley's achievements is his pro basketball career with the New
York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD TO THE END GAMES
</P>
<P>
   While the two underdogs are expressing confidence as they make
the TV talk show rounds, their aides are bracing for the worst by
quietly making plans for dignified exits. Bill Bradley's advisers
acknowledge he has little chance of loosening Al Gore's grip on
Super Tuesday states. John McCain's team was holding out hope for
an election night surprise. McCain, asked what was in store if he
fared poorly, replied, ``A happy life.''
</P>
<P>
   SHAKING THE MONEY TREE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush or his surrogates will return to the fund-raising
circuit this month to replenish coffers drained by heavy spending.
Bush finance chairman Don Evans said the plan all along had been to
raise more money, but acknowledged it was made more necessary
because of the unexpectedly strong challenge mounted by John
McCain. The campaign has scheduled five fund-raisers for March and
April, and is considering five to seven more, with a goal of
raising $5 million to $10 million, Evans said. The events already
scheduled will be in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   BARKING UP THE MONEY TREE
</P>
<P>
   Turning his sights on the Republicans, Al Gore criticized George
W. Bush on campaign finance issues, saying he was flooding the
campaign with ``soft money,'' and suggested at a senior citizens
forum in Cranston, R.I., that if Bush wins the Republican
nomination, he might not have won it fairly. Gore raised those
themes for the first time Sunday in Rhode Island, and repeated them
Sunday night in New York in an appearance with Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING PRETTY CLOSE TO FINALITY
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, so insistent that he takes nothing for granted, slipped
and called Super Tuesday ``this final, er, semi-final uh, uh
contest.'' The stumble lays bare what he has tried to convey in
code _ looking ahead to November, he's now reaching out to Bill
Bradley. Gore road-tested an evolving, new stump speech aimed at
more moderate voters than those he had targeted against Bradley.
Aides said Gore hoped to debut the speech in Nashville, Tenn.,
tonight as results come in from 15 states, where polls give Gore
commanding leads.
</P>
<P>
   NO FINALITY YET FOR KEYES
</P>
<P>
   Last place in the GOP race for the presidential nomination has
not dissuaded Alan Keyes from taking his fight all the way to the
party convention in Philadelphia. Speaking to about 150 people at
St. Louis University, Keyes said he is keeping his campaign going
with the help of small donors. Keyes: ``They're energized at the
thought that I'm not going to stop.'' Even though Keyes supporters
are few in number, they ``open their wallets enough for him to
continue,'' according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   LOYALTY TO A FRIEND REMEMBERED
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Tempe, Ariz., is impressed with John McCain's
loyalty. Neil Giuliano, facing a threat that his homosexuality
would be exposed by Christian conservatives at a city council
meeting, did what he thought was nobody's business: He held a news
conference and declared, ``I happen to be gay.'' The reaction of
Arizona's senior senator, McCain, was swift and angry. ``John was
the first to tell the religious right, `This doesn't make a damned
bit of difference,' '' Giuliano said, remembering how McCain went
out of his way to call him a good mayor and a great friend.
``Politically in Arizona, McCain should have done just the
opposite. Instead, he came right to my defense. He's a loyal
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   TIED IN KNOTS OVER MARRIAGE
</P>
<P>
   When Californians choose between Al Gore, Bill Bradley and John
McCain and George W. Bush today, they also will decide whether the
state will validate gay marriages. Of the 20 propositions on the
ballot _ dealing with a slew of social and economic issues _
Proposition 22 is generating the most heat. It declares that only
marriages between men and women are legally valid. ``It's been a
more quiet campaign, but we certainly have a lot of action over
Proposition 22,'' said Stanley Moore, a political science professor
at Pepperdine University.
</P>
<P>
   SO LONG AS THEY DON'T THROW IRISH CONFETTI
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton celebrated St. Patrick's Day several days
early _ and got an early idea of how rough-and-tumble New York
politics can become. Clinton went from Riverside Church in
Manhattan, where she was repeatedly applauded for calling for
better police-community relations, to a St. Patrick's Day parade in
Queens, where she was alternately heckled and admired. Most of the
onlookers clapped and cheered, with some of them holding signs
saying ``Irish-Americans for Hillary.'' But anti-Hillary shouts
could be heard, like ``Go back to Arkansas, carpetbagger!''

<P>
   Three weeks after Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura abandoned the
Reform Party over a dispute about the party's presidential
candidate, the party's Minnesota branch split from the national
organization, cementing the internal divisions that left the party
in shambles. ``If we don't leave the national party, we will have
no honor, and we will doom ourselves to failure,'' said state party
chairman Dean Barkeley during a meeting in St. Paul.

3 OFFICERS CONVICTED OF CONSPIRACY IN POLICE TORTURE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By EDWARD WONG and ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two New York City policemen and one former officer
were convicted Monday of covering up the brutal assault on Abner
Louima, a Haitian immigrant, in an emotional verdict that the
defendants' lawyers and families vowed through tears to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants _ Charles Schwarz, Thomas Wiese and Thomas
Bruder _ each were found guilty in federal District Court in
Brooklyn of obstructing justice by conspiring to manufacture a
story for authorities that Schwarz was not involved in the attack
on Louima in the bathroom of a Brooklyn station house in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The horrible details of the assault, in which a police officer
beat and sodomized Louima with a broken broomstick, had been fully
aired at a trial last year. Monday's verdicts spoke to the systemic
problem of whether police officers and officials of the policeman's
union lied to protect their brethren rather than the citizens they
were sworn to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns also were raised in the recent testimony of four
New York police officers who were charged in the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo, a 21-year-old Guinean immigrant, in the Bronx last
February. The officers were acquitted last month of all charges,
which included second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   In the Louima case, Schwarz was convicted in June of violating
the victim's civil rights by pinning him down on the bathroom floor
while another officer, Justin Volpe, sodomized him. Volpe pleaded
guilty to attacking Louima and is serving 30 years in prison.
Schwarz, who has been in custody, faces a possible life sentence
for that conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In the second trial that ended Monday, jurors were not directly
asked to consider whether Schwarz was, in fact, involved in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the government argued in the monthlong trial that
Schwarz pinned Louima to the floor while he was tortured, and then
lied about his role with the help of Bruder and Wiese. The defense,
which said it would appeal Monday's verdict, claimed there had been
no plot to exculpate Schwarz because he was innocent from the
start. The three officers seemed stunned to the point of hysteria
Monday each time the jury forewoman pronounced the word ``guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruder, the first to be convicted, grabbed his neck, squinting
in disbelief, before laying his head on the shoulder of his lawyer,
Stuart London, and bursting into tears.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz sat back in shock when his verdict was read, then
glanced angrily around the courtroom, from his lawyers to his
family to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   After Wiese heard his verdict, he and Bruder met in a tearful
embrace, gripping each other's heads. Moments later, outside the
courtroom, Wiese's mother collapsed to the floor and Wiese dropped
to his knees to cradle her in his arms. ``Get a nurse!'' someone
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder paced the hallway amid a crowd of family and friends,
crying openly and calling out: ``You tell the truth and this is
what happens!''
</P>
<P>
   Andra Schwarz, Schwarz's wife, who has been working to appeal
her husband's earlier conviction, promised to fight Monday's
verdict as well. ``The prosecutors were not seeking the truth,''
she said, in a voice stony with fatigue and disbelief. ``They just
want a conviction. I'm fed up. We're not going to let them get away
with this.''
</P>
<P>
   As he was led out of the courtroom, Schwarz cursed and yelled,
``Why did they do this!'' His lawyer, Ronald Fischetti, said the
ex-officer was ``absolutely devastated.'' He added that he had
asked the authorities to place Schwarz on a 24-hour suicide watch.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants face up to 5 years in prison for Monday's
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Louima was not in the courtroom when the verdict was read, but a
lawyer, Sanford Rubenstein, representing the Louima family, issued
a statement: ``I hope that as a result of today's verdict, a
message will be sent to police officers all over the country that
they will be held accountable if and when they obstruct justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Diallo trial, in which the white defendants killed a
black man, both of the Louima trials have raised questions of
racial bias within the police department. Volpe and the three
defendants in the Louima case are white, while Louima is black.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers in the Louima case suggested that the Diallo
case influenced Monday's verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to ignore the post-Diallo anti-jury sentiment,''
London, Bruder's attorney, said. He added that there were cases in
which juries had made mistakes, and that this was one.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the government faced a daunting task in proving
there was a conspiracy to lie because conspiracies are, by nature,
crimes of secrecy. Although the prosecution introduced reams of
telephone records showing that the defendants spoke with each other
in a blizzard of calls in the days after the assault _ sometimes
only minutes apart _ there were no tapes of the conversations and
no ironclad way to know what was being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of hard evidence, the jury was left with a case
of inferences: Were the defendants joining forces on the phone to
concoct stories, as the government claimed? Or were the three
officers, who had subdued Louima on the street, calling each other
for moral support, discussing his hospitalization and the chance
that they might face repercussions for having injured their
prisoner during the arrest, as the defense maintained?
</P>
<P>
   The lack of concrete evidence also left the jury with the
difficult job of determining the credibility of a parade of
witnesses, many of whom have now testified so many times _ at two
grand juries, two trials and before a host of investigative
agencies _ that it was easy for lawyers on both sides to trip them
up with their own words.
</P>
<P>
   Louima, the first witness to appear, was grilled by the defense
about crucial instances where his account of the attack changed
over time. In his first interview with the police, Louima said his
pants and underwear were pulled down only after he was taken into
the bathroom. Later, however, he said he was led through the
station house with his buttocks and genitals exposed.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to contradicting testimony there also were
several instances where witnesses told their versions of the events
of Aug. 9, 1997, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In a display of raw emotion, Volpe, subpoenaed from prison to
testify, gave his first detailed account of the night of Aug. 9,
1997. He described how he thought he had been punched by Louima on
the street and then, in a tense stand-off in the stationhouse
bathroom, had demanded an apology several times before throwing the
prisoner to the ground and sodomizing him.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack, Louima spent two months in the hospital
recovering from internal injuries that included a ruptured bladder
and colon.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, too, took the witness stand for the first time in more
than 2-and-a-half years of court proceedings and offered an alibi
that had never been heard before. He said he was outside the
station house as the attack occurred, conducting a routine search
of his patrol car for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bruder and Wiese did not take the stand, their stories
were revealed through the testimony of the government investigators
who interviewed them. According to former Deputy Inspector James
Burns, Wiese said he walked into the bathroom moments after the
attack and discovered Volpe brandishing a feces-stained stick with
Louima sobbing at his feet. Bruder told investigators that he saw
Volpe escorting Louima into the bathroom while Wiese was standing
outside the bathroom door playing with the station house mutt,
Midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder and Wiese, each free on $100,000 bail, still face
departmental charges. And all three defendants are named along with
the city, the Police Department and the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association in a $155 million civil lawsuit filed by Louima.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's conviction, Wiese also might have to answer for
charges raised by Volpe on the stand that he was present in the
bathroom throughout the attack on Louima but did nothing.

`CARE OF THE SOUL' AUTHOR THOMAS MOORE SUGGESTS WAYS TO SAVE SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN JENKINS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MAY MISSED THIS /  &UR; ALSO MOVING IN
THE ``L'' CATEGORY)
</P>
<P>
   In the Western world, a hard-and-fast line often is drawn
between the sacred and secular. But to be true to the soul's
nature, says author Thomas Moore, one must integrate the two _ and
learn to live life on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, whose ``Care of the Soul'' spent months on the ``New York
Times'' bestseller list, expands upon the spiritual principles laid
out in this 1992 book and subsequent ones in ``Original Self:
Living with Paradox and Originality'' (HarperCollins, $22). Moore
and his wife, Joan Hanley, whose woodcut drawings supplement the
essays in ``Original Self,'' are making a nationwide book tour.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 59, spent 12 years as a Roman Catholic monk. Living in a
Servite order, which was both contemplative and active, he learned
theological and philosophical truths that influence his writings
about the loss of ``soul'' in our culture. One of the most crucial
lessons he took from that time was ``the importance of living a
contemplative life, having time to be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way to give a little bit of time each day to
contemplation,'' he says. ``If you have that kind of experience, it
can make a crucial difference in the way you live in your active
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He says today's anxious, materialism-obsessed society could take
a page from ancient pagan religion, which took a holistic,
Earth-based approach to all facets of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we imagine the religious or spiritual life in limited ways,
the trouble is all these issues left to the secular world aren't
treated deeply enough,'' Moore says. ``The pagans had a lot of
problems, but one thing they did do right was (knowing) that every
aspect of a person's life has religious and spiritual dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as work. &QL; 
CROSSOVER ROOTS
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to assume it's a secular part of our lives,'' Moore
says, ``that it has nothing to do with our spiritual lives. Both
individually and socially, the difficulties we run into run so deep
they eventually cross over into a religious or spiritual dimension.
We have to begin realizing that everything has these deep roots and
all have some theological roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to think deeply enough, we need to be theologians in our
own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Original Self's'' essays address human personality _ and the
importance of passion, memory, living in the moment. Even the need
to own our neuroses and failures as unique qualities that make us
who we are. When perfection becomes the goal, much of life's
originality gets lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it,'' Moore says, it's about ``the faith in
oneself and trusting that life is offering what you need to live,
and take it on with such gusto that you can make mistakes. And
that's what I mean by original _ it takes a great deal of faith in
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore started writing the pieces that would eventually compose
``Original'' ``Se''lf over a year ago, finding quotes from his
favorite writers and expounding on them. His wife then read each
essay and created ``woodcuts in her own way that represented the
theme of each piece.''  &QL; 
KEY CONNECTIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Working as a psychotherapist for nearly 20 years, Moore says
that ``dealing with people's lives in tense situations'' helped him
clarify the themes he now writes and speaks about. He felt that
part of his job as a therapist was to help patients see the
connection between faith in a spiritual, as well as practical, way.
Being confident in themselves _ as well as trusting in some power
greater than themselves _ was key.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not separate at all,'' he says. ``It's a part of the
whole story. If you can just carry that faith forward, you don't
have to be paranoid. And beyond that, you can have faith that life
is worth living. It's seamless, as far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue is to have the faith (to) live your life so that
you don't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one major fault of our full-speed-ahead, Type A society,
he says. People are so obsessed with trying to master their fates,
to somehow reach perfection, that they fail to take ``generous
participation in the concrete life we're given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of people who are realizing (that
being) a spiritual person is to be more tolerant of yourself and
others,'' Moore says.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he says, ``the word `perfect' means to complete, not
to be without mistake or error or fault.'' &QL; 
FEAR-BASED RELIGION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in some ways, Moore says, organized religion and its
concrete ``thou shalt not'' rules are partially to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of religion is based on fear, and that we should be
perfect,'' he says. ``It's a fear of letting life happen. I think
there's a profound lack of faith in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's only through releasing control that life gets
lived with passion and balance.
</P>
<P>
   As Moore writes in ``Original Self,'' ``. . . We pride ourselves
on our freshly won intelligence, while religion teaches the value
of holy ignorance. There is a thickheaded form of not knowing, from
not having reflected or thought, and an inspired way, being
sufficiently educated that we realize how absurdly little we know.
The former is plain ignorance, the latter verges on the sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   In his writings, Moore includes tenets and quotes from Daoism,
from Buddhism, from Christian mystic traditions, showing readers
that ``letting go'' is a common thread woven through most of the
world's faith traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't know everything,'' he says. ``In this Information
Age, it's hard to imagine this. What we have to do is become smart
enough to realize we're never going to know the context in which we
live. To me, that's opening the door to true faith.'' &QL; 
SECURE IN HIS BELIEFS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of his books' popularity, Moore often is invited to
speak at churches. He's talked to Catholics, Episcopalians,
Unitarian Universalists, and others. He's comfortable speaking to
churchgoers from ministers' pulpits, yet feels equally secure
addressing folks who ``hate church'' and organized religion,
because both audiences can relate to the spiritual nature of his
writings.
</P>
<P>
   The author of 10 books, Moore next will deal with deepening
one's spiritual life by ``connecting the spiritual with the
emotional, and tying together things pulled apart.''
</P>
<P>
   After that book is completed, Moore and his family will move to
Ireland while he writes about the richness of that country's
culture. He says travelers are drawn to Ireland not just for its
residents' trademark humor, music and storytelling, but because the
Irish have managed to syncretize strong Catholic faith with an
earthy, Celtic spirituality that's survived the centuries. He hopes
to show readers that it's possible to live in today's modern world
while retaining values that shape close-knit communities.
</P>
<P>
   Which gets back to that premise of linking the sacred and
secular in everyday life. It's not just a message Moore preaches,
but one he himself lives out, whether walking on the beach with his
family, cooking a meal or visiting with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best meditation for me is playing the piano every
morning,'' he says. ``My work is so caught up in religion, and I
don't see any separation between my spiritual life and my work. I
feel a certain call from the world to `come out here and talk to
us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, if you're living a real spiritual life, you're living a
real full secular life. If you can (tell the difference), you're in
trouble.'' &QL; Reach the reporter at maureen.jenkins(at)arizonarepub

 &HT;    First female to lead black cardiologists
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Overjoyed is how Dr. Elisabeth Ofili reacted when
elected the first woman president of the Association of Black
Cardiologists, a 700-member international organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped up and down. Then, I said, `What have I done?'''
laughed Ofili, 44, chief cardiologist at Morehouse School of
Medicine, who already juggles her marriage, four children, academic
and medical careers, and faith and volunteer activities. She will
be officially named president this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC, based in Atlanta, was formed in 1974 to draw attention
to the statistics on stroke and heart disease among blacks and to
promote prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Ofili was born in Nigeria, to a father who was a U.S.
Information Service librarian and a mother who worked as a nurse
and raised seven children. Ofili received her medical degree in
Nigeria and a master's of public health in the United States, then
completed medical residencies in internal medicine and cardiology.
</P>
<P>
   She will oversee the ABC's goal of starting an international
resource center for cardiovascular disease in Atlanta. She also
wants to keep getting out the basic message on heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surveys show African-Americans have less knowledge in terms of
risk factors,'' Ofili said. ``And they're not as aware of their own
numbers, such as their cholesterol levels.''
</P>
<P>

Cardiologists, call 678-302-4222 or go to www.abcardio.org.

 &HT;    Medical panel: More focus on equal treatment
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lack of health insurance and low income-status are oft-heard
explanations for the disparity between blacks and whites when it
comes to health care access and disease death rates.
</P>
<P>
   But even when economics and insurance are equal, treatment is
often still unequal, concludes a Morehouse School of
Medicine/Kasier Family Foundation report.
</P>
<P>
   Morehouse convened a gathering of Georgia's leading medical
researchers, doctors, public health leaders and managed-care
executives Friday to respond to the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to understand the `why' is the next step,'' said Dr.
Lawrence Sanders, director of clinical medicine at Morehouse.
``We've got to connect this research to the people who live in the
communities who best know how to deliver the services they need.
The national goal is to end this disparity by the year 2010. But I
personally think it will take until the end of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mayberry, author of the report and director of the
Morehouse Medical Treatment Effectiveness Center, noted some
improvements, such as in the likelihood of young black women
getting screening for breast and ovarian cancer. ``But older women
are still not being reached,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the report's findings:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The largest disparity continues to be in the most vital of
organs _ the heart _ which helps explain why African-Americans are
twice as likely to die of cardiovascular disease than whites.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Blacks are 13 percent to 40 percent less likely to receive
coronary angioplasty than whites and 32 percent to 70 percent less
likely to have bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Race was the biggest predictor of treatment of AIDS or HIV
patients. Blacks are 41 percent to 73 percent less likely than
whites to receive expensive and effective drug therapies.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Diabetes care was seen as most equitable; however, it has not
been as scrutinized as other health conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the review of hundreds of research studies conducted
nationwide since 1985, the Morehouse report is the most
comprehensive, up-to-date picture of health disparity in America,
said Dr. John Eisenberg, head of the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality. The watch-dog federal agency is leading President
Clinton's attack on the 98,000 annual deaths caused by doctor
errors.
</P>
<P>
   After three hours of hearing from the expert panel, Eisenberg
wrapped up the discussion, saying ``If this were a disease, we'd be
at the stage of describing what the problem is. We'd be asking,
`Why does this occur? What are the mechanics, causes?' ... Let's
find the remedies. Let's put them in place and let's disseminate
the knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kathleen Toomey, director of Georgia Division of Public
Health, cautioned that many times applying the most obvious
solution won't work. ``In public health, we often think all we need
to do is change health access, and we will improve their health
status. It's the `If we build a clinic, they will come,' theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we've learned they may or may not come and we may or may
not improve their health status at all,'' she said.

 &HT;    Get allergy alert at Pollen.com
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trees are blooming. Bushes are budding. For a certain percentage
of the population, the signs of spring provoke a pressing question:
``Is it safe to go out of the house?''
</P>
<P>
   A newly launched Web site hopes to make spring and fall a little
easier for allergy sufferers. Using your ZIP code, Pollen.com
generates a free local forecast of probable pollen counts for the
next four days. It classifies the days in the forecast as low,
medium or high risk, and lists the plants most likely to be
releasing pollen for the length of the forecast. (Last week, for
instance, it ranked Decatur's Courthouse Square as medium-to-high
risk, with maple, alder and cedar tree pollen causing the most
trouble.) If you register _ which is not required to obtain a
four-day forecast _ Pollen.com will also send you e-mail alerts
warning when certain types of pollen are expected to reach
troublesome levels locally.
</P>
<P>
   The site is the creation of a Pennsylvania company called
Surveillance Data Inc., a private research concern whose
subsidiaries specialize in environmental modeling and manufacture
pollen-counting equipment. The company claims that its proprietary
computer models put the site's usefulness ahead of similar ones
such as the very informative National Allergy Bureau
(www.aaaai.org/nab/default.stm), which reports pollen counts but
does not predict them. Relatively new, Pollen.com has an
uncomplicated design, offers several links to allergy information
sites and is refreshingly free of advertising.

 &HT;    Locally and globally, hospital infections a big global concern
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Melanie Dodd's patient needed a dressing changed.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like an uncomplicated task: Remove an adhesive-edged
bandage from an elderly man's upper chest, where it covered a
catheter sewn into a blood vessel, and put on a new one.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quite that simple. Moving around the private room, the
27-year-old nurse ran through a precise checklist: 15 steps to
clean the skin and change the dressing, including donning a sterile
mask, washing hands twice and wearing three pairs of gloves.
</P>
<P>
   From the doorway, Maureen Forier _ nurse-manager of Emory
University Hospital's 6G Intensive Care Unit and Dodd's supervisor
_ shook her head. She has been a nurse for 23 years; Dodd, for
five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, you would walk into a patient's room, say hello and
shake hands,'' Forier said. ``Now we're trained to go to the sink
first. We think about the potential for infection in everything we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years between Forier's first nursing experiences and
Dodd's, health care has faced an uncomfortable truth: Infections
that are acquired during a hospital stay make some patients sicker
than they were before they entered the hospital and can endanger
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 2 million Americans each year _ one in 20 of all those
admitted to hospitals _ contract such infections, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The infections kill
almost 90,000 patients and cost an additional $5 billion each year
to treat.
</P>
<P>
   This week the CDC has organized an international scientific
meeting in Atlanta _ the first in a decade _ to examine the problem
of infections acquired by patients (called ``nosocomial,'' from the
Greek word for hospital). Experts attending the conference say the
news is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This truly has international attention,'' said Dr. John
McGowan, a former CDC scientist now teaching at Emory's Rollins
School of Public Health. ``People around the world realize that
this is an issue they need to address, even if they have relatively
limited resources.''
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, researchers arriving for the conference were
met by good news: The CDC announced Thursday that 300 U.S.
hospitals participating in a 10-year pilot program had reduced
rates of certain infections by at least one-third.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the attendees faced abundant bad news. More
than 600 scientific papers were submitted in advance, many of them
detailing the advance of the so-called ``superbugs'' _ disease
organisms that have developed resistance to many of the drugs used
against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antimicrobial resistance is a huge problem, and it is only
getting worse,'' said Dr. James Steinberg, who tracks the results
of infection control programs at Crawford Long Hospital.
``Globally, it is one of the major challenges we face.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the infections contracted in health-care settings are
not caused by drug-resistant pathogens, though their proportion is
growing. Nosocomial infections don't have to be caused by superbugs
to be troublesome: They can arise from a flu virus coughed out by a
visitor and inhaled by a patient, or a bacteria that lives
harmlessly on intact skin but slips into a surgical wound. Managed
care's emphasis on moving mildly ill patients to outpatient care
has left hospitals handling a generally sicker population than in
the past, and improved technology has increased treatment options
for the very sick. The result has been a patient population for
whom any additional infection can have dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our patients are more ill, we generally have more patients and
less time, and our environment is characterized by more procedures
and more invasive devices,'' summed up Dr. Julie Gerberding,
director of CDC's Hospital Infections Program. ``Our patients are
more at risk. And so preventing infections is more challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that danger has led, in many health-care
institutions, to an array of preventive steps. In the Emory system,
placards listing standard infection precautions _ procedures for
handling needles and linens, and requirements for wearing gloves,
gowns, eye-shields and masks _ are displayed at every nurses'
station. All personnel, down to the parking valets, are offered
vaccinations and protective devices. Each patient's room includes
protective containers for contaminated materials and needles, and
is stocked with disinfectants and boxes of gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a staff nurse, we never used to wear gloves, even
to do all kinds of nasty things,'' said Betsy Hackman, who is now
director of infection control for Crawford Long and Emory
University hospitals. ``It wouldn't have occurred to us. But also,
they wouldn't have been available.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the emphasis on prevention, combating nosocomial
infections is an ongoing battle: CDC research has found that,
though up to 30 percent of potential infections could be prevented,
only 6 percent to 9 percent actually are. Some additional studies
of hand-washing by health care workers, the most basic act of
infection control, put their willingness to wash hands as often and
as long as required at less than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In part, researchers say, it's a question of perceived risk. The
gloves, masks and eye protection required by ``universal
precautions'' _ the AIDS-inspired recommendation, dating back to
the 1980s, that all body fluids be treated as potentially hazardous
_ were adopted relatively quickly by doctors, nurses and other
health care personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of universal precautions was protecting the health
worker,'' said Dr. Henry Blumberg, hospital epidemiologist for
Grady Memorial Hospital. ``Washing hands is for the benefit of your
patients, so that you don't transmit any organism from one to
another. In that situation, a health care worker is unlikely to get
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some experts say, the same industry conditions that put
patients at greater risk of nosocomial infections _ sicker patients
and tighter schedules _ also make it more difficult for health care
workers to avoid transmitting the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patient safety and patient protection are part of our culture
_ but if the patient is in the middle of a crisis, you don't
necessarily deem it appropriate to run away and wash your hands,''
said the CDC's Gerberding. ``It's a question of competing
priorities, and it causes trouble across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Local hospitals such as those in the Emory system coach their
personnel in the necessity of infection control, usually through
formal trainings at least once a year. They also try to educate
their patients; Crawford Long, for instance, gives brochures to
newly admitted patients that explain why nurses and technicians may
be wearing gowns, goggles or masks.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the infection-control measures protect the
individual patients who are vulnerable to hospital-acquired
infections for the days, weeks or months they spend in the
institutions. Behind that goal, though, there is a second one. No
one in health care wants to be responsible for encouraging the
spread of drug-resistant organisms, which thrive in hospitals and
among the sickest patients, and which threaten to return medicine
to the days before antibiotics. The most formidable drug-resistant
bug yet recognized _ Staphylococcus aureus that has become
partially resistant to the last-ditch antibiotic vancomycin _ has
surfaced four times in the United States in the past three years,
each time in a patient already under treatment in a health care
institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I know what's coming, if we don't get Staph aureus
under control, and I don't like it,'' said Hackman, Emory's
director of infection control. ``It would change my life as I know
it if we had to deal with that.''

 &HT;    Protect yourself
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What can patients or family members do to protect themselves
against infections acquired in medical settings? Dr. Julie
Gerberding, director of the Hospital Infections Program at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends these steps:
</P>
<P>
   IN THE HOSPITAL
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask the nurse or physician if they have washed their hands.
``It's not an easy thing to do, but it is possible to be your own
advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ask whether intravenous lines, catheters or tubes are still
necessary. ``These devices are essential to taking care of a
patient, but sometimes they can be used longer than needed. Asking
`Do I still need this IV?' can save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   IN DAILY LIFE
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't demand antibiotics when they won't be useful _ for
example, to treat a virus. ``The physician is not recommending
against antibiotics because they are trying to save money or get
you out of the office faster, but because they have a genuine
concern about antibiotic resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure children and adults have all their recommended
vaccinations. ``Flu shots and pneumococcal vaccine for adults can
prevent problems and complications that would require antibiotics
to treat.''

``AS NATURE MADE HIM'' &QL; 
By John Colapinto (HarperCollins, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've probably heard about this book on television magazine and
talk shows, but until you read what happened to Bruce Reimer on
April 7, 1966, you won't understand the staggering trauma he
endured. On that day, Bruce and his twin brother, Brian, were set
to undergo routine circumcisions in the Canadian hospital where
they had been born eight months earlier. Bruce went first. Doctors
never got to Brian. Instead, their young parents were told that
there had been an ``accident'' during Bruce's procedure _ the
circumcision had been botched, his genitals were all but destroyed
and the family was left to make wrenching decisions in an era of
little knowledge and few options. In desperation, they consulted a
sex researcher at Johns Hopkins Hospital, who advised them to
``reassign'' their son as a girl, mentally and physically. So,
Bruce was castrated and raised as a girl _ Brenda _ until she was
14 and, in the book's most moving scene, finally told what had
happened to her. This is a chilling story about the power of
nature. If you have a baby boy in your house, you will want to grab
him and run for the hills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE WORKSHOP: SEVEN DECADES OF THE IOWA WRITERS' WORKSHOP'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Edited by Tom Grimes (Hyperion, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's some great fiction here, but we fell for the
introductions, the brief lead-in to each story written by the
writer or, in the case of Flannery O'Connor, Wallace Stegner, Andre
Dubus, Raymond Carver or others no longer living, by a
contemporary. Michael Cunningham, for example, tells the publishing
history of his story ``White Angel'' (an early chapter in his
novel, ``A Home at the End of the World''). He had sent many
stories to ``The New Yorker'' to no avail, but a friend insisted
that he try again with ``White Angel.'' To his astonishment, the
magazine said yes, and the story's appearance in 1988 made, he
says, ``more difference than I'd ever imagined,'' with a dozen
editors calling to ask whether they could have a chance at his
first novel. The stories are arranged chronologically, with Stegner
in the 1930s; writers such as Elizabeth McCracken and Buddy Udall
in the 1990s; and Ethan Canin, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Jayne Anne
Phillips, Stuart Dybek, Thom Jones, John Casey and others in
between. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``SHRUB'' &QL; 
By Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose (Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We'd buy this one just for the title. In the introduction, Ivins
shifts to her other nickname for George W. Bush _ ``Dubya'' _ which
is good, too. Her book, subtitled ``The Short but Happy Political
Life of George W. Bush,'' is written from a Texan's point of view,
which is helpful because Dubya promises to do for the country what
he did for the state. Ivins and Dubose (editor of ``The Texas
Observer'') try to portray the candidate as he really is:
privileged, personable, unintellectual and most of all, LUCKY. For
one thing, he inherited a healthy Texas from Ann Richards, his
predecessor in the Governor's Office. Then there is his father.
``The political career of W. Bush is a fairly funny yarn,'' the
authors write, ``on account of being the son of a former president
is not . . . actually sufficient job training for the governance of
a large state. Fortunately, in Texas, this makes no difference.''
If you think that Bush's record is different from his rhetoric, and
that his resume is, as Ivins puts it, ``a little light,'' don't
blame her. ``There's really not much there,'' she says. ``We've
been looking for six years.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``DISH'' &QL; 
By Jeannette Walls (Spike, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walls looks at our fascination with gossip, beginning with the
columns of Walter Winchell in the 1920s and the gossip reporters
who subsequently became some of the most influential journalists of
the midcentury, and ending with the notorious events of recent
years _ the O.J. Simpson trial; the death of Diana, Princess of
Wales; Matt Drudge's theft of ``Newsweek'' information to scoop the
world on the Clinton/Lewinsky affair. Also here are miniprofiles of
former ``Vanity Fair'' and ``New Yorker'' Editor Tina Brown;
powerful Hollywood publicist Pat Kingsley (who redefined the term
``star access'' with her belligerence toward reporters seeking
interviews with client Tom Cruise); and Mike Wallace, who jumped
into the gossip cauldron with his 1956 program, ``Night Beat.'' In
the process of reporting all of this, Walls herself panders to the
gossip mill with mention of rumors of Cruise's homosexuality and
John and Robert Kennedy's simultaneous affairs with Marilyn Monroe.
Best of all, she provides an index. You can choose your own gossip,
and leave the rest to the tabloids. &QL;

 &HT;    Grisham sells _ in a monthly, too
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   His legal thrillers still sell in the millions, but John Grisham
is getting more enthusiastic responses to his serialized novel ``A
Painted House.'' The second installment of the six-part novel about
young Luke Chandler's adventurous summer in 1950s Arkansas appears
this month in The Oxford American ($5.95). As the story resumes,
the boy is questioned about a brutal fight among three of the
town's bullies and one of his father's migrant workers _ a fight
that resulted in a death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is one of John's best works,'' says Oxford
American editor Marc Smirnoff. ``People are going ga-ga over it,
and Stephen King called to say how much he liked it.'' Smirnoff
attributes the positive reaction to the fact that the semi-autobio-
</P>
<P>
   graphical novel is one of the most personal things Grisham has
written. ``Even though there aren't any lawyers in it, it reads
like a thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   The public response has translated into some big numbers for the
magazine, which, incidentally, is financed by Grisham. Sales have
soared from 50,000 to nearly 230,000 copies, Smirnoff says, and
readers who missed the first installment can order back issues by
e-mail: oxam(at)watervalley
</P>
<P>
   .net. The series eventually will become a book, Smirnoff says,
but no publication date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Star treatment: Newsweek ($3.50) gushes over Julia Roberts in
an eight-page spread on the $20 million woman. Roberts talks about
her new movie, ``Erin Brockovich''; her new love, actor Benjamin
Bratt; and admits that she has been estranged from her brother,
Eric Roberts, for years. In a sidebar, Donna Foote writes about the
real Erin Brockovich, a legal investigator who helped win a $333
million lawsuit against Pacific Gas and Electric for chromium VI
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On the pill: When John Rock and his colleagues developed the
birth control pill, they included a placebo or ``off'' week
allowing women to menstruate at the rate the researchers considered
normal. What Rock didn't take into account, says New Yorker ($3)
writer Malcolm Gladwell, was the possibility that Western women
were menstruating at much higher rates than women historically.
Those rates have resulted in a higher incidence of breast cancer,
Gladwell writes, and have led one researcher to advocate a new
birth control nasal spray that would reduce both the number of
periods and the risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Katie's crusade: In more health news, Time ($3.50) features
``Today'' show host Katie Couric in a cover story on colon cancer.
Couric, whose husband died of the disease two weeks after his 42nd
birthday, is hosting a five-day series this week on the morning TV
show to draw attention to the cancer and suggest ways of preventing
it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Split decision: The music and youth culture magazine Spin
($3.99) marks its 15th anniversary this month with four covers from
the past. Newsstand buyers can choose among the 1985 Madonna, the
1987 Beastie Boys, the 1993 Nirvana and the 1997 cover of the
Notorious B.I.G. The issue also looks back at a decade and a half
of musical history, from metalheads to B-boys.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Atlanta is the ninth most wired city, according
to Yahoo! ($3.50). San Francisco remains at the top for the third
straight year, followed by Washington; San Jose, Calif.; Austin,
Texas; Seattle; San Diego; Boston and Dallas. ... Of all the roles
Madonna has played, that of mother would seem to be the biggest
stretch. Not so, the star of ``The Next Best Thing'' tells People
($2.99). ``I'm going to be the mother I never had,'' she says.

happened to her. This is a chilling story about the power of
nature. If you have a baby boy in your house, you will want to grab
him and run for the hills. &QL;

   ``THE WORKSHOP: SEVEN DECADES OF THE IOWA WRITERS' WORKSHOP'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Edited by Tom Grimes (Hyperion, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's some great fiction here, but we fell for the
introductions, the brief lead-in to each story written by the
writer or, in the case of Flannery O'Connor, Wallace Stegner, Andre
Dubus, Raymond Carver or others no longer living, by a
contemporary. Michael Cunningham, for example, tells the publishing
history of his story ``White Angel'' (an early chapter in his
novel, ``A Home at the End of the World''). He had sent many
stories to ``The New Yorker'' to no avail, but a friend insisted
that he try again with ``White Angel.'' To his astonishment, the
magazine said yes, and the story's appearance in 1988 made, he
says, ``more difference than I'd ever imagined,'' with a dozen
editors calling to ask whether they could have a chance at his
first novel. The stories are arranged chronologically, with Stegner
in the 1930s; writers such as Elizabeth McCracken and Buddy Udall
in the 1990s; and Ethan Canin, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Jayne Anne
Phillips, Stuart Dybek, Thom Jones, John Casey and others in
between. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``SHRUB'' &QL; 
By Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose (Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We'd buy this one just for the title. In the introduction, Ivins
shifts to her other nickname for George W. Bush _ ``Dubya'' _ which
is good, too. Her book, subtitled ``The Short but Happy Political
Life of George W. Bush,'' is written from a Texan's point of view,
which is helpful because Dubya promises to do for the country what
he did for the state. Ivins and Dubose (editor of ``The Texas
Observer'') try to portray the candidate as he really is:
privileged, personable, unintellectual and most of all, LUCKY. For
one thing, he inherited a healthy Texas from Ann Richards, his
predecessor in the Governor's Office. Then there is his father.
``The political career of W. Bush is a fairly funny yarn,'' the
authors write, ``on account of being the son of a former president
is not . . . actually sufficient job training for the governance of
a large state. Fortunately, in Texas, this makes no difference.''
If you think that Bush's record is different from his rhetoric, and
that his resume is, as Ivins puts it, ``a little light,'' don't
blame her. ``There's really not much there,'' she says. ``We've
been looking for six years.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``DISH'' &QL; 
By Jeannette Walls (Spike, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walls looks at our fascination with gossip, beginning with the
columns of Walter Winchell in the 1920s and the gossip reporters
who subsequently became some of the most influential journalists of
the midcentury, and ending with the notorious events of recent
years _ the O.J. Simpson trial; the death of Diana, Princess of
Wales; Matt Drudge's theft of ``Newsweek'' information to scoop the
world on the Clinton/Lewinsky affair. Also here are miniprofiles of
former ``Vanity Fair'' and ``New Yorker'' Editor Tina Brown;
powerful Hollywood publicist Pat Kingsley (who redefined the term
``star access'' with her belligerence toward reporters seeking
interviews with client Tom Cruise); and Mike Wallace, who jumped
into the gossip cauldron with his 1956 program, ``Night Beat.'' In
the process of reporting all of this, Walls herself panders to the
gossip mill with mention of rumors of Cruise's homosexuality and
John and Robert Kennedy's simultaneous affairs with Marilyn Monroe.
Best of all, she provides an index. You can choose your own gossip,
and leave the rest to the tabloids. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; TALES OF THE LAVENDER MENACE: A Memoir of Liberation &LR;  By Karla
Jay. Basic Books, $14. A Pace University professor recalls her
dizzying transformation in the late 1960s and early '70s from a
bisexual college girl into a radical lesbian activist. ``Jay's calm
descriptions of the often extraordinary goings-on are duly
inspiring, and not infrequently hilarious,'' Stacey D'Erasmo wrote
in The New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE GROUND BENEATH HER FEET &LR;  By Salman Rushdie. Picador USA,
$16. In a fictional universe crammed with alternative realities and
crazed visions, a young man in India sings ``I Got You, Babe''
before it is released in the West, and John Kennedy narrowly
escapes assassination. The novel's narrator, a garrulous Indian
photographer with a fondness for puns and multicultural allusions,
tells of the magical romance between a doomed rock singer and her
singer-songwriter husband and musical collaborator. The result is
an ``exuberant and elegiac'' tale, Michael Wood wrote in The New
York Times Book Review in 1999. Rushdie ``makes us laugh with the
sheer proliferating energy of his call.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DARK CONTINENT: Europe's Twentieth Century &LR;  By Mark Mazower.
Vintage, $16. A British historian argues that the Nazis and other
authoritarian movements of wartime Europe came closer to success
than is commonly acknowledged, and that the ascension of liberal
democracy after 1945 was anything but a foregone conclusion. ``His
splendid book makes a convincing case for a different version of
20th-century European history,'' Tony Judt wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A HISTORY OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: Volume Two, 1933-1951 &LR; , by
Martin Gilbert (Post Road/ Avon, $20), chronicles a 19-year period
``dominated by the struggle between the rule of law and
lawlessness'' and blighted by war and suffering. ``This is history
stripped to its essentials, shrn of fads and celebrities and
hoopla, and devoted instead to what was of consequence,'' David
Walton wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A WORKING GIRL CAN'T WIN: And Other Poems &LR;  By Deborah Garrison.
Modern Library, $7.95. A young poet's first collection features
lyrics that revolve around the twin axes of work and love, small
frustrations and larger losses. Together they form a highly
personal story in many parts. In 1998 the reviewer Nicholas
Christopher called this ``an intense, intelligent and wonderfully
sly book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEAVING EARTH &LR;  By Helen Humphreys. Picador USA, $13. In 1933, a
famous aviatrix and her inexperienced co-pilot set out to break the
world flight endurance record by circling Toronto for 25 days; as
the days pass, their contact with earth drifts away. This first
novel is ``beautiful in its reticence and insight,'' David Willis
McCullough wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NIKE: A Romance &LR;  By Nicholas Flokos. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin,
$10. The keeper of a ruined Greek sanctuary hooks up with an
American filmmaker in a plot to repatriate a Hellenistic statue
that was whisked away to the Louvre after its discovery in 1863. In
1998 the reviewer Gloria Rohmann called this a ``witty first
novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLACK HAWK DOWN: A Story of Modern War &LR;  By Mark Bowden.
Penguin, $13.95. A journalist reconstructs the strange and horrific
battle between American soldiers and Somali street fighters in
Mogadishu in 1993. ``Bowden has performed an important service by
picking out and meticulously dramatizing ... a turning point in
recent history,'' William Finnegan wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SPICE ISLANDS VOYAGE: The Quest for Alfred Wallace, the Man
Who Shared Darwin's Discovery of Evolution &LR;  By Tim Severin. Carroll
&AMP; Graf, $14.95. Setting sail in present-day Indonesia, the author
retraces the voyage of the bumbling collector of foreign fauna who
beat Darwin to the punch with his theory of species origination. In
1998 the reviewer Ted Conover admired the author's ``deep and
obvious sympathy for Wallace,'' whose travails were truly
harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HEALER &LR;  By Greg Hollingshead. HarperPerennial, $14. A
recently widowed journalist becomes involved with a young woman
with miraculous healing powers, as well as her maniacal father and
the primeval landscape they inhabit in rural Ontario. Last year
Abby Frucht called this novel ``a mad-tongued Gothic tale, a blend
of high drama and sly, dark marvels.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN ANOTHER PLACE, NOT HERE &LR;  By Dionne Brand. Grove Press, $13.
This first novel explores the love affair between two
Caribbean-born women on an unnamed island: a sugar-cane worker and
an educated expatriate who returns from Canada to take part in a
political revolution. The tale is ``passionate in its attention to
emotional nuance and visual detail,'' Catherine Bush wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WORKING WITH EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE &LR;  By Daniel Goleman. Bantam,
$15.95. Drawing on extensive interviews and data, the author
maintains that maturity and ``grownupness,'' more than expertise or
IQ, accounts for up to 90 percent of success at work. ``Anyone
interested in leadership and the health of human institutions
should get a copy of this book,'' Warren Bennis wrote in 1998.

`CARE OF THE SOUL' AUTHOR THOMAS MOORE SUGGESTS WAYS TO SAVE SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN JENKINS  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (RETRANSMITTING FOR THOSE WHO MAY MISSED THIS /  &UR; ALSO MOVING IN
THE ``E'' CATEGORY)
</P>
<P>
   In the Western world, a hard-and-fast line often is drawn
between the sacred and secular. But to be true to the soul's
nature, says author Thomas Moore, one must integrate the two _ and
learn to live life on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, whose ``Care of the Soul'' spent months on the ``New York
Times'' bestseller list, expands upon the spiritual principles laid
out in this 1992 book and subsequent ones in ``Original Self:
Living with Paradox and Originality'' (HarperCollins, $22). Moore
and his wife, Joan Hanley, whose woodcut drawings supplement the
essays in ``Original Self,'' are making a nationwide book tour.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 59, spent 12 years as a Roman Catholic monk. Living in a
Servite order, which was both contemplative and active, he learned
theological and philosophical truths that influence his writings
about the loss of ``soul'' in our culture. One of the most crucial
lessons he took from that time was ``the importance of living a
contemplative life, having time to be quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way to give a little bit of time each day to
contemplation,'' he says. ``If you have that kind of experience, it
can make a crucial difference in the way you live in your active
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He says today's anxious, materialism-obsessed society could take
a page from ancient pagan religion, which took a holistic,
Earth-based approach to all facets of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we imagine the religious or spiritual life in limited ways,
the trouble is all these issues left to the secular world aren't
treated deeply enough,'' Moore says. ``The pagans had a lot of
problems, but one thing they did do right was (knowing) that every
aspect of a person's life has religious and spiritual dimensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as work. &QL; 
CROSSOVER ROOTS
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to assume it's a secular part of our lives,'' Moore
says, ``that it has nothing to do with our spiritual lives. Both
individually and socially, the difficulties we run into run so deep
they eventually cross over into a religious or spiritual dimension.
We have to begin realizing that everything has these deep roots and
all have some theological roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to think deeply enough, we need to be theologians in our
own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Original Self's'' essays address human personality _ and the
importance of passion, memory, living in the moment. Even the need
to own our neuroses and failures as unique qualities that make us
who we are. When perfection becomes the goal, much of life's
originality gets lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it,'' Moore says, it's about ``the faith in
oneself and trusting that life is offering what you need to live,
and take it on with such gusto that you can make mistakes. And
that's what I mean by original _ it takes a great deal of faith in
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore started writing the pieces that would eventually compose
``Original'' ``Se''lf over a year ago, finding quotes from his
favorite writers and expounding on them. His wife then read each
essay and created ``woodcuts in her own way that represented the
theme of each piece.''  &QL; 
KEY CONNECTIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Working as a psychotherapist for nearly 20 years, Moore says
that ``dealing with people's lives in tense situations'' helped him
clarify the themes he now writes and speaks about. He felt that
part of his job as a therapist was to help patients see the
connection between faith in a spiritual, as well as practical, way.
Being confident in themselves _ as well as trusting in some power
greater than themselves _ was key.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not separate at all,'' he says. ``It's a part of the
whole story. If you can just carry that faith forward, you don't
have to be paranoid. And beyond that, you can have faith that life
is worth living. It's seamless, as far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue is to have the faith (to) live your life so that
you don't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one major fault of our full-speed-ahead, Type A society,
he says. People are so obsessed with trying to master their fates,
to somehow reach perfection, that they fail to take ``generous
participation in the concrete life we're given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are an awful lot of people who are realizing (that
being) a spiritual person is to be more tolerant of yourself and
others,'' Moore says.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he says, ``the word `perfect' means to complete, not
to be without mistake or error or fault.'' &QL; 
FEAR-BASED RELIGION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in some ways, Moore says, organized religion and its
concrete ``thou shalt not'' rules are partially to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of religion is based on fear, and that we should be
perfect,'' he says. ``It's a fear of letting life happen. I think
there's a profound lack of faith in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's only through releasing control that life gets
lived with passion and balance.
</P>
<P>
   As Moore writes in ``Original Self,'' ``. . . We pride ourselves
on our freshly won intelligence, while religion teaches the value
of holy ignorance. There is a thickheaded form of not knowing, from
not having reflected or thought, and an inspired way, being
sufficiently educated that we realize how absurdly little we know.
The former is plain ignorance, the latter verges on the sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   In his writings, Moore includes tenets and quotes from Daoism,
from Buddhism, from Christian mystic traditions, showing readers
that ``letting go'' is a common thread woven through most of the
world's faith traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't know everything,'' he says. ``In this Information
Age, it's hard to imagine this. What we have to do is become smart
enough to realize we're never going to know the context in which we
live. To me, that's opening the door to true faith.'' &QL; 
SECURE IN HIS BELIEFS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of his books' popularity, Moore often is invited to
speak at churches. He's talked to Catholics, Episcopalians,
Unitarian Universalists, and others. He's comfortable speaking to
churchgoers from ministers' pulpits, yet feels equally secure
addressing folks who ``hate church'' and organized religion,
because both audiences can relate to the spiritual nature of his
writings.
</P>
<P>
   The author of 10 books, Moore next will deal with deepening
one's spiritual life by ``connecting the spiritual with the
emotional, and tying together things pulled apart.''
</P>
<P>
   After that book is completed, Moore and his family will move to
Ireland while he writes about the richness of that country's
culture. He says travelers are drawn to Ireland not just for its
residents' trademark humor, music and storytelling, but because the
Irish have managed to syncretize strong Catholic faith with an
earthy, Celtic spirituality that's survived the centuries. He hopes
to show readers that it's possible to live in today's modern world
while retaining values that shape close-knit communities.
</P>
<P>
   Which gets back to that premise of linking the sacred and
secular in everyday life. It's not just a message Moore preaches,
but one he himself lives out, whether walking on the beach with his
family, cooking a meal or visiting with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best meditation for me is playing the piano every
morning,'' he says. ``My work is so caught up in religion, and I
don't see any separation between my spiritual life and my work. I
feel a certain call from the world to `come out here and talk to
us.'
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, if you're living a real spiritual life, you're living a
real full secular life. If you can (tell the difference), you're in
trouble.'' &QL; Reach the reporter at maureen.jenkins(at)arizonarepub

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: Boy, 3, takes on solar system, sentences and
all-around smarts
 &HT;    By Dani Davies
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM CITY, Fla. _ When Shawn Nigam was 6-months-old, he couldn't
sit up by himself but could say words like ``ball'' and ``car.'' At
10-months, he learned the alphabet and five months later, he could
write letters.
</P>
<P>
   By age 2, Shawn was reading and writing approximately 65 words.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the precocious 3-year-old with a 150 IQ _ making him one of
the smartest kids his age in the United States _ has a penchant for
the solar system, computers and new languages.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn's parents, Ravi and Himani Nigam, say they are at a loss
about how to teach him all he wants to know, such as Spanish,
French, Japanese. They speak English and each speaks a different
Indian language, both of which Shawn is learning.
</P>
<P>
   Socially and emotionally, he isn't ready for kindergarten. He is
an active, energetic, affectionate 3-year-old whose mother, like
any other mother of a 3-year-old, often says, ``Shawn, please stop
that.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, his parents appease him with Spanish audio tapes and
computer programs and have set up once-a-week lessons with two
tutors _ one for Spanish, one for English language skills.
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of school officials, his parents had Shawn's IQ
measured in January. At 3 years, 7 months, he landed in the 99th
percentile of children his age with a score of 150.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that only one percent of the population in the
country in his age group would score higher,'' said Patricia Gage,
the child psychologist who tested Shawn. ``That is considered very
superior. One hundred-sixty is the highest you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   The handsome, bespectacled boy appeared on television twice in
February _ once on the CBS Early Show with Bryant Gumbel and once
on a local news program _ displaying his knowledge of the solar
system, world geography and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigams hoped the media attention would attract experts to
advise them of the best educational path for Shawn. For now, he
attends preschool in the mornings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt that children should play and enjoy
childhood,'' Ravi Nigam said. ``Even now, I don't push him. He
forces us.''
</P>
<P>
   His Spanish tutor, Gladys Velez, has had about six lessons with
Shawn. She uses colorful props, pictures and games to conquer his
3-year-old's attention span.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at his kitchen table, Velez holds up flash cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Como te llamas?'' Shawn reads from a card.
</P>
<P>
   Velez eyes him quizzically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me llamos Shawn,'' he answers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he glides his feet in blue socks with red cars on them
across the shining kitchen tile as he wiggles and sings Spanish
songs, naming facial features and body parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Una rodilla, dos rodillas,'' the two sing together, first
touching one knee, then both as Shawn puts his smiling face
nose-to-nose with Velez.
</P>
<P>
   In 14 years of teaching elementary Spanish, she hasn't ever met
a student like him. She uses words like ``special'' and ``unusual''
to describe him and shakes her head when she remembers their first
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock, to be honest with you,'' Velez said. ``I say
the word only once with him and he knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also intriguing is the fact that Shawn speaks English with a
slight Indian accent but has none when he speaks Spanish, Velez
said. He also uses articles like ``la'' and ``una'' that she hasn't
taught him yet.
</P>
<P>
   Both Velez and former Martin Downs Montessori School teacher
Sana Risedorph marvel at Shawn's ability to read and write long
words and sentences with no misspellings or mispronunciations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say something, he wants to write it down, words like
automotive or northern hemisphere,'' Risedorph said. ``And he can
write in complete sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn even liked to spend his playground time writing, Risedorph
said. He would ask other children for words or their names and
write them with chalk on the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   As a baby, Shawn sat up, crawled and walked at the normal times,
but his parents knew his early curiosity with written words was
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would demand paper and pen,'' Ravi Nigam said.
</P>
<P>
   While other parents toted around games and stuffed animals, the
Nigams carried colored pens and pads of paper to occupy their
toddler.
</P>
<P>
   He had an affinity for anything written and even lugged a heavy
dictionary to preschool to show his friends. He examined the words
on newspapers and books before he could read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he even ate some newspaper once,'' Himani Nigam
laughed. ``I think that might have been where he got some of his
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, while Shawn enjoys horseback riding, swimming and an
occasional Barney show, his favorite pasttimes are more cerebral.
</P>
<P>
   He became interested in the solar system _ facts about planets
and moons _ when his father found some pictures of planets in the
garage. More recently, his interest shifted to languages. But he
still sleeps with glow-in-the-dark star and moon pillows.
</P>
<P>
   Gage said in her report that ``his very superior abilities
warrant ... above age level placement and an accelerated
curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Himani Nigam agrees. She has visited about six schools and has
yet to make a decision about which would be best.
</P>
<P>
   School officials nationwide are cautious about placing children
who may not be socially ready for classroom settings into
kindergarten, even if they are mentally able. State law prohibits
children who are not 5 or older by Sept. 1 from entering
kindergarten in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``For parents of young children, the biggest problem is keeping
them interested,'' said Peter Rosenstein, executive director of the
National Association for Gifted Children. ``All the research and
studies on the brain show that one of the most crucial times is
from birth to 5. Parents have to make sure that they are
challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the more challenged Shawn is, the more fun he
has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying my best to do what I can at home, but if it's the
mother teaching, they don't want to learn,'' Himani Nigam said.
``Also, my husband and I haven't done school from this country. We
went to school in India. We want him to learn according to the
system over here.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she and Ravi, an engineer at Pratt and Whitney,
aren't qualified to teach Shawn English and are concerned about him
picking up their accent.
</P>
<P>
   Gage has no doubt Shawn will be ready for a kindergarten
classroom in the fall when he's 4. By working with tutors, the
length of time he can focus on a task will gradually increase, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The day he was tested, Shawn looked into a box in Gage's office
filled with bracelets and rubber balls. He took out one of each and
said, ``If I put this ring around this ball, I can have Saturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably, Gage said, ``he is not your typical 3-year-old.''

FUEL PRICES TO PEAK IN SUMMER BUT EVENTUALLY DROP, AGENCY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gasoline prices will continue to rise sharply,
hitting an average of $1.56 a gallon in the peak summer driving
season, but they will come down by this time next year, the Energy
Department predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Because worldwide crude oil supplies are so low, a steep
increase in gasoline costs is unavoidable in the near future even
if oil-producing countries agree soon to significantly increase
production, the department's Energy Information Administration
said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said that the average price for a gallon of regular
unleaded gasoline, now about $1.35, would ``surge to unprecedented
levels before the spring is out'' and that motorists would pay an
average of 35 cents more a gallon from April through September than
they did in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But while the prices will probably set records in purely
numerical terms, they will still be 40 percent lower when adjusted
for inflation than they were at their all-time high, in March 1981,
the energy information office said. And they will be 16 percent
lower when adjusted for inflation than they were late in 1990,
during the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   As further consolation, an Energy Department analyst predicted
that there would be no long lines at gasoline stations, as there
were two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting the season with relatively low supplies,'' said
Dave Costello, an economist with the energy information agency.
``Meeting the demand _ which will happen _ will be attended by
relatively high prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the energy information office foresaw a return by this
time next year to today's gasoline prices as oil countries continue
to produce enough to bolster supplies once again.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is scheduled
to meet on March 27 to decide whether to increase production to
offset a shortage that now stands at more than 2 million barrels a
day. But even if OPEC decides to raise its production drastically,
and soon _ say, by 2 million barrels a day _ there is little chance
that enough crude oil can get to refiners in time to stave off
higher prices for summer vacationers in the United States, the
energy office said.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department report is full of caveats that are
intriguing to those who follow the economics and politics of oil.
In California, where clean-air rules make gasoline more expensive,
prices could approach $2 a gallon. Taxes also vary considerably
from state to state.
</P>
<P>
   The department said that heating oil prices, which hit $2 a
gallon or more in the oil-dependent Northeast this winter, were
already coming down as warm weather approaches and should be lower
next winter. So, presumably, will diesel fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told Congress last week that he
thought oil production would go up, and that there was no need,
therefore, for the government to tap its 600-million-barrel
Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson told some skeptical lawmakers that the option was
still ``on the table.'' With the price of crude oil at $32 a
barrel, three times what it was a year ago, the administration
could face renewed pressure to use the reserves. In New York, crude
oil rose 67 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $32.18 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving itself plenty of leeway, the energy information office
said it expected crude oil prices to be $22 to $28 a barrel by the
end of this year and $19 to $26 a barrel by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   For now, analysts expect oil production to increase. Saudi
Arabia, Venezuela, Kuwait and Mexico, which is not an OPEC member,
have signaled a willingness to increase production.
</P>
<P>
   But there is good reason for caution in predicting oil trends.
OPEC has historically had trouble keeping discipline among its
members, partly because some members, like Iran, Iraq and Kuwait,
have been enemies on the battlefield. Another war in the Middle
East could dash all predictions.
</P>
<P>
   One prediction seems safe: American drivers will grumble over
higher gasoline prices, forgetting that not many months ago they
were extraordinarily low. The same amount of gasoline that cost $10
in 1984 cost only $10.19 in July 1999, according to the Consumer
Price Index, while the cost of most other goods and services went
up 60 percent over those 15 years.

 &HT;    Dancer withdraws from Spoleto lineup over the S.C. flag issue
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston, S.C., the Southeast's
premier arts event, has suddenly lost one prominent artist to an
economic boycott directed by the NAACP. Festival leaders want the
exodus to stop there.
</P>
<P>
   They're hoping that Spoleto's multicultural tradition, and its
public support for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from
above the state Capitol, can keep arts lovers on track to this
year's $6.2 million event, running May 26-June 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be more than a bit unfortunate if audiences stayed
away in droves,'' said Eric Friberg of Atlanta, a Spoleto board
member who also leads the boards of the Atlanta Opera and the High
Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spoleto has done many things over the years to introduce
African-American art and culture into the festival,'' Friberg said.
``We do believe the festival has been tremendously responsible in
bringing together different cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Spoleto's executive committee released a statement
supporting removal of the state's controversial flag. That still
didn't prevent dancer Bill T. Jones from withdrawing his company
from the festival's multidisciplinary lineup. ``It was the only
decision I could make,'' Jones told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Spoleto's organizers are urging other artists and supporters to
make a statement of a different sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Festival strongly believes that the arts have a unique
ability to stimulate debate, draw people together and ultimately to
change them in ways that nothing else can,'' the Spoleto dispatch
read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a cause for great concern,'' said festival
director Nigel Redden from Paris on Monday. ``I strongly feel that
the best way for artists to deal with an issue is to speak out, by
performing, and not be silent.'' Because of the boycott, some
subscribers have written letters saying they cannot attend this
year's performances. Yet marketing director Marie Lawson
acknowledged Monday that ticket sales through January showed an
increase of 16 percent over last year, when 72,536 tickets were
dispensed.
</P>
<P>
   For many, attendance at this year's festival clearly involves a
moral decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the African-American community in Charleston feels
they can continue to support the festival as local people
supporting something local,'' Redden said. ``But they've all said
they would have a difficult time inviting friends to come to South
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no other arts groups have withdrawn from the lineup.
Dwight C. James, executive director of the NAACP branches in South
Carolina, said he plans to call all artists on the schedule, urging
them to back out. As of Monday, he had reached only
</P>
<P>
   ``20 percent'' of them.
</P>
<P>
   Redden wouldn't speculate on chances that the flag could be
removed from the Capitol by June 1, when the state legislative
session is expected to end.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Campbell, an African-American retiree who helps Spoleto
build audiences, said it's too soon to tell what will happen.
``There's still a chance this (boycott) could have a chilling
effect.''

 &HT;    Bill seeks millions for lake cleanup
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ After a quarter-century of watching Lake
Okeechobee on television, Bruce Shupp finally got to visit the
fabled bass-fishing haven in January.
</P>
<P>
   His verdict: ``That's pretty ugly-looking water,'' said Shupp,
national conservation director of the Bass Anglers Sportsman
Society, the nation's largest bass fishing organization.
</P>
<P>
   He was astounded by the water's pollution-fed murk, and the loss
of the fish-nurturing grasses along the lake's shore. The fishing
was better than in your average lake, he said, ``but it's been a
lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   And by the looks of things, Shupp said, ``nobody was doing
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That will change this year, vow some state lawmakers, who want
to spend $38 million to begin a 15-year cleanup to stop fertilizer
and manure from flowing into the lake and scrape polluted muck from
its bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The cost eventually could exceed $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by House Budget Chairman Ken Pruitt (R-Port
St. Lucie) is likely to be one of the most closely watched
environmental initiatives in the legislative session that begins
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators also will rule on Gov. Jeb Bush's $2.3 billion
proposal for financing the state's share of restoring the
Everglades, and battles over property rights, growth and ownership
of publicly owned streams and riverbeds.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists question whether the Lake Okeechobee bill
will share the fate of earlier legislative promises.
</P>
<P>
   They especially remember the Surface Water Improvement and
Management Act, or SWIM. That 1987 law never fulfilled hopes of
rescuing the lake, and legislators eventually lost interest in
spending money on it. In the past two years, they spurned South
Florida water managers' requests for money to keep the cleanup
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists fear that Pruitt's bill may turn out to
be ``Son of SWIM'' _ undermined by a lack of money and lax
pollution limits.
</P>
<P>
   Pruitt vows that it won't. He said he aims to devote so much
money to the cleanup that future legislators will feel bound to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action is contagious,'' said Pruitt, who is in his final year
in the House and faces a race for the state Senate this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alternative is not good _ a dead lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides worries about the money, environmentalists want speedier
deadlines and stricter curbs on pollution from citrus groves, dairy
farms and cattle ranches.
</P>
<P>
   They also want to ban the practice of allowing landowners north
of the lake to import sewage sludge and chicken manure for
nourishing their fields. Pruitt's bill would merely limit those
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists also object to the continued role that
the bill would give to the state Department of Agriculture, which
would work with South Florida water managers and the state
Department of Environmental Protection in setting rules around the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Agriculture should concern itself with
growing oranges,'' said West Palm Beach lake activist Wayne Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   But Okeechobee rancher Frank ``Sonny'' Williamson said farmers
want to save the lake as much as anyone does.
</P>
<P>
   ``A landowners' general response on this is, `I will do
everything I can short of committing economic suicide,''' said
Williamson, a former water manager.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the ranchers and farmers can't afford to meet the
pollution limits that some environmentalists are demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Pruitt's bill, largely following the advice of water managers
and other agencies, would pattern the lake's cleanup after the $763
million pollution removal under way just north of the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, engineers may plow 60 square miles of farms and
pasture into pollution-filtering marshes and reservoirs north of
the lake. Those structures would cleanse the algae-feeding runoff
from fertilizer and manure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, water managers would test methods for vacuuming 300
square miles of manure-tainted muck from the lake's bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers and ranchers would reduce their own pollution, perhaps
by buying and selling the legal right to pollute.
</P>
<P>
   Pruitt's bill sets more modest goals for the next four years:
Water managers and the state would have four years to dig some
marshes, conduct some studies and devise a plan for finishing the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Everglades cleanup, which relies mostly on special
taxes levied against property owners and sugar farmers, Pruitt's
bill would draw its money from the state's general tax revenue.
That would avoid any no-new-taxes battles _ but it also would deny
the lake cleanup a guaranteed, year-in-year-out source of money.
</P>
<P>
   Some money could come from the federal government, since the
lake cleanup would use some of the same reservoirs proposed in a
larger $7.8 billion Everglades restoration plan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, some environmentalists call Pruitt's
bill a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a lot more than this, but you eat an elephant one bite
at a time,'' said David Guest, an attorney with the Earthjustice
Legal Defense Fund in Tallahassee. ``We can work with this.''
</P>
<P>
   State agencies already have most of the legal power they need to
fight the pollution, said Paul Gray of the group Audubon of
Florida. ``They mostly need the money to do it.''

 IRON TRIANGLE: McCAIN'S METAPHOR VS. THE NEWLY STEELED BUSH  
 (For release Sunday, March 12)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the eve of his victory in the South Carolina primary,
recalling his stunning defeat in New Hampshire, George W. Bush
said: ``People may not think I'm tough enough, but I am. This is a
process of  &UR; steeling &LR;  me to become president.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek, reporting on the ``hardening'' of the candidate during
the rough tactics of that Southern campaign, commented, ``Consider
him  &UR; steeled &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The verb, in its sense of ``to make hard or strong as steel,''
is used in Shakespeare's poem ``Venus and Adonis,'' as Venus says:
``Give me my heart .... O give it me, lest thy hard heart do
 &UR; steel &LR;  it,/And being  &UR; steeled &LR; , soft sighs can never grave it.''
Bush, in subsequent interviews, repeated the verb; he evidently
felt that being  &UR; steeled &LR;  is an admirable development in a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is also partial to a metallic metaphor. ``I've
taken on the  &UR; iron triangle &LR; : special interests, campaign finance
and lobbying,'' he said in mid-February. A few weeks earlier, his
definition was formulated slightly differently: ``The establishment
obviously is in a state of extreme distress, if not panic, because
they know I have taken on the  &UR; iron triangle &LR;  of money, lobbyists
and legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The origin is military. On U.S. Army maps during the Korean
conflict of 1950-53, an area about 30 miles north of the 38th
parallel with its apex at Pyongyang and its corners at Chorwon and
Kumhwa was marked ``the  &UR; Iron Triangle &LR; .'' This was the center
anchor of the North Korean defense line and the hub of a
communication and supply network. During the Vietnam War, an area
of 125 square miles northwest of Saigon was called by the same
name.
</P>
<P>
   Then the phrase was transferred to Europe and used for nations
rather than small areas: In 1977, an editorial in The New York
Times called East Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia ``the
U.S.S.R.'s  &UR; iron triangle &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the military phrase was being used as a synonym for
what Dwight Eisenhower, in his 1961 farewell, called ``the
military-industrial complex'' _ that is, the military services,
defense contractors and members of Congress busy at the pork
barrel. In the '70s, the term spread beyond the military to include
the cozy relationship among federal agencies, congressional
committees and lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan, as he was leaving office, substituted the media
for the military in his triangulation. ``A  &UR; triangle &LR;  of
institutions _ parts of Congress, the media and special-interest
groups _ is transforming and placing out of focus our
constitutional balance,'' Reagan warned. Modestly, he did not claim
credit for the phrase: ``Some have used the term  &UR; iron triangle &LR;  to
describe what I'm talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain left the media out of his  &UR; iron triangle &LR; , substituting
``money,'' so that his three corners are now ``money, lobbyists and
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   How did his opponent deal with the three-sided ferrous metaphor?
George W. Bush's department of figure-of-speech ripostes did fairly
well. Another sense of  &UR; triangle &LR;  is ``an iron rod bent in a
triangle with one angle open, used as a percussion instrument or
bell when struck with another iron rod.''
</P>
<P>
   After being asked frequently about McCain's symbol, he was
readied with a colorful reply. ``If a man says, for example,'' said
Bush, undoubtedly alluding to the man as McCain, ``that there's an
 &UR; iron triangle &LR;  in Washington, D.C., of lobbyists and special
interests, and he's ringing it like a dinner bell to raise money
for his campaign, I think that I have a right to point out that he
says one thing and does another.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's  &UR; triangle &LR;  had only two sides, his word-image
nicely brought to mind a picture of an  &UR; iron triangle &LR;  used
sometimes on Texas ranches to call cowhands to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about iron that attracts phrase makers? John C.
Calhoun, vice president under Andrew Jackson, was nicknamed ``the
 &UR; cast-iron man &LR; '' by the English economist Harriet Martineau
because he ``looks as if he had never been born, and could never be
extinguished.'' Lou Gehrig, the `` &UR; iron horse &LR; '' (originally
referring to the railroads), was followed by Cal Ripken, the
`` &UR; iron man &LR; ,'' who broke Gehrig's endurance record of 2,130
consecutive games in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a cruel connotation to the word-image.  &UR; Blood and
iron &LR; , in German  &UR; Blut und Eisen &LR; , meant ``military force as
distinguished from diplomacy'' and was associated in the 1870s with
Prince Bismarck, ``the  &UR; iron chancellor &LR; .'' Autocratic rule was
governance with an  &UR; iron hand &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Churchill famously called the Soviet separation of the
tyrannized East and the free West the  &UR; iron curtain &LR; , after a
fireproof curtain used in French and English theaters as early as
the 18th century. (The Viscountess Snowden, after a visit to Russia
soon after World War I, wrote, ``We were behind the ` &UR; iron
curtain &LR; ' at last!'') In the United States, the undemonstrative
first lady Rosalynn Carter was derogated (unfairly, in retrospect)
as ``the  &UR; steel magnolia &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; iron rice bowl &LR;  was Mao Tse-tung's guarantee to China's
workers of a job for life under the communist system, with
cradle-to-grave benefits. President Bill Clinton, celebrating what
he believed was the emergence of capitalism in China, said in 1998
that ``restructuring state enterprises is critical to building a
modern economy, but it is also disrupting settled patterns of life
and work, cracking the  &UR; iron rice bowl &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, McCain's  &UR; iron triangle &LR;  has a built-in pejorative
connotation. Even the  &UR; triangle &LR;  has dark memories, as its
evocation in necromancy and in the military usages above indicates.
There's also the  &UR; Bermuda Triangle &LR; , where boats disappear
mysteriously, as well as the  &UR; golden triangle &LR; , the area of
Southeast Asia _ Myanmar, Laos and Thailand _ where opium is
cultivated. (On the other hand, people in rejuvenated downtown
Pittsburgh, and Texans in the Beaumont-Orange-Port Arthur area, are
happy to call their neighborhoods the  &UR; golden triangle &LR; .)

   LOUIMA-TRIAL (New York) _ Three Brooklyn police officers were
convicted on Monday of hatching a plot to cover up the brutal
assault on Abner Louima in a bitterly contested and emotional
verdict that the defendant's lawyers and families vowed through
their tears to fight. The three officers were each found guilty of
conspiring in dozens of telephone calls to obstruct justice by
crafting a false story for the authorities that one of them,
Charles Schwarz, was never involved in the notorious attack three
years ago in the bathroom of a Flatbush station house. By Alan
Feuer.

   BOEING-STRIKE (Tukwila, Wash.) _ The chants and placards along
the picket lines outside the Boeing Co.'s huge aircraft plants are
a bit unusual. ``No Nerds, No Birds,'' proclaims one sign. And many
Boeing engineers, most on strike for the first time in their lives,
say they are still stunned at how unified their group has become in
the face of its protest against the jet manufacturer. The
increasingly bitter protest by the Society of Professional
Engineering Employees in Aerospace has mushroomed into one of the
largest strikes by white-collar workers against a private company
in years. For national labor leaders, who have rushed in to help
out the striking engineers, the strike is clearly seen as an
opportunity to make inroads in its hopes to organize a potentially
vast sector of the workforce. By Sam Howe Verhovek. 1,800 words.

   INTERNET-MUSIC (Undated) _ The music industry is already plenty
disturbed about the popularity of MP3, a technology that poses a
serious piracy threat by compressing music into files that can be
close to CD quality yet small enough to travel quickly over the
Internet. But Napster, a new online service, greatly magnifies the
threat that MP3 files pose to music copyrights by creating an
international exchange for swapping recordings _ often in far less
time than it takes to play the music. In just months, Napster has
vastly widened the scale of music swapping, provoking a debate over
what constitutes reasonable and realistic copyright protection in
the digital age. By Amy Harmon.

<P>
   CHINA-ASSESS (Shanghai) _ News Analysis: China's renewed threat
of war against Taiwan has caused anxiety in the West, but Beijing's
military options for attacking the island remain limited and
impractical, a fact often overlooked amid the furor in Washington.
Beijing's vow to use force, made in a policy paper last month and
repeated in an editorial in a military newspaper today, is meant to
warn Taiwan away from formal independence and push it toward
serious negotiations on reunification with the mainland. A news
analysis by Craig S. Smith.

COURT RULES ON CONFLICTING STANDARDS FOR OIL TANKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (See also SCOTUS-TRAILS) 
(lb) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing the longstanding federal interest in uniform
rules for interstate navigation, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
Monday that states cannot set safety and environmental standards
for oil tankers that conflict with, or in some instances merely
supplement, federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision invalidated a series of regulations that
the state of Washington adopted in 1994 governing tanker traffic
along its coast and specifically in Puget Sound and the 65-mile
long Strait of Juan de Fuca, which connects Puget Sound to the
Pacific. Much of the oil from Alaska's North Slope is transported
through Washington's waters, and the state acted in response to the
Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Among the regulations the court struck down Monday, in an
opinion by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, were those governing
training and operational requirements for tanker crews, including
one that required all licensed deck officers, even of foreign
vessels, to be ``proficient'' in English. The corresponding federal
rule requires only that ``at least one licensed deck officer'' be
``capable of clearly understanding English.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal regulation ``may not be supplemented by laws enacted
by the states without compromising the uniformity the federal rule
itself achieves,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The court based its decision primarily on a 1972 federal law,
the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, which Congress passed to
address safety and environmental concerns raised by the disastrous
Torrey Canyon tanker oil spill off the coast of England in 1967.
The federal law required the Coast Guard to issue regulations
governing various aspects of tanker design and operation that
affect seaworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Coast Guard was authorized, although not
required, to adopt other types of regulations for vessel traffic
and navigation.
</P>
<P>
   The court said Monday that in those areas where the Coast Guard
was required to act _ the ``design, construction, alteration,
repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification,
and manning'' of tankers _ Congress reserved the entire field for
exclusive federal regulation and ``has left no room for state
regulation of these matters.''
</P>
<P>
   On this basis, the decision, United States vs. Locke, No.
98-1701, invalidated Washington's training requirements, which
specified particular drills for the crew and a requirement for two
officers to be on deck during an ordinary watch, in addition to the
English proficiency requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The court also invalidated a requirement for a detailed report
on various incidents and near misses. Washington had defended this
requirement on the ground that it essentially duplicated, rather
than conflicted with, federal requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But, Kennedy said, ``it is not always a sufficient answer to a
claim of pre-emption to say that state rules supplement, or even
mirror, federal requirements'' when the federal intent was to
``establish a workable, uniform system.''
</P>
<P>
   The court said that states might have more flexibility to act in
areas where Congress had authorized, but not required, federal
regulation. In these areas, the opinion said, Congress did not mean
to occupy the entire field but only to pre-empt regulations that
actually conflicted with federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   The court suggested that several of Washington's regulations
that deal with the specific needs of navigation in Puget Sound, and
which therefore are of ``limited extraterritorial effect,'' might
not be pre-empted. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should
examine those specific regulations, Kennedy said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The appeals court, which sits in San Francisco, had upheld the
full range of Washington's regulations in a lawsuit brought by the
International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, a trade
organization known as Intertanko, which represents 80 percent of
the world's independently owned tanker fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said Monday that the appeals court had misinterpreted a
1990 federal law, the Oil Pollution Act, which contains some
language suggesting that Congress meant to narrow the pre-emptive
effect of the 1972 law. But ``if Congress had intended to disrupt
national uniformity in all of these matters'' it would have done so
directly, rather than obliquely, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had joined Intertanko in appealing
the 9th Circuit's ruling. The case attracted considerable
international attention, with Britain, Canada, Japan and 12 other
countries filing briefs warning that Washington's regulations
conflicted with U.S. treaty obligations that require treaty
partners to accept one another's ships.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the treaties themselves did not pre-empt the state
regulations, but rather indicated that Congress ``demanded national
uniformity regarding maritime commerce.''

PEDRO ASIDE, WHAT ABOUT JEFF FASSERO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Yeah, yeah, yeah, Pedro pitched Monday.
He wasn't anything special, what with the Luis Alicea home run and
the solid Royce Clayton double and the wild pitch and all. The
whole thing was pretty un-Pedrolike, not that it really mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro is Pedro. He's going to be fine. He's going to win 20-plus
and he's going to win another Cy Young. It is time to move on to
more important matters, such as, what's up with Jeff Fassero?
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Sox really are going to challenge the Yankees, or at
least win a third straight wild card berth, it's the Ramon
Martinezes and Tim Wakefields and, yes, Jeff Fassero who will be
the difference. (Bret Saberhagen? When we see him on the mound,
we'll talk.)
</P>
<P>
   That's why innings three and four were a lot more important to
the Red Sox Monday at Charlotte County Stadium than innings one and
two were. For innings three and four belonged to Fassero, the
37-year-old lefthander who has a chance to be anything from one of
the great offseason pickups in all of baseball to a forgotten
spring training footnote.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is very simple. Was 1999 an aberration, or was it
Fassero's new reality? From 1992, when he broke through with an
8-7, 2.84 year in Montreal, through 1998 (13-12, 3.97), Fassero was
that most valued of baseball commodities, a quality lefthanded
pitcher. From '96 through '98 he averaged 229 innings of dependable
work, peaking with a 16-9, 3.30 1997 season while playing half his
games in the batter-friendly Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was a horror show. He was 4-14 with a horrifying 7.38
ERA in 139 innings. The Mariners happily unloaded him to Texas on
Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   He did pitch a little better for the Rangers, but not well
enough that anyone in the Rangers organization saw the need for
staff grievance counseling when he elected to accept a free agent
offer from the Red Sox, who have been searching for a solid lefty
starter to call their own since the departure of Bruce Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   It was a classic Dan Duquette maneuver, given that it involved
(a) a reclamation project and (b) a former Expo. Spicing the plot
was the presence of Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, who, the
story goes, had something to do with Fassero's emergence as a good
major league pitcher in his ninth year as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   We got our first look at the 2000 model Fassero Monday. Let's
just say it was not Koufaxian. He went two innings, allowing two
runs (via a Rafael Palmeiro homer), while walking (ugh) three. On
the plus side: Unlike Pedro and Dan Smith, he did not give up a
home run to Alicea. And he deftly picked Gabe Kapler off first
base.
</P>
<P>
   He treated all this as any veteran pitcher would. He gave a
technical treatise. It was all about ``mechanics'' and ``location''
and a couple of pitches ``coming off,'' and ``not flying open,''
and one you don't hear all that often: ``being a little quick with
my head.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that the 1999 disaster really was about fouled-up
mechanics, and that he simply never felt comfortable. Now that he's
been reunited with Kerrigan, everything is going to be hunky-dory.
</P>
<P>
   He's got little choice but to believe that last year was the
athletic equivalent of a bad dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked and disappointed,'' he acknowledges. ``After
eight good years, it was a shock to have a year like that. But I
think I've learned something from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as?
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned how this game can jump up and get you,'' he says.
``The game wasn't as easy as I thought. And I learned that when
things go bad they can really snowball.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody in his situation would consider Boston. Fenway
Park still has the capacity to scare people _ particularly
lefthanded pitchers _ and then there's the pressure put on players
by both the intense fandom and the ravenous media. Fassero says he
has little worry about the ballpark, correctly reasoning that for
every cheapo home run there's a line drive single. And as for the
other business, Fassero assures us he's a big boy. ``There's
pressure everywhere,'' he shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   He likes what he's seen thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very glad to be a part of this team,'' he says. ``It's a
solid lineup, and it is very well prepared, which is a tribute to
the manager and the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat humbled Fassero worked out with more intensity this
winter in an effort to reconstruct his career. He has, he says, a
very reasonable goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to win 15 games,'' he says. ``In this game, that's a
good figure. Aside from that, I have no other personal goals. If I
win 15, everything else will fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff, baby, if you win 15 games, you'll be pitching in October.
That's a guarantee.

 &HT;    In Shaq's shadow
 &HT;    By Ethan J. Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When you're the slamming, rapping genie
of the NBA, the Shaq Daddy, the only Notorious B.I.G. still living
large, the league becomes your traveling party. And as with most
parties, there is a guest list, those welcome to your bash.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter? You mean, the super-soarer Shaquille O'Neal
renamed ``Half Man, Half Amazing''? Of course, and if a strobe
lightbulb breaks, he can leap up and change it. Hakeem Olajuwon?
``The Dream,'' the center O'Neal reveres, and before the 1995 NBA
Finals called ``a class act, a soft-spoken, well-dressed, handsome
guy''? Certainly. Tim Duncan? A little quiet, sure, but didn't
O'Neal just say that ``you don't see too many guys who can go
inside and out. I admire him for that''? A guy with those skills
surely can come inside and snatch a party hat.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning? Only as the hat rack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know and don't care,'' says the Miami Heat center, on
why O'Neal, a teammate on the 1994 Dream Team II, has never shown
him respect. ``I don't get involved in that, man. Everybody's
entitled to their own opinion, and he's entitled to his.''
</P>
<P>
   But he must have heard, even if O'Neal tends to speak in a
droning bass mumble.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's 1996 take on Mourning's contract: ``He must have had a
good agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Or this one: ``If you're going to pay 25 grand for a Beemer,
you've got to pay 40 for a Benz, bro, and I'm a Benz, bro.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he's a Shaq Diesel, and he's had more to say on
Mourning. As Mourning, in the past, has had more to say on O'Neal.
Once, when asked about the strength of the 305-pound behemoth,
Mourning said Joe Kleine was stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the two men faced each other in a regular-season game for
the first time since Jan. 17, 1998. O'Neal had 24 points in that
Lakers win, and Mourning just five, though most of their matchups
have been less lopsided. They were drafted first and second by
Orlando and Charlotte, respectively, in 1992, each the centerpiece
of expansion teams. Now they are separated by the mainland states,
playing in Los Angeles and Miami for the game's two cachet coaches,
Phil Jackson and Pat Riley, men who also are as dissimilar and
distant as men with like jobs and credentials might be.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Mourning play the same position. Differently. And
yet, that's all they share.
</P>
<P>
   One has spent many summers mugging on movie or commercial sets,
the other sweating in a Georgetown gym. One cuts rap albums, the
other is only seen crooning when the rare Motown record is played
on the arena speakers. One smiles for effect, the other is known
for his scowl.
</P>
<P>
   And although those characterizations are perhaps too simplistic
_ witness O'Neal's fight with Charles Barkley this year, or all the
grinning Mourning does when he's around children _ they have come
to define the two men in the eyes of the NBA public. One seeking
the spotlight, the other shunning it. One who often has played lazy
defense in the playoffs, the other who plays positional, relentless
defense in charity and All-Star Games.
</P>
<P>
   One clown, one frown.
</P>
<P>
   Simplistic, but it explains everything to the other NBA
superstar that O'Neal thinks of dimly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Shaq have a good relationship with anybody?'' says San
Antonio Spurs center and noted good guy David Robinson. ``I don't
know. I played with Shaq in the Olympics, and we got along great.
Right after the Olympics, he said something negative about me
again. I think part of it is that it's just a big show for him.
It's like Hollywood. And I think he kind of likes some of that
tension in the media. I don't think there's much to it. I think you
go out and you win the game, and that's what it's all about. I
think Shaq does that a lot, probably, because it reads good in the
papers, it makes it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   NO CRYING IN BASKETBALL
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there was some back-and-forth in 1995 when Robinson
noted the limitations of O'Neal's game. O'Neal, who was angry about
finishing second to Robinson in the regular-season MVP voting, used
the NBA Finals as a forum to question Robinson's fortitude, by
comparing it to Olajuwon's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you guys are going to compare me to a great center, I want
to be compared to Hakeem,'' O'Neal said then. ``When I play him, he
doesn't complain. He doesn't cry. He just plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Robinson acknowledges how far O'Neal has come on the
court, particularly in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no comparison to playing Shaq,'' Robinson said,
when asked about defending Mourning and O'Neal. ``I don't know that
there's ever been anybody really like him. And I think he's getting
better and better. I think he's learning to use his body a little
bit better, I think he's learning how to manipulate his position in
the post a little bit better. I think Zo in this last two years has
really stepped up his game. His effort and intensity is fantastic,
I think defensively, he's blocking shots, doing a lot of tremendous
things. That's a credit to him. You only get that way by hard work.
But I still think it's not a comparison to Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mourning won't make one. ``I don't get into measuring
myself,'' he says. ``I let the critics do that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a criticism. Mourning's just ... smaller. Much smaller.
Four inches and 50 pounds smaller. He is one of the two best
centers in the game, but he's really an overachieving power
forward.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to keep from being overwhelmed by a man who crowds a
lane like a Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zo will tell you, 'I can't do anything with this guy,''' says
Heat broadcaster and Hall of Fame coach Jack Ramsay. ``Imagine
hearing that from Zo? Zo might be the second strongest man in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alonzo is not one of the big guys,'' NBC broadcaster and
former center Bill Walton said. ``He's one of the best guys. The
key is to find the way to make the big guy play your game. Dave
Cowens was the absolute master of that. He could take Kareem, he
could take Wilt, and make them play his game. That's what Alonzo
Mourning has to do. Alonzo's power game is not going to work
against Shaq. Pat Riley has done such a great job of diversifying
Alonzo's game. And getting him to play a cerebral game.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton notes Mourning's versatility, quickness and shooting
ability, calling the progress he has made ``fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of players, when they see Shaq, they just
say, 'I want no part of him,''' Walton says. ``They absolutely
disappear, and they come down with Shaqitis. If you are going to
beat the Lakers, you have to come out and make a major
contribution. It may not be the same type of game that you play
against others.''
</P>
<P>
   While Walton thought Mourning was the ``best center in
basketball'' last season, ``Shaq has taken it up this year to a new
level.''
</P>
<P>
   ONE STEP AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   That is how it always is, it seems. Mourning is going to the
Olympics in Sydney this summer ... because O'Neal didn't want to.
Mourning finished ahead of O'Neal in the MVP voting last season ...
but didn't win. O'Neal is a prohibitive favorite to win his first
this time. O'Neal has been to the Finals ... Mourning has not.
O'Neal is better positioned to go again and win.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mourning is disrespected. He was a runaway choice to
start the All-Star Game against O'Neal. And opponents _ most of
them, anyway _applaud his intensity. ``Zo shows his emotions out
there on the floor,'' said Seattle's Horace Grant, who played with
O'Neal in Orlando but declined to comment on the relationship
between the centers. ``He wears it on his sleeve. You would love to
play with a guy like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still now O'Neal is being lauded for doing what Mourning always
has. The Heat center was the defensive player of the year last
season, and his blocks are up. Just this season, O'Neal decided
this aspect of his game was worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has stepped up his defense, to be a shot-blocker, an
intimidator, a rebounder,'' Ramsay said. ``He's changed his game,
and the result is that the Lakers are much better. They lead the
league in field-goal percentage allowed. That's the whole
difference. He and Kobe (Bryant) defensively, not scoring,
defensively. Because Kobe does it at the outside, and Shaq does it
in the basket area. Shaq denies that. Shaq says he hasn't been
healthy, had this stomach strain, and that's prevented him from
being as active. But I think Phil has put his defensive imprint on
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   SHAQ MAY USE MOVE NO. 299
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Jackson has put his imprint on the tattooed O'Neal, who
has generally spoken of his coaches _ Del Harris, Brian Hill _ in
mocking tones. Now he's the loyal warrior, just like Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not like Mourning. Nor does he like Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   He was kinder than usual when asked late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami's a good team, and Alonzo's a great player,'' O'Neal
says. ``Against a guy like that, you just have to take it to him.
They don't usually double-team me, and I've got 300 moves on each
block, so I'm just going to take it to him.''

GENZYME TO ACQUIRE BIOMATRIX

<P>
   Genzyme Corp. said Monday that it had agreed to acquire
Biomatrix Inc. for about $738.5 million in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme plans to combine Biomatrix with two of its separately
traded units, Genzyme Surgical Products and Genzyme Tissue Repair,
to create a company called Genzyme Biosurgery.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme, based in Cambridge, Mass., was one of the first
biotechnology companies to become profitable and has since become a
holding company for a diverse group of medical technology
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Biomatrix, based in Ridgefield, N.J., is a leader in the
development and manufacture of so-called viscoelastic biomaterials
for use in orthopedic and other medical applications. The materials
are used in one formulation to treat arthritis pain and in another
to fill in facial wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme Surgical Repair sells the Seprafilm product used to
prevent postsurgical adhesion between organs. Genzyme Tissue Repair
sells skin-graft products.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts applauded the deal, saying it gives the venture greater
critical mass and fills out the new company's catalog and pipeline
of new products. The three companies have been selling to a similar
set of physicians and surgeons, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme shares closed Monday at $59.75, down 6.25 cents on
Nasdaq. Biomatrix shares closed at $35.50, up $1.1875, on the New
York Stock Exchange. Shares in Genzyme Surgical Products closed at
$18.9375, up $2.4375; shares in Genzyme Tissue Repair ended at
$10.6875, up $1.5625, both on Nasdaq. Genzyme Biosurgery will have
its own stock upon completion of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal Biomatrix shareholders will receive
either $37 in cash or one share of the newly created Genzyme
Biosurgery stock for each Biomatrix share. The cash portion of the
deal is limited to $245 million; if the cash choice is
oversubscribed, Biomatrix shareholders will get part cash and part
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building an exciting new enterprise with very strong
financial, commercial, scientific and product development
capabilities, which creates a powerful platform for innovation,''
Henri A. Termeer, Genzyme's chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement. ``Establishing this new organization dramatically
transforms our biosurgery franchise. It provides critical mass and
sharpens our strategic focus in several key markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme said Genzyme Biosurgery would have revenue of over $250
million a year and would be profitable measured on earnings per
share, before amortization of good will, and would generate enough
cash flow from operations to support current operations and to
service any debt associated with the acquisition. The company would
have more than 1,300 employees and six dedicated manufacturing
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Biomatrix shareholders will hold 47 percent of Genzyme
Biosurgery; Genzyme Tissue Repair shareholders will have about 27
percent and Genzyme Surgical Products about 26 percent.

GAUGING THE LIMITS OF QUANTUM COMPUTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Six years ago, Dr. Peter Shor, a researcher
at AT&AMP;T Labs, galvanized an obscure area of computer science when
he published a recipe by which a computer based on the principles
of quantum mechanics could break the cryptographic codes protecting
data transmissions over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, top researchers around the world have joined forces
to further explore how the power of the strange rules that prevail
in the submicroscopic realm of the atom can be harnessed in a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Many government and corporate research labs like Microsoft
Research, International Business Machines and AT&AMP;T Labs, either
already have a quantum computing group, or, like NASA's Ames
Research Center and the Hewlett-Packard Corp., are thinking of
starting one.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious group in New York has even begun a quantum
computing start-up, called MagiQ Technologies, with a stated goal
of building a ``quantum Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   At a weeklong quantum computing conference last month at the
Mathematical Sciences Research Institute here, researchers from
universities and corporate labs gathered to discuss advances in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Talks centered on algorithms for quickly solving problems
thought infeasible for ``classical'' computers, understanding the
limits of the computational power of quantum computers, various
approaches to building a practical device and methods for
correcting computational errors.
</P>
<P>
   The week culminated in a series of presentations to the
Information Technology Office of the Defense Department's funding
agency, which is considering a program for financing quantum
computing research.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the participants celebrated the advances in this
technology, which go far beyond speculations of just a few years
ago, they acknowledged that researchers were still far from
understanding either the potential or the limits of the technology
and even further from building a practical device.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some of the researchers said they were lured to the
field, not by the possibility of a quantum computer on every
desktop, but as a gateway to a better understanding of the bizarre
world of quantum physics.
</P>
<P>
   An ordinary or ``classical'' computer stores information in
units called bits (0s or 1s), typically represented by electrical
currents or voltages that are either high or low. A quantum
computer, however, stores information by using the states of
elementary particles.
</P>
<P>
   Classically, the electron in a hydrogen atom, say, can be in a
high or low energy state. But in the weird world of quantum physics
the state of the electron is not just high or low but a weighted
combination of both simultaneously: what physicists call a
``superposition'' of states. As a result, a quantum bit in some
sense contains more information than its classical counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, as the number of quantum bits grows, the
amount of information required to describe it grows exponentially.
Classically, since each electron can be in one of two states, a
system of 200 hydrogen atoms will be in one of 200 states. Quantum
theory, however, says that the system at any moment is in a
superposition of all of those 200 possibilities at once.
</P>
<P>
   Because 200 is a huge number, far larger than the estimated
number of particles in the universe, scientists question how the
universe can manage to even keep track of its own natural
processes. But the fact that it can hints at an enormous resource
for computing power.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a tiny system of 200 atoms, it is as though nature must
keep 200 pieces of scratch paper on the side, each with a number
written on it,'' said Dr. Umesh Vazirani, a professor of computer
science at the University of California at Berkeley and a
co-organizer of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   But this vast storehouse of information is difficult to tap.
According to the theory of quantum mechanics, a scientist cannot
look at an electron without jarring it out of its delicate
superposition and collapsing it into a single one of its two
classical states according to the weights.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of devising quantum algorithms for solving
problems is to harness this vast and hidden information processing
power despite the inability to access all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their potential power, Shor said in his presentation,
quantum computers will not necessarily perform all tasks more
quickly than classical computers. A working quantum computer, he
said, is likely to perform each operation more slowly than a
classical computer.
</P>
<P>
   Only for certain problems where researchers have discovered
methods of exploiting this vast pool of stored information to
extract an answer in far fewer steps _ methods impossible on a
classical computer _ will it be possible to speed up the
computation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Examples of this are Shor's algorithm for factoring numbers into
their prime components, a process that enables the cracking of
codes, and an algorithm by Dr. Lov Grover, a Bell labs researcher,
for searching a very specialized type of database.
</P>
<P>
   Many researchers, including Shor, are trying to find quantum
algorithms for other problems, believed to be beyond the reach of
classical devices. Others are working on quantum cryptographic
schemes to replace existing schemes in case a practical device is
built.
</P>
<P>
   Vazirani's presentation highlighted research on the limits of
quantum computers. For example, Grover's algorithm allows a
database to be searched in the square root of the time required by
a classical computer.
</P>
<P>
   This square root speed-up is the best that can be achieved,
according to work by Vazirani and others. Their result suggests, he
said, that the hardest problems in computing may forever be beyond
the reach of quantum computers.
</P>
<P>
   Vazirani pointed out, however, that such limits might be a
blessing in disguise because it raises hopes that new crytosystems
can be developed that quantum computers cannot break.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Isaac Chuang, a physicist at the IBM Almaden Research Center
in San Jose, Calif., described several competing technologies for a
working computer. In one of those, he reported, researchers have
managed to perform Grover's database search algorithm using as many
as four quantum bits. All the proposals, however, face difficulties
in scaling up to a practical device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main challenge in building a quantum computer,'' Chuang
said, ``is that you want to isolate it from everything in the
external world, yet, at the same time, be able to manipulate it at
high speed.''
</P>
<P>
   A major difficulty with running a quantum computer, the experts
say, is correcting the errors that build up during a calculation.
States stored in memory will get jostled inadvertently, for
example, and operations will be applied to the wrong quantum bit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Gottesman, of Microsoft Research, reviewed techniques
for correcting some of the errors that occurred while computations
were in progress. Beginning with a startling breakthrough by Shor
and colleagues, he said, researchers have outlined how to restore
quantum states that have been stored in memory but have partly
collapsed due to inadvertent observations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, research by Gottesman and others has shown that
errors in the computations themselves can also be corrected, as
long as there are not very many of them. He and others are trying
to develop error correction techniques that are more efficient and
that can accommodate larger numbers of errors.
</P>
<P>
   These researchers seem not to be disheartened by the many
barriers to a desktop quantum computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the value of a newborn baby?'' asked Richard Josza, a
professor of computer science at the University of Bristol in
England. ``Now, it can't do anything. But the potential is
limitless.''

JETS THINK THE UNTHINKABLE: TRADING KEYSHAWN JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Jets have been talking to other teams
about trading their best player, Keyshawn Johnson _ one of the
National Football League's top wide receivers _ in a deal that, at
first glance, seems unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   But that is exactly what Jets' officials have been doing,
according to several NFL officials. The talks have occurred mainly
with the Baltimore Ravens; the Jets have offered Johnson to
Baltimore in exchange for the Ravens' fifth overall pick in the
April draft, the NFL executives say.
</P>
<P>
   A team executive said the Ravens were ``serious, very serious''
about a possible trade, as were the Jets. The Ravens are interested
in the deal only if they can create the salary cap room that would
be needed to sign Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Why would the Jets want to trade Johnson, who is one of the top
five wide receivers in the game? His six-year contract does not
expire until the end of next year, and Johnson believes he is no
longer being paid market value as a top-flight receiver. The Jets
are concerned that they may not be able to re-sign Johnson once his
contract ends, and trading him now would give the team more value
for Johnson than if the Jets simply lost him to free agency at the
end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jets were able to trade for Baltimore's fifth pick, the
team would be in position to make several possible moves. The Jets
already own two first-round picks, and league executives speculated
that the Jets might combine either their 16th or 18th selection in
the first round with the No. 5 pick, and entice either Washington
or Cincinnati to switch with them. Washington has the second and
third picks and Cincinnati has the fourth slot.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Jets might have a shot at drafting Penn State pass
rusher Courtney Brown, who some personnel men believe could be the
next Bruce Smith. If Cleveland takes Brown with the first overall
pick, then the Jets could still be in position to snag Penn State
linebacker LeVar Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, with the Jets still holding their remaining
first-round selection, the team could draft a wide receiver to
replace Johnson. This draft is particularly deep at the position,
and one of the players the Jets like is Michigan State's Plaxico
Burress who, like Johnson, is a big, athletic player.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets might even use their second first-round selection, in
combination with other picks, to try to move into the top ten to
get Burress. Or they could remain at the 18th spot and still get a
good wide receiver. Other possibilities include Sylvester Morris
from Jackson State and Dez White from Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and Ravens have been talking for at least a week, and
Johnson's name was not brought up in passing, the NFL executives
said. The Ravens consider the talks so serious that Baltimore owner
Art Modell is seeking ways to pay for what would be a pricey new
contract for Johnson, the executives said. When Johnson's current
deal expires in two years, he could become the highest paid
receiver in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a number of calls from teams about our fifth pick,
including the New York Jets,'' Modell said. ``Beyond that, I cannot
comment. All I can say is we are trying to improve our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks over Johnson could fall apart at any time, of course.
The Ravens may decide they want to keep the fifth pick, and the
Jets may determine that giving up Johnson is too steep a price. The
possibility exists _ though it is a tiny one _ that the Jets could
part from their longstanding policy of not renegotiating a contract
when it has more than one year remaining on it and redo their star
receiver's deal.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the chance, however remote, that the Jets
purposely initiated trade talks, hoping they would leak to the
public, and get to Johnson, thus rattling him. The Jets might be
hoping that Johnson, faced with the possibility of playing in
Baltimore or an even less desirable city, might be more patient
about renegotiating his current contract.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, the Jets' director of football operations, did
not return phone calls. Johnson could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   There are few players who have a better work ethic than Johnson
or who can put so much fear in a defense. At times throughout his
career, he has been unstoppable. Trading such a player is always
risky. There is the possibility that the Jets may not find a
receiver of his quality for years.
</P>
<P>
   But the team is apparently concerned about Johnson's contract
situation. He originally signed a six-year, $15 million contract
that included a $6.5 million signing bonus. His deal runs through
2001, with an average salary of $2.5 million a year, including the
bonus. That is way below market for a player of Johnson's caliber.
In fact, his $1.74 million base salary for 2000 ranks him 20th
among wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is irritated that wide receiver Joey Galloway recently
signed a seven-year, $42 million contract. Galloway's $12.5 million
signing bonus is more than Johnson has earned his entire career.
Galloway has 283 career catches for 4,457 yards and 37 touchdowns
and Johnson has 305 catches for 4,108 yards and 31 touchdowns. In
other words, the numbers are very close, and Johnson has been to
two Pro Bowls while Galloway has been to none.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Johnson, according to people close to him, feels he is not
earning his fair market value. He has said privately that he might
consider holding out next season.
</P>
<P>
   So the biggest reason the Jets have explored trading Johnson is
because the team expects a bitter, and possibly impassable,
contract fight. Especially considering that the team has a rocky
relationship with Johnson's agent, Jerome Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about his contract situation, at all,''
said Stanley. ``As for any trade talks, I can't comment on
speculation or rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger for the Jets is that if the trade does not go
through, they risk angering Johnson, leaving them with a bitter
star player on their roster for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all speculation,'' Stanley said. ``No one knows what
Keyshawn would think if this were true.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Mahmoud Darwish, the poet whose lyrical
writings have long been a touchstone of Palestinian national
passions, was banned from Israel and the occupied territories for
nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now he finds himself watching _ still from afar, but with
considerable bemusement _ as his poetry becomes a weapon in the
hands of right-wing Israeli politicians who would like to bring
down the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arabs are always accused of being a nation of poetry,''
Darwish said Monday in an interview in his sunny office in a
Ramallah arts center. ``But it's Israel that now is putting poetry
in the eye of the storm.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm began brewing late last week, when Yossi Sarid, the
iconoclastic education minister, announced that Darwish's poetry
would be included in a new multicultural literature curriculum for
Israeli high school students.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry from hard-liners in the opposition was not long in
coming.
</P>
<P>
   Darwish is ``anti-Zionist and an Israel-hater who calls for the
destruction of the Zionist entity,'' complained one member of the
right-wing Likud Party. His poetry, said a member of the even more
conservative National Union Party, is racist. To impose it on
Israeli students, said a member of the National Religious Party, is
``a Bolshevik decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak weighed in, saying that Israel was not
yet ready for Darwish's poetry to be taught in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the question of whether Israel should have its children
read Palestinian poetry was being argued on the radio, in the
streets and in parliament. Likud leaders said the threat from
Darwish's words was so serious that they would call for a vote of
no confidence in Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot continue to grant legitimacy to the delegitimizing
that is done to us,'' declared Yuval Steinitz, a Likud member of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   For Darwish, the dispute is like the rumbling of a distant
thunderstorm. It is ominous, but there is nothing he can do about
it. His poetry may have infiltrated Israel, but he cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was born in a village in the Galilee region in what
is now Israel, and was educated in Israeli schools and studied
Zionist poetry, he was barred from re-entering the country after he
left in 1970. He has lived in Cairo, Beirut and Paris, and served
until 1993 as a member of the executive committee of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Long after other PLO figures were permitted to return home, the
Israeli prohibition on Darwish remained. The ban was lifted only
four years ago and then only to allow Darwish to live in the parts
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   The poet who once wrote that his homeland is a suitcase moved to
the Palestinian city of Ramallah on the West Bank, about a
20-minute drive and a world away from Jerusalem. Except for one
trip for a funeral, he was not allowed even to visit his aging
mother in the Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   But three months ago, to his surprise, he received a six-month
pass to enter Israel _ a good-will gesture toward the Palestinian
leadership, he believes, from Barak. The pass expires in May.
Darwish fears that the uproar over the teaching of his poetry in
Israeli high school classes could jeopardize a renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel embarrassed, really, by all this,'' he said. ``The
accusation is that I hate Jews. It's not comfortable that they show
me as a devil and an enemy of Israel. I am not a lover of Israel,
of course. I have no reason to be. But I don't hate Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 58, Darwish has written poems that range from dreamy
reflections on love to bitter longing for the Palestine that was
lost when Israel was created in 1948. He writes of the pain of
exile, a state he said he now realizes he may never leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became addicted to exile,'' he said. ``My language is exile.
The metaphor for Palestine is stronger than the Palestine of
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   His preoccupations, however, are taken by Palestinians and
Israelis alike for political statements.
</P>
<P>
   One poem in particular, published in 1987 in Arabic and then
translated into Hebrew, has long rankled many Israelis. Called
``Those Who Pass Between Fleeting Words,'' it is a tirade against
unnamed interlopers in what Darwish calls ``our land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for you to be gone,'' the poem reads. ``Live
wherever you like, but do not live among us. It is time for you to
be gone. Die wherever you like, but do not die among us. For we
have work to do in our land.''
</P>
<P>
   Darwish has said that he did not mean, as some Israeli critics
charged, that he wanted to evict the Jews from Israel. The poem, he
said, was a call for Israel to leave the Palestinian territories it
captured in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
   He now despairs of creating a climate for dialogue through his
poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Israel they start from the point of saying that you have to
love them and then they may be ready to talk to you and know you,''
he said. ``But love is a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most political analysts in Israel, he also believes that
the newest attacks on his poetry are just the pretext for another
round of Barak-bashing by the country's fractious political
parties. ``I don't think the country with the strongest army in the
Middle East is really afraid of a poem,'' Darwish said.
</P>
<P>
   The role of accidental subversive is not one that he seeks or
relishes, he said. He would prefer his life's work to be read for
its literary rather than its political value.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do teach my poetry, they should choose something nice
and light, like my poem about my mother,'' Darwish added. ``But
they can't read me in an innocent way, seeing the beauty of the
poetry and the aesthetic side of it.''

 &HT;    Life after Robert: A millionairess and a maid recall a man they
both loved
 &HT;    By Michael Browning

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Robert Horne's life contained cashmere
and collard greens, diamonds and black-eyed peas.
</P>
<P>
   He was at home in one of the most sumptuous palaces of Palm
Beach, the Via Mizner, and he lived in a modest, foursquare house
with a screened porch on 11th Court, off Australian Avenue. He
drove a shiny Oldsmobile to work _ and an even shinier 1959
Rolls-Royce at work. He handled tens of thousands of dollars in
rent receipts from shops on Worth Avenue, and he was treasurer and
honorary deacon at the Friendship Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   He never lost his way, nor misplaced a penny, in either world.
People who knew him say Robert Horne did the impossible: He bridged
the enormous economic divide between Palm Beach and West Palm
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   When he died of lung cancer nearly two years ago, he bereaved
two women. He was faithful to both to the very end of his life.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was his wife, Missy Horne, who treasures his memory
still. She's in her 60s. ``I don't lie about my age, but I don't
advertise it either,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Rose Sachs, 87, one of Palm Beach's best-known
socialites, whose 40-year relationship with ``my Robert'' bears an
uncanny resemblance to the 1989 movie ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' in
which a black man and a wealthy white woman gradually come to
discover a shared humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' said Missy Horne. ``Whenever they pulled up in
the Rolls-Royce at the Palm Beach Airport, all the porters would
shout, `Here comes Robert! Driving Miss Daisy!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' giggled Rose Sachs. ``They called me `Miss
Daisy.' I would ride up in the front seat with Robert, because we
had so much to talk about. There were people who thought that was
improper, but I didn't care. I loved Robert.''
</P>
<P>
   The two women hug each other and smile, in the lush, flowery
garden of the $350-a-night Brazilian Court Hotel on Palm Beach.
Rose Sachs wears a glittering necklace of topazes and a massive,
glittering gold bracelet that was a gift from her husband,
Mortimer, over half a century ago. Missy Horne wears a simple,
silver letter `M' on a thin chain.
</P>
<P>
   They are two Southern farm girls, who grew up to lead lives as
far removed from each other as the wide leap of the Intracoastal
Waterway allows. Missy Horne is from Sylvester, Ga. Rose Sachs is
from Memphis, Tenn. Both were poor, both from big families. Neither
made it past grade school: Missy to the fifth-grade, Rose to the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Rose Sachs wears Tita Rossi evening gowns while Missy
Horne, until a week or two ago, wore a maid's apron to work.
</P>
<P>
   Rose married a man who became very rich: Mortimer Sachs of Long
Island, the king of Worth Avenue, Palm Beach's ``Mink Mile,'' where
he eventually owned 20 rental properties and another 30 scattered
over the island. She spends the season in Palm Beach and the rest
of the year in a pied-a-terre at the Sherry Netherlands Residential
Hotel on Fifth Avenue in New York. She sold her apartment in Monte
Carlo some years back.
</P>
<P>
   Missy married Robert Horne, the son of an Eufaula, Ala., farmer,
a man who was rich in spirit alone. She goes to Moultrie, Ga., each
year for family reunions. She has never been to Monte Carlo, but
she does remember being taken to dinner by Mortimer Sachs once,
``to some restaurant where we couldn't read the menu, it wasn't in
English.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had two cents when I was a little girl, I thought I was a
millionaire,'' said Rose, who is a millionairess many times over
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in the country, the youngest of 10 children. I grew
up with chickens and cows. My father ran a little country store,
and my mother died when I was 13. After that all I knew was work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very poor. You won't believe this, but lunch was often
a can of creamed corn, mixed with cow's milk, and dinner might be a
can of peas, mixed with cow's milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose married, had a son, but left her husband within a year. She
doesn't go into details. ``I walked out of that house with a baby
in my arms and left everything behind,'' she says. She went to stay
with her brother in Teaneck, N.J., and met Mortimer Sachs at his
New York business, Paris Style Leather, which manufactured ladies'
purses. Sachs, a Columbia University graduate who taught political
economy before going into business with his father, was smitten
with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me if I liked to dance. Well, all Southern girls like
to dance. He asked me to marry him, and I said yes. We were married
50 years. The happiest day in my life was the day I met my husband,
and the saddest was the day he died. We not only loved each other,
we liked each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Missy Horne met her Robert in 1953 in church, one year after she
came to Palm Beach County from Georgia. She liked him the minute
she saw him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a young church man. He didn't drink, didn't gamble.''
They married in 1954, ``and he never let me buy so much as a loaf
of bread. He said: `Your money is your money.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer and Rose Sachs first came to Palm Beach in 1941. ``Land
was cheap as dirt. We started buying up Worth Avenue. They were
just giving it away. We were the first young people to come in
here. We worked like mules.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth Avenue got its name in 1913 when the directors of the Palm
Beach Improvement Co. decided to memorialize Col. William Jenkins
Worth, a hero of the Second Seminole War. But the money to make it
the glittering shopping mecca it is today came out of Sachs'
handbag business in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret of success is hard work, common sense _ and it
doesn't hurt to have a Southern accent, for charm,'' Rose Sachs
said.
</P>
<P>
   But she and Mortimer had one more hidden advantage. They had
Robert Horne.
</P>
<P>
   Unobtrusive, unassuming, yet indispensable, Robert Horne devoted
most of his life to Rose and Mortimer Sachs. He, more than money,
was their living link to Florida. His quiet competence freed them
to concentrate on business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked each other immediately because we were both from the
South,'' Rose said. ``He was such an elegant gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He began to work for us in 1959, and he was with us nearly 40
years. I guess you would call him a major-domo. He ran our house,
the Via Mizner. He drove the Rolls-Royce. He could fix anything. He
made me coffee in the morning. There wasn't anything Robert
couldn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Missy Horne nodded. ``Everybody was crazy about Robert,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert worked for us year 'round, even when we weren't here.
He was part of our family,'' Sachs recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took the responsibility. He was a good man,'' Missy Horne
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean! He was honest as the day is long,'' Sachs exclaimed.
``We would let him hold the rent receipts and checks for thousands
of dollars, and when we got down from New York, there they'd be,
not a penny short.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were married 44 good years,'' Missy Horne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't get over how they called me `Miss Daisy'
whenever I was out with Robert,'' Rose Sachs said. ``It was the
funniest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true. They did,'' Missy Horne said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was a compliment. It meant we had a beautiful
relationship. He had a world of common sense, Robert did,'' Rose
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did,'' Missy agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you stay for lunch?'' Rose asked Missy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, ma'am. I'm sorry. I can't. I've got to be at work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, what a shame! Well, it was so nice to see you again!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs orders lunch: a chicken breast sandwich, a glass of ice
water without ice and some decaffeinated coffee with NutraSweet.
Crotons and palms bloom beside the outdoor table at the Brazilian
Court Hotel, where she has a corner suite of rooms, and
white-uniformed waiters with soft Spanish accents hover and flutter
around her, expertly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Mortimer died 18 years ago. I've tried to look after
Robert's family since then,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer Sachs drew up a will in July 1982, three months before
he died of emphysema, in which he gave all his tangible property to
Rose. He gave $10,000 to St. Edward's Catholic Church, $5,000
apiece to two other servants, Elizabeth Dykes and Walter Span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give and devise to Robert Horne, if he shall be employed by
me at the time of my death, the sum of twenty-five thousand
dollars,'' Sachs wrote. The $25,000 bequest was paid, Missy Horne
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mister Sachs was crazy about Robert,'' she said later, after
work, at her home on 11th Court. ``Not a holiday came, but he gave
him a big check: $3,000 for Christmas, $1,000 for Easter, $1,000
for Thanksgiving. He bought Robert two new cars, Oldsmobiles. New,
paid for, in the driveway. Brand new!

   ``He also gave us stock advice. He'd say: `Buy some of that,'
or, `No, don't put your money there, that's no good.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In return, Robert worked his heart out for them. A lot of
times he'd be over there at 8 o'clock in the morning and he
wouldn't get back until after midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have them over here for dinner,'' Missy Horne said.
``Mr. Sachs loved stuffed cabbage, fried chicken, baked sweet
potatoes... Good Southern food. I even brought him some fried
chicken when he was in the hospital. Mr. Sachs was a nice man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Sachs died in 1982, and it was a funny thing, Robert's dog
died that day, too. Ate one of those big poisonous toads and
died.''
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's death, Rose Sachs sold his holdings on Worth
Avenue for large sums. The 1928 Via Mizner went for $11.9 million
in September 1985. Another property, 200 Worth Avenue, was sold to
Ferragamo for $7.75 million. Rose donated $1 million to Palm Beach
Atlantic College in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept the business up for three years after he died. Then I
asked myself, `Why are you doing this?' So I got rid of the
properties one by one and moved out of Via Mizner and got an
apartment in the Breakers II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived there 14 years, and Robert stayed with me right along.
I could no more think of having anyone else than the man in the
moon. Then Robert said to me one day when he was bringing me my
breakfast on a tray, `I think I might be retiring.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `You are like family to me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `I know.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And so I kept him on another two years, even though he
couldn't do much. Then he retired and then he died, and I moved
here to the Brazilian Court two years ago. I'm having a lot of fun.
I go to parties every night. I entertain a lot. I don't go
backwards. I'm an optimist. What can you do about yesterday? I'm a
tomorrow person.''
</P>
<P>
   Missy Horne is a Sunday person. An old, well-thumbed Bible sits
on the sofa on the screened front porch of her green and white
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I sit and read my Bible,'' she said. ``I'm a
quiet person. I don't watch much TV, just go to church every
Sunday. That's my highlight. Robert was the one who loved to watch
TV: football, baseball, basketball. He loved fishing, and he loved
to play checkers. He was a checker player.
</P>
<P>
   She worked for Rose and Mortimer Sachs, too, for 13 years, until
an illness compelled her to leave. Since Robert died, aged 69, on
Aug. 1, 1998, the two women have drifted apart, each to her side of
the Intracoastal. Missy Horne lays flowers on Robert's grave at
Royal Palm Cemetery and raises collards in her back yard, in his
memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert loved his greens. He could grow anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither widow plans to remarry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already had the best husband a woman could have,'' Rose
Sachs said. ``Why would I want another?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marry again? No, sir. Not after Robert,'' Missy Horne said.
``Robert was one in a million.''

SEX AND SPYING ALL OVER, NONE OF IT SPELLED OUT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Suppose someone took a fancy-shmancy pornographic
movie and edited out everything that cannot be shown on broadcast
television. Without the naughty bits, you'd be left with confusing
scenes of people looking vaguely hungry and speaking in monotones.
But what's the point? It would be like a car without the engine,
like a sundae without the ice cream. It would be like ``Secret
Agent Man.''
</P>
<P>
   This series with a familiar name, beginning Tuesday night on the
UPN network, is a heavy-breathing but lightweight spy tale with
only one thing on its mind. Which it cannot show. Like a
hormone-tortured teen-ager, it sublimates its frustration in
attempts at clever sex talk. The double-entendres are as thinly
veiled as some of the women on display. But there's no payoff.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of all the panting is a hunk named Monk, who works
for an unnamed international agency that somehow protects the
world. As played by Costas Mandylor, who used to be the droopy-eyed
cop on ``Picket Fences,'' Monk is no James Bond. Heck, he's no
Austin Powers.
</P>
<P>
   When first encountered, he is at some kind of mountain inn with
a tall, busty blonde in a small, slinky dress. He's teaching her to
play pool by the embrace-the-student method. ``Nice, long, smooth
stroke,'' he purrs.
</P>
<P>
   Monk's weekend is upended, however, by the arrival of Prima
(Musetta Vander), an operative for a rival spy agency and the love
of his life. He introduces her to the blonde as someone he ``works
with, or against sometimes.'' Prima amplifies, ``Against one
another in the biblical sense, if you know what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Prima's desire to defect to Monk's side puts her at odds with a
criminal mastermind called Vargas, played by Jesus Garcia in a
jumpy impersonation of Ricky Martin that is the only crumb of wit
in this hour. Vargas is holding the world hostage with a secret
weapon called an EMP. (That name, like most of what goes on here,
is never explained.)
</P>
<P>
   Monk is in grave danger, which causes anguish for his lovely
partner, Holiday (Dina Meyer), who of course is madly in love with
him. Holiday's seriousness is indicated by the folded-up eyeglasses
she hangs from her plunging necklines. She and another agent, Davis
(Dondre T. Whitfield), scurry around trying to save Monk's life. At
one point Monk and Holiday rendezvous in a dressing room at a kinky
lingerie shop where she is trying on something with feathers. Or is
that fur?
</P>
<P>
   About that familiar name: In the mid-'60s CBS ran a series
starring Patrick McGoohan called ``Secret Agent.'' It had a catchy
theme, ``Secret Agent Man'' by Phil Sloan and Steve Barri, which
this new series recycles.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's a tip-off that this is supposed to be ironic
nostalgia (or nostalgic irony). Otherwise why is this show being so
smarmily coy in an era when most viewers can switch to a cable
channel and find sex dealt with in a more frank (and occasionally
more mature) manner?
</P>
<P>
   Two of the executive producers of ``Secret Agent Man,'' Barry
Sonnenfeld and Barry Josephson, boast credits including the clever
film ``Men in Black.'' Maybe if you use a lot of imagination, you
can see the kind of clever television show they were aiming at. But
with just a little imagination you can find a better way to kill an
hour.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the fate of the crippled Compton Gamma Ray Observatory
remains up in the air, NASA moved last week to ensure the continued
study of the powerful and mysterious radiations that appear to
signal the most violent phenomena in the distant universe.
</P>
<P>
   NASA selected Stanford University to develop and build the main
instrument for the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope, better
known by the acronym GLAST. The entire project is expected to cost
$326 million and lead to a launching of the telescope into Earth
orbit in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   With a wider field of view and more than 50 times the
sensitivity of comparable space-based telescopes, the new
observatory should give astronomers their best view yet of the
titanic forces released when dying stars explode, dense stars
collide with each other or with a black hole, and the tremendous
gravitational power of supermassive black holes accelerates
particles to phenomenal energies and kicks them out in blazing jets
reaching light-years across space.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists think the telescope may also produce critical
discoveries relating to some of the most formidable quests of
modern cosmology. Gamma rays coming from the most distant sources
could shine a light on the epoch of earliest galaxy formation, a
shadowy time in cosmic history that has so far eluded direct
observation. And if most of the dark matter that presumably
dominates the universe's mass is in the form of hypothetical exotic
particles, collisions of the particles would probably create
detectable gamma rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we know is the sky is aglow in gamma rays,''
said Dr. Brenda Dingus of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, a
gamma ray astronomer advising the project. ``They represent
incredible amounts of energy, are very distant and often flare
suddenly. Their variability is beginning to teach us a lot of
what's going on in the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elliott Bloom, leader of the particle astrophysics group at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, said the new telescope
would be sensitive to ``an ideal energy range for seeing thousands
and thousands'' of especially powerful gamma ray sources.
</P>
<P>
   GLAST is being designed with a sensitivity to detect gamma rays
at high energies ranging from 20 million to 300 billion electron
volts, and probably much higher. This is to be at least 10 times
the capability of a comparable instrument on the Compton
observatory, which has detected about 300 such high-energy objects
over the last nine years. This particular detector on the Compton,
the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope, or EGRET, has reached
the end of its operating life.
</P>
<P>
   Most gamma ray objects can be observed only from spacecraft,
above Earth's radiation-absorbing atmosphere. But a new
ground-based detector in New Mexico, operated by Los Alamos
National Laboratory and eight universities, has been able to record
especially powerful bursts of gamma rays, including one registering
nearly a trillion electron volts, by detecting the showers of
particles produced when an energetic gamma ray hits the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of the Stanford accelerator center to develop the
GLAST instrument reflects the growing alliance between particle
physicists and astrophysicists in the investigation of gamma rays,
as well as most other fields of cosmology. After all, the particle
accelerating machines of today's scientists are puny compared with
the natural forces producing some of these radiations at such
extreme energies.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford team, headed by Dr. Peter F. Michelson, includes
more than 100 particle physicists, astrophysicists and other
scientists from six countries and several American research
institutions. The Department of Energy, which supports particle
accelerator research, is collaborating with NASA on the project.
The Stanford proposal was chosen over a competing plan by the
University of Alabama and the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``GLAST will enable the study of many important cosmological
mysteries where particle physics has fundamental relevance,
including the mechanisms of cosmic particle acceleration, the
physics driving the mysterious gamma ray bursts and the nature of
dark matter,'' Michelson said in a statement announcing the new
telescope project.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful particle accelerations appear to occur at the
cores of some galaxies that are thought to be occupied by black
holes, with masses possibly greater than a billion Suns. Although
the gravity of such objects is so strong that nothing, not even
light, can escape them, material that comes close but avoids being
swallowed is accelerated to energies that produce X-rays and even
more powerful gamma rays.
</P>
<P>
   What are known as gamma ray bursts are brief flares of intense
energy that appear suddenly and randomly in deep space. Some of
these bursts, observed by the Compton spacecraft, may come from the
most powerful explosions known since the Big Bang, the theorized
explosion at the creation of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The design for Glast is based on recent advances in the
detection technology for major particle accelerators and bears no
resemblance to what most people think of as a telescope. Instead of
mirrors or lenses, an array of eight columns composed of thin lead
foil interleaved with silicon strips acts to register impacts of
gamma radiation and determine the location in the sky of its
source. Cesium-iodide calorimeters measure the radiation's energy
levels. An anticoincidence detector is the instrument's first line
of defense, screening out the more abundant background of cosmic
rays.
</P>
<P>
   As planned, the spacecraft bearing the instrument is to be
launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida into a
340-mile-high orbit. Engineers have been asked to design the craft
for a minimum lifetime of five years and a goal twice that long.
</P>
<P>
   Gamma ray astronomers emphasized that Glast and two other small
spacecraft being planned will not be able to replace the Compton
observatory's full capabilities provided by four telescopes. GLAST,
for example, will only include a more advanced replacement for
Compton's EGRET instrument. Only the Compton can monitor the entire
sky continuously on the lookout for new gamma ray sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we can do to save Compton would be good,'' said
Dingus of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   But the $600 million Compton observatory, the largest American
scientific satellite, has been in trouble since one of its three
gyroscopes failed in December. The observatory, in orbit since
1991, is still sending data from three of its main telescopes, all
except Egret, and the other gyroscopes orienting the craft show no
signs of failing.
</P>
<P>
   But under mission rules, flight controllers may be ordered to
send the spacecraft on a controlled suicidal plunge back to Earth,
rather than wait and risk the loss of one or both of the other
gyroscopes. In the latter event, the concern is that when the
17-ton vehicle eventually falls through the atmosphere, parts of it
could land on populated areas. A decision on what to do, originally
expected by the end of February, has been delayed for another
month.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Kniffen, NASA's deputy program scientist for the
Compton project, said engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center
in Greenbelt, Md., were still evaluating procedures to bring the
spacecraft safely down even with the failure of all the gyroscopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are discussions about bringing Compton in,'' Kniffen
said, ``but also considerable support for leaving it up there, if
it can be done safely.''

latest Celebrity 100 ranking, a list of the richest and most
powerful celebrities in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking is based on the combination of income and media
coverage, including the number of cover stories in magazines, press
clips and TV/radio coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Roberts in the top 10 are Lucas, Oprah Winfrey, Tom
Hanks, Jordan, the Rolling Stones, Tiger Woods, Backstreet Boys,
Cher and Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes devoted its cover to singer Britney Spears, whose debut
album sold 11 million copies last year in the United States, mostly
in the teen market.

<P>
   WAS GREENSPAN TOO LATE?
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan usually gets the highest
marks for his economic policy, but Business Week (March 13) detects
``growing murmurs of concern'' about his approach. Critics fear the
Fed waited too late to raise interest rates in its attempt to fight
inflation and now risks pushing the economy into recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``With gross domestic product rising at an astonishing annual
rate of 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999, the worry on
Wall Street _ and among a few anti-inflation hawks at the Fed _ is
that Greenspan allowed the unemployment rate to fall too low, the
stock market to rise too high and too much liquidity to slosh
around the system,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   According to this argument, Greenspan will have to generate a
``growth recession'' _ a situation where the economy grows about 2
percent per year, but job growth slows enough to take the heat off
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   MILLIONAIRE IN THE MIRROR
</P>
<P>
   The next millionaire could be the person staring back at you
from the mirror, says Kiplinger's Personal Finance (March).
</P>
<P>
   ``A growing number of Americans are entering the winner's circle
the old-fashioned way: by working hard to develop, and possibly
sell, a business, or by investing steadily and astutely,'' the
magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   But would you know how to handle it? Lots of people don't.
Wealth brings new tax consequences, different implications for the
kids, and for some people an inability to stop worrying about money
once they've got it. At least you won't be alone: About 9 million
U.S. households have assets of $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Fast Company (March) says new companies are not built to last
these days, but ``built to flip,'' or to be sold or merged out of
existence as soon as the founders make a fortune. This phenomenon
threatens to ``kill the soul of the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Most people work, but the details of work _ or a career _ are
usually absent from most contemporary fiction, Fortune (March 13)
reports. The last time writers dealt with work in detail was the
industrial era between the 1880s and 1930s.

 &HT;    BLACK FARMERS ARRESTED IN USDA PROTEST
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a spirited protest outside the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, 10 black farmers were arrested Monday while about
30 others waved signs and chanted ``no farmers, no food, no
justice, no peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The farmers, mostly from the South, are angry about the
department's handling of a racial discrimination lawsuit settled
out of court last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is getting paid but the farmers,'' said Eddie
Slaughter from Buena Vista, Ga. ``They settled out of court to deny
us access to the justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, farmers do not get automatic compensation
for their claims Those with few records of their dealings with the
USDA can seek to qualify for $50,000 payments, along with tax and
debt relief. Farmers with more complete records and detailed damage
claims may go before an independent arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   The protesting farmers said they had many grievances about the
process. They said USDA has not fired employees guilty of
discrimination and that it has denied debt relief to many
plaintiffs. They said they want the USDA to stop foreclosures until
all settlements are finished and to stop relying on local loan
officers for decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very people who discriminated against us control who gets
paid,'' said Tom Burrell of Covington, Tenn. ``Does that make
sense?''
</P>
<P>
   So far, 60 percent of the 10,540 reviewed cases have been
decided in favor of farmers, said Charles Rawls, USDA general
counsel. More than 4,000 have been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Rawls said the process is working, and that as part of the
settlement, USDA lowered the standard of evidence so that more
farmers would get compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The total case load _ about 20,000 cases _ should be reviewed by
late May, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, approved by a federal judge last April, ended a
class-action lawsuit that accused the USDA of regularly denying
black farmers loans for equipment and other necessary items to
yield crops.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's protest, the latest of several against the USDA, began
on the street outside the department with the farmers demanding to
speak to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who was out of town.
They carried white signs with angry statements such as ``lawsuit
becomes death trap for black farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   They also waved three large American flags _ one upside down.
</P>
<P>
   As some of the protestors walked arm-in-arm to the entrance of
the building, about a dozen police officers moved in. After a brief
sit-in at the steps by the door, the men were arrested, several of
them chanting ``Dan Glickman'' very slowly and in a deep voice.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McAvoy, a USDA spokesperson, said the protesting farmers
were invited to speak with department officials but did not accept.
She declined to comment further about the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 men arrested at the protest were charged with
incommoding, which means they failed to obey a police order. The
charge carries a $50 fine, police said.

   GEORGIA-VOTERS (Covington, Ga.) _ If previous elections were a
blur of policy headlines and angry demands, this year's is more
like an interesting novel that local voters suddenly have the time
and the wherewithal to read. There is a plot, and they are in it.
There's not much doubt who will win Tuesday's primaries in Georgia;
both Bush and Gore are enormously popular here, and none of the
four major candidates has even bothered to campaign here on a
regular basis. But neither inevitability nor prosperity seems to
have dimmed Newton County's interest in this election. No one here

states and pinched a penny's worth (one percent) of the vote from
the major party candidates. But this time, Nader said at a packed

A `SECRET' UPN SHOULD HAVE KEPT TO ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the best thing about a new show is an old song, well, maybe
we're not talking instant Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   But here it is, the ancient theme song from ``Secret Agent'' in
1965. The Johnny Rivers version _ somehow I always heard it as
``Secret Asian Man'' _ leaped as high as No. 3 on the charts back
then.
</P>
<P>
   For UPN's new ``Secret Agent Man,'' which has no other
connection to ``Secret Agent,'' the song has been recovered from
karaoke heaven. It's been rerecorded by a group called the Supreme
Beings of Leisure, but that's probably more than most people care
to know.
</P>
<P>
   Costas Mandylor (``Picket Fences''), who seems more equal than
his co-stars Dina Meyer (``Starship Troopers'') and Dondre T.
Whitfield (``Between Brothers''), might have been found in Sly
Stallone heaven. Though he's shown a taste for comedic drama in the
past, Mandylor is burly and built to order for the heavy lifting of
an action show.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, Barry Sonnenfeld (``Men in Black'') and his
co-producers see Mandylor's character, Monk, as more than muscular
material. They think he can chuck the big, lovable lug stuff and
play debonair.
</P>
<P>
   He's first glimpsed in total James Bond guise _ suave man of the
world, mouthing puns as he entertains a blond playmate in a low-cut
gown. They're playing pool, but mostly just bending over the table
and amusing each other about what they'll be playing next.
</P>
<P>
   If you know your movie rules, the hero must now be interrupted
by business. ``Secret Agent Man'' hardly has the wherewithal to
make an exception. The cueballitus interruptus comes in the form of
another beauty, a brunette named Prima (guest star Musetta Vander).
</P>
<P>
   Prima has been working for an evil organization called Trinity,
which is threatening the world order with some kind of cheesy
pulse-bomb gizmo. She wants to defect to Monk's good-guy
organization, the Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Fine with him, because she's a pulse-bomb gizmo herself in
stringy black undies. And because Monk once spent a night with her,
or some damn thing.
</P>
<P>
   Before you can roll your eyes and yawn, Prima and Monk are on
the run from everyone. Odds are they won't live to see tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But Monk's Agency pals Holiday (Meyer) and Davis (Whitfield)
want to save them, when they're not preoccupied modeling their
black outfits and those little ``M.I.B''-style sunglasses
Sonnenfeld adores so much.
</P>
<P>
   UPN viewers will be disappointed, but perhaps not crestfallen,
to learn that there's a shortage of big explosions in Tuesday
night's premiere. There are a few awkwardly staged fights, though,
with slo-mo and stop-action karate kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers so desperate to avoid primary election results that
they'll watch this show will note that the escapade ends on a note
of utterly counterfeit emotion.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, the show would be better with real-time karate
kicks and stop-action emotions. But that's only a suggestion for
our Men in Blechh.

 By EDWARD WONG and ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two New York City policemen and one former officer
were convicted Monday of covering up the brutal assault on Abner
Louima, a Haitian immigrant, in an emotional verdict that the
defendants' lawyers and families vowed through tears to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants _ Charles Schwarz, Thomas Wiese and Thomas
Bruder _ each were found guilty in federal District Court in
Brooklyn of obstructing justice by conspiring to manufacture a
story for authorities that Schwarz was not involved in the attack
on Louima in the bathroom of a Brooklyn station house in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The horrible details of the assault, in which a police officer
beat and sodomized Louima with a broken broomstick, had been fully
aired at a trial last year. Monday's verdicts spoke to the systemic
problem of whether police officers and officials of the policeman's
union lied to protect their brethren rather than the citizens they
were sworn to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns also were raised in the recent testimony of four
New York police officers who were charged in the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo, a 21-year-old Guinean immigrant, in the Bronx last
February. The officers were acquitted last month of all charges,
which included second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   In the Louima case, Schwarz was convicted in June of violating
the victim's civil rights by helping another officer, Justin Volpe,
torture Louima. Volpe pleaded guilty to attacking Louima and is
serving 30 years in prison. Schwarz, who was thrown off the police
force after his conviction and has been in custody, faces a
possible life sentence. Bruder and Wiese were acquited of beating
Louima in a squad car.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged as a central element in both trials was Schwarz's
role &UR;  &LR; in the attack. After the first trial, Volpe said Schwarz was
not in the bathroom during the attack. And in the second trial,
Volpe testified that it was Wiese, not Schwarz, who was the second
person with him in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   In a disheartening blow to the defense, Judge Eugene Nickerson
instructed the jurors in the second trial that they could convict
the defendants of conspiring to lie about Schwarz even if the
jurors were not sure that he had played the role described by
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The government argued in the monthlong trial that Schwarz had
pinned Louima to the floor while he was tortured, and then lied
about his role with the help of Bruder and Wiese. The defense,
which said it would appeal Monday's verdict, claimed there had been
no plot to exculpate Schwarz because he was innocent from the
start.
</P>
<P>
   The three officers seemed stunned to the point of hysteria
Monday each time the jury forewoman pronounced the word ``guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruder, the first to be convicted, grabbed his neck, squinting
in disbelief, before laying his head on the shoulder of his lawyer,
Stuart London, and bursting into tears.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz sat back in shock when his verdict was read, then
glanced angrily around the courtroom, from his lawyers to his
family to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   After Wiese heard his verdict, he and Bruder met in a tearful
embrace, gripping each other's heads. Moments later, outside the
courtroom, Wiese's mother collapsed to the floor and Wiese dropped
to his knees to cradle her in his arms. ``Get a nurse!'' someone
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder paced the hallway amid a crowd of family and friends,
crying openly and calling out: ``You tell the truth and this is
what happens!''
</P>
<P>
   Andra Schwarz, Schwarz's wife, who has been working to appeal
her husband's earlier conviction, promised to fight Monday's
verdict as well. ``The prosecutors were not seeking the truth,''
she said, in a voice stony with fatigue and disbelief. ``They just
want a conviction. I'm fed up. We're not going to let them get away
with this.''
</P>
<P>
   As he was led out of the courtroom, Schwarz cursed and yelled,
``Why did they do this!'' His lawyer, Ronald Fischetti, said the
ex-officer was ``absolutely devastated.'' He added that he had
asked the authorities to place Schwarz on a 24-hour suicide watch.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants face up to 5 years in prison for Monday's
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Louima was not in the courtroom when the verdict was read, but a
lawyer, Sanford Rubenstein, representing the Louima family, said:
``Today's verdict was a further vindication for Abner Louima. I
hope this sends a message to police all over that they will be held
accountable if they obstruct justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Diallo trial, in which the white defendants killed a
black man, both of the Louima trials have raised questions of
racial bias within the police department. Volpe and the three
defendants in the Louima case are white, while Louima is black.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers in the Louima case suggested that the Diallo
case influenced Monday's verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to ignore the post-Diallo anti-jury sentiment,''
London, Bruder's attorney, said. He added that there were cases in
which juries had made mistakes, and that this was one.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference outside the courthouse, Loretta E. Lynch,
the U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, praised the jury's decision saying
it would help close a traumatic chapter in the city's history.
``There's no greater betrayal of the badge and the brotherhood than
to ensnare a fellow officer in a web of lies and deceit.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Puglissi, first vice president of the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association, called the case ``a witch-hunt by federal
prosecutors'' and said Schwarz was an innocent man and that Bruder
and Wiese had been wrongly convicted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the government faced a daunting task in proving
there was a conspiracy to lie because conspiracies are, by nature,
crimes of secrecy. Although the prosecution introduced reams of
telephone records showing that the defendants spoke with each other
in a blizzard of calls in the days after the assault _ sometimes
only minutes apart _ there were no tapes of the conversations and
no ironclad way to know what was being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of hard evidence, the jury was left with a case
of inferences: Were the defendants joining forces on the phone to
concoct stories, as the government claimed? Or were the three
officers, who had subdued Louima on the street, calling each other
for moral support, discussing his hospitalization and the chance
that they might face repercussions for having injured their
prisoner during the arrest, as the defense maintained?
</P>
<P>
   The lack of concrete evidence also left the jury with the
difficult job of determining the credibility of a parade of
witnesses, many of whom have now testified so many times _ at two
grand juries, two trials and before a host of investigative
agencies _ that it was easy for lawyers on both sides to trip them
up with their own words.
</P>
<P>
   Louima, the first witness to appear, was grilled by the defense
about crucial instances where his account of the attack changed
over time. In his first interview with the police, Louima said his
pants and underwear were pulled down only after he was taken into
the bathroom. Later, however, he said he was led through the
station house with his buttocks and genitals exposed.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to contradicting testimony there also were
several instances where witnesses told their versions of the events
of Aug. 9, 1997, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In a display of raw emotion, Volpe, subpoenaed from prison to
testify, gave his first detailed account of the night of Aug. 9,
1997. He described how he thought he had been punched by Louima on
the street and then, in a tense stand-off in the stationhouse
bathroom, had demanded an apology several times before throwing the
prisoner to the ground and sodomizing him.
</P>
<P>
   After the attack, Louima spent two months in the hospital
recovering from internal injuries that included a ruptured bladder
and colon.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, too, took the witness stand for the first time in more
than 2-and-a-half years of court proceedings and offered an alibi
that had never been heard before. He said he was outside the
station house as the attack occurred, conducting a routine search
of his patrol car for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bruder and Wiese did not take the stand, their stories
were revealed through the testimony of the government investigators
who interviewed them. According to former Deputy Inspector James
Burns, Wiese said he walked into the bathroom moments after the
attack and discovered Volpe brandishing a feces-stained stick with
Louima sobbing at his feet. Bruder told investigators that he saw
Volpe escorting Louima into the bathroom while Wiese was standing
outside the bathroom door playing with the station house mutt,
Midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder and Wiese, each free on $100,000 bail, still face
departmental charges. And all three defendants are named along with
the city, the Police Department and the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association in a $155 million civil lawsuit filed by Louima.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's conviction, Wiese also might have to answer for
charges raised by Volpe on the stand that he was present in the
bathroom throughout the attack on Louima but did nothing.

PROVENANCE QUESTIONED OF `LOST' -- AND FOUND -- WATERCOLORS BY
GEORGIA O'KEEFE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., Texas, N.M.)   By GRETCHEN REYNOLDS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ Eleven years ago, the mysterious discovery of a
``lost'' series of 28 evocative watercolors by Georgia O'Keeffe
elicited almost swooning enthusiasm from art experts worldwide. J.
Carter Brown, then the director of the National Gallery of Art in
Washington, called the works ``a national treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Called the ``Canyon Suite,'' the series became the focus of
elbowing interest from major collectors. In the end the suite sold
for $5 million to a Kansas City philanthropist, R. Crosby Kemper
Jr., who immediately donated it as a seedling gift to his new
Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art and Design in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Times change. In December experts from the National Gallery,
including several who had sung the suite's praises, announced that
the 28 works could not have been painted by O'Keeffe, who died in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Their provenance is now the subject of debate in the art world
and is under investigation by the FBI. One man came forward several
weeks ago to claim that the watercolors were partly his work. At
the same time, a man who is said by some to have forged the works
denied that charge. The dealer who sold the suite to Kemper has had
to refund the $5 million purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Keegan, director of the Kemper Museum, said the affair
had the makings of a significant scam.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in the dusty vest pocket town of Canyon, Tex.,
where Georgia O'Keeffe lived from 1916 to 1918 and taught art at
West Texas Normal College (now Texas A&AMP;M University). It is also
where she embarked on her first truly mature paintings: majestic
studies of the sere, lunar canyonlands and surrounding desert. No
one disputes that some of the watercolors from that era are among
the foundation of all her later work. The question is the origin of
these watercolors.
</P>
<P>
   The Canyon watercolors were not even known to exist until 1988,
when Terry Reid Caballero of Amarillo, Tex., announced that she had
found the set in a package she had received as a gift from her
father-in-law, Emilio Caballero, a former director of the art
department at West Texas. He in turn said he had received the
package from Tim Reid, Terry Caballero's grandfather, who is said
to have been O'Keeffe's lover in Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Caballero said he had never opened the package and did not know
what it contained. Reid, who had died the previous year, left no
documentation concerning the works.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Keeffe experts immediately declared them to be authentic
and striking. With such Southwestern titles as ``Dark Mesa,''
``Purple Mountains'' and ``Dusk in the Canyon,'' they showed
sinuously abstracted buttes, slits, sunsets, and statuesque nudes,
the familiar physical and internal landscapes of the artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seemed so intimate to Georgia's thinking, it's still hard
for me to imagine they're not her work: they were and are
spectacular,''` said Gerald Peters, a Santa Fe art dealer who also
has galleries in New York and Dallas and who acquired ``Canyon
Suite'' from Terry Caballero for $1 million in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after ``Canyon Suite'' was discovered, Barbara Buhler
Lynes, a professor of art history at the Maryland Institute College
of Art, was commissioned by the National Gallery to begin work on a
catalog of OKeeffe's works that would serve as the final arbiter of
the authenticity of various works.
</P>
<P>
   Lynes, now the curator of the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa
Fe, began an intensive study of the paper used by O'Keeffe for her
watercolors. She discovered that the artist used a surprisingly
small range of different papers and that none of those were used in
the ``Canyon Suite'' series.
</P>
<P>
   More damaging, Lynes judged that some of the paper used for
``Canyon Suite'' was unavailable in the United States before 1930
and that some was not available until the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   If that were the case, the watercolors could not have been
produced during O'Keeffe's early stay in Canyon. It is unlikely
that she produced them later, Lynes reasoned, because O'Keeffe
usually painted landscapes when she lived in them. Last November
Lynes omitted the suite from her catalog along with 250 other
works, most of them on paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly unwelcome news,'' Peters said of the
authenticity challenge. Although he recently sent out the drawings
for a separate independent analysis, he said, ``It seems clear at
least some of the works are not by O'Keeffe.''
</P>
<P>
   So whose work is it? Jacobo Suazo, a professed foster son of
O'Keeffe, says the work is his. He recently filed a copyright claim
asserting that he painted three of the disputed watercolors and
that he helped O'Keeffe finish 13 more.
</P>
<P>
   Suazo, 65, did indisputably live with O'Keeffe in Abiquiu, N.M.,
from the time he was 9 until he was 18; she taught him painting
techniques and relied on him to help alleviate her crushing
workload.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd work on dozens of paintings at a time,'' Suazo said.
``But I remember those perfectly.'' He said he saw a reproduction
of a work in the ``Canyon Suite'' series in a local newspaper,
recognized it (``It brought tears to my eyes'') and immediately
went to Kansas City to see the entire series. He rousted Keegan
from his home on a Sunday. ``I realized I did three of them and
some Mother O'Keeffe did,'' he said. ``Some I didn't recognize.''
</P>
<P>
   Suazo soon filed his claim, not to seek physical ownership but
to establish reproduction rights. He is reviewing the new catalog,
and his lawyer said he might file additional copyright claims.
O'Keeffe left Suazo $30,000 in her will.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Rose, a New York art historian and friend of O'Keeffe,
said: ``Georgia left Canyon quite suddenly to return to New York.
It's possible she left a few paintings and other materials
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that someone found the things left in her office and
realized they had a treasure trove,'' she said of O'Keeffe's office
at West Texas University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim Reid died in the spring of 1988, and suddenly in June 1988
Emilio Caballero deeds this unopened package to his
daughter-in-law,'' Rose said. ``Deeds it. Why do you deed something
whose contents you don't know?''
</P>
<P>
   Several other experts said they were suspicious about the
sequence of events surrounding the reappearance of ``Canyon
Suite.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, however, no one questioned it. ``Everyone was so
blinded by the drama and the big money,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Beldon, a supervisory special agent for the FBI in
Albuquerque, confirmed that his office had opened an investigation
into the origins of ``Canyon Suite'' but said that the inquiry was
still ``very preliminary.''

&HT;     BUSH HOPES SUPER TUESDAY WINS WILL ENERGIZE FUNDRAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush is counting on a strong
showing in the 13 Republican `Super Tuesday'' primaries to goose
his fundraising campaign, aides said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared Monday that he's on `a long march to victory'' and
his fundraising chief
</P>
<P>
   A good showing for Bush on Tuesday would help fuel his legendary
fundraising machine, which raised nearly $70 million last year but
now has less than $20 million left.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is planning fundraisers in New York, Newark, N.J.,
Chicago, Michigan and Palm Beach, Fla. and Miami. According to
Bush's finance chairman Don Evans, the goal is to raise between $5
million-to-$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush does well on Tuesday and McCain's challenge evaporates,
that should be enough to tide the campaign over until after the GOP
convention this summer in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   After that, if Bush wins the nomination, the campaign can expect
up to $70 million in federal matching funds, and up to $15 million
from the Republican Party, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's unexpectedly stiff challenge has had an unanticipated
draining effect on Bush's coffers, Evans acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   `You've got one plan that says it's over in February and another
that says it's competitive through the spring,'' he said. `That's
the one we're on.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results here in California and in New York, Ohio,
Georgia, Missouri and eight other states `could indicate who the
nominee's going to be, but we're fully prepared to keep on going,''
Bush told reporters. `I'm looking forward to the contests down the
road as well as the results tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 613 delegates are at stake on Tuesday, with 1,034
needed to win the Republican nomination. So far, Bush has about 194
delegates to McCain's 111, according to calculations by ABC News.
The numbers are approximations because not all delegates selected
are committed to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned through Southern California with polls showing
him in the lead in several of the most important `Super Tuesday''
contests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush toured the Museum of Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in an effort to attract the region's sizable Jewish vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every American must know they are equally American _ no matter
their culture, race or religion, Bush said. ``And those who
practice intimidation and violence will have a determined enemy in
the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, according to the Zogby/Reuters/MSNBC poll,Bush
leads McCain 59.3 percent to 25.6 percent among Republicans whose
votes are the only ones that count toward selection of the state's
162 delegates _ the major prize of Tuesday's primary balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can vote in the non-binding preference ballot or the
`beauty contest,'' as it's called in political circles. Although
this doesn't affect each party's delegate-selection process, it
stands as an important measure of each candidate's popular appeal
and capacity to attract independent and cross-over votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby poll Monday showed Vice President Al Gore in the
overall lead with 30.5 percent, followed by Bush with 26.4 percent;
McCain with 19.9 percent and former Sen. Bill Bradley with 9.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This was good news and bad news for Bush. It was good for Bush
because if he beats McCain in the `beauty contest,'' he dents
McCain's claim to be the GOP candidate most likely to attract
non-Republican votes and win in November.
</P>
<P>
   And it's bad news because it shows Bush slipping to Gore. The
same poll Sunday showed Gore with 27.5 percent in a virtual tie
with Bush at 27.4 percent. McCain had 20.9 percent, and Bradley had
10.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls showed Bush solidly ahead of McCain in Georgia with
54 delegates, Ohio with 69 delegates and Missouri with 35
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Tuesday's second Republican prize with 101
delegates, the Zogby poll showed a tightening race with Bush
leading McCain by 43.4 percent to McCain's 39.5 percent in a
primary restricted to party members. The poll represented a
percentage point drop for Bush and a point gain for McCain over a
similar poll Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York delegates are apportioned by congressional
district.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show McCain ahead in the New England states.

<P>
   Confident in their chances to sew up their parties' respective
contests, Bush and Gore started sniping at each other over the
weekend. Campaigning in Cranston, R.I. Sunday, Gore said an
independently financed television ad praising Bush's environmental
record while criticizing McCain's showed that Bush was in the
pocket of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy Dallas investor Sam Wyly, a Bush acquaintance, came
forward to say he had bankrolled the ad. Both Wyly and Bush denied
there was any coordination between them, which would be illegal
under federal election law.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lashed back at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   `I was somewhat pleased that the vice president took time out of
his schedule to talk about my candidacy,'' Bush playfully joked to
reporters. `The man must have amnesia when he's talking about
campaign funding reform.''
</P>
<P>
   He condemned Gore for his controversial appearance at a Buddhist
temple in Southern California during the 1996 campaign. At that
events, monks and nuns who had taken `a vow (of) poverty,'' as Bush
phrased it, contributed money to the Clinton re-election campaign
and were reimbursed. Federal election law prohibits contributions
by `straw donors.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Maria Hsia, a friend of Gore who helped organize the
event, was convicted of violations of election law.
</P>
<P>
   `I look forward to debate with VP gore at the appropriate
time,'' Bush said. `Right now I'm trying to earn my party's
nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the McCain campaign filed a complaint with the
Federal Election Commission alleging that the Bush campaign
illegally coordinated with Wyly on the TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes responded that the Bush campaign
didn't know the ad was planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. McCain should be ashamed for himself and his campaign for
making allegations that our campaign did something that would be
illegal,'' she said.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ It began early last November with a little yellow
creature named Pikachu, and it hasn't let up yet.
</P>
<P>
   Movie genres, like baseball seasons and presidential campaigns,
have their hot spells and their slumps. For the last four months
movies aimed at children and family audiences have been griddle
hot, one after the other, without a miss. Beginning in early
November with ``Pokemon: The Movie,'' continuing at Thanksgiving
with the huge box office success of ``Toy Story 2,'' then ``Stuart
Little'' right before Christmas and now ``Snow Day'' and ``The
Tigger Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Children's films often do well, especially in the prime family
seasons of summer and the holidays. But this has been an
extraordinary string of successes without a single flop. One need
only go back to last summer to see that this is not always the
case. George Lucas' ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace''
was a major success around Memorial Day, but several other movies
aimed at children, most notably the critically praised ``Iron
Giant,'' dropped with a thud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get that momentum going, you can have a string of
hits,'' said Dick Cook, president of the Walt Disney Motion Picture
Group, which during this period released both ``Toy Story 2'' and
``The Tigger Movie,'' which features Winnie-the-Pooh and friends.
``Especially when people have gone to a movie and they loved it and
they realized what a great experience it was. They are much more
eager to go to the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick, he said, is getting the streak started, as the
one-two punch of ``Pokemon'' and ``Toy Story 2'' did with this one.
``Any time the theatrical marketplace has gone into a slump, it's
always difficult to jump-start it,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Few believe that the current family-movie streak points to any
permanent change in audience habits or to a tectonic shift in the
market, although the demographic of the moment, with baby boomers
raising the so-called echo boomers, would suggest flush times for
family movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there's a major trend here that says anything,
except that families are always looking for movies as a family
activity, and if they feel there are movies out there they'd like
to take their kids to see, they take them to see them,'' said
Robert Levin, president for worldwide marketing at Sony Pictures
Entertainment, whose Columbia Pictures released ``Stuart Little.''
</P>
<P>
   Studio marketing and distribution executives credit the current
streak to a variety of factors. Besides the appetite for more
movies created by the enormous success of ``Pokemon'' and ``Toy
Story 2,'' they note that distribution was almost perfectly spaced
out. Each movie was released on a weekend when there were no other
new family films, and it then had a few weeks to run before the
next family movie came along, again without competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is about timing,'' said Robert G. Friedman, vice
chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture Group, which released
``Snow Day'' as part of a distribution deal with Nickelodeon Films.
``And you must make films that are not just kid-friendly, but
parent-friendly as well, so parents aren't sitting there clawing at
their eyes to get out of the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Ball, president for domestic marketing at Warner Brothers,
which released ``Pokemon'' and ``Iron Giant,'' agreed that timing
was vital. ``When you date your picture and its various components
has to be aligned equally as intelligently as the making of the
picture itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By ``various components,'' he means the marketing tie-ins, like
trinkets at fast-food outlets. That was something ``Iron Giant''
did not have and may have played a significant role in keeping it
from reaching its audience in the summer competition before other
movies came along to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not have a fast-food component,'' Ball said. ``If you
don't have that in this arena, you are behind the starting gate.
You're not only not in the pole position, you're seven or eight
rows back.''

   WASHINGTON _ Goodbye, Bill Bradley. We barely knew ye.
</P>
<P>
   Your quixotic adventure is over. You never won a primary and on
Tuesday elections across the country will reaffirm the polls that
show you badly trailing Vice President Al Gore in every primary
state voting that day.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley himself virtually conceded defeat in a Sunday television
appearance, claiming that he had not given up hope but sounding as
though he actually had.
</P>
<P>
   Next will come the armchair generals to second-guess the reasons
for the quick demolition of a challenge that had once seemed so
promising. But the Democratic presidential election was never
Bradley's to lose.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gore's to win. And he did. It was a rough but clean
fight, compared to the ruthless, dirty brawl on the Republican
side.
</P>
<P>
   The underestimation of Gore by pundits and politicians is the
Democratic story of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore went after Bradley's expensive health plan, mocked his
premature departure from the Senate and compared his relatively
passive support for women, racial minorities and labor to Gore's
own long record in the trenches for those causes. Bradley endlessly
complained that Gore was distorting his record, but Gore was
careful not to go too far. It was more a matter of spin. And that
is fair game in competitive politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has emerged as an aggressive, intelligent, engaging and
energetic politician, characteristics that were largely suppressed
in his role as veep. Forget wooden.
</P>
<P>
   The dull speaker in this campaign was Bradley; Gore has learned
how to shout, laugh and wave his arms around. It's a little
disconcerting but better than being put to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's early verbal gaffes and dramatic organizational shake-up
contributed to a mistaken impression that he could be easily
outwitted and outcampaigned by a liberal Democrat who merely
offered himself as the non-Gore. The fact that he is at the top of
his game came as quite a shock.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic primaries, Gore's eight-year service as
President Clinton's subservient sidekick was not the liability that
it might eventually become in a general election. Gore's
controversial role in the 1996 campaign finance controversies and
his praise for Clinton despite Clinton's dalliance with Monica
Lewinsky were never major issues with the Democrats. Those problems
are left for the Republicans to raise in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Clinton fatigue did Bradley no good. On the
contrary, Gore's experience as second in command in the White House
and his resultant expertise in foreign and domestic policy were
assets. He simply knew more than his rival about the issues they
were discussing, and it showed.
</P>
<P>
   Where Bradley was fuzzy about what he might do in the White
House, Gore was relentlessly specific. He has a plan and a program
for everything, something for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was not helped by the excitement generated by Republican
Sen. John McCain, who attracted many independents who might
otherwise have gone to the Democrat. But it was not McCain who did
him in; it was Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bradley did Gore a favor by doing so well initially.
Gore had been coasting to the nomination, untested and unfit for
battle. The possibility of defeat galvanized him into action.
</P>
<P>
   He got serious about his campaign, sharpened his attack mode and
came out fighting. He was ridiculed for moving his headquarters to
Tennessee and adopting informal earth-tone clothes, but they were
outward symbols of a transformation from a vice presidential
mentality to a campaign mode. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   It was never clear why Bradley ran in the first place. He didn't
seem to want the White House job all that badly. The campaign had
the aspect of an exercise conducted just to see what would happen
if a candidate took the high road.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, a road trod only by angels is not the path to a party's
presidential nomination. And as his campaign faltered, Bradley
strayed from his original abstract ideal to trash Gore for
legislative inconsistency and supposed character faults. But
Bradley's heart never seemed in it.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley reverted to a conciliatory attitude in his final debate
with Gore, suggesting that he means to exit the field with dignity.
He said that he would support Gore if Gore wins the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Very civilized, really. And an outcome that positions Bradley
for an important role in a Gore administration, if there is one.
The vice presidential nomination, however, is likely to go to a
fresher face who is a proven vote-getter.

   The current streak began on Nov. 10, when ``Pokemon'' opened,
catching the craze for the Japanese animated phenomenon at its
crest and earning an astonishing $50.7 million before the end of
its first weekend and another $17 million the following weekend.
With interest in the film beginning to flag, ``Toy Story 2'' burst
into theaters nationwide on Nov. 22 and made $80 million before the
end of the subsequent Thanksgiving weekend and $140 million by Dec.
12. Just as that film was beginning to lose a bit of its box-office
steam (though it remained quite strong for weeks to come), ``Stuart
Little'' appeared on Dec. 17 and earned $15 million in its first
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Critical reaction to these films was all over the map. While
``Toy Story 2'' was almost universally praised and ``Stuart
Little'' received a number of favorable reviews, the others drew a
more mixed reaction and it was difficult to tell what difference,
if any, the reviews made. With ``Pokemon,'' certainly, the puzzled
reactions of critics seemed to have little impact on young
moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Pokemon'' was not unexpected, though the size
of the numbers was startling to many. And everyone expected ``Toy
Story 2'' to dominate the Thanksgiving box office, which is why no
other family films opened anywhere near it. But ``Stuart Little''
was something of a mystery before its opening.
</P>
<P>
   Costing more than $100 million to produce, it boasted the latest
computer animation to bring E.B. White's mouse-boy to life but did
not have a franchise as foolproof as Pokemon or ``Toy Story.'' And
the movie's opening, to a much smaller audience than the previous
two films, attested to that. But ``Stuart Little'' had the
Christmas period pretty much to itself, young children loved it,
and family audiences embraced it. The film dropped only 21 percent
at the box office in its second week and then, in the week between
Christmas and New Year's, it actually increased its box office take
by 36 percent, earning $136 million by the middle of February.
</P>
<P>
   Many expected the family-movie streak to cool with the arrival
in force of films geared to attract Oscar nominations in the first
months of the year and with children back in school. But the tandem
releases of ``Snow Day'' and ``The Tigger Movie'' on Feb. 11, in
time for the President's Day weekend, proved that wrong. Both films
not only performed well, they also did much better than expected,
and both have reasons to brag, perhaps ``Snow Day'' most of all.
</P>
<P>
   The slapstick comedy about what happens when a snowstorm gives
children a day off from school was aimed at marginally older
audiences than some of the other releases but was propelled into
theaters on the strength of the Nickelodeon banner. The splotchy
orange Nickelodeon logo is almost as familiar and beloved to young
people as the Walt Disney fairy castle, and the power of the
various Nickelodeon-affiliated cable channels to reach young
eyeballs guaranteed that news of the movie's arrival would be known
among children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that there has been a dearth of family movies in
general,'' said Albie Hecht, president for film and television
entertainment at Nickelodeon. ``By that I mean movies that parents
really enjoy as well. You had very extreme action films and very
extreme teen films but very few attempting to do really broad-based
comedy for the whole family. It's something that Hollywood
abandoned for a long time, and we're trying to fill a void.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Nickelodeon logo alone cannot create a hit. ``Harriet
the Spy'' and ``Good Burger,'' two previous Nickelodeon efforts,
failed to catch fire at the box office. Hecht said the success of
``Snow Day'' came from its being aimed more clearly at family
audiences, rather than at children alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that brand is important to the initial success of
`Snow Day,''' Friedman said. ``But after that it comes down to word
of mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   What Nickelodeon marketing executives are seeing now, to their
great delight, is that young parents who watched Nickelodeon as
youngsters now are beginning to have children of their own, and
there is a second generation of brand loyalty, something that, in
the family arena, only Disney has had, going back to the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   When marketing executives try to explain the success of films
that were not necessarily expected to do so well, they often look
for time-proven hooks upon which to hang their reasoning. For the
current crop of family movies that has been easy. Pokemon, ``Toy
Story'' and Winnie-the-Pooh were reliable franchises with a proven
ability to attract young audiences. ``Stuart Little,'' while not
quite to their promotional level, was based on a beloved children's
book. But ``Snow Day'' came into the marketplace relatively
unheralded, with only the Nickelodeon brand behind it and a pitch
aimed a bit higher than the ``Pokemon'' or ``Tigger'' audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' made $14 million in its first weekend, only
marginally less than ``Stuart Little'' had made during the
holidays, and like ``Stuart'' it held on at the box-office through
strong word of mouth, dropping only 20 percent in its second
weekend and 28 percent in its third, when it was still the No. 2
movie in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tigger'' also had a charmed life. Though it opened with only
minimal advertising and in very few of the large urban theaters, it
earned $9 million in its first weekend and $8 million in its
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any advertising in the major city newspapers,''
Cook said. ``We went to the suburban papers. That's where we
believe the audience is, so we wasted no dollars on an audience
that wasn't going to be interested in seeing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The film had also been promoted during showings of ``Toy Story
2,'' which helped.
</P>
<P>
   How long the streak will last is anybody's guess. Perhaps the
first indication will come this week when ``My Dog Skip'' has its
first shot at wide, national distribution. The movie, based on
Willie Morris' memoir of his childhood pet, has played for several
weeks in limited release and earned some good reviews but
lackluster box office revenue. Now, however, Warner Brothers hopes
to capitalize on the current spate of family hits and on the recent
success of the film's young star, Frankie Muniz, who is featured in
the hit television series ``Malcolm in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, on March 31, DreamWorks will release its next animated
feature, ``The Road to El Dorado,'' with Kevin Kline and Kenneth
Branagh providing the voices in a kind of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby
road movie set in 17th-century Central America.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, neither of them will meet the fate of ``Iron Giant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in many respects, we're learning a little bit better
what we're doing,'' Ball said. ``Of course a lot of it may just be
coincidence and luck.''

 &HT;     McCAIN LOOKS BEYOND GOP IN BID FOR SUPER TUESDAY UPSET  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sen. John McCain on Monday wrapped up a
make-or-break bid to wrest the Republican presidential nomination
from Texas Gov. George Bush with a fiery ``call to duty'' for
Republicans and non-Republicans alike to help him repudiate the
influence of ``dirty money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republican barnstormed the length of California on
the eve of what amounts to a national GOP primary _ 613 convention
delegates at stake in 13 states stretching from California to New
England.
</P>
<P>
   McCain fought Bush's wide lead in polls in most of the states
with an impassioned appeal for voters to join his insurgency and
repudiate a $2.5-million advertising blitz in California, New York,
Ohio and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   McCain accused two billionaire brothers _ Sam and Charles Wyly
of Texas _ of financing the ads that attack his environmental
record and demanded for the first time that Bush ask his supporters
to end the attack.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, claiming the integrity of the ``whole political
process'' is being threatened by violations of laws adopted after
the Watergate scandal, demanded immediate remedial action by the
Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told students on the Los Angeles campus of the University
of California that ``a couple of billionaires from Texas'' are
trying to ``steal this campaign; they're trying to hijack it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain asked voters support his campaign on Tuesday and send a
message ``to Governor Bush and his cronies (to) take that dirty
money and give it back to the state of Texas, we don't want it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain cautioned that with ``lots of billionaires'' in the
nation, ``we're going to see the disappearance of politics in
America'' if the Bush supporters are ``allowed to come into the
last few days of an American political campaign and spend millions
and millions and millions of dollars in attack ads.''
</P>
<P>
   At an earlier stop in Santa Cruz, McCain declared: ``We'll let
the people of California decide who they want to be the next
president of the United States _ not some people, some billionaires
from Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign spokesman Howard Opinsky said that McCain hopes
to persuade non-Republican voters, particularly in California,
cross party lines and support his campaign rather than vote in
Democratic races to support former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of Tuesday's 13 GOP contests are open to non-Republican
voters, including a largely symbolic contest for the popular vote
here in California. Polls show Bradley trailing Vice President Gore
in Tuesday's Democratic contests in 16 states.
</P>
<P>
   So far in the primary season, Bush has about 194 delegates to
McCain's 111, according to calculations by ABC News. The numbers
are approximations because not all delegates selected are committed
to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign aides said the best-case scenario for the
challenger on Tuesday would be sweeping five New England states and
New York and capturing the popular vote in California.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats and independents can cross party lines, only
Republican votes count toward deciding who gets California's 162
delegates to the Republican nominating convention. Bush holds a
wide margin over McCain among Republicans, according to polls.
</P>
<P>
   McCain addressed rallies in Santa Clara, Los Angeles and San
Diego on the eve of Super Tuesday contests that will select 60
percent of the 1,034 delegates needed to win the GOP presidential
nomination at the national convention in Philadelphia in July.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to more than 1,000 students crowded onto one of three
basketball courts in the gym at Santa Clara University, McCain
sought to bolster his anti-establishment credentials with attacks
on President Clinton and the Congress, as well as Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our crusade is about saying come and serve and sacrifice and
be ennobled,'' said McCain, a former Navy pilot and Vietnam War
prisoner whose campaign ads cite his ``courage and character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a call to duty. This a call of duty to awaken the
spirit of America that has been dormant for some period of time,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spoke before a red, white and blue campaign banner,
``It's your country. Take it back from the special interests,''
that was designed to strengthen his populist appeal in an
independent-minded state where many voters turned their backs on
the Democratic and Republican nominees in 1992 to support
independent Ross Perot. Perot won 21 percent of the vote in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won a boost in his efforts to exploit Bush's Feb. 2
controversial appearance at Bob Jones University, an evangelical
Baptist institution in Greenville, S.C., that banned inter-racial
dating until last week and has promulgated anti-Catholic teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Privett, a Jesuit priest and the provost leading the
7,700 students at Santa Clara University, contrasted McCain to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had chosen to speak at an ``institution whose active
promotion of intolerance and divisiveness undercuts its claim to be
a university.'' McCain, he said, had chosen to address a
139-year-old ``Jesuit Catholic university that cherishes our
diverse community.''
</P>
<P>
   Privett hailed McCain's efforts to ``promote a more inclusive
political process that the promotes the common good of all rather
than pitting people against one another.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, McCain's allure to some Democrats is proving so
appealing that Chris Stampolis, a Democratic Party leader in the
Santa Clara state assembly district, made the rounds among
reporters covering McCain's rally to emphasize that many Democrats
would return to Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that some moderate Democrats are excited
by McCain and drawn to his campaign,'' Stampolis said. ``But we
think these Democrats will vote for Gore in the end. Once they
learn about McCain's positions on the issues, they'll realize that
Gore will be the only candidate in the mainstream.''

</P>
<P>
   Opinsky said that once McCain emerges from Tuesday's contests,
he would gain additional benefits from Bradley's expected
withdrawal from the race against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky said that Gore then would increasingly focus his
campaign attacks on Bush rather than Bradley, in a shift that
McCain hopes will enhance his claim that he would be a more
effective challenger to Gore in the race for the White House in
November.

ETHIOPIA'S ROADBLOCK TO PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A nation where 8 million people are threatened by famine would
be wise to end a senseless war immediately. Ethiopia ought to
accept an African peace plan that calls for the peaceful settlement
of its border dispute with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Yet late last month fighting broke out, as it has periodically
since heavy combat ended last June. Eritrea blames Ethiopia, but
whatever really happened, it is clear that Ethiopia is presenting
the biggest roadblock to peace.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of African Unity devised a peace plan last
summer that provided for a withdrawal from contested areas and the
demarcation of the border by disinterested outsiders. This would be
a textbook example of how a regional organization settles a border
dispute if the Ethiopians would only agree to accept the plan in
full.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are haggling over the precise nature of the
withdrawal and whether any weapons will be allowed in the disputed
zones. These issues could be resolved with a minimal amount of good
will. Ahmed Ouyahia, an OAU mediator, was in the region last week
in an effort to help out.
</P>
<P>
   So was Anthony Lake, former national security adviser to
President Clinton, who shuttled between the two capitals. Once the
peace plan is accepted, the United States would almost certainly
finance a peacekeeping operation in the disputed area.
</P>
<P>
   The war is fueled by more than boundary disputes. Since Eritrea
broke off from Ethiopia in 1991, the two countries have yet to
devise an economic relationship that combines interdependence with
independence. Eritrea controls the two ports through which most of
Ethiopia's seaborne commerce flows, while the 59 million Ethiopians
are prime customers for anything the 3.9 million Eritreans have to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   As it did 15 years ago, when it was fighting to prevent Eritrean
independence, Ethiopia today faces a famine that could kill
hundreds of thousands of people. Ethiopia was then ruled by
Mengistu Haile Mariam, a brutal dictator. The international
community needs to remind the present rulers, a more democratic
group, that it must end the war to avert another humanitarian
catastrophe.

`MAKE BELIEVE': IN THE FANCIFUL HEAD OF A SMALL BOY IN BIG
TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joanna Scott's characters have always been preoccupied by the
randomness of life, the uncertainty, even perversity of existence.
The men and women in ``Various Antidotes'' (1994) coped by
filtering their lives through a solitary obsession, be it the study
of bees or mice or the compulsive reliving of a traumatic event;
and in ``Arrogance'' (1990), the painter Egon Schiele used art to
try to control the world around him, remaking people and things to
conform to the lineaments of his own imagination.
</P>
<P>
   In Scott's uneven new novel, ``Make Believe,'' the hero is a
little boy named Bo who processes the tumultuous events that keep
overtaking his life through fantasy, stories and childish logic.
Bo's father was shot to death in a robbery attempt and died a month
before Bo's birth; his mother was killed in a car accident when he
was 3; and one of his grandmothers will die in a freak accident the
following year. Bo's custody will also be decided by seemingly
random events: the judge presiding over his case will allow his
decision to be affected by his own marital problems and a novel he
happens to be reading.
</P>
<P>
   The opening sections of ``Make Believe,'' which depict Bo's
experience of the car accident that killed his mother and his new
life with his paternal grandparents are as powerful as anything the
gifted Scott has written. They possess the unsettling intensity of
Benjy's interior monologue in Faulkner's ``Sound and the Fury,''
immersing the reader in the slip-sliding world of a child's
imagination, a world at once egocentric and rudderless, a world of
bright, shimmering sensations and fragmentary knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Bo experiences the accident as a strange succession of thuds,
like the thuds he ``made when he slid under his mama's bed and
kicked the mattress,'' with glass bursting into stars, and metal
bubbling ``with a noise that reminded him of secret laughter.''
Still, he realizes that what ``could happen was always worse than
what he could imagine,'' worries that the people in the hospital
who are poking and prodding him are capable of ``actions as awful
and mysterious as the sea creatures living at the bottom of the
ocean.'' It was his fault, he thinks, because ``everything was his
fault'' but at the same time, he imagines that ``everything that
happened to him now happened for a reason beyond his control.''
</P>
<P>
   From Bo's point of view, Scott shifts angles to sketch in the
lives of his family: his mother, Jenny, a rebellious young woman,
on the outs with her family for having a child with a black man;
his father, Kamon, who was shot outside a grocery store while
buying cigarettes for his cousin; Jenny's mother, Marge, a large,
complacent woman under the thumb of her self-righteous husband,
Eddie Gantz; and Kamon's parents, Erma and Sam Gilbert, who take Bo
in after Jenny dies.
</P>
<P>
   As a custody battle for Bo shapes up, however, Scott's
elliptical narrative inexplicably lapses into stark made-for-TV
melodrama: the Gilberts, who are black and who have been part of
Bo's life since he was born, pitted against the Gantzes, who are
white and who scorned Bo's mother, Jenny, when she became pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, we are told, that the Gantzes have taken a sudden
interest in Bo is that Eddie Gantz believes there is a lot of money
to be made by filing a malpractice suit against the doctors who
cared for Bo after the accident. Scott not only gives Eddie the
basest reasons for wanting custody of Bo, she later turns him into
a caricature of an abusive father, bullying the boy and beating him
and accusing him of being a devil who disrupted his perfect life.
</P>
<P>
   Though there has always been a gothic strain in Scott's writing
_ one of her novels depicted a grisly act of mutiny aboard a
19th-century slave ship; another portrayed an obsessive taxidermist
and the bizarre people around him _ this venture into family soap
opera does not mesh with the overall conception of ``Make
Believe.'' It stands in stark contrast to the carefully calibrated
depiction of the hazards of ordinary life that distinguished the
opening half of the book, and it turns the characters into hapless
puppets dancing spastically to their creator's whims.
</P>
<P>
   Although the penultimate chapter of ``Make Believe,'' which
sends Bo's life skidding off in yet another direction, contains a
dazzling set piece that showcases all of Scott's virtuosic skills,
it grows out of a willfully contrived situation, and so feels less
like an organic conclusion to this story than a showoff-y piece of
writerly legerdemain. In short, a disappointing and stage-managed
end to a novel that started off with such subtlety and promise.

   In California, McCain's allure to some Democrats is proving so
appealing that Chris Stampolis, a Democratic Party leader in the
Santa Clara state assembly district, made the rounds among

<P>
   ``There's no question that some moderate Democrats are excited
by McCain and drawn to his campaign,'' Stampolis said. ``But we
think these Democrats will vote for Gore in the end. Once they
learn about McCain's positions on the issues, they'll realize that
Gore will be the only candidate in the mainstream.''

A TRULY GLOBAL VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Congress considers broadening trade relations with China,
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers rightly argues that the
question must be viewed in terms of its benefits to Americans
rather than as a present to the Chinese. Chinese membership in the
World Trade Organization is the single most important decision for
the United States this year, Summers asserts. He is right.
</P>
<P>
   International trade plays an enormous role in sustaining
America's impressive record of economic expansion with low
inflation. Continuing that record pace will be more likely if China
is in the WTO as an active trading partner operating under WTO
rules and standards. American access to Chinese markets will expand
significantly through admission to the WTO. American exporters will
benefit from those markets, and American consumers will continue to
take advantage of low-cost Chinese products.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats in Congress, including some from Massachusetts,
oppose China's entry into the WTO out of an excess of sympathy with
organized labor, which argues that US jobs would be lost to cheap
foreign labor. In reality, the greater danger is that America will
turn inward, as it did in the 1920s with disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, who met with Globe editors and writers Monday following
his participation in Boston College's conference on the link
between exploding technologies and the American economy, places
heavy emphasis on a number of international problems that, if
resolved, would stimulate global economies. One is relieving debt
burdens of countries that spend more on interest payments than on
educating children. Another is eradicating the half-dozen diseases
that kill a million children a year worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Summers calls tariff reductions the biggest tax cut the world
has ever seen. Domestically, he favors paying down the federal debt
as ``the best tax cut Americans can get,'' since it reduces the
amount on which interest must be paid and lowers interest rates on
the amount remaining. It is a dynamically conservative approach
that deserves support.

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China's renewed threat of war against Taiwan
has caused anxiety in the West, but Beijing's military options for
attacking the island remain limited and impractical, a fact often
overlooked in the furor in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Though China's army outnumbers Taiwan's six to one, the country
lacks a transport fleet large enough to ferry a major invasion
force across the narrow Taiwan Strait. And even if it could muster
the ships, China does not have the means to secure control of the
sea or air separating it from the island to carry out such a
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way at this moment that Beijing has the weapons in
its arsenal in sufficient numbers to undertake and sustain a major,
full-scale assault on Taiwan,'' says Jonathan Pollack, a China
specialist at Rand Corp. in California.
</P>
<P>
   China does have nuclear weapons, but using them against avowed
compatriots in Taiwan is highly unlikely. Most Western military
experts say it will be years, if not decades, before the mainland
mounts a credible threat.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's vow to use force, made in a policy paper last month
and repeated in an editorial in a military newspaper on Monday, is
meant to warn Taiwan away from formal independence and push it
toward serious negotiations on reunification with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing still regards Taiwan as its territory, occupied by the
nationalist authorities who fled there during China's civil war in
the 1940s. But forcing the island to the table is a delicate game;
were Taiwan to survive a misguided mainland military campaign, it
would probably declare independence and win widespread diplomatic
support abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing does have alternatives to an invasion, though none of
them seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   The option that experts in Taiwan and the West take most
seriously, because it is the one most available to China today,
would be a short, Kosovo-like missile campaign intended to
devastate Taiwan's economy _ either by direct strikes on sites in
Taiwan or by disrupting shipping lanes. China has hundreds of
short-range ballistic missiles pointed at the island.
</P>
<P>
   Supplemented with information warfare _ using computer viruses
and electromagnetic pulses to knock out Taiwan's communications and
transportation infrastructure, for instance _ and perhaps sabotage
by Beijing's agents on the island, incoming missiles could
demoralize Taiwan's people and undermine support for Taipei from
the island's business elite. Many in that group have investments on
both sides of the strait and might prefer political compromise to
economic ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it didn't work, Beijing may not be greatly harmed by great
loss of forces, as may be the case with other options,'' said Eric
McVadon, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former defense
attache in Beijing. He says this is the option he worries about
most.
</P>
<P>
   But the domestic risks if such a strategy failed would be dire.
McVadon adds that such a dramatically belligerent act could isolate
China diplomatically and halt most exports to the United States and
other major markets.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment might dry up, as it did in the year after
Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen
Square in 1989. China's economic engine, still dependent on export
revenue and foreign investment inflows to keep its people employed,
would probably sputter and slow to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   China's economy is already at low ebb and so in some ways is
more fragile than in 1989. The country has spent billions of
dollars to prop up slowing economic growth in the last two years
and cannot afford to do this indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in China's industrial northeast is especially high
_ 30 percent in some regions _ and the economic shock that would
follow military action against Taiwan would worsen conditions for
many already disgruntled people. If an action against Taiwan
failed, Beijing could face a groundswell of domestic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A defeat would mean the end of the regime,'' says a Hong
Kong-based economist who asked not to be identified. ``The risk to
the party is far more than just more economic stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a brutal approach, meanwhile, would cast China as an
international pariah and reverse decades of diplomatic confidence
building. Beijing is still stinging from the international
condemnation that followed the killings of protesters near
Tiananmen Square. The trade concessions it has offered so that it
can join the World Trade Organization are, in part, an attempt to
erase that legacy. The deal is contingent upon Congress ending its
annual review of China's trade status, an exercise put in place
after the Tiananmen crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, China is years from being able to actually ``take''
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Any large-scale attempt to cross the strait would be obvious for
weeks ahead of time as China massed men and equipment on its
shores. And once at sea, such a force would be sitting ducks for
Taiwan's air force or even two submarines positioned at either end
of the strait.
</P>
<P>
   China's chief problem is air cover: It has far more planes than
Taiwan, but most are out-of-date blowflies compared with Taiwan's
jets. The 72 SU-27 fighters that China has bought from Russia could
outmaneuver Taiwan's aging F-5s, but probably not the island's 150
F-16s, 60 French Mirage 2000s or air defense batteries, which
include advanced Patriot missiles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Equally daunting are the numerous ground and airborne radar
systems that the United States has supplied to Taiwan to coordinate
air and sea assaults.
</P>
<P>
   China lacks the technology in its offensive forces to cope with
those defenses, military experts say, though it is trying to
acquire such technology from Russia and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   China does have air-defense missiles, but they lack the range
and ability to effectively clear the strait's skies long enough to
permit safe movement of an invasion force.
</P>
<P>
   The best China could hope for would be to disable Taiwan's air
force by pounding its airfields and communications centers with
short-range ballistic missiles and then land enough men to take an
airport or another strategic installation, giving them a base to
build on.
</P>
<P>
   But the chances that such an isolated invasion force could
survive would be slim, while the chances that those soldiers would
end up as prisoners and bargaining chips for Taipei is high enough
to argue against this course of action.
</P>
<P>
   China could seize one or two of Taiwan's outlying islands;
Jinmen and Matsu lie just a few miles off the mainland's coast. But
those islands are heavily fortified with thousands of Taiwanese
troops, and so the cost of taking them would likely be high and the
gain slim.
</P>
<P>
   Or Beijing could attempt a naval blockade, hoping to bring
Taiwan to heel.
</P>
<P>
   China's navy has enough ships to enforce a quarantine. And the
island's economy is almost entirely dependent on trade, including
imported oil. Taipei might buckle to domestic pressure and
negotiate terms of reunification if its factories stopped running.
</P>
<P>
   But coordinating such an action is far more complex than
anything China's navy has attempted before. And blockades are
easier to circumvent than to sustain.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Taiwan might decide to fight rather than negotiate if
backed into a corner, something that could prove disastrous for
Beijing because it is outgunned both at sea and in the air.
</P>
<P>
   For now, China's most likely military action will be more war
games and other training exercises in the coastal provinces facing
Taiwan. China has mounted such maneuvers many times before, most
recently in September. The size and threatening nature of those
exercises could increase, but they are likely to remain games for
now.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, China's is working to remedy its relative impotence
by upgrading its arsenal. It is improving the accuracy and number
of short-range ballistic missiles aimed at the island and is
developing a land-attack cruise missile with accurate ``terminal
homing'' _ in other words, a ``smart'' bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has agreed to supply China kits for 200 more SU-27 jet
fighters, and Beijing reportedly will soon buy even more advanced
SU-30s. And Israel is expected to supply China with an airborne
warning and control system mounted atop Russian IL-76 jets that
could be used for battle management.
</P>
<P>
   But the new weapon systems will not necessarily shift the
balance of power in China's favor anytime soon. Taiwan will also
continue to improve its arsenal and operational skills. And it will
take years before China's military is proficient enough to use the
high-tech weapons effectively in a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troops equipped with weapons produced by various countries are
virtually incapable of integrating them in modern, high-tech
warfare,'' said Wang Weixin, a senior researcher at China's
Military Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, quoted this week in China's armed forces mouthpiece,
Liberation Daily, was talking about Taiwan's troops, but the
judgment applies equally to those of his own country.

AMD BEATS INTEL TO MARKET WITH 1-GIG MICROCHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first desktop computers to use ultrafast one-gigahertz
processors are coming to market months ahead of schedule, and with
no ``Intel Inside'' stickers on the box.
</P>
<P>
   In a public relations coup, rival chipmaker Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. has begun shipping the new one-gigahertz version of
its Athlon processor chip. That puts AMD out in front of industry
leader Intel Corp., which is expected to introduce its own
one-gigahertz chip later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Most PCs use chips that are compatible with the ``X86'' design
created by Intel. But AMD has snatched the speed lead from Intel
with the Athlon, a line of processors the company introduced last
year. The first Athlons ran at 500 megahertz, leading Intel to roll
out faster Pentium III chips to keep up. Last month, AMD took the
lead with an 850-megahertz chip, compared to Intel's 800-megahertz
Pentium III. Now AMD is offering Athlons at 900, 950, and 1,000
megahertz, or one gigahertz.
</P>
<P>
   Two leading computer makers, Compaq Computer Corp. of Houston
and Gateway 2000 Inc. of San Diego, say they're ready to begin
making computers armed with the new chip, the fastest
Intel-compatible processor on the market. Gateway is already taking
orders for the machines, with a base price of $2,999. Compaq will
start taking orders Thursday, with prices starting at $2,499.
</P>
<P>
   These are steep prices at a time when most personal computer
systems sell for $1,000 or less. That's partly because the Athlon
chip alone will cost $1,300. But then, Compaq and Gateway are
aiming their new systems at hard-core home users who want the best
of everything. The systems come with huge hard drives, high-end
stereo speakers, and advanced graphic accelerator cards. That makes
the systems well suited for high performance when playing
three-dimensional computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Vena, Compaq's director of consumer desktop product
marketing, estimated Monday that about 20 percent of Compaq's
retail customers are likely customers for the new machines. ``These
are people who are well, well beyond PlayStations or Dreamcasts.
These are people who are looking for the ultimate entertainment
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq system also comes with video editing software and
FireWire data ports that will let users download digital camcorder
videos directly into the computer. Vena said the high-powered
Athlon processor will allow for quick and easy desktop video
editing.
</P>
<P>
   Both AMD and Intel had previously said they'd bring out
one-gigahertz chips later this year. But AMD is moving quickly to
capitalize on the success of the Athlon. It's the first AMD chip
considered equal in quality to Intel's top products. Meanwhile,
Intel has recently stumbled due to an inability to meet high demand
for its Pentium III chips. Gateway, for instance, had stopped using
AMD chips in its computers. But the company changed its mind and
started using Athlons, partly to make up for a shortage of Pentium
chips.
</P>
<P>
   Intel spokesman Michael Sullivan seemed unconcerned about AMD's
latest accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about having the first news release,'' Sullivan said.
``I don't think that the competitive environment has changed today
in any way. We fully plan to be the leader in this segment with the
fastest chips and the most of them.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds like pointless chest-thumping to chip industry
analyst Linley Gwennap, principal analyst of the Linley Group in
Mountain View, Calif. ``I think it's more of a race of testosterone
than technology,'' said Gwennap, adding that AMD can produce only
limited quantities of the Athlon and has therefore priced it high
enough to scare most customers away. ``Thirteen hundred dollars for
the chip? That's like slapping a big, red sign on them saying
`Don't buy me.' ''

SYDNEY BRENNER, A CEASELESS IDEA-GENERATOR IN MICROBIOLOGY'S GOLDEN
AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: South Africa, Britain, France, Lithuania, Wis., Calif.,
Mass. ) (Science Times) (DW) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ Sydney Brenner's picture window apartment
overlooks a children's playground and a kelp-strewn beach where
surfers contest with the Pacific. The balmy California scene is a
far cry from the little South African town of Germiston where he
grew up, and the biting winds of Cambridge in England where he
worked for many years.
</P>
<P>
   That journey spans a scientific career of unusual versatility.
Brenner, who is now the inventor-guru of a new biotechnology
company after retiring from the British Medical Research Council,
has been a leading molecular biologist for nearly half a century.
In a career of unquenchable creativity, he has always kept moving,
searching for new and different problems to tackle, founding a new
field as soon as the old one seemed stale.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner played a starring role in the Golden Age of molecular
biology _ the years from 1953 to 1966 when the high mysteries of
the genetic code and protein synthesis were worked out. He is also
one of the architects of the present Genomic Era, brought about by
machines that can decode an organism's entire DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often you read these potted biographies of great scientists,
and when you meet them in real life they are not much different
from other people, but Sydney was very different,'' said Dr. John
White, a former graduate student of Brenner now at the University
of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   A ceaseless flow of ideas, some successful, some less so, is one
of Brenner's traits. Another is his gift of spellbinding listeners
with his latest enthusiasm. He speaks with distinctive English
diction and in perfectly constructed sentences that often end with
a joke. In the humorless deserts of the scientific literature, a
consistent sparkle of wit is to be found in an iconoclastic column
he writes in the journal Current Biology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sydney Brenner is probably the cleverest and most articulate
of the founding fathers,'' said Dr. Norton Zinder of Rockefeller
University, referring to the creators of modern biology. ``He is
the most enjoyable company. He overflows with ideas, some of which
are occasionally even useful.''
</P>
<P>
   With the human genome expected to be substantially decoded
within the next few months, Brenner's deft handiwork can be seen at
both ends of the process. The decoding of an organism's whole DNA,
or genome, began as part of the array of studies on a tiny
translucent roundworm that Brenner selected in the mid-1960s as a
model organism.
</P>
<P>
   The little worm, known as C. elegans, is now studied in
laboratories around the world and has already yielded many insights
into the genetic design of animals. It has turned out to be
surprisingly relevant to humans _ by and large, people have a
worm-type genome repeated four times over _ and is expected to play
a major role in helping to interpret the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   That task, going from the raw sequence of the genome to the
knowledge of what each of its 100,000 genes may do, and how they
interact, is expected to be the work of decades.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Brenner announced a novel group of techniques for
analyzing very large sets of DNA. His invention, put into practice
by Lynx Therapeutics of Hayward, Calif., is based on anchoring DNA
fragments to microscopic beads by combinatorial chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   The beads can be processed so as to identify the handful of DNA
sequences that may differ between two large sets, like the
cancerous and noncancerous states of a human cell, or the genomes
of two people. If the system works as hoped, it could play a major
role in understanding the dynamics of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Brenner was born in 1927 to parents who had immigrated to
South Africa, his mother from Latvia and his father from Lithuania.
Though he studied medicine at the University of Witwatersrand,
biological research was his passion. But South Africa was then a
scientific backwater. When he wished to stain a cell, he had first
to synthesize the dye.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in 1952 in Oxford, that ancient seat of learning, the
young provincial learned that his eminent adviser, the physical
chemist Sir Cyril Hinshelwood, was not a believer in mutation. His
first task was to persuade his professor of the reality of genetic
change. On a visit to Cambridge a year later, he met Dr. James D.
Watson and Dr. Francis Crick, who had just discovered the structure
of DNA, the hereditary material.
</P>
<P>
   Crick liked his quick wit and in 1956 brought him back from
South Africa to a job at the British Medical Research Council's
Cambridge laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Crick was then at the center of a nexus of biologists in
Cambridge, Paris and the United States who were working out the
first consequences of the discovery of DNA. Brenner, who shared an
office with Crick for 20 years, played a major role in many of
textbook discoveries made by Crick's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Several concerned the genetic code, the relationship through
which the order of units in DNA determines the structure of the
cell's various protein molecules.
</P>
<P>
   He and Crick proved the code must require three DNA units to
specify each amino acid, the building blocks of proteins, in an
ingenious experiment. By deleting DNA units from bacteria they
showed that only after three units had been deleted in close
proximity did the DNA message come back into correct phase, proving
the units must be translated three at a time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, with Dr. Matthew Meselson of Harvard and Dr. Francois
Jacob of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, Brenner proved the
existence of messenger-RNA, the transcript that carries the genetic
message from DNA to the cell's protein-making factories.
</P>
<P>
   With these and several other discoveries, described in Horace
Judson's standard history ``The Eighth Day of Creation,'' the
essential nature of the relationship between gene and protein had
been resolved. Believing the details could be left to others,
Brenner and Crick cast around for new biological pinnacles to
conquer.
</P>
<P>
   The development of the organism and the working of the brain
being the two highest in sight, Brenner decided in 1964 to tackle
both through the medium of a brand new experimental organism, the
roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of work had made the Drosophila fruit fly a standard
organism for geneticists, but the fly's brain was too complicated
for Brenner's purpose. He wanted an organism with a nervous system
so simple that he could compute its behavior from knowledge of the
interconnections between its nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Computing the worm's behavior, however, was one of Brenner's
less than fully successful ideas. After 14 years, his student White
succeeded in reconstructing the wiring diagram of the worm's brain,
but its 5,000 interconnections proved too complex a system for
further analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But the C. elegans project bore fruit in many other ways. Two
students, Dr. John E. Sulston and Dr. H. Robert Horvitz, worked out
the worm's fate map _ the precise lines of descent by which the 959
cells of the adult are generated from the single cell of the egg _
a pioneering feat that has been achieved with no other organism.
Sulston then began to sequence the worm's genome, the pilot project
that gave scientists confidence they could tackle the much larger
sequence of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   After much hard work by Brenner and his students, many of them
Americans who came to work as postdoctoral researchers in his
Cambridge laboratory, the worm had developed into a gold mine for
solving outstanding problems in biology.
</P>
<P>
   But in the mid-1980s, Brenner, who did not entirely relish being
introduced everywhere as the `Father of the Worm,' decided to move
on to general problems of genome research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still wanted to do the computing problem,'' he now says,
``but I thought it would require younger people than me. It's a
young man's problem. My problem is that I know too much to tackle
that. I'm a strong believer that ignorance is important in science.
If you know too much, you start seeing why things won't work.
That's why it's important to change your field to collect more
ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Having served as director of the Medical Research Council's
Laboratory of Molecular Biology from 1979 to 1986 and approaching
the council's mandatory retirement age, Brenner started working
part of the year in Southern California, where Crick and other
friends had already moved. A new project began to take shape: a
fish known as the fugu.
</P>
<P>
   As DNA sequencing progressed, it became clear that some 97
percent of the human genome is junk DNA, material that does not
code for genes and has no apparent function other than to make the
real genes very hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons yet to be fathomed, the fugu or puffer-fish genome
is end-to-end genes with almost no junk DNA. Brenner conceived the
idea of sequencing the fugu genome so as to find the genes more
quickly and develop a basis of comparison with the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has not found favor with the federal Human Genome
Project, which favors the zebra fish as a model organism for
studying animal development and the mouse genome for direct
comparison with that of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they will do comparisons on the mouse,'' Brenner
said, ``but they won't succeed _ the mouse is too close. It hasn't
had enough time to randomize, so you are confused by the commonness
of origin.''
</P>
<P>
   He means that genes that have retained a similar DNA sequence in
puffer fish and people, species that separated 400 million years
ago, are likely to be of critical importance. Mice and men shared
an ancestor so recently that almost all their genes show signs of
relatedness.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists are more interested in theory, others in
experimental detail. Brenner has a cast of mind that pursues both
the tiniest cogs of a system and its overall design with equal
interest. ``He is a mixture of someone who likes to develop the
ultimate tool, but also to think of the concept behind it,'' White
said.
</P>
<P>
   For his DNA bead system, Brenner invented an artificial genetic
code that serves to tie each gene transcript a cell produces to a
different bead, creating a powerful system for DNA-based
computation and sequencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the end we are the people who will provide the
interface between the gene and the computer,'' Brenner said,
referring to his colleagues at Lynx. Part of the bead system was
published for the first time last month, but its full details are
not widely understood.
</P>
<P>
   After the beads? New projects are already lining up in Brenner's
mind. One is a new way of analyzing the human genome so as to
identify its most slowly evolving genes. Another is a speculation
about the kind of device the cell is.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of machines, he pointed out. One, like a
computer, can calculate the answer to a problem. The other has a
set of tables with all the answers written out. Which kind are
cells?
</P>
<P>
   ``They are table machines, not program machines,'' Brenner said.
``So who calculates the tables? Evolution calculates them. It finds
the answer and stores it in the gene. So I envisage that the genome
is a library in which has been stored books with important numbers
which were generated by the process of evolution, a process which
is inelegant and opportunistic, but it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Where then is the cell's central computer that crunches all the
information in the tables? There isn't one. In Brenner's view, the
proteins are designed to interact with one another in a process
that produces the right answer.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of life is one outstanding biological problem that
Brenner has not yet tackled in depth. Perhaps a hint of his
thinking appears in one of his columns, where he relates how his
officemate Crick, trying to understand the embryonic organs from
which the fruit fly's wings develop, one day threw down his book
with the remark, ``God knows how these imaginal discs work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a flash,'' Brenner wrote, ``I saw the whole story of
Francis arriving in heaven and Peter welcoming him.''
</P>
<P>
   Crick insisted on being introduced immediately to the deity and
after some persuasion was taken to a junkyard shack at the very
back of heaven, where there was ``a little man in overalls with a
large spanner in his back pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   ```God,' says the angel, `This is Dr. Crick; Dr. Crick, this is
God.' `I am so pleased to meet you,' says Francis. `I must ask you
this question. How do imaginal discs work?'
</P>
<P>
   ```Well,' comes the reply, `We took a little bit of this stuff
and we added some things to it and ... actually, we don't know, but
I can tell you that we've been building flies up here for 200
million years and we have had no complaints.'''

GROUP SUES US FOR FAILING TO PROTECT RIGHT WHALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Alarmed at the growing number of Northern right whales
being hurt or killed by fishing gear, one of New England's leading
environmental organizations plans to sue the federal government for
failing to protect the most endangered large whale species in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the 300 remaining right whales, many of them in
Cape Cod Bay at this time of year, are slowly heading for
extinction, partly because they continue to become entangled in
fishing gear or are accidentally hit by ships. In all, rescue
workers tried to free six entangled right whales last year,
including one that died off the New Jersey coast from a deep cut
caused by fishing line.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservation Law Foundation of Boston charged Monday that
the National Marine Fisheries Service deserves at least part of the
blame for the gear entanglements because the agency has dragged its
feet in requiring the development of lobster traps, nets, and other
gear that allow whales to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crisis and it hasn't been treated like a crisis,'' said
Alan Wilson, vice president of the Conservation Law Foundation.
``The National Marine Fisheries Service really hasn't done as much
as it should to protect the whales.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service declined to
comment on the planned lawsuit, but said that the agency expects to
require some type of breakaway nets and lines for lobster traps and
gillnets by the end of the year. They also said new federal funds
will allow more research into practical ways to make gear less
harmful to the whales.
</P>
<P>
   But conservationists and scientists alike say the service moves
too slowly. They hope that the lawsuit by the Conservation Law
Foundation, which in the past has successfully sued to force the
cleanup of Boston Harbor and restrict fishing on Georges Bank, will
give the right whale's decline far more urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is put this more on a war footing where we
really have a massive attempt to find solutions,'' said Scott
Kraus, director of the Edgerton Lab at the New England Aquarium.
``I think the agency treats us like orphans and they wish that we
would just go away, so maybe a lawsuit is just what is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The right whale population has been declining since the early
1990s, due both to a plummeting birth rate and a steady stream of
human-induced deaths. Although fishing gear accounts for only 10
percent of whale deaths, 60 percent of the whales show signs of
fishing gear scars, including an entangled whale near Provincetown
that the Center for Coastal Studies is trying to free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are well past the age of denial here. We've got so many
animals with scars and so many entanglements,'' said Peter
Borrelli, the Center's executive director. ``We have got to act
quickly with this few animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservation Law Foundation officials said their top goal is to
force more federal spending on ``whale-safe'' gear than the
$450,000 now available. Some scientists say at least $5 million is
needed to investigate products such as fishing line that dissolves
when imbedded in whale flesh, or lines that lie on the sea floor
until electronically ``called'' to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   However, both Kraus and others worry that the lawsuit could
reopen old wounds between fishermen and environmentalists just as
they are beginning to work cooperatively. An advisory team
including both fishermen and environmentalists are preparing a
report to the fisheries service on gear changes to help the whales.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, activists and fishermen were deeply divided
over a National Marine Fisheries Service proposal, now shelved,
that would have cost fishermen $12,000 or more to make each boat
``whale-safe.'' Fishermen said the price was too high, considering
that most of the roughly 10,000 lobstermen and 100 or so gillnet
fishermen in federal waters will never snag a whale in their gear.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the division, activist Max Strahan, known as the
``Prince of Whales,'' sued the state of Massachusetts in an attempt
to ban lobstering and gillnet fishing in state-managed waters
altogether. The state ultimately agreed to close areas in Cape Cod
Bay during peak whale visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hell of a lot isn't getting done on fisheries management
because of all these lawsuits,'' warned Pat White, executive
director of the Maine Lobstermen's Association, who said the
National Marine Fisheries Service already faces 96 lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the six entangled whales last year, two right
whales have been reported entangled in fishing gear in 2000,
including one dead whale floating north of Rhode Island's Block
Island. However, researchers were unable to recover the carcass to
determine the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Mantzaris, chief of the protected resources branch of
the National Marine Fisheries Service in Gloucester, said the
increase in reported entanglements may actually reflect improved
efforts to protect the whales. He said scientists believe the
increase reflects better reporting of whale distress by everyone
from fishermen to the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in the last couple of years have we had such a massive
effort in looking for these animals,'' said Mantzaris.

ARGUMENTS OVER LIFE AND THE NEED FOR DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Ill., Calif.)  (The Science Times) 
(DW) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Advances in research in recent years have raised
the possibility of extending human life by decades. At a conference
held here to discuss the consequences of such a development,
scientists described the techniques of extending life, only to be
assailed for presenting a threat to human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Far from accepting greater longevity as a blessing, ethicists
and some theologians offered passionate praise of death. They
argued that life without death would be meaningless and that the
natural ambitions of career and family were satisfied within a life
span of 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't ban this research but we can make it socially
despicable,'' said Dr. Daniel Callahan, a biomedical ethicist at
the Hastings Center in Garrison, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Another ethicist, Dr. Leon R. Kass of the University of Chicago,
said, ``The finitude of human life is a blessing for every
individual whether he knows it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, convened by Dr. Arthur L. Caplan of the
University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics with support from
the John F. Templeton Foundation, brought together scientists and
theologians, but to a large degree the two groups talked past each
other and argued among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists differed as to whether they would extend life
merely by curing its major diseases or would go beyond that to
tackle the underlying aging process. The theologians often split
along religious lines, with Christians saying that to delay death
was to delay union with God, and a Jew, Rabbi Neil Gilman of the
Jewish Theological Center, declaring that everything possible to
prolong life must be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can violate the Sabbath and Yom Kippur even if they are on
the same day in order to preserve life,'' Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a wry philosophical joke, the conference was held in the
University of Pennsylvania's archaeological museum, under the nose
of a sphinx and in a room displaying artifacts of the Egyptian cult
of immortality.
</P>
<P>
   Enabling people to live 150 to 200 years or more is not an
immediate prospect but has become a matter of speculation after
discoveries about stem cells and other cellular mechanisms, and
success in prolonging the life of certain laboratory animals by
genetic manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have control of genes and gene expression, we can
control the things which are controlled by the genes, like aging
and mortality rates,'' said Dr. Michael R. Rose of the University
of California at Irvine. Rose has stretched the life of laboratory
fruit flies by breeding them in appropriate conditions, proving
that life span is under genetic control.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert P. Lanza of Advanced Cell Technology spoke of plans
to create a remedial patch for failing hearts by cloning an adult's
skin cells and inducing the embryonic cells so formed to develop
into heart cells. The company's work has been confined to cows.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists' projections of a greater human life span were not
universally welcomed. The Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus of the Institute
of Religion and Public Life criticized the search for immortality
as ``a pagan and sub-Christian quest'' and as an enterprise driven
by the ``essentially amoral and mindless dynamic of the
technological imperative joined to an ignoble fear of death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do pursue this course of extended life, interminably
extended life,'' Neuhaus said, ``I would advise the most informed
and critical resistance at every point along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   After the drubbing from theologians, the researchers came under
assault from ethicists. Kass portrayed immortality as a state
altogether alien from that of being human.
</P>
<P>
   ``To argue that human life is better without death is to argue
human life would be better without being human,'' he said. He
praised the character of the Homeric hero Odysseus, who turned down
the nymph Calypso's offer of being her immortal consort in favor of
mortality and his human duty, that of continuing his hazardous
voyage back to his home and his aged wife, Penelope.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said research on extending life was part of larger
pattern of misallocation of funds, a focus on fighting death and
lethal diseases rather than learning how to care for people at the
end of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who want medicine to increase life expectancy must show
us what the social and human benefit would be, and this case needs
to be laid out in advance, and we should assess it in the context
of enormous skepticism since no one has shown the present life
expectation is somehow a disaster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another ethicist, Dr. Ronald Cole-Turner of the Pittsburgh
Theological Seminary, said that a longer life would be positive
because it would focus attention on the meaning of life and ``offer
an opportunity for the blossoming of our humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pure moonshine,'' Callahan retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Kass said he feared that public wisdom would not prevail against
the temptation of immortality. ``While the head might council
finitude, the blood likes to live,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER, Colo. _ It was a rare, almost surreal political moment:
the polar opposites of the enduring national gun debate sharing the
same stage, even applauding each other at introductions.
</P>
<P>
   James S. Brady, a board member of Handgun Control Inc., and
Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle
Association, joined a dozen federal, state and local officials here
Monday at a news conference to announce that Colorado had become
the latest jurisdiction to inaugurate Project Exile, a program that
uses federal, rather than state courts, to prosecute gun crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a victim, I and many others can tell you it's no fun,''
said Brady, who was White House press secretary in 1981 when he was
shot and paralyzed during an assassination attempt on President
Ronald Reagan. The 1993 federal law that mandates waiting periods
and background checks of gun buyers bears Brady's name. ``Project
Exile is one of many initiatives needed to keep guns out of the
wrong hands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre said, ``This is the most common-sense program of all.
It gets bad people off the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Project Exile began as a pilot program three years ago in
Richmond, Va., and now operates statewide in Virginia, Texas, South
Carolina and Louisiana, as well as in several cities, including
Rochester, N.Y., and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Its effectiveness relies on federal prosecution of crimes that
are generally left to state and local authorities, with the
expectation that the greater supply of federal prisons and stricter
sentencing guidelines will serve as a deterrent. Officials in
Richmond say crimes involving guns have dropped by 65 percent since
the program began.
</P>
<P>
   Project Exile is one of the few such efforts that has won
support from both gun rights groups like the NRA and from those
that favor tighter restrictions for gun ownership, like the
organization Brady leads with his wife, Sarah, who is president.
</P>
<P>
   To both sides, it is a vivid example of how prosecuting existing
laws can reduce gun violence even if gun control advocates would
favor additional legislation, like laws that would require
background checks for those buying guns from private dealers at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Colorado's program took on added drama
through the presence of Brady, who has used a wheelchair since he
was shot and still has difficulty speaking. LaPierre said he had
appeared frequently with Mrs. Brady to debate and discuss gun
issues but rarely with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   While the two men sat at opposite sides of the stage and had no
opportunity to interact, LaPierre said he and Brady had chatted
briefly before the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre said several other states were considering programs
like Project Exile. But wherever such programs have begun, they
have achieved only limited support from the Department of Justice,
which has not made street crimes a priority. As a result, the
program largely depends upon community pressure to combat the
illegal use of guns, private donations to support an advertising
campaign that warns would-be criminals of the consequences of
getting caught and a local U.S. attorney who is willing to devote
more resources to street crime.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has had no shortage of motivation, much of it stemming
from the shootings last April at Columbine High School, where two
students killed 12 other students and a teacher before turning
their guns on themselves. Last month, two more Columbine students
were shot and killed in a sandwich shop for reasons that are still
unclear to investigators. No one has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Strickland, the U.S. attorney for Colorado, who took office
shortly after the shootings at the school, said he had decided
quickly that a Project Exile program would be worthwhile.
Strickland led efforts that raised more than $600,000 to pay for
billboards and radio and television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was still uncertain how much more money might
become available from the Justice Department for new prosecutors or
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Strickland said, ``we'll just try to do more with
existing resources, and other things will move to a lower
priority.''

 &HT;    Using deceased victims' criminal history part of defense
strategy in Atlanta case
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All Pro linebacker Ray Lewis and his two co-defendants
are slated to sit before a jury on murder charges in May. But they
probably won't be the only ones on trial. So, too, may be the dead
men.
</P>
<P>
   According to motions filed in the case, it appears the criminal
backgrounds of victims Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar will be
scrutinized. Lawyers who follow the case predict Lewis
co-defendants Joseph Sweeting and Reginald Oakley will plead
self-defense and attempt to portray Baker and Lollar as the
aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   Painting a negative portrait of the deceased is a common defense
ploy in stranger-on-stranger killings involving street fights or
bar brawls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the `dude-needed-killing' defense,'' said criminal
defense attorney Dan Summer, who said the strategy allows the
introduction of ``specific bad acts by the deceased.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, you're trashing the victim's character,'' he
said. ``Unfortunately for the state, that resonates with jurors.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Cook, district attorney in Newton and Walton counties,
agrees that such a defense is common when there is not ``an
innocent victim.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it used before, and I've seen it sway juries,'' said
Cook.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most famous self-defense successes, recounted in the
best seller ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' was
Savannah antiques dealer Jim Williams, who was acquitted in 1989 of
the fatal shooting of his 22-year-old housemate, Danny Lewis
Hansford.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, in his fourth trial, convinced jurors that he shot
Lewis because the young man was crazed with drugs and alcohol and
was trying to shoot him.
</P>
<P>
   And Sweeting's lawyer, Bruce Harvey, got client Jeff Henry freed
after a Douglas County jury could not reach a verdict on murder
charges in the 1991 shotgun killing of Henry's twin brother. The
shooting occurred during a drunken brawl, and the defense argued
that Greg habitually abused Jeff, who finally snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Making a self-defense claim in the recent stabbing case,
however, may be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Some eyewitness accounts indicate Lollar and Baker were greatly
outnumbered in the deadly fracas outside Cobalt, a nightclub in
Atlanta's entertainment district, hours after the Super Bowl. At
least one witness said the two men were outnumbered 10 to two.
Another one described seeing six or more on one.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, 21, died of stab wounds to the heart and liver; Lollar,
24, perished from stab wounds to the chest, including one to the
heart, a Fulton County autopsy found.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting's lawyers have petitioned the court asking to perform
tests on a gun they believe Lollar had at the scene. They claim it
was the gun fired at Lewis' rented limousine as it fled. Oakley's
father said his son told him he was hit over the head with a
champagne bottle. They've also asked to be given the results of
alcohol and drug testing of the victims, saying the tests ``will
tend to show that one or both of the decedents were aggressors.''
</P>
<P>
   And last weekend, an acquaintance of Lewis', Jessica Robertson,
told prosecutors that Lewis and some of his friends believed others
in his group thought they were about to be robbed by the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's autopsy said he was carrying a large plastic bag and six
smaller bags containing what is suspected to be marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lollar and Baker had drug arrest records. Baker was wanted
by police when he died, having violated probation on a gun offense
with a subsequent drug arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, Baker fled on foot when the borrowed car he was
driving was stopped by police in his native Akron, Ohio. Police
said they found a loaded .22-caliber pistol and a baggie of
marijuana in the car, according to the Summit County prosecutor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who was listed as ``homeless'' in the police report,
pleaded guilty the following month to a lesser charge of improperly
handling a firearm and was given 18 months probation.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months later, Baker was again in a car stopped by Akron
police. This time, an officer said Baker, a passenger, was stuffing
something under the seat. Police say they found 25 grams of crack.
There was also an open container of brandy in the car.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and the driver were charged with possession of cocaine and
possession of an open container of alcohol but Baker missed a court
date 10 days later and a warrant was issued for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Lollar also had three drug arrests. In June 1996, Akron police
arrested him and charged him with aggravated drug trafficking. The
grand jury did not find enough evidence for felony charges and
Lollar later pleaded guilty, agreeing to pay a $100 fine, according
to Summit County and Akron records. He was arrested again in
September 1996 on marijuana possession charges and got another $100
fine.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, he was arrested once more and charged with
marijuana possession and misrepresenting his identification. This
time, he was sentenced to serving 60 days in an Akron halfway
house.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Smith, who grew up in the same Akron neighborhood with the
two victims, was dismayed to hear their arrest records were being
brought up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense is just trying to slander two dead man,'' said
Smith, who finds it incredible that a football star and his cohorts
would feel threatened by the 5-foot-3 Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Ray Lewis on TV, he's a linebacker; Jacinth's
nickname was Shorty,'' said Smith. ``You've got to remember, they
are the victims. They didn't jump on no people. That ain't going to
make it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said contentions that one of the victims had a gun makes no
sense. ``If that man had a gun, then why would he have got
stabbed?'' Smith asked.
</P>
<P>
   Putting victims on trial is risky and can sometimes backfire,
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't willy nilly raise self-defense and attack the
victims,'' said Mike Mears, who represents indigent death penalty
defendants. ``Ideally, you want to be able to put some weapon of
equal or greater force in the victim's hands. If you're not
successful, you've not only hurt your case, you've alienated the
triers of fact _ the jurors. It can be a risky defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's challenge will be to keep out any bad
character evidence of the victims, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's appellate courts have allowed the introduction of a
victim's prior criminal history, if it's relevant. To be admitted
into evidence, the defense must show the judge that the victim was
the aggressor and that the prior offense is related to the claims
being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a victim had a prior shoplifting conviction, that wouldn't
be relevant in a murder case,'' Cook said. ``Prior drug convictions
wouldn't either, I believe, if drugs had nothing to do with the
killing.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer, who has tried a number of high-profile murder cases,
said prior histories are not limited to convictions and criminal
charges. ``You can be sure, they're going to find out any
aggressive acts committed by the victims, if there are any,'' he
said.

COMMENTARY: A PRIMARY PRIMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of you voters out there may be a tad disappointed about the
way this primary season has worked out. I know you thought that
when the campaign got to your state, the candidates would be up
close and personal, holding town meetings in the high school gym.
But hey, the schedule got crowded. And wasn't that pre-dawn rally
at the airport something?
</P>
<P>
   It's been a busy month since the New Hampshire primary, people.
Here's what's been happening.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 6: John McCain's TV ad says ``there's only one man running
for president who knows the military and understands the world.''
In an interview, McCain denies this is meant to suggest that George
W. Bush doesn't know the military or understand the world.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 11: In South Carolina, McCain comes under assault by
conservatives who call up talk radio, describing him as everything
from a communist spy to the father of multiple illegitimate
children.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 12: McCain begins comparing himself to Luke Skywalker.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 13: Bush, refusing to take a stand on South Carolina's
Confederate flag, warns voters not to ``judge my heart based on a
position on who ought to be flying a flag over what capital.'' Bush
also does not want his heart judged on his appearance at Bob Jones
University or anything Pat Robertson might have been saying over
the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 19: Bush thumps McCain in South Carolina, then McCain
thumps Bush in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 22, more or less: John and Charles Wyly, Texas businessmen
whose family hedge fund handles $96 million worth of investments
from the University of Texas, wake up and spontaneously decide
they're in the mood to spend $2.5 million on ads that unfavorably
compare John McCain's record on the environment with Bush's.
Luckily, their wacky impulse has no connection to the Bush campaign
and therefore is not regulated by campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 23: Bill Bradley, attempting to restart his sputtering
campaign in Seattle, volunteers that his favorite grunge band is
Nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 25: The Bush campaign, which had $70 million a few months
ago, admits it is short of money. Bush asks voters not to judge his
head by the fact that he wasted $2 million buying TV ads for the
primary in McCain's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 26, more or less: The Wyly brothers stumble on an ad
producer who has by coincidence done a lot of work for the state's
Republican Party. He whips them up a commercial that shows McCain,
looking quite a bit like Marley's ghost, floating over a belching
smokestack while Bush's smiling head soars across a pristine
prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 28: Al Gore gives an analysis of American ethnic history to
the Seattle NAACP: ``The African-American experience is unique ...
the Irish-American experience is unique ... all the experiences are
unique ... the African-American experience is uniquely unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 29, more or less: The Wyly brothers impulsively decide to
target New York, fortuitously hitting on the place where Bush is in
a particularly tough race. In another remarkable coincidence, the
firm they choose to buy TV time turns out to have done work for New
York's governor, George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   March 1: McCain's social conservative allies recoil in horror
when he calls Pat Robertson ``evil.'' The candidate says it was
just part of his Luke Skywalker rap. ``I don't know what's going
on. I'm not a psychiatrist,'' says William Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   March 2: The Republicans debate in Los Angeles with McCain
appearing via satellite. The Arizona senator's chair is occupied by
a TV set, with McCain inside looking like Max Headroom.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate highlight, Bush suggests that requiring trigger
locks on guns might lead to ``trigger lock police knock(ing) on
people's doors saying show me your lock.''
</P>
<P>
   March 3: The Wyly brothers' ad starts running, causing a Sierra
Club spokesman to note that while McCain's record on the
environment is ``poor,'' Bush's is ``terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   March 4: &UR;  &LR;  Bush, currently running radio ads charging that
McCain ``opposes funding for vital breast cancer programs,'' says
he does not believe the senator is opposed to funding for breast
cancer programs.

   BOEING-STRIKE (Tukwila, Wash.) _ The placards along the picket
lines outside the Boeing Co.'s huge aircraft plants are a bit
unusual. ``No Nerds, No Birds,'' proclaims one. And many Boeing
engineers, most on strike for the first time in their lives, say
they are still stunned at how unified their group has become in the
face of its protest against the jet manufacturer. The increasingly
bitter protest by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees
in Aerospace has mushroomed into one of the largest strikes by
white-collar workers against a private company in years. For
national labor leaders, who have rushed in to help out the striking
engineers, the strike is clearly seen as an opportunity to make
inroads in its hopes to organize a potentially vast sector of the

 &HT;    New Delta ads ready for takeoff
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines is about to launch the first ad
campaign by its new agency, Leo Burnett Co.
</P>
<P>
   Television spots for Atlanta-based Delta debut this weekend, and
will be accompanied by a print campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The airline plans to preview the campaign to the media
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few tactical spots in recent months, it will be the
first fresh effort for Delta since 1997's ``On Top of the World''
campaign by Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's new management team, which arrived after that campaign
started, gradually curtailed it and moved the airline's account
last year to Chicago-based Leo Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Burnett created United Airlines' old ``Fly the Friendly
Skies'' theme _ one of the best-remembered taglines in airline
history _ but no longer has United's account.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Reid, Delta's executive vice president-marketing, said the
new Delta spots won't be built around a catchy tagline or a
signature song.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no song, no tagline, just Delta,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The spots ``are more passenger focused than airline focused,''
Reid said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most airlines talk about themselves,'' he said. ``Look at our
wine list, look at our seats, look at us, us, us. But when people
travel they have their own affairs on their minds. ... So the
centerpiece (of advertising) should be the passenger and not the
airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to say the sky is blue and it's all
wonderful,'' Reid added.
</P>
<P>
   He said the campaign will be ``practical, realistic and maybe a
little humorous.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta advertising in the 1980s and early '90s was defined by
now-classic taglines such as ``Delta is Ready When You Are,'' and
``We Love to Fly and It Shows.'' But in recent years the airline's
advertising hit rough air.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 ``Delta Marathon'' campaign, timed to coincide with the
Atlanta Olympics, flopped. That prompted Delta to dump longtime
Atlanta agency BBDO South and hire Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, who came to Delta in 1998 from Lufthansa, said Saatchi's
ethereal ``On Top of the World'' campaign, with its new age music
theme, was too oblique.
</P>
<P>
   It also came as Delta wrestled with service problems stemming
from mid-'90s financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to fix the deficiencies and then advertise, not the
other way around,'' Reid said. He said Delta's improved on-time
performance and efforts to improve passenger processing at
airports, coupled with more down-to-earth ads, will give the new
campaign more credibility.

STOCKS MOVE LOWER AFTER GREENSPAN'S COMMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices moved lower Monday after the three most
important guardians of the United States' financial system said
higher interest rates are needed to cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the cautionary comments, which were made by Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Lawrence Summers,
secretary of the Treasury, and Arthur Leavitt, chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, last week's big run-up in stock
prices provided additional incentive to take some profits out of
equities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if Greenspan wrote the speech for all of them,'' said
Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``As the day
wore on and the headlines of what they were saying hit the tape,
the market went down.'' The three officials addressed a conference
held at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 196.70,
or 1.9 percent, to 10,170.50. IBM, Microsoft, American Express and
Wal-Mart led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the Dow gained more than 200 points after February
employment data suggested the economy may be starting to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index slipped 17.89, or 1.3
percent, to 1,391.28, pushed lower by big declines in Exxon-Mobil,
Bristol Myers Squibb and 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks bucked the trend for much of the session, but
late in the day the Nasdaq composite index began to sag and closed
lower. The Nasdaq finished at 4,904.85, down 9.94, or 0.2 percent.
At one point during the day it was up by as much as 65 points.
Trading was brisk.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, volume was 1.03 billion shares.
On the Nasdaq stock market, 1.9 billion shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors have been worried that instead of cooling the
economy, a further series of interest-rate increases by the Fed
will cause the economy to lapse into recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the big question,'' said David L. Mead, chief
investment officer at Harris Bank in Chicago. ``I think they will
be able to avoid a hard landing, simply because they have done it
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Mead said the prospect of further increases in interest rates
has not caused him to change his investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to make a change, we would shift money out of
large-cap sectors and into small- and mid-cap stocks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of bellwether technology companies had a tough day.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was one of them. The stock fell 5{ to 90 5/8.
Meantime, Intel dropped 1 7/16 to 117 3/8. And Cisco Systems shed 1
5/16, to 136 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard was one of only three Dow stocks to gain ground.
</P>
<P>
   The stock gained 7 1/8, to 145 9/16, after Agilent Technologies,
which is 85 percent owned by Hewlett-Packard, announced a
switching-technology breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent closed at 161, up 53.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone-equipment manufacturers had a good day.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel gained 7, to 128. Lucent Technologies was up 2{, to 73
5/8. And Motorola gained 5 5/16, to 180 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology stocks, which have been among the market's leaders
so far this year, turned in a mixed performance.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen fell 1}, to 64 9/16. Genentech was off 19, to 215{. But
Immunex rose 3 11/16, to 248 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Williams Sonoma fell 12}, to 18 1/8, after the seller of kitchen
equipment said earnings for the quarter ended Jan. 30 may be below
Wall Street estimates.

BUSH LIGHTS CANDLE AT HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Determined to convey a ``tolerant message of
inclusiveness'' on the eve of the March 7 primaries, Governor
George W. Bush addressed a gathering at a Los Angeles Holocaust
museum, then donned a yarmulke to light a memorial candle before
television cameras at a ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, indeed, tried on many hats throughout the day. Immediately
after touring an exhibit of Jewish death camps, he raced across Los
Angeles to appear on the ``Tonight Show'' with Jay Leno, hoping to
compensate for an awkward comedic appearance on David Letterman
last week. Earlier in the day, he shook hands with San Diego
Republicans over the sounds of a steel kettle drum band.
</P>
<P>
   But the main event was his trip to the Simon Wiesenthal Center,
purposely scheduled one week after his rival, Senator John S.
McCain, gave a speech lambasting Christian conservative leaders Pat
Robertson and Jerry Falwell as intolerant. Despite its intention,
that McCain speech has since brought the Arizona severe criticism
for being ``divisive,'' and has been widely blamed for the scope of
Virginia primary loss.
</P>
<P>
   Bush sought Monday to capitalize on that misstep. Communications
director Karen Hughes said the sudden outreach to the Jewish
community was ``designed to provide a stark contrast between the
message of divisiveness McCain delivered last week and our message
of unity.'' And as he wandered through the exhibit during a
40-minute tour, listening to historical accounts from the center's
founder, Rabbi Marvin Hier, Bush appeared moved.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, during a brief speech, Bush called the museum ``a
monument to the power of truth over falsehood.'' He also lauded the
museum for not allowing anti-Semitism to go unexposed, saying:
``Tolerance can never be assumed, and it must always be taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not respond to a member of the crowd who interjected:
``What about gay people?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife also signed a guest book signed in 1988 by his
father. The insciption by Vice President George Bush read: ``With
solemn appreciation for the spirit of remembrance.'' Monday his son
wrote: ``God bless this world!''
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican nomination in his sights, Bush and his
advisors also continued to map out a campaign fundraising plan to
raise an additional $5 to $10 million before the party convention
in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has spent some $60 million of the $70 million he
raised early on, once hoped to sail into the general election with
his war chest brimming. With most of it spent battling McCain, Bush
now faces a delicate dilemma if he becomes the nominee: Challenging
Vice President on campaign finance abuses while raising millions
more for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Because while Bush would automatically receive millions if he
were the nominee, he is leaving nothing to chance, scheduling
between 10 and 12 dozen fundraising events that he will personally
attend in upcoming months, advisors said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will appear at fundraisers in New York, New Jersey,
Maryland and Florida, among other places, his national finance
chairman, Don Evans, said. He is planning to raise money in
Illinois at an event next Thursday. And behind the scenes, Bush
fundraisers are already working aggressively to raise money through
direct mailings, Internet solicitations and surrogate fundraising
events.
</P>
<P>
   Evans insisted the campaign had always planned to continue
fundraising past March 7. ``We have yet to tap the vast number of
Americans that are starved for leadership. It takes a long time to
communicate with people all across America,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``It is safe to say we do have, and we will
continue to have, what we need through the convention.'' But, asked
how things would have been different without McCain's potent
challenge, Evans said, chuckling: ``Would we have spent less? We
probably would have spent less.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to return late Monday night to his home in Austin,
where he hoped to hold a victory rally Tuesday.

 &HT;    Cox Radio expands with $380 million deal in 2 markets
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Radio will sign on in two new markets under a $380
million cash deal announced Monday with Clear Channel
Communications. The price makes it the biggest acquisition to date
for Cox Radio, according to Robert Neil, president and chief
executive of the Atlanta-based broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Radio agreed to buy three FM stations in Houston, and three
FM stations and one AM station in Richmond, Va. The former is the
eighth-largest radio revenue market, the latter the 47th, Cox Radio
said.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to enter those markets came as part of Clear
Channel Communications' planned divestiture ahead of its takeover
of AMFM Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, announced agreements Monday
to sell a total of 72 stations in 27 markets. Infinity Broadcasting
and several other buyers were involved as well.
</P>
<P>
   The deal follows a familiar pattern for Cox Radio: Buy a mix of
stations, in terms of age and performance, with a preference for
the Sun Belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prefer Sun Belt markets because they are growing faster
than the radio industry as a whole,'' said Neil.
</P>
<P>
   Neil said the purchase price works out to less than 18 times
broadcast cash flow for this year _ net revenue less station
operating expense _ for the established stations. ``It's on par
with what we've paid for good properties in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, analyst Ed Hatch of SG Cowen Securities estimated
Infinity Broadcasting agreed to pay about 21 times cash flow for
the stations it bought, according to Dow Jones News Service.
</P>
<P>
   One of the stations Cox Radio will acquire in Houston is
KTBZ-FM, a new licensee. Cox Radio will buy the name and format of
KLDE-FM, also in Houston, and then switch KLDE-FM to the frequency
now used by KTBZ-FM, Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Radio, which counts itself the fifth-biggest radio company
in the United States in net revenue, said it expects to complete
the acquisition in the second half of the year, pending regulatory
approval. The company is controlled by Atlanta-based Cox
Enterprises Inc., which owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

BOEING ENGINEERS FIND UNITY AND DEFIANCE ON THE PICKET LINE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUKWILA, Wash. _ The chants and placards along the picket lines
outside the Boeing Co.'s jet plants are a bit unusual. ``No nerds,
no birds,'' proclaims one sign. And many Boeing engineers, most on
strike for the first time in their lives, say they are stunned at
how unified their group has become in the face of its dispute with
the giant aircraft manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, if you get six engineers in a room, you'll get 12
different opinions,'' explained Steve Love, a 45-year-old flight
test engineer who was warming his hands over a burning barrel on
the picket line here the other day. ``Well, Boeing has somehow
managed to get 19,000 of us together with one thought and one goal,
and that's a better contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Now nearing its fifth week, the increasingly bitter protest here
by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace
has mushroomed into one of the largest strikes by white-collar
workers against a private company in years. It is an unexpectedly
fierce action by a group long considered a union in name only,
whose sole act of defiance in its 56-year history was a one-day
walkout in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   For the company, which has clearly stirred up deep resentment
among the engineers by failing to offer 10 percent cash signing
bonuses and other terms of a contract it reached last summer with
its larger machinists' union, the strike is posing growing
problems. Boeing recently announced, for instance, that the strike
had already delayed 15 of 42 commercial jet deliveries planned for
February, and such delays will likely worsen if a settlement is not
reached soon, since many of the striking engineers are needed under
federal law to certify new airplanes as flightworthy.
</P>
<P>
   But for national labor leaders, who have rushed in to help the
strikers, the walkout is clearly seen as a major test of their
ability to organize a potentially large segment of the work force:
professional workers, like many of the engineers here, who complain
of both relentless pressure in the workplace and salaries that they
feel do not reflect their contributions to the booming national
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Labor has already scored once-unthinkable successes in
organizing doctors, especially in California and Florida, who are
especially angry at the intrusions of insurance companies on their
salaries and relationships with patients. It is making determined
efforts, with somewhat less success so far, to organize the
high-tech workers who are a huge part of the economy here in the
Seattle area and in Silicon Valley. And because the high-profile
battle the engineers are waging here is likely to resonate far
beyond the corridors of Boeing, organized labor is manning the
ramparts in a bid to help them win.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, with which the
engineers' union voted to affiliate a few months ago, visited the
picket lines this week, and the federation's secretary-treasurer,
Richard Trumka, the former head of the United Mine Workers, is due
in town Tuesday. Both have promised money and help to the striking
union, and Sweeney said the Boeing strike was an excellent example
of how disgruntled white-collar workers could rally to press for
better contracts and health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a whole area of the new economy that organized labor
would very much like to be involved in,'' said Harley Shaiken, a
labor specialist at the University of California at Berkeley. ``For
many white-collar workers, there's just a volatile combination of
feelings that they are underappreciated and not sharing fully in
the benefits of this supposedly booming economy. This strike
underscores what we've seen with doctors, teachers, now engineers _
there are many professionals who are feeling that they are the
proletariat of the information age.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the engineers prevail here and get a better contract, it
remains to be seen, of course, whether organized labor can ever
forge a truly broad-based coalition between many of these
professionals and the lower-wage workers it continues to try to
organize with major campaigns like the Justice for Janitors
movement.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, here in the Seattle area, there is no question
that the ``brains behind the planes,'' as the engineers are
sometimes called, are marching in the picket lines, and that
truckers and other union workers who drive by the Boeing plants
here constantly blow their horns in support. (Some drivers making
deliveries have declined to cross the picket lines; the machinists
and other Boeing unions are contractually prohibited from stopping
work in support of another union's strike at the company.)
</P>
<P>
   Many Boeing engineers, who typically hold advanced degrees and
whose salaries range from $37,000 to $128,000, express frustration
at having to haggle over contract terms in a region where it seems
like so many other smart, ambitious people are becoming dot-com
millionaires. Many also expressed bitterness over the huge bonuses
received by many corporate executives, including those at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   But an even more immediate factor in this strike seems to be the
engineers' perception that the company is trying to play hardball
with them while, the engineers say, it basically gave in to the
machinists' union. The company reached a deal with the machinists
last summer as it was eager to achieve labor peace in the face of a
huge backlog of orders; many analysts described the pact as
extremely generous, and labor leaders described it as a major
victory.
</P>
<P>
   That pact, which headed off what would have been the third
walkout by the machinists in the last 10 years, was approved
overwhelmingly by the 44,000-member union. It raised hourly wages
by nearly 16 percent over three years, and contained a one-time
bonus averaging $4,400 per worker.
</P>
<P>
   It is undeniable that the engineers are incensed, and that
resentment is palpable in the analogies that the engineer union's
executive director, Charles Bofferding, uses to describe the
strike. He likened Boeing's management to the schoolyard bully who
declined to pick a fight with the class jock _ in this case, the
machinists, the largest union at Boeing _ ``and instead they see
the little kid in the corner with the glasses and they say, `Here,
let's slap him around a little bit.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, guess what?'' said Bofferding in an interview. ``What
they don't realize is, the kid with the glasses has been taking
kung fu. So watch out.''

   The union represents a broad array of engineers and technical
workers with varying levels of training, though those workers are
not required to join the union. The engineers' salaries average
about $63,000; technical workers pay ranges from $21,000 a year to
$81,000, with an average of $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Since contract negotiations began in October, more than 3,000
eligible workers have joined the union; while less than half of
those eligible to join had done so last year, the figure now is
nearly two-thirds _ 13,329 out of 20,683 workers in the
``bargaining unit'' are represented by the union. And even some of
those who do not belong to the union are out on the picket lines.
The union says 19,000 of the workers in the bargaining unit are out
on strike; Boeing estimates that the number is about 17,000.

</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokesman, Peter Conte, said the company had made
several generous offers to the union. Last week, however, Boeing
formally declared an impasse, and this last weekend it announced it
would attempt to impose the terms of its last contract offer on the
engineers, a bid to force them back to work that the union insisted
would not shake its resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the engineers say they have never supported unions, and
as one put it: ``All that brotherhood and sisterhood stuff kind of
made me sick. I mean, these are my co-workers, they're not my
brothers and sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is changing. Jim Davis, a 64-year-old maintenance
programs engineer who spent 27 years in the Navy and has spent the
last 15 at Boeing, decided earlier this year to join the engineers'
union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really been pretty much an anti-union person,'' said
Davis, who holds advanced degrees in aeroengineering and systems
management. ``I never, ever thought I'd see the day that I went out
on strike. I still can't quite believe I'm out here on a picket
line. But Boeing pushed me over the edge. I think they've been
unreasonable and unresponsive to some truly unhappy engineers and
technical workers.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Bill Sandell, a 34-year-old liaison engineer on the picket line,
said he thought unions were for other kinds of workers, not
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize their place for other people,'' he said. ``But
philosophically, I didn't want to be represented by a labor union.
I wanted to be represented by my training, my experience and my
abilities. I really thought that was my bargaining chip. But now, I
feel like joining a union was really the only effective way to make
my voice heard at this company.''

   Tom Claps, 37, a flight test engineer, said he was amazed to
watch his fellow engineers, holding signs, chanting and throwing
more wood in the blazing barrel to keep themselves warm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot for a bunch of engineers to get up and walk out
the door,'' he said. ``The rocket scientists are literally out on
the streets here. It's kind of incredible.''

CAMPAIGNING AT HECTIC PACE ON EVE OF `SUPER TUESDAY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A confident George W. Bush campaigned in
California, taped ``The Tonight Show,'' and hoped to wrap up the
nomination in 13 Republican Super Tuesday contests. Republican
rival John McCain, needing a sweep of five New England states and a
strong showing at least in New York to remain politically viable,
told Californians the primaries are still too volatile to predict.
</P>
<P>
   The more subdued Democratic race focused on the vital
battleground of New York. Vice President Al Gore, appearing to be
ahead in all 15 states with Democratic contests, ignored his
opponent Bill Bradley and attacked Bush's health care record.
Bradley, the former New York Knick and former New Jersey senator,
acknowledged that he needs to ``win a couple of states'' to avoid
being forced out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   With a final, furious round of campaigning, the four main
presidential candidates headed toward a coast-to-coast vote, which
could effectively decide the Republican and Democratic nominations.
The Republican race held the most suspense. The wild ride of the
last five weeks, in which McCain barreled out of the New Hampshire
primary with a 19-point victory and engaged in a topsy-turvy
campaign against Bush, potentially could end or be given new life
if McCain pulls yet another upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been one primary yet that has met
expectations,'' McCain said Monday aboard his campaign bus. ``I
think there are going to be a lot of surprises (Tuesday) either
way. It is just too volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
and Secretary of State William Galvin expects a record turnout.
Four other New England states are also holding primaries: Rhode
Island, Connecticut, Vermont and Maine. Other Super Tuesday
primaries stretch from Georgia to Ohio to Missouri to California.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 16 states are holding primaries or caucuses, with 613
Republican delegates at stake and for the Democrats, 1,315
delegates toward winning the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   According to the polls, Gore is in a strong position to sweep
every primary, leaving Bradley with no victories after a year of
campaigning. Despite the strong promise Bradley once showed, his
campaign aides are now making plans for a dignified withdrawal
later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ``has just not made a convincing case for change,'' said
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior associate at the school of politics
and economics at Claremont Graduate School. ``The spark that was
there at the beginning is not there now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican race focused Monday on California, which has
unusual party rules that favor Bush. Any registered voter can cast
a ballot for a Republican candidate, but only the ballots of
registered GOP voters count toward delegate selection. The polls
show Bush far ahead among Republican voters, meaning he is likely
to gain the winner-take-all 162 delegates. McCain spent the day
campaigning here hoping for a moral victory in the so-called
``beauty contest'' vote by winning the popular vote, which McCain
hopes would support his contention that he is the ``electable''
candidate who could win in November.
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides said their best hope is to sweep five New England
states, New York and make a strong showing or even an upset in
Ohio, along with the ``beauty contest'' win in California. But even
under that scenario, McCain would face an uphill fight, with
contests next week dominated by Southern states where Bush is
strongest.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, whose signature issue is campaign finance, continued to
denounce Bush for his association with two Texas brothers, Sam and
Charles Wyly, who have spent an estimated $2.5 million on ads that
attack McCain's environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the advertisements violate the spirit of campaign
finance law and was confident voters would see that. The campaign
filed a complaint about the ads with the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The ads emboldened McCain to revive one of his most
controversial charges, that Bush is like President Clinton. McCain
withdrew an ad comparing Bush to Clinton during the South Carolina
primary after receiving much criticism and vowed to stop running
negative ads. But McCain himself did not hold back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so Clinton-esque it's scary _ raise the soft money, run
the attack ads,'' McCain said. ``They're getting more and more like
the Clinton campaign. They'll say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was running behind in most recent polls, the senator
from Arizona said he had few regrets about the campaign he has run
to date.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought last week's speech in Virginia Beach
criticizing Christian conservatives Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell
might hurt him at the polls, he firmly said it would not, and he
stands by his words, no matter what happens in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to do that,'' McCain said. ``You had to say it before
the (Virginia) primary. If we had said it after the primary, then
you're not legitimately giving your criticism and your vision for
the party.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush remained confident and calm, reminding
reporters that McCain had hurt himself previously in South Carolina
by comparing him to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to backfire again,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush set his sights on Gore, who echoed McCain's criticism of
the enviromental ads. Bush accused Gore of having ``amnesia,''
forgetting his own fund-raising at a Buddhist temple in California
during the last presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an administration that has violated every campaign
finance law, it seems like, on the book,'' Bush said, smiling
broadly. ``I'm looking forward to running against Vice President
Gore. It's going to be a campaign where the man has got amnesia. He
seems to have forgotten what the last seven years have been like,
and I am going to remind America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, acted like he was ready to meet Bush in the
general election, ignoring Bradley as he campaigned around New York
City, where he spent part of the day wooing Jewish voters, health
care professionals and gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn, Gore began his
broadside against Bush by saying, ``Texas now ranks 49th in health
care for children'' and last for health care coverage for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``That includes insurance for women suffering from breast
cancer,'' Gore said, in a reference to the ongoing dispute between
Bush and McCain, who has complained that Bush has distorted his
record on funding for breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty out of fifty. That's dead last,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, meanwhile, was hoping for a last-minute political
comeback to rival his days from the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley began his day greeting commuters coming off the Staten
Island ferry, then gave a pep talk to students at a high school in
the Bronx. He visited with voters in suburban Westchester County
and in Brooklyn and ended his day with a rally at Manhattan's
Bryant Park.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his best hopes to derail Gore are in Maine,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Missouri, Maryland and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any magic number, but I do think we
have to win a couple of states,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the commuters that stepped off the ferry from Staten
Island, the most Republican of New York's five boroughs, grumbled
at the obstacle posed by Bradley and his entourage. Others wished
him well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep hitting jumpers from the corner. You've got our support
in the hip-hop community,'' said Nathaniel West, 30, who works in
the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the 2000 primary season, when it comes to a close,
is likely to center on the impact of New Hampshire, and the ability
of the front-runners to weather tough times in the first primary
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that happened afterward on both sides was
determined by what happened in New Hampshire,'' said Dayton Duncan,
the author of ``Grassroots,'' about the 1988 Granite State primary.
``The fact this was a bitter and protracted Republican race, more
than anyone expected, was because of McCain's success in New
Hampshire,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   It also squashed any hopes Bradley had of receiving attention
after New Hampshire. Gore's own New Hampshire collision happened
last fall, when Bradley drew even with him in the polls and led the
vice president for awhile. Ultimately, the vice president won the
New Hampshire primary by four points, enabling him to retain the
front-runner title during the following monthlong period without
Democratic contests.'
</P>
<P>
   The next round of primaries comes March 10, with contests in
Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming and Nevada. On March 14, primaries will
be held in six states, including Florida and Texas, states both led
by governors named Bush.

   KYOTO, Japan _ In the playground of Hino Primary School here,
where a second-grader was stabbed to death in front of his
classmates in December, little evidence remains of the horrific
crime that traumatized the nation, even though Japan has slowly
been growing accustomed to more violence.
</P>
<P>
   But a botched police investigation into the slaying has made it
much harder for adults of this ancient capital city to recover. In
February, a 21-year-old man who was the prime suspect in the
stabbing escaped during questioning by six police investigators,
then plunged to his death from a nearby roof, an apparent suicide.
</P>
<P>
   TheKyoto blunder was the latest in a series of errors and
scandals involving police departments across the country that has
led many people to conclude that Japan's police, once celebrated as
a model of honesty and competence, may in fact be both corrupt and
inept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust the police, and I don't think people can depend
on them for protection or to solve a crime when it happens,'' said
Toshiji Okada, a Kyoto food vendor. ``There have been so many
incidents of police wrongdoing that we don't know what or who to
believe anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely a day has passed in recent months on which newspaper
headlines have not reported another case of police corruption and
negligence, including drug abuse, extortion, bribery, sexual
assault, false reports, hazing of fellow officers and coverups.
</P>
<P>
   The scandals have prompted a political debate over what measures
are needed to increase oversight of the police and promote reform.
The police corruption cases have occurred as crime has risen,
apparently fueled by a decade of economic decline, in a society
with traditionally low crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent public opinion poll conducted by the newspaper
Yomiuri Shimbun, 60 percent of Japanese surveyed said that their
trust in the police had declined in recent years; 45 percent said
they did not trust the police at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, we had faith in the police and we could be
proud of them because they stood for something,'' said an elderly
Kyoto man, standing in front of the building where the stabbing
suspect perished. ``Today the police are a shame and an
embarrassment for all of Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first scandals to focus nationwide attention on
police corruption occurred last year in Kanagawa prefecture, where
police officials were found to have concealed an investigator's
illegal drug use and to have obtained seminude photographs of a
female officer that they used to extort money from her. Kanagawa
police officials were also found to have abused younger colleagues
with beatings and gunplay.
</P>
<P>
   In a case in Hokkaido prefecture, a police sergeant was
sentenced to four and a half years in prison after being convicted
in February of repeatedly raping and molesting female convicts.
Investigators said the sergeant was able to pull off the sexual
abuse by sending his partner to patrol other areas of the police
station while he sneaked into the detention center unsupervised.
</P>
<P>
   In another widely publicized scandal in Niigata prefecture, 160
miles north of Tokyo, two senior police officials were forced to
resign in February over a series of blunders involving the case of
a 19-year-old woman who had been held captive for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   After being informed of the extraordinary case on the night the
teen-ager was rescued, the Niigata police chief left the
investigation to subordinates, while he wined and dined and played
board games with an investigator from the National Police Agency at
a hot spring inn until the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   The police chief later approved a plan to issue a false news
release that credited the Niigata police with finding the woman,
though she had in fact been discovered at the home of her
37-year-old abductor by health care officials, who had been drawn
there by his erratic behavior. The national police investigator had
been sent to Niigata to perform a routine department inspection
that was aimed at restoring public trust in the police.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Niigata police later admitted that when the woman was
reported missing in 1990, they had made no effort to contact the
man who turned out to have abducted her, even though he had
previously been arrested in an abduction case involving another
girl.
</P>
<P>
   Although both of the partying police officials were found to be
derelict in their duties and were forced to resign, they were
allowed to receive a pension, which caused widespread public
outrage. Police departments across Japan were inundated with
telephone calls and e-mail messages from people expressing anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their behavior lacked judgment and was inappropriate and
inexcusable,'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said, referring to the
case at a parliamentary budget committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's chief spokesman said that while the reprimand of the
two police officials was inadequate, there was little the
government could do because police supervision resides solely in
the hands of the National Public Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission is basically a rubber stamp for the
autonomous National Police Agency, which nominates its members and
is the main source of research and advice for them.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to public outrage over the Niigata case, the public
safety commission did reprimand the director of the National Police
Agency, Setsuo Tanaka, for failing to supervise its investigator
adequately. Tanaka, who is also the leader of the safety
commission, was penalized with a 5 percent pay cut.
</P>
<P>
   Tanaka was put in charge of the agency, which oversees Japan's
230,000 police officers, in January, after Yuko Sekiguchi resigned
in the wake of the scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, the police were Japan's pride and joy.
Revered around the world for their high morals and ethics and
devotion to duty, Japanese police were considered virtually
incorruptible and highly efficient in solving crimes. The Japanese
community-policing concept was widely emulated by New York and
other major cities.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent scandals, particularly the Kyoto and Niigata
cases, have severely damaged the reputation of the police and
raised questions about their ability to solve even basic crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have said that as a result of the scandals,
officers are finding the public less cooperative in helping them
investigate crimes, and that some citizens have taken to scolding
officers about the corruption when they receive traffic violations
or other reprimands.
</P>
<P>
   Masamitsu Miura, planning officer for the national police
personnel division, said in an interview that it would not be easy
to regain the public's confidence. Miura said that his agency is
undertaking a series of reforms, including increased supervision
and better education, to avoid what he called ``mistakes in
judgment'' that led to many of the blunders.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect us to solve crime incidents and remove the worry
from their lives,'' he said. ``These are our basic duties. By
pursuing these basic duties, we think that we can recover the
public's confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto police said that they found evidence in the dead
suspect's home that proves that he killed the elementary school
student _ including a note saying he had committed the killing. He
left a note at the school saying that he had a grudge against it.
</P>
<P>
   But the school principal, Takeshi Shimokura, is taking no
chances. He has locked the school's gates and hired additional
teachers to monitor the students on the playground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed that police let the killer run away,''
Shimokura said. ``Not as the principal of the school but as a
father and an educator, I wanted to know why he did such a terrible
thing and what was troubling him. Hopefully we can use that
knowledge to prevent other children from growing up and doing the
same.''

COMMENTARY: DON'T PUNISH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a travesty brewing in Congress that, if allowed to
continue, will be a source of shame for all Americans. It will
certainly be an ugly stain on the U.S. labor movement, particularly
the apparel union and the AFL-CIO _ a stain that will highlight all
the unions' phony-baloney assertions in Seattle that they just want
to improve worker rights around the world and help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   This controversy has to do with a stalled trade bill called
``The African Growth and Opportunity Act.'' And the bottom line is
this: At a time when Africa is ravaged by AIDS, at a time when 290
million Africans _ more than the entire population of the United
States _ are living on a dollar a day, the main U.S. textile union,
UNITE!; the main textile manufacturers' lobby, ATMI; and the
lawmakers who bow to both of them are blocking a bill that would
allow Africans to export clothing to America duty free _ instead of
with the current 17 percent import tax.
</P>
<P>
   Why the opposition? Because Africa might increase its share of
U.S. textile and apparel imports from its current level of 0.8
percent! Shame on the people blocking this bill. Shame on them.
</P>
<P>
   Some 85 percent of the garments sold in the United States today
are already sewn abroad. Honduras, little Honduras, already exports
seven times more textiles and apparel to the United States than all
48 nations of sub-Saharan Africa  &UR; combined &LR; . With our minimum
wages, we can't produce jeans that retail for $16 and we don't want
to. North Carolina's textile industry has already become highly
automated and has moved away from low-value goods to high-value,
high-tech fabrics. Much of the unionized labor force sewing clothes
in the United States is in large cities and comprises new
immigrants, many not citizens, since most Americans don't want
these jobs.
</P>
<P>
   If Africa were given duty-free access to our market,
sophisticated textile plants in North Carolina wouldn't move to
Madagascar. China would be the big loser, because Africans have the
same skills to knit cashmere sweaters cheaply as people in China,
and if Africa were given a 17 percent import tax advantage in
shipping to the U.S., manufacturers would move their production
from low-wage China to low-wage Africa. Which is why a study by the
U.S. International Trade Commission concluded that ``the impact of
quota removal (for African imports) on U.S. producers and U.S.
workers would be negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   So why do the unions still oppose it? Sheer knee-jerk
protectionism _ even though the bill has tough measures to protect
against any surge in imports from Africa, and restricts free-trade
status to African countries moving toward democracy, economic
reform and real worker protection.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Right now the only version of the bill the textile
makers would permit is one that says Africa can only import
duty-free into the United States if it first buys all the fabric,
thread and yarn from U.S. factories, then ships it to Africa to be
sewn, and then ships it back to the United States to be sold _ a
costly obstacle course that would prevent any new investment in
African factories. The real motto of U.S. trade unions is: We're
for more worker standards in Africa, not more work.
</P>
<P>
   This is really bad. This bill isn't a panacea for Africa, but
it's important. Throughout the history of industrialization, poor
countries have started down the road of development by sewing
clothes. It's the one thing that poor people can do right away.
It's critical that this bill go through now because by 2005 all the
quotas on textile imports into the United States will expire. It
will be a free-for-all. Right now investors are deciding where to
locate plants for 2005 _ whether to stick with China or branch out
to Africa, Vietnam or Mexico. If Africa is shut out from these
investment decisions, it will fall even further behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintonites talk the talk of Africa and AIDS, but, sadly,
they have been afraid to get tough with the unions on this textile
issue. Why is AIDS spreading so quickly among young women in
Africa? One reason is that women have so few jobs they have to sell
themselves to men with AIDS. Apparel jobs largely employ women.
They make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   But this is of no interest to the AFL-CIO crowd. All they care
about is that Africa not sell more than 0.8 percent of garments
here. Shame on them for what they are doing, and shame on us if we
let them.

NINE WEST AGREES TO PAY $34 MILLION FOR FIXING SHOE PRICES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Fla., and Ohio)   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nine West Group, the maker of women's shoes, agreed
Monday to pay $34 million to settle civil charges brought by
federal and state investigators who contended the company had
illegally fixed shoe prices since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said they will divide the $34 million
settlement among the 50 states and other U.S. territories to be
used to fund women's health, educational or safety programs. The
agreement must still be approved by the Federal Trade Commission as
well as by the federal court for the Southern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West, which was purchased by Jones Apparel Group last year,
also agreed to end its shoe pricing practices that the federal and
state governments contended were illegal. The company's practices
forced women to pay artificially high prices, the governments said,
by ending competition between stores.
</P>
<P>
   The company agreed to settle the case without admitting
wrongdoing. In a written statement, Jacki Nemerov, president of
Jones Apparel, said, ``We believe that this settlement was clearly
in the best interest of our company, avoiding substantial legal
expense and management time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company's legal troubles are not over. Jones Apparel
still faces a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of the millions
of women who have purchased Nine West brands, which include Easy
Spirit, Enzo Angiolini, 9 &AMP; Co., Bandolino, Evan-Picone, Amalfi,
Calico, Pappagallo, Capezio, Calvin Klein, Selby, Joyce and
Westies.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West sells about one out of every five pairs of shoes sold
to women in the United States. Most of those shoes are sold either
at the company's own retail stores or at department stores,
including Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Bon Marche, Lord &AMP; Taylor,
Marshall Fields, Dillard's and Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   In their complaint, federal and state investigators said that
Nine West had entered into agreements with the department stores
and other retailers to sell shoes at set prices. Nine West demanded
that the stores discount the shoes only on certain dates that the
stores and Nine West had agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West employees monitored the stores to ensure they
complied, the government said. Nine West warned the stores, the
government said, that if they did not follow the pricing rules, it
would stop shipping shoes or would not pay amounts it had promised
the stores in discounts or for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The pricing system meant that for years, no matter how many
stores women shopped in, they would find the same prices for many
Nine West styles.
</P>
<P>
   Recent court cases have weakened federal antitrust laws so that
companies can do more to control prices and consumers are less
protected. Under the law, a company can legally tell retailers what
prices to charge and even stop shipping goods to stores that do not
comply.
</P>
<P>
   But Nine West went beyond what was legal, the government
contended, by seeking agreements from the stores on future shoe
prices and on the limited dates when the shoes could be sold at a
discount.
</P>
<P>
   The government contended the illegal activities occurred before
Jones Apparel acquired on June 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement requires Nine West to send a letter to all of its
retail outlets explaining the investigation, and stating that while
Nine West can suggest retail prices, the stores are free to sell
and advertise the shoes at any price they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Four states _ New York, Texas, Florida and Ohio _ took a lead in
the investigation with the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   New York will get $2 million of the settlement. Eliot L.
Spitzer, New York's attorney general, said Monday that the amount
will go to battered women's shelters, breast and ovarian cancer
research and preventive health programs such as mammography
screening.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends a warning to all manufacturers,'' Spitzer said,
``that we will not tolerate illegal pricing agreements.''

INSURGENT CAMPAIGNS FACE REALITY CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's created such a following they have a name: McCainiacs, a
bloc of voters so drawn to John McCain's life story and his vow to
uproot Washington's special interests that they have set aside
personal ideology _ theirs and his _ to make the McCain campaign
plausible.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tuesday, the McCain rocket that soared heavenward with his
startling triumph in New Hampshire may, if current polls hold,
tumble back toward Earth. In another week, as happens almost every
four years around this time, a delegate majority is likely to trump
the euphoria of February's insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   But if that comes to pass, and the two establishment favorites
who began the year as front-runners become the nominees, what is to
become of the patchwork coalition of left-thinking and
right-leaning McCainiacs? Where do the long-time voters
disenchanted with the institutional favorites turn? Or the
first-time voters who were attracted to McCain? And is there a home
for the dwindling band of Bill Bradley supporters?
</P>
<P>
   By most estimates, the next eight months of sharp debate between
Democratic and Republican Party nominees will probably drive most
of them to one side or the other. Or they might follow the example
of millions of others: Avoid the polls on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a new national poll suggests that McCain, like Ross
Perot in 1992, would start with a substantial base of support if he
decided to mount a third party challenge for the White House. And
that has been enough to create a political buzz over whether the
unpredictable McCain might find a way to become a plausible
alternative yet again.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said he would ``never'' take such a step. In the end,
despite Texan George W. Bush's attempts to portray him as a liberal
outrider, McCain may be too reflexively Republican to bolt the GOP.
And if he did, such a challenge would more likely mimic the
quixotic effort mounted in 1980 by John B. Anderson than the
ever-so-brief promise of Perot's rebellion, according to political
strategists who have mulled over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   To be credible, they say, a third party challenge must be
mounted by an outsider; McCain made his political name in
Washington. Its appeal must be based on issues; McCain's allure has
been personality and biography. And to succeed, it must tap into a
national mood of discontent strong enough to prompt voters to
radically alter the American political system.
</P>
<P>
   What discontent? ``This is the politics of contentment. We're
too fat and sassy. The country is prosperous and at peace,'' said
Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution.
``You only get serious third party challenges when there's a
national itch that needs scratching. And we do not have that.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, McCain surely tapped into something. His primary
campaign energized many of the same rootless voters who found Perot
inspiring in 1992. ``Even as much as he has damaged himself with
Republicans, John McCain appealed to and got the Perot
constituency. There is no question that he would be formidable if
he ran as a third party candidate,'' said Donald J. Devine, a
veteran of several presidential campaigns and one of the
conservative strategists who helped Ronald Reagan win in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   To others, McCain's success with Perot's voters is testimony to
the disarray within the Reform Party that Perot launched. The party
is so riven by dissent that its brightest star, Minnesota Gov.
Jesse Ventura, quit in disgust. Even Donald Trump decided against
seeking its nomination. And some of the Perotistas are so alarmed
by the negativist appeal of Pat Buchanan that they want to draft
Perot rather than risk having Buchanan carry their banner in
November.
</P>
<P>
   That internecine squabble, by itself, may well be enough to
deter McCain. Pat Choate, the Reform Party chairman, said in an
interview that if McCain decides to mount a general election
campaign, he'd be better off striking off on his own. But that
would present McCain with enormous ballot access challenges.
</P>
<P>
   While others agree with Hess's view that voters are too content
with the economy to propel a third party candidate to victory, they
nonetheless say there's evidence that, for now, voters are not
enthusiastic about either Gore or Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is a significantly weaker candidate now than we
believed him to be in December. And yet he still beats Gore in
general election polls. Why? Because Al Gore is an even weaker
candidate,'' said John Buckley, who held senior positions in three
of the four previous GOP presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, that sentiment shows up in the Wall Street
Journal-NBC News poll of 1,213 adults that sought to gauge the
strength of a McCain third party challenge. It showed McCain with
24 percent of the vote, to 34 percent for Bush and 33 percent for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Patterson, a political scientist who directs the
Vanishing Voter project at the Joan Shorenstein Center on the
Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard's John F. Kennedy
School of Government, said that beyond McCain's personal appeal,
``he's tapped into a sense that our politics is not working very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said that in a new poll just completed by the
Vanishing Voter project, nearly three out of every four people
agree with the statement that politics in America is ``pretty
disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the promise for McCain hinted at in the polls, some
suggest that political reality would soon set in if he were to
persist in third party roll. If Bush sweeps most of the states that
vote through next Tuesday, as many analysts expect, McCain's allure
would diminish, and so would his poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas D. Rath, a GOP national committeeman from New Hampshire
who supports Bush, said McCain's appeal to new and independent
voters ``has been driven much more by his character, his life story
and his personality than by any extended examination of the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were to be a general election matchup among the three,
Rath said, ``and you said to these liberal supporters of John
McCain, `Do you really want a president who is pro-life and
pro-gun,' they would probably say, `No, not that much.' ''

CONFIDENT GORE BRINGS CAMPAIGN TO NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here on the streets of New York &UR;  &LR; City, Al Gore met
political disaster 12 years ago, fleeced like a Tennessee lamb on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Just 39, bursting with youthful ambition, Gore got a humiliating
10 percent of the vote in the 1988 New York primary, finishing well
behind the victor, Michael Dukakis, and the runner-up, Jesse
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But a dozen years later Gore is back, confident, and favored to
defeat local hero Bill Bradley in the New York primary. The streets
that once held torment may serve as a victory lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1988 he was barely constitutionally old enough to run and
wasn't comfortable with either the social or cultural currents of
New York,'' said Mark Green, the city's top elected Democrat, after
watching Gore campaign on his turf last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he is on top of his game. He knows the issues. He knows
the city. He's comfortable with himself,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore still offers obeisance to New York's ethnic and demographic
fiefdoms _ teachers last Thursday, Irish-Americans and
silk-stocking liberals on Saturday, Jews and gays Monday. But it is
a far cry from 1988, when Gore arrived in New York after five
victories in the Southern primaries to pit his moderate ``New
Democrat'' philosophy against Dukakis and Jackson. On paper Gore's
strategy seemed plausible: He would try to win the votes of
moderate Jewish and Catholic Democrats, while his two foes split
the liberal vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``What followed was a spectacle at once so abrasive and pathetic
as to make many question whether Gore would ever again be taken
seriously as a national candidate,'' wrote Gore's biographer,
Robert Zelnick.
</P>
<P>
   Gotham's loud and florid mayor, Ed Koch, endorsed Gore and then
used the campaign for his own self-promotion. Egged on by the
city's tabloid press, Koch and Gore heightened racial tensions by
pitting Jews against blacks. The mayor, literally, elbowed Gore
aside at news conferences and photo opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore compounded his troubles with clumsy pandering to Jewish
voters, and by attacking Dukakis for giving prison furloughs to
convicted criminals, an issue the Republicans seized upon and used
to assail the Massachusetts governor in the fall campaign. Gore
seemed in over his head. He went home to Tennessee and suspended
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, caught Gore in the
polls last fall, it looked like New York might once again serve as
a painful test for the vice president. Bradley had been a star for
the New York Knicks and was advertised on New York television for
18 years. He had his former Knicks teammates behind him, and
endorsements from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, filmmaker Spike
Lee and Koch.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes Gore made in his campaign organization and
personal style paid dividends here. So did his ability, as an
incumbent vice president, to lock up the endorsements of national
and local labor unions, which still wield great influence in the
Empire State. African-Americans, the most loyal Democratic group
during the Clinton-Gore years, stuck by Gore; so too did the
party's liberal activists, after seeing how he tailored his
positions over the years to better suit their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic race between Republicans George W. Bush and John
McCain, and the ongoing Senate campaign between Hillary Rodham
Clinton and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, have thwarted
Bradley's attempts to garner attention here. The power of the famed
tabloid newspapers has been eroded by dozens of new cable-TV
channels, Internet sites and other news outlets that have as much
clout. Bradley's ads may have had Spike Lee, but Gore's commercials
ask, ``Who has the experience to keep our economic revival going?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said Green, Bradley's chance to score an upset
dissolved when he failed to beat Gore in either Iowa or New
Hampshire. Green used a Wall Street analogy to explain. ``Just as
the capital markets discount expected news, so do the voters
here,'' he said. ``And the expectation, right or wrong, is that
Gore is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   To forestall any last-minute surprises, Gore has run a tightly
scripted and controlled campaign that despite a raucous debate with
Bradley at Harlem's Apollo Theater, or the breaking news that a
longtime Democratic fund-raiser had been convicted on corruption
charges _ keeps him away from the tabloids and extinguishes
potential brushfires.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance last week at P.S. 163, the Alfred E. Smith
elementary school on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, serves as an
example. He read ``A Friend for Little Bear'' for a kindergarten
class, and then joined parents and educators in the public school
library for what was supposed to be a discussion on education.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the demands of his schedule, Gore took no questions from
parents or the press, and instead gave a 10-minute speech before
the TV cameras, complete with the requisite sound bite: an attack
on Republicans for supporting school voucher programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to think that just because schools in New York begin
with P.S., that education is just an afterthought,'' Gore said.
Whatever disappointment the parents might have felt about being
used as props was vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing. He answered all our questions before we could
even ask them,'' said a charmed Betty Miller, the parent of a
third-grade student at the school, after Gore left. ``I'm going to
vote for him.''

 &HT;    Coca-Cola insists it's more than soft drinks in report
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For nearly three months, Coca-Cola Co. Chairman Doug
Daft has been saying that the company is in the beverage business _
not the soft drink business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Coca-Cola's annual report hammers the point home.
</P>
<P>
   The company redefines its worldwide market, substituting
``non-alcoholic ready-to-drink-beverages'' for plain-old ``soft
drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the annual report said, its global market share is
now 18 percent _ not 51 percent. And when you've had problems with
antitrust regulators _ as Coca-Cola did last year _ a smaller
market share can be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Doug Daft and now the Coca-Cola Co. look at the
beverage industry as much more than carbonated soft drinks, and
they realize they are a smaller player in a bigger universe,'' said
John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest.
</P>
<P>
   In the annual report, the company emphasizes the importance of
its wide range of brands. While Coke Classic, Diet Coke, Sprite and
Fanta are key brands, there are 228 others, including Dasani water,
Minute Maid juices and Georgia Coffee, which is sold in Japan, not
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is seeking to become more active and competitive
in the liquid, nonalcoholic beverage market around the world,''
said Andrew Conway, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``I
think it has everything to do with growth. Noncarbs are growing
faster than carbonated soft drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual report also makes little mention of M. Douglas
Ivester, who retired as chairman and chief executive last month
after a troublesome two years at the helm and a total of 20 years
at the company.
</P>
<P>
   In Daft's four-page letter to shareholders, he mentions Ivester
in one sentence: ``I appreciate the counsel and friendship of my
predecessor, Doug Ivester.''

GREENSPAN WARNS OF INFLATION THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The nation's economic boom could be halted by a burst
of inflation unless growth can be slowed to a more sustainable
level, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan warned that the United States can't keep up its
current pace of growth, with a surging stock market fueling
consumer spending and a tight labor market creating wage pressures.
He hinted the central bank, at its March 21 meeting, will again
raise interest rates to slow the galloping economy.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Fed is vigilant about fighting inflation, Greenspan
said, the benefits brought by increased productivity ``are at risk
of being undermined by financial and economic instability.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's latest warnings struck a sobering note at a
conference at Boston College on ``The New Economy,'' hosted by US
Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. About
1,800 business leaders attended the conference, which explored the
impact of technology. Speakers included US Treasury Secretary
Lawrence H. Summers and founders of cutting-edge Internet
companies, such as Monster.com, Lycos, and Sycamore Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan and other speakers, including the chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, said this New Economy has
created new huge risks, as well as opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   After the audience rose to sing ``Happy Birthday, Mr. Chairman''
and Markey presented a 74th-birthday cake, Greenspan delivered an
analysis that contributed to a retreat on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 505 last week,
slid 196.70 Monday to close at 10,170.50, as 26 of the index's 30
stocks declined.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, retreated from
Friday's record, dropping 9.94 to 4904.85.
</P>
<P>
   More than three stocks fell for every two that rose on the New
York Stock Exchange. The 500-stock Standard &AMP; Poor's index lost
9.94, closing at 1391.28.
</P>
<P>
   Although Greenspan repeated arguments first presented in
testimony last month in Congress, analysts interpreted his speech
as a signal rates would be raised, perhaps by a quarter point, at
the upcoming meeting. If the Fed acts, it would be the fifth rate
hike since last June.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chairman cited two forces creating ``imbalances'' that
threaten the economy: wage pressures, due to a labor shortage, and
a soaring stock market, which drove a remarkable 6.9% annual growth
rate in the fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Summers, speaking to The Boston Globe's
editorial board after leaving the conference Monday, said so-called
imbalances in the job market could be eased by bringing more
marginalized workers into the work &UR;  &LR; force, such as welfare-to-work
candidates or disabled workers.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of workers is an ``imbalance that needs to be
addressed,'' by government policies, said Summers, who was a
professor of economics at Harvard University before joining the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Notable in Greenspan's speech was a suggestion there is a dark
side to rising worker productivity, which is typically seen as a
force keeping inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of high productivity gains, Greenspan said, is that
it adds to the scorching pace of growth and creates ``an even
greater increase in aggregate demand than in potential aggregate
supply.'' The result, he said, is ``higher expectations for
long-term corporate earnings,'' which drives the stock market even
higher and fuels consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation adds another dimension to the stock market. SEC
Chairman Arthur Levitt said there has been a sharp rise in recent
months of investing through the use of margin accounts _ basically,
borrowing money to invest in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of margin debt has surged even faster than the stock
market,'' Levitt said. ``I am very concerned about investors
borrowing on other assets, such as homes and real estate, to invest
in our markets.''
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the Internet economy, David Wetherall, chief
executive of CMGI, a holding company that invests in Internet
concerns, said that the New Economy has only begun to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Within the decade, ``we're going to see an increase in Internet
viewing time of 150 to 300 times what it is today,'' Wetherall
said. ``We're only in the early innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zarb, the chief executive of the National Association of
Securities Dealers Inc., an organization of traders, urged that
investors look beyond stories of high-priced stocks to the benefits
of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb said that the Nasdaq's volume has risen to more than 2
billion trades per day from about 700 million just over a year ago.
The ``dot-com'' and Internet companies fueling this trading spree
``are reinventing the way you and I live,'' by changing the
economy's structure and adding jobs, Zarb said.

CHINESE ARREST PAIR WANTED IN MURDER OF 5 IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a major breakthrough in one of Boston's most
coldblooded homicides, two Vietnamese nationals believed to be
responsible for the 1991 execution-style slayings of five men in a
Chinatown social club have been arrested in China and may face
extradition to, law enforcement officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Police from several countries had been searching for the men,
Siny Van Tran and Nam The Tham, since warrants charging them with
the early-morning massacre were issued nearly a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both defendants allegedly have ties to Asian organized crime,
and a third suspect, Hung Tien Pham, remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United States has no extradition treaty with China,
efforts to return the men to Boston to face trial will depend on
the success of discussions between the US State Department and
Department of Justice officials and Chinese government authorities.

<P>
   Tran, who was arrested in the city of Dongxing by the Guangxi
Provincial and District Police, also faces prosecution in China for
possessing illegal drugs and fraudulent Chinese identification
documents. Tham, who was arrested in the city of Shenzhen by the
Guangdong Provincial and District Police, also faces prosecution by
Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Boston attended by top law enforcement
officials, US Attorney Donald K. Stern said the arrests came after
years of teamwork by overseas authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``For nine years, local, state, federal and international
officers, agents, and prosecutors worked together, without regard
to borders or boundaries, to track down two men charged with
participating in one of Boston's most heinous and vicious crimes,''
Stern said. ``Criminals who believe they can run from the United
States and seek sanctuary from justice on foreign shores are
mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 12, 1991, shootings occurred during a violent period in
Boston _ in 1990 the city experienced its highest-ever homicide
rate _ and the nature of the attack shocked Chinatown residents and
even veteran police officials.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the victims was forced to lie face-down and was shot at
least twice in the back of the head at point-blank range, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings took place during a low-stakes game of cards at a
Chinese and Vietnamese social club. A dispute precipitated the
killings, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Ralph C.
Martin II. Several of the victims knew the shooters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth victim survived the shooting and ``has been helpful'' to
investigators, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have long believed that the three suspects, who
were on the Boston Police Department's ``Ten Most Wanted'' list and
are suspected members of the Los Angeles-based Viet Ching gang,
fled to Vietnam or China.
</P>
<P>
   American law enforcement officials waited to announce the
arrests, which were made about a month ago, until fingerprint tests
were confirmed, Stern said. He declined to comment on whether
investigators have any leads on the third suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Also aiding in the investigation are the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the US Drug Enforcement Administration, as well
as Interpol, the Hong Kong Police, and the Ministry of Public
Security of the People's Republic of China and its Guangxi and
Guangdong components.

U.N. COUNCIL URGED TO DEBATE FUTURE OF KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The director of U.N. administration in Kosovo
told the Security Council on Monday that the time had come to open
a debate on the political future of the Serbian province, where
local elections are scheduled to take place before the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, the transitional government's director, said
after all-day meetings with the Security Council that he had won
its approval on the planned elections. He has held that job since
last summer, when responsibility for governing Kosovo, establishing
political and legal institutions and building an economy was handed
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials at the meetings said that the council did not
disagree with Kouchner's assessment that the ``substantial
autonomy'' promised for Kosovo by a Security Council resolution
creating the administration has never been adequately defined. The
officials said that Kouchner's plan is to move ahead as he sees
fit, and that he does not intend to wait for a council definition
of where he is headed.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner, who briefed the Security Council jointly with Gen.
Klaus Reinhardt, the military commander of the NATO-led
peacekeeping forces, invited the 15-member Security Council to
travel to Kosovo to see the situation on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kouchner nor Reinhardt, who held a news conference
together after the Security Council sessions, chose to dwell
primarily on the volatile security situation in the divided town of
Mitrovica on Kosovo's northeastern border with the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner did return several times to the theme of protecting
minorities in Kosovo, however, saying that this is an important
ingredient in shaping the political future of the territory. Aides
say that the vision of the U.N. administration in Kosovo is not
independence, as some nationalist Kosovo Albanians are demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner mentioned the scarcity of money and other resources,
but did not make that his major theme, council members said. ``His
priority today was not to invite us to provide more money or even
more men for the police and so on,'' said Alain Dejammet, France's
representative. ``His main preoccupation today was to get some
guidelines from the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all council members share Kouchner's vision of Kosovo's
political future, and there are bound to be debates here as the
administration in the province introduces more political and
economic measures.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest criticism on Monday of Kouchner's administration
came from the Russian representative, Sergey Lavrov, council
members said. The Russians, traditional friends of the Serbs, are
concerned that Kosovo, still regarded internationally as a Serbian
province, is drifting toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats and experts on the region are critical of the
United States and to some extent of Europe for what they see as a
failure to keep Russia, which has troops in the NATO-led military
operation, involved in political planning as well.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Bildt, Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special
representative in the Balkans, said at a public forum in Washington
last week that the only durable agreement on Kosovo's future will
come from the United States, Europe and Russia working more closely
together.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dennis McNamara, who is responsible for refugee and relief
affairs in Kosovo for the United Nations, said at the news
conference after the closed-door meeting that Kosovo lacks police
officers and legal institutions and officials to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Association of the United States, an independent
research and support group, recently published a set of
recommendations for Kosovo (at www.unausa.org/issues/kosovo). One
of its proposals was that the search for judges and prosecutors be
broadened to create a more balanced judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Laurenti, executive director of policy studies for the
association, said that of 180 local judges sworn in so far, only
eight were from non-Albanian ethnic groups; of 39 prosecutors, two
were. ``You're getting a particularly monochromatic cast,'' he
said.

 &HT;    For Smith, this Kentucky team `special'
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ In December, Kentucky's record was 4-4. That
would be unacceptable at many major programs, but downright sinful
in these parts. And so, the clamoring resounded all over the Blue
Grass State, from the doubters' mouths to Tubby Smith's ears.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's March now, and Lexington is hearing a different kind
of uproar. For sure, they are wild about the Wildcats again, and
for good reason. The coach did not allow the criticism to
demoralize him or his team. Rather, he executed what he called his
``most satisfying'' season ever as coach, including Kentucky's
national championship in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say it is,'' Smith said about this season, which
brings his team to Atlanta for the SEC Tournament at 22-8 and
conference co-champions. ``We've gone through a lot. The death of
(touted recruit) John Stewart. The (three) transfers. We've got 10
guys and that's who we go with. So, to be where we are, we've
probably achieved more than any team I've ever had and certainly
more than any that's been through here in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 title team was laced with experienced holdovers from
the Rick Pitino era _ Wayne Turner, Scott Padgett, Nazr Muhammad,
Jeff Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys on that ('98) team all knew; they had been there
before,'' Smith said. ``For this group to be here, to grow as it
has, is special. When we were 4-4, people were ready to give up on
us. But the kids battled back and achieved one of our goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Another goal is the SEC Tournament title, and the Wildcats come
to Atlanta with confidence. The Wildcats have won seven of the last
eight conference tournaments; Smith is 16-1 in March as Kentucky's
coach; and his team won five of its last six games, including the
convincing 85-70 defeat of Florida, to finish 12-4 in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this group to get where we are is a great statement,''
Smith said. ``Adversity makes you stronger, and this is as strong a
team as I've been around.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Saul Smith, his son, said: ``Nothing feels better than
knowing you earned what you've gotten. No one has given us
anything. We've fought for what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who knows Kentucky basketball knows that March has been
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when the full moon is out and the werewolf changes
form,'' Saul Smith said. ``We're like that. March is here and we're
changing form, getting right.''
</P>
<P>
   Right from the start, Kentucky athletics director C.M. Newton
said the Wildcats could be formidable _ if they could find reliable
offense to go with their fierce defense, led by Smith and freshman
Keith Bogans on the perimeter and center Jamaal Magloire and
sophomore Jules Camara inside.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, Bogans and forward Tayshaun Prince can be deadly
from the perimeter, even if they aren't consistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said that if we start shooting, watch out,''
Newton said. ``It's hard to look pretty when you're missing. But
the job Tubby has done this year has been tremendous. For us to
keep winning when the team does not shoot well is just a great
coaching job. We've played one of the toughest schedules in the
nation. But we've continued to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The unconfirmed but persistent rumors of Tubby Smith to the NBA
continue to circulate. But last week, Smith said, ``I've got a team
to coach. That's where my interest is.''
</P>
<P>
   Other rumblings imply he has grown weary of the overreaction in
Kentucky to every loss and the criticism for relying on Saul Smith
to run the offense. ``Coming here, you never know what to expect as
the coach,'' he said. ``But this job is everything as advertised _
and more.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement could be taken as something other than positive.
But Smith does have strong reasons to stay: He's got one of the top
five college coaching jobs in the nation; and Saul is a junior and
Magloire is the only senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay attention to that stuff,'' Newton said about the
rumors. ``That's a bunch of Internet garbage. Tubby and I have a
great agreement, the same agreement I had with (Pitino): If there
is any other job out there of interest, I'm the first to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, undefeated at the Georgia Dome in Smith's era, are
overflowing with optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it about Atlanta for us?'' Tubby Smith asked. ``I
guess we're familiar with the place, for one. Our fans can easily
get there, so that helps. And we've just played well in domes.
We're comfortable there.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of it rides on the play of Saul Smith at the point.
Kentucky fans have been hard on him, some suggesting that his role
is increased because he is the coach's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned from G.G. (Saul's brother, who played for his father
at Georgia) about playing for my dad,'' he said. ``The big thing he
told me was to be myself. Don't try to do too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great situation. If I could do it all over again, I'd
be right at Kentucky, playing for my dad with my mom and brothers
watching. And now we've got a chance to do something big. It's time
for us to play our best ball. What can be better than this?''

 &HT;    BRADLEY REMAINS HOPEFUL, BUT GORE LOOKING AHEAD
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD and KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vice President Al Gore, in the final day of
campaigning before Super Tuesday, aimed squarely at Republicans as
he vowed to make health care reform one of the main issues this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's sole challenger, Bill Bradley, pinned his presidential
hopes on come-from-behind wins in New England and his native
Missouri while urging New Yorkers to send a ``powerful message to
this country that we want a new politics and a new day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech Monday to health care workers at a Brooklyn
medical center reflected his confidence that he is one the verge of
locking up the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to make health care one of the principal issues in
this election campaign,'' Gore said in criticizing the positions
taken by the Republican candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, on a host of health-related
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore singled out Bush for special criticism, charging that Texas
ranks 49th in providing health care for children and 50th in health
coverage for women. ``That's dead last,'' he said. ``You've got to
work at that.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the Republicans oppose meaningful health care
reforms because they have sided with pharmaceutical and insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would advocate a patients' bill of rights that
would ``take medical decisions out of the hands of bureaucrats and
accountants,'' and that he would move toward universal health care
for all Americans, beginning with expanded federal programs
covering children.
</P>
<P>
   He said the patients' bill of rights measure proposed by Bush
and McCain was ``phony,'' failing to cover 100 million Americans.
He joked that it reminded him of the veterinarian and the
taxidermist who went into business together, advertising: ``Either
way you get your dog back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not begin his campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination advocating a bold approach to health care reforms. But
Bradley's push for universal access to coverage has forced the vice
president to make more dramatic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore planned to visit St. Louis on Monday evening before
returning to Nashville on Tuesday to watch the election returns.
</P>
<P>
   Before his visit to the Brooklyn medical center, he addressed a
conference of Jewish leaders to reiterate his support for Israel
and to the peace process begun during the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He also visited briefly with New York gay and lesbian leaders
before stopping to see his daughter, Karenna, and grandson, Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley campaigned in New York City and suburban Westchester
County before ending his day at a get-out-the-vote rally in a park
behind the New York City Library.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 800 curious onlookers and die-hard supporters turned
out for his last official campaign rally before Tuesday's balloting
in 15 states and American Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign chairman Doug Berman said the mood among staffers was
one of ``determined optimism that tomorrow we will surprise
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the presence of so many of Bradley's top aides lent an air
finality to the event, as if staff members wanted to hear one last
time the candidate whom they have supported for more than 14
months.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley arrived at the rally, he rushed to greet Tom
O'Donnell, vice president of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping for a miracle,'' O'Donnell said after Bradley moved
on. ``I hope this works out for him. Maybe he doesn't need a
miracle, but he needs a hell of a good showing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is everyone ready to do it on Tuesday?'' Bradley shouted from
the stage. Smiling broadly, he tossed some ``Bill Bradley''
baseball caps to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is me running for Super Tuesday,'' Bradley
shouted. ``But it's also about you and your future. ... And after
tomorrow, we are going on to the next campaign and the next
campaign and the next campaign!''
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, Bradley lingered to sign more autographs and
shake more hands. He said he was hoping for victories in Vermont,
Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Missouri. Despite yawning
polls, Bradley also said he was not prepared to ``write off'' New
York.

&HT;     BUSH HOPES SUPER TUESDAY WINS WILL ENERGIZE FUNDRAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: DELETES extraneous line in 2ndgraf; SUBS 20thgraf, In New
York, to add latest poll numbers; FIXES quote marks thruout)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush is counting on a strong
showing in the 13 Republican ``Super Tuesday'' primaries to goose
his fundraising campaign, aides said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared Monday that he's on ``a long march to victory.''
</P>
<P>
   A good showing for Bush on Tuesday would help fuel his legendary
fundraising machine, which raised nearly $70 million last year but
now has less than $20 million left.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is planning fundraisers in New York, Newark, N.J.,
Chicago, Michigan and Palm Beach, Fla. and Miami. According to Bush
finance chairman Don Evans, the goal is to raise between $5
million-to-$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush does well on Tuesday and McCain's challenge evaporates,
that should be enough to tide the campaign over until after the GOP
convention this summer in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   After that, if Bush wins the nomination, the campaign can expect
up to $70 million in federal matching funds, and up to $15 million
from the Republican Party, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's unexpectedly stiff challenge has had an unanticipated
draining effect on Bush's coffers, Evans acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got one plan that says it's over in February and
another that says it's competitive through the spring,'' he said.
``That's the one we're on.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results here in California and in New York, Ohio,
Georgia, Missouri and eight other states ``could indicate who the
nominee's going to be, but we're fully prepared to keep on going,''
Bush told reporters. ``I'm looking forward to the contests down the
road as well as the results tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 613 delegates are at stake on Tuesday, with 1,034
needed to win the Republican nomination. So far, Bush has about 194
delegates to McCain's 111, according to calculations by ABC News.
The numbers are approximations because not all delegates selected
are committed to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned through Southern California with polls showing
him in the lead in several of the most important ``Super Tuesday''
contests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush toured the Museum of Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in an effort to attract the region's sizable Jewish vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every American must know they are equally American _ no matter
their culture, race or religion, Bush said. ``And those who
practice intimidation and violence will have a determined enemy in
the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, according to the Zogby/Reuters/MSNBC poll, Bush
leads McCain 59.3 percent to 25.6 percent among Republicans whose
votes are the only ones that count toward selection of the state's
162 delegates _ the major prize of Tuesday's primary balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can vote in the non-binding preference ballot or the
``beauty contest,'' as it's called in political circles. Although
this doesn't affect each party's delegate-selection process, it
stands as an important measure of each candidate's popular appeal
and capacity to attract independent and cross-over votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby poll Monday showed Vice President Al Gore in the
overall lead with 30.5 percent, followed by Bush with 26.4 percent;
McCain with 19.9 percent and former Sen. Bill Bradley with 9.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This was good news and bad news for Bush. It was good for Bush
because if he beats McCain in the ``beauty contest,'' he dents
McCain's claim to be the GOP candidate most likely to attract
non-Republican votes and win in November.
</P>
<P>
   And it's bad news because it shows Bush slipping to Gore. The
same poll Sunday showed Gore with 27.5 percent in a virtual tie
with Bush at 27.4 percent. McCain had 20.9 percent, and Bradley had
10.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls showed Bush solidly ahead of McCain in Georgia with
54 delegates, Ohio with 69 delegates and Missouri with 35
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Tuesday's second Republican prize with 101
delegates, the Zogby poll showed a tightening race with Bush
leading McCain by 45.9 percent to 41.1 percent in a primary
restricted to party members.
</P>
<P>
   The New York delegates are apportioned by congressional
district.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show McCain ahead in the New England states.

 &HT;    Cremins plugs Peterson for successor
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech basketball coach Bobby Cremins has
expressed a desire that Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson be
considered as his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who last year was among the finalists for the Georgia
job that went to Jim Harrick, captured the Southern Conference
Tournament title Sunday with an upset of the College of Charleston.
With the victory, Appalachian State secured its first NCAA
appearance since 1979, when Cremins was the coach.
</P>
<P>
   A former North Carolina player, Peterson was out of the office
Monday and could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Jackets athletics director Dave Braine will not comment
on the search until someone is hired. But Braine is thought to be
seeking a coach with a record of recruiting success at a school
with high academic standards, similar to Tech's.
</P>
<P>
   Being mentioned as possible choices are Tommy Amaker of Seton
Hall, Dayton's Oliver Purnell, Xavier's Skip Prosser and former
Tech assistant Perry Clark of Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Kent, head coach of surprising Oregon, who guided St.
Mary's (Calif.) to an NCAA Tournament appearance and was an
assistant at Stanford, is a hot candidate, as are Tulsa's Bill Self
and Miami's Leonard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   No decision is expected until after the season ends for the
Jackets. They play Florida State on Thursday in the ACC Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cremins has said that first-year Tech assistant Mark
Price, who some speculated might be interested in pursuing the head
coaching job, would prefer an opportunity to stay on the staff of
the incoming coach.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Reese, another first-year assistant and former Tech
player, was a successful high school coach at Landmark Christian
Academy. The Atlanta native is highly regarded in state high school
circles and could be an asset to the next coach.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Cantwell, Tech's associate head coach, who assisted
and then succeeded Cremins at Appalachian State, will move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get a head coaching job,'' Cantwell said. ``I'll
just keep an eye out on what might become available.''

<P>
   Judge Juan Guzman Tapia requested that the Appeals Court revoke
Gen. Augusto Pinochet's immunity so that he can proceed with
indictments against the former dictator involving charges of
torture, kidnappings and executions. Should the Appeals Court
agree, Pinochet's lawyers can be expected to appeal the decision to
the Supreme Court. Pinochet has been a senator for life, a position
that grants him broad immunity from prosecution, since 1998.

   Ken Livingstone, a Labor left-winger known as ``Red Ken,''

was breaking a pledge not to break ranks with his party but said he
was justified because the choice of the official Labor candidate in
the May 4 election, former Health Secretary Frank Dobson, was
``rigged.'' Blair said Livingstone as mayor would be a ``a disaster

ISRAEL PAROLES SETTLER WHO KILLED AN ARAB

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A Jewish settler sentenced to life imprisonment for
the execution-style killing of a Palestinian in the West Bank was
given parole Monday, after seven years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The settler, Yoram Skolnik, 31, is to be freed next month.
</P>
<P>
   The decision continues a pattern of leniency for Jews convicted
of killing Arabs. Skolnik's life sentence was cut on two earlier
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Palestinians sentenced to life terms for killing
Israelis have not had their sentences commuted. But as part of the
interim accords with the Palestinians, Israel has released dozens
of Arab prisoners convicted of killing Arabs suspected of being
informers for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Skolnik ``sends a negative message to Israeli
society,'' said Ahmad Tibi, an Israeli Arab legislator and a former
adviser to Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader. ``We demand equal
treatment for Jewish and Arab security prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Negbi, a legal commentator for the Israeli radio said:
``The sense is that that the legal system is lenient toward Jews
who kill Arabs out of nationalist motives. Reducing the penalty
grants legitimacy to such acts.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, 1993, Skolnik fired several shots from his Uzi
submachine gun at Musa Abu Sabha, a Palestinian who lay face down,
his hands tied behind him. Abu Sabha had been caught near the
settlement of Susia, south of Hebron, carrying a knife and a
grenade, and had stabbed and slightly injured a settler before he
was subdued.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush is counting on a strong
showing in the 13 Republican ``Super Tuesday'' primaries to goose
his fundraising campaign, aides said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared Monday that he's on ``a long march to victory.''
</P>
<P>
   A good showing for Bush on Tuesday would help fuel his legendary
fundraising machine, which raised nearly $70 million last year but
now has less than $20 million left.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is planning fundraisers in New York, Newark, N.J.,
Chicago, Michigan and Palm Beach, Fla. and Miami. According to Bush
finance chairman Don Evans, the goal is to raise between $5
million-to-$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush does well on Tuesday and McCain's challenge evaporates,
that should be enough to tide the campaign over until after the GOP
convention this summer in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   After that, if Bush wins the nomination, the campaign can expect
up to $70 million in federal matching funds, and up to $15 million
from the Republican Party, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's unexpectedly stiff challenge has had an unanticipated
draining effect on Bush's coffers, Evans acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got one plan that says it's over in February and
another that says it's competitive through the spring,'' he said.
``That's the one we're on.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results here in California and in New York, Ohio,
Georgia, Missouri and eight other states ``could indicate who the
nominee's going to be, but we're fully prepared to keep on going,''
Bush told reporters. ``I'm looking forward to the contests down the
road as well as the results tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 613 delegates are at stake on Tuesday, with 1,034
needed to win the Republican nomination. So far, Bush has about 194
delegates to McCain's 111, according to calculations by ABC News.
The numbers are approximations because not all delegates selected
are committed to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned through Southern California with polls showing
him in the lead in several of the most important ``Super Tuesday''
contests.
</P>
<P>
   Bush toured the Museum of Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in an effort to attract the region's sizable Jewish vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every American must know they are equally American _ no matter
their culture, race or religion, Bush said. ``And those who
practice intimidation and violence will have a determined enemy in
the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, according to the Zogby/Reuters/MSNBC poll, Bush
leads McCain 59.3 percent to 25.6 percent among Republicans whose
votes are the only ones that count toward selection of the state's
162 delegates _ the major prize of Tuesday's primary balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can vote in the non-binding preference ballot or the
``beauty contest,'' as it's called in political circles. Although
this doesn't affect each party's delegate-selection process, it
stands as an important measure of each candidate's popular appeal
and capacity to attract independent and cross-over votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Zogby poll Monday showed Vice President Al Gore in the
overall lead with 30.5 percent, followed by Bush with 26.4 percent;
McCain with 19.9 percent and former Sen. Bill Bradley with 9.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This was good news and bad news for Bush. It was good for Bush
because if he beats McCain in the ``beauty contest,'' he dents
McCain's claim to be the GOP candidate most likely to attract
non-Republican votes and win in November.
</P>
<P>
   And it's bad news because it shows Bush slipping to Gore. The
same poll Sunday showed Gore with 27.5 percent in a virtual tie
with Bush at 27.4 percent. McCain had 20.9 percent, and Bradley had
10.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls showed Bush solidly ahead of McCain in Georgia with
54 delegates, Ohio with 69 delegates and Missouri with 35
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Tuesday's second Republican prize with 101
delegates, the Zogby poll showed a tightening race with Bush
leading McCain by 45.9 percent to 41.1 percent in a primary
restricted to party members.
</P>
<P>
   The New York delegates are apportioned by congressional
district.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show McCain ahead in the New England states.

CHINESE ARREST PAIR WANTED IN MURDER OF 5 IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>

 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a major breakthrough in one of Boston's most
coldblooded homicides, two Vietnamese nationals believed to be
responsible for the 1991 execution-style slayings of five men in a
Chinatown social club have been arrested in China and may face
extradition to, law enforcement officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Police from several countries had been searching for the men,
Siny Van Tran and Nam The Tham, since warrants charging them with
the early-morning massacre were issued nearly a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both defendants allegedly have ties to Asian organized crime,
and a third suspect, Hung Tien Pham, remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United States has no extradition treaty with China,
efforts to return the men to Boston to face trial will depend on
the success of discussions between the US State Department and
Department of Justice officials and Chinese government authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Tran, who was arrested in the city of Dongxing by the Guangxi
Provincial and District Police, also faces prosecution in China for
possessing illegal drugs and fraudulent Chinese identification
documents. Tham, who was arrested in the city of Shenzhen by the
Guangdong Provincial and District Police, also faces prosecution by
Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Boston attended by top law enforcement
officials, US Attorney Donald K. Stern said the arrests came after
years of teamwork by overseas authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``For nine years, local, state, federal and international
officers, agents, and prosecutors worked together, without regard
to borders or boundaries, to track down two men charged with
participating in one of Boston's most heinous and vicious crimes,''
Stern said. ``Criminals who believe they can run from the United
States and seek sanctuary from justice on foreign shores are
mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 12, 1991, shootings occurred during a violent period in
Boston _ in 1990 the city experienced its highest-ever homicide
rate _ and the nature of the attack shocked Chinatown residents and
even veteran police officials.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the victims was forced to lie face-down and was shot at
least twice in the back of the head at point-blank range, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings took place during a low-stakes game of cards at a
Chinese and Vietnamese social club. A dispute precipitated the
killings, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Ralph C.
Martin II. Several of the victims knew the shooters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth victim survived the shooting and ``has been helpful'' to
investigators, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have long believed that the three suspects, who
were on the Boston Police Department's ``Ten Most Wanted'' list and
are suspected members of the Los Angeles-based Viet Ching gang,
fled to Vietnam or China.
</P>
<P>
   American law enforcement officials waited to announce the
arrests, which were made about a month ago, until fingerprint tests
were confirmed, Stern said. He declined to comment on whether
investigators have any leads on the third suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Also aiding in the investigation are the Federal Bureau of

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: Our company has a computer specialist on
staff, but we have difficulties dealing with him. When we have
computer problems, he comes into our department at his convenience,
makes some fast adjustments, gives an incomprehensible explanation,
and treats us like we are fools. His repairs are not that great, so
we have to call him again and the cycle repeats itself. Any
suggestions? T.C.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: You may have some computer problems, but there is
something else that does not compute here. It is fairly typical for
the staff computer guru to operate by his or her own rules, but
that is acceptable only if this specialist is able to make the
computers work. If he has mastered the eccentricities without
mastering the computer, then you have the worst of both worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The next time the specialist deciphers what is wrong, you need
to decipher what he is saying. If you are given an incomprehensible
explanation, tell him that you need more information. You should
have an absolutely clear understanding of what he is saying, and
you should probably write it down. It is possible that he is making
the necessary corrections, and the subsequent problems are the
result of poor communication about the changes that he has made.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, if repairs are truly not being made properly,
and if the working relationship with him remains problematic at
best, then it is time to discuss the situation with management.
Perhaps he needs more training on the technical side as well as in
interpersonal relations, since shortcomings in these two areas can
cause something other than a computer to get booted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The owner of the company where I work recently hired his
daughter as office manager. Granted, she has the training and
experience to do the job. She is picky, insulting and never says
thanks, but the owner feels she can do no wrong. Are we stuck? S.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: When this kind of leadership change occurs on a job, it is
normal to feel that you are stuck between a rock and a hard place
to work. However, in terms of your career, you are only stuck if
you decide to be stuck. You and your associates can roll over and
suffer, or you can try to salvage a work situation that was
apparently quite satisfying before the apple of the owner's eye
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   You and your associates should meet with the new office manager.
It is possible that you are seeing her ``new manager on the block''
mode, and once she gets through the early period, she will start to
act more like a human. You may be able to accelerate this process
by opening the lines of communication with her.
</P>
<P>
   If the working relationship does not work with this increased
communication, you should consider talking to the owner. Although
this may be treacherous territory, you actually have nothing to
lose. If the job has become awful, you are going to have to think
about making some kind of change anyhow. And if the owner's
daughter is as difficult as you indicate, he might be more
receptive than you think. Or he may be the one person who is truly
stuck in this situation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was terminated in my last three jobs, but there are two
sides to each of these stories. I have been through several job
interviews recently, but I am not getting called back, and I am
certain that this is because of the terminations. Do you have any
suggestions? C.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Most employers do not have a fixed number of terminations
that automatically eliminate a job applicant, but the fact is that
you enter many interviews with three terminations and possibly
three strikes against you. Before any interview, it will be
important for you to honestly think about what happened on these
jobs and how you are going to prevent it from occurring again.
</P>
<P>
   You indicated that there are two sides to each story, but
frankly that can be said about every situation in which someone is
terminated. If you focus on these stories, you can spend too much
time defending yourself and too little time describing yourself,
your accomplishments and your objectives.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with each termination, give the interviewer the facts
and then add what you have learned and accomplished as a result.
Rather than being bitter or overly defensive about what happened,
let the interviewer see how you have grown and matured. Try to
focus the bulk of the interview on achievements that illustrate
your drive, persistence, diligence and leadership abilities. And,
if the interviewer does not call you back, you should call him or
her back. You may have three strikes, but that does not mean you
are out.

   NEW YORK _ Turns out, it really is rocket science.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Rose Center for Earth and Space opened last month amid
praise for its architecture and multidimensional tour of the
universe, visitors have lined up with enthusiasm. Sometimes, they
have left in confusion. As one woman complained, ``My brain hurt
when I was done.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the exhibits seem to require, if not a degree in
astrophysics, at least a passing acquaintance with light years,
astronomical units and orders of magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Karin Miller-Lewis of Manhattan brought her 8-year-old son,
Joshua, to the center, and they loved it. In particular, she liked
the way it showed how small humans are on a universal scale. But
something was nagging at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The red shift,'' she said. ``I'm still stuck on the red shift.
There are some completely new terms to me as a nonscientist.''
(Light emitted from an object traveling away from us in space, like
a galaxy, shifts toward the red end of the spectrum and, according
to a sign at the center, that ``tells us how much the universe
expanded during the time the galaxy's light has traveled to us.'')
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of $210 million, the center, which opened Feb. 19,
replaced the Hayden Planetarium, at the 81st Street end of the
American Museum of Natural History. It includes installations worth
$30 million by Ralph Appelbaum, an exhibition designer known for
his modern storyteller style. His work can be seen at the
U.S.Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and the Country Music
Hall of Fame in Nashville, and in many other popular attractions.
</P>
<P>
   While visitors do rave about the spectacle of the Rose Center,
some also find its subject matter a bit over their heads, literally
and figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge for an adult to concentrate on so many
exhibits,'' said Hilda Koch of Manhattan, who was visiting the Hall
of the Universe with her granddaughter and great-grandson from
California. ``Actually, the material seems condensed in a
complicated manner, to me.''
</P>
<P>
   On one topic, Donald Harris of Greenwich, Conn., called himself
lost in space. ``I can understand everything that's been explained
so far, except for the ramp,'' he said, referring to the exhibit
about time. ``The pictures on the ramp aren't really clear to me,
what points they're trying to get across.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's creators had an inkling such perplexity might be a
problem. ``We knew in advance that everybody was not going to get
everything,'' said Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden
Planetarium. ``If everybody got everything, then the level of the
exhibits would be so low that we would be a different kind of
museum.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why six months ago the center hired a small museum in
Connecticut to help with a solution. The Eli Whitney Museum in
Hamden is developing carts equipped with computer screens and
powered by 200-pound batteries. Human ``explainers'' will push the
carts around the center and clarify topics like the speed of light
and how radio telescopes and X-ray telescopes work.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype of the first cart, which explains the speed of
light, arrived at the Hall of the Universe Thursday. Each cart
costs $35,000 to $50,000 to develop and build; at least two or
three more are planned. They can be rolled where they are most
needed and are expected to be useful in entertaining crowds waiting
in line.
</P>
<P>
   The explainers, with the carts, will talk to the public using
the Socratic method, asking how much visitors know and what more
they need to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go back to the fundamental language of
astronomy and astrophysics and remind people that they are more in
touch with it than they realize,'' said Bill Brown, director of the
Eli Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, most people can explain why they count the seconds
between lightning and thunder to gauge the distance of a storm.
Through questions, they discover they knew more about the speed of
sound and light than they thought. (Think of it as nurturing your
inner quantum mechanic.)
</P>
<P>
   Brown stopped short of saying the carts would make the exhibits
more intelligible. He drew other parallels instead. ``We wanted to
kind of create a glossary,'' he said. ``Like when you're reading
James Joyce, it takes a day before you catch the language of it,
before you say, `I got this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the language of astrophysics. ``They know the language
of their presentation needs a little bit of warming up,'' he said
of the center's leaders. ``We're kind of the comedians who warm the
audience up before the show begins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eli Whitney has never annotated ``Finnegans Wake,'' but it
did help bring Leonardo da Vinci's Codex Leicester to the common
man, when the manuscript visited the Museum of Natural History in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The universe is a slightly thornier project. For museum visitors
used to seeing objects and asking questions about them,
astrophysics poses a problem. The artifacts involved are pictures
or computer printouts, on a scale larger than a trillion blue
whales or Barosauruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really more `minds-on' than `hands-on,''' said James
Sweitzer, director of special projects for the Rose Center.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, curators say, is to find ways to connect such
concepts directly to people. Supernovas, for example. At the
mention of them, Sweitzer throws his hands up, as if in a papal
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For astronomers, they're the main event. They're the Sammy
Sosas of astronomy,'' he said, referring to the Chicago Cubs
slugger. ``Yet where's the connection to people?''
</P>
<P>
   As the exhibit explains, it is right within us. Sweitzer
described how all the elements in the human body originated first
in the Big Bang, which formed hydrogen and helium, and later in the
explosions of stars. Oxygen was formed in the explosions of the
first generation of stars, and all the iron in human blood came
later from supernovas. Myles Gordon, vice president for education
for the museum, said, ``It's the most powerful idea I've ever seen,
that we are star stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweitzer agreed. ``It's a big, big idea,'' he said. ``And when
you get it across to other people, you've hit a home run.''

ANALYSIS: PATAKI MAY HAVE MORE RIDING ON N.Y. PRIMARY THAN BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also REPUBS-NYT) 
(nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When George Pataki marched the New York Republican Party behind
George W. Bush's candidacy last year, at a news conference staged
with much fanfare in Manhattan, there seemed little question about
how the primary nomination contest would go: fast, smooth and right
to Bush. As far as Pataki was concerned, Bush was the ideal
candidate: smart, moderate and vibrant, an accomplished governor
and, more important, a prodigious fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   The perception of Bush is very different today, as Republicans
prepare for their first contested presidential primary in New York
since 1976. The candidate's star is not as polished as it once was.
If fairly confident that Bush will defeat Sen. John McCain on
Tuesday, the same Republicans who enthusiastically signed on to the
Texas governor's candidacy last year are tense about his prospects
in a general election, particularly in New York, a state where
Republicans once thought they might have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But for all that, there is not the slightest sign of Pataki or
his supporters backing away from their candidate. Even Monday
night, they were still making telephone calls, distributing
literature, and attacking McCain's record and campaign tactics. No
matter how Bush's bid for the presidency turns out, the New York
Republican Party, and Pataki, will clearly be remembered as one of
his more steadfast and energetic supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that, though, has less to do with Bush than might
be imagined. The primary in New York has in recent days become less
about Bush's campaign for the presidency, and more about Pataki and
the state Republican Party, particularly as Bush has essentially
handed off control of his campaign to Pataki and the Republican
machine.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Pataki has a lot riding on the outcome of Tuesday's
primary. It can fairly be viewed as a test of a governor who has
tried to present himself as a national figure, as well as of the
state Republican machine. Its outcome could well shape Pataki's
future, especially if Bush wins the White House next year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no evidence that Bush has stirred any passion or
deep-seated loyally among the Republicans who are now working so
feverishly on his behalf in New York. When Republicans talk about
why they support him, they do not tend to talk about the vision
Bush has offered during his long campaign, or his personal skills
or abilities as a campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they talk in the cold currency of politics: That he
alone has the ability to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this race is about is putting a Republican out there who
can end the Clinton-Gore era,'' said Zenia Mucha, who is Pataki's
chief political adviser and has largely directed the Bush campaign
effort here in recent days. ``He is the stronger, by far, more
principled candidate in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to forget, in a campaign that has been both elongated
and quick-paced, how different the scene is today than it was last
May, when Pataki assembled most of the state's Republican leaders
on a stage in Manhattan and announced he was delivering the party
to Bush, whose face was beamed into the event via Austin, Texas.
McCain was a sideshow then; it would have been hard to find anyone
in the Republican party _ or for that matter, any journalist among
those covering the race _ who did not believe that Bush was certain
to be the Republican nominee, if not the nation's next president.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that even if Pataki, Mucha and the state
Republican chairman, William D. Powers, had wanted to distance
themselves from Bush as they grew worried about his campaign skills
in the ensuing months, they could not. They had made too much of a
ceremony of the endorsement. More than that, they then had
orchestrated a very public _ and very unsuccessful _ effort to use
New York state election laws to keep McCain off the ballot and
assure Bush the state's delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there is a personal element as well. This senator
from Arizona clearly succeeded in sticking the New York Republican
Party in the eye, whether it was by forcing it to let him on the
ballot, or by his gleeful references to ``Comrade Pataki'' and
``Comrade Powers,'' as he uses the party as a foil in presenting
himself as the reformer. This might have accounted for the extra
shot of vinegar that seems to have found its way into the party's
attempts to assure Bush's victory this week _ or, more precisely to
assure McCain's loss.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, for example, Bush's campaign learned that state
Sen. John Marchi, a McCain supporter, had put out a letter
criticizing McCain for distributing a piece of literature that
mentioned Bush's visit to Bob Jones University in South Carolina,
whose leaders have espoused anti-Catholic sentiments. Bush's New
York campaign aides were instantly on the telephone to the
reporters, faxing out a copy of the letter to anyone who needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sincerely hope that you will see to it that attacks on
Governor Bush, painting him as one of anti-Catholic views, will
stop immediately,'' Marchi wrote, overstating the actual content of
McCain's flier.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Molinari, the Staten Island borough president and head of
McCain's New York campaign, responded by saying that the New York
campaign had very explicitly avoided making any such attacks.
``They made a lot of mistakes and they blame us for their
mistakes,'' Molinari said. ``Thanks but no thanks. We've run a
positive campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, the only question now is what will
constitute a win in the balloting Tuesday. For Bush, who has a
fairly straightforward agenda here, it's mostly a matter of winning
as many delegates as possible. But for Pataki and his cohorts, it
may not be that simple, after this difficult year for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe when all is said and done, the rocky road they traveled
to get here won't be remembered,'' one Republican consultant who is
not sympathetic to Pataki said Monday. ``The antidote to all of
this is that he carries this race big. You might say that the most
interested election-watcher in the state of New York tomorrow will
be the governor of New York.''

N.H. SEEKS SUPREME COURT DECISION IN NAVY YARD DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Firing a salvo over the Piscataqua River that
reverberated all the way to Augusta, N.H. officials have asked the
US Supreme Court to try to settle their long-standing border
dispute with Maine.
</P>
<P>
   N.H. Governor Jeanne Shaheen and Attorney General Philip
McLaughlin hope the high court will hear the case and rule in their
favor, saying that New Hampshire's border runs along the Maine
river shore and not in the middle of the river's main navigable
channel, as Maine contends.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, which sits on
Seavey's Island in the Piscataqua River. If the court decides the
New Hampshire-Maine border is on the Maine shore, New Hampshire
gets the shipyard. If it decides the border runs on a watery line
in the middle of the Piscataqua, Maine gets it.
</P>
<P>
   Also at stake are millions in tax revenues for shipyard workers.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire bolsters its argument with 129 pages of maps and
hundreds of other documents _ some dating to colonial times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historical records of colonial America, of New England, the
state of New Hampshire and, to a large extent, the state of Maine
show that for most of the last three centuries, there was little
doubt that Portsmouth Harbor was part of New Hampshire,'' Shaheen
said. ``New Hampshire should not cede its claim on Portsmouth
Harbor to the state of Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine is ready for fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're massing troops on the southern border,'' joked Maine
Governor Angus King Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a frivilous matter,'' he added, adopting a
more serious tone, ``but I don't think they're likely to prevail,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   King said the strongest evidence for Maine's case ``is there was
practical recognition that it was part of Maine for as long as
anybody can remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen disagrees. ``During the colonial period it was New
Hampshire officials who administered the Port of
Piscataqua...during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, it
was New Hampshire that manned Fort Sullivan on Seavey's Island
where the Shipyard is now located and defended the harbor,'' said
Shaheen. ``And for the past 200 years it was New Hampshire and the
City of Portsmouth that provided services to the Naval Shipyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen pointed out that New Hampshire has long overseen and
funded maintenance and repairs to Portsmouth Harbor _ including a
$5 million turning basin in 1991 that extended to the Maine shore.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear when the Supreme Court will decide whether to hear
the case. But there is precedence for the high court weighing in on
similar state-to-state boundary feuds. It ruled in 1998 that most
of Ellis Island _ the historic immigrant entry point _ was part of
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire contends this case is just as important.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harbor is part of our state's identity,'' Shaheen said.
``It has played a large role in our economy throughout history, and
it is destined to play an important role in our economy in the
future. That is why we must protect our historic right to
Portsmouth Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the shipyard's workers live in New Hampshire,
which has no state income tax. But those workers are levied an
income tax by Maine _ a tax that also takes into account the
incomes of the workers' spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Some N.H. shipyard workers have refused to pay Maine's income
tax, and lost a class-action lawsuit in 1988 in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Navy decide to close the base, the state that is
found to have jurisdiction over the islands will be the big winner
in terms of revenues generated from economic development on that
land.
</P>
<P>
   The N.H. Attorney General's office, led in this case by
Associate Attorney General Leslie Ludtke, has assembled a team of
lawyers and academics to make its case.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Bourre, a former shipyard worker who for years has
championed the case that the shipyard is in New Hampshire, cheered
the state's filing Monday. Bourre has devoted himself full-time to
researching the boundary dispute, and some of his discoveries
helped to make New Hampshire's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful day for me,'' Bourre said. ``It's like trying
to climb a mountain and getting to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   In its filing, New Hampshire argues that ``the Shipyard has
always been culturally, economically, and politically connected to
New Hampshire. Since the colonial period, New Hampshire and the
city of Portsmouth have exercised authority and responsibility over
nautical regulation, quarantine and harbor improvements in
Portsmouth Harbor and have provided municipal and other services to
the Shipyard and naval personnel with little or no protest from
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five islands that now form the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard
are situated in Portsmouth Harbor, New Hampshire,'' the filing
states, and says the Navy and federal government long considered
them as such.
</P>
<P>
   King said the dispute is fueled by taxes. ``The issue only
became a cause after Maine imposed the income tax in the late
sixties.'' King said that through the ``19th and virtually all of
20th centuries, all of the actions of people in that area confirmed
that it was part of Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maine has long argued that it was that state that ceded
Seavey and Dennett's Islands to the federal government in the
1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Maine Attorney General Drew Ketterer said Monday that his state
had agreed in the 1800s to retain parallel jurisdiction over the
property with the federal government . ``New Hampshire took no such
correlary action, because the property is not located in New
Hampshire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ketterer, who said he expects the high court to hear the case,
also thinks a 1969 opinion by then-New Hampshire Attorney General
George Pappagianis bolsters Maine's argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Hampshire Attorney General wrote a written opinion
saying the property's in Maine,'' Ketterer said. ``We think he was
right. It is in Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire hopes the Supreme Court will decide Pappagianis
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, in a settlement over the so-called ``lobster war''
between Maine and New Hampshire, the U.S. Supreme Court set the
ocean boundary between the states at a point in the mouth of the
Piscataqua River. New Hampshire contends that this line sets the
maritime boundary only, and does not extend upriver, as Maine
argues it does.
</P>
<P>
   King said the case will not have ``any particular negative
consequence for the relationship,'' between Maine and New
Hampshire. ``I consider Governor Shaheen a friend and we'll
continue to collaborate and work together on a number of matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine has 60 days to respond.

 &HT;    GOP candidates ply California voters for support
 &HT;    By Ken Herman and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen.
John McCain barnstormed California on Monday as they sought support
in the biggest state on the biggest day of the battle for the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, counting on an unbeatable combination of wins, wants to
make today the final day of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in 13 states participate in contests today that
offer a total of 613 delegates, more than half the 1,034 needed for
nomination. Bush wins in California, New York and Ohio could end
the McCain campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, Monday looked like the last lap by a candidate
convinced he is about to go into a victory trot in Western
primaries scheduled for Saturday, and Southern contests that
include Texas next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude is this is a long march to victory and (Tuesday)
night could indicate who the nominee is going to be, but we are
fully prepared to keep going,'' Bush said after a San Diego rally.
</P>
<P>
   McCain believes momentum is on his side, but time may not be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, Is it going to be enough? I don't think
there's a question of a momentum shift. We have got him (Bush) on
the defensive across the board,'' McCain said aboard the Straight
Talk Express on his way to a rally and Internet chat at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's day included San Diego and Long Beach rallies, a solemn
speech at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles and an
appearance on ``The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain traveled from the Bay Area to San Diego on Monday,
accompanied by his wife, Cindy, four of his seven children and most
of his senior campaign staff.
</P>
<P>
   The entourage is planning to rest Wednesday at McCain's weekend
retreat in northern Arizona, where he and his aides will figure out
what to do next based on today's results.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is also hoping to get final results from last week's
Washington state primary. As hundreds of thousands of absentee
ballots are counted, McCain is narrowing Bush's lead in the overall
vote. He trailed Bush by fewer than 7,000 votes with more than
175,000 ballots yet to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, McCain filed complaints with federal agencies about
$2 million pro-Bush ads bankrolled by Bush backer Sam Wyly of
Dallas. Bush has denied any connection to the ads.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has allowed McCain to return to his core message,
particularly his call for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   At Santa Clara University, McCain told supporters, ``Tell his
sleazy Texas buddies to stop these negative ads ... Don't try to
corrupt American politics with your money.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the speech and tour at the Wiesenthal Center's Museum
of Tolerance also resurrected what has been a theme Bush has
reluctantly had to deal with throughout the campaign, as well as
earlier in his career: his attitude toward Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 letter to the Anti-Defamation League, Bush addressed
fallout from 1993 comments in which he said his Christian faith
tells him that heaven is open only to those who accept Jesus Christ
their as personal savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret the concern caused by my statement and I reassure you
and the Jewish community that you have my deepest respect,'' he
said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Bush told Catholic leaders he had ``regrets'' about
not speaking out against Bob Jones University's anti-Catholic views
when he spoke at the South Carolina school.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, at the Wiesenthal Center, Bush praised the center's
work on behalf of Jews and others who face oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ``A leader must do more than hold this conviction. He must give
it voice. And he must give it force. That is my commitment to the
people of this country,'' he said. ``And those who practice
intimidation and violence will have a determined enemy in the
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice during his speech, a spectator tried to ask Bush about
tolerance toward another group.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about gay people?'' the man yelled, getting no response.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush spent Monday working toward the short-term goal of
wrapping up the nomination, his campaign staff was gearing up for
the longer term.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, Bush will attend 10 to 12 fund-raising events
nationwide, including in Chicago, South Florida, Little Rock, Ark.,
Newark, N.J., New York and Baltimore, according to Don Evans,
chairman of the money-raising side of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush has spent almost $60 million of the $70 million he
has raised. He hopes to raise as much as $10 million through the
upcoming events, as well as Internet and direct-mail efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more people to really contact that would like to
support the governor and just haven't heard from us and we need to
talk to them, we need to get to them,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   That money would take Bush through the period after he
presumably clinches the nomination until federal funds for the
general election _ estimated at $70 million _ begin flowing
following the Republican National Convention in August.

COURT RULES ON WARNINGS TO JURIES ABOUT DEFENDANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Monday that prosecutors may
try to undermine a defendant's credibility by warning the jury that
the defendant might have tailored his testimony to match that of
witnesses who took the stand first.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision overturned a ruling by the federal appeals
court in New York that drawing an adverse inference for the jury
from the fact that a defendant attended his own trial violated his
constitutional rights to be present at trial and to confront his
accusers. In New York, in fact, defendants are required by law to
attend their trials.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses are typically not allowed to be present in a courtroom
when they are not needed for their own testimony. In that sense,
defendants who testify in their own defense have the advantage of
having heard the prosecution's witnesses by the time they take the
stand themselves. Lower courts have disputed for some years what
the prosecution should be permitted to make of that fact.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1991 trial of a New York man accused of sodomy and
weapons possession, the prosecutor summed up the state's case by
telling the jury that the defendant, a ``smooth, slick character,''
was able to ``sit here and listen to the testimony of all the other
witnesses'' before he testified. ``That gives you a big advantage,
doesn't it?'' the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Ray Agard, was convicted. The New York state courts
rejected his appeals. But in 1997 the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals granted his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, ordering
a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said the prosecutor's comments violated
Agard's Fifth Amendment right to be present at his trial, his Sixth
Amendment right to confront his accusers and his 14th Amendment
right to due process of law. The Queens district attorney's office
in New York City appealed the case, Portuondo vs. Agard, No.
98-1170, to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court had based its analysis largely on a 1965
Supreme Court decision, Griffin vs. California, which held that a
defendant's Fifth Amendment right against compelled
self-incrimination was violated by the prosecution's comment on his
failure to take the stand at his trial.
</P>
<P>
   But that decision was ``a poor analogue'' to the current
situation, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority on Monday.
Scalia said the fact that a defendant does not testify, as in the
Griffin case, should not be permitted to relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving its case. Guilt should not be inferred from
silence, he added, because a defendant might have many reasons,
including fear, not to testify.
</P>
<P>
   However, Scalia said, a jury was ``perfectly entitled'' to
evaluate the credibility of a defendant who did testify. ``It is
natural and irresistible for a jury, in evaluating the relative
credibility of a defendant who testifies last, to have in mind and
weigh in the balance the fact that he heard the testimony of all
those who preceded him,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``allowing comment upon the fact that a
defendant's presence in the courtroom provides him a unique
opportunity to tailor his testimony'' might sometimes be
``essential to the central function of the trial, which is to
discover the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that a
prosecutor's comment on a defendant's presence at trial did not
advance a search for truth, because it ``tarnishes the innocent no
less than the guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that under the 2nd Circuit's decision, prosecutors
could still point out specific flaws or inconsistencies in the
defendant's testimony, but were simply barred from making
``generic'' adverse comments that were not tied to anything
specific.
</P>
<P>
   As a general matter, Ginsburg said, a defendant's testimony
might conform to that of earlier witnesses because the defendant
was telling the truth. ``The court today transforms a defendant's
presence at trial from a Sixth Amendment right into an automatic
burden on his credibility,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was unfair for the prosecutor to make these comments
at the summation stage, when the defense has no further chance at
rebuttal. Justice David Souter signed the dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist
and by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and
Clarence Thomas. Justice John Paul Stevens filed a separate
concurring opinion, which Justice Stephen G. Breyer signed. They
said they agreed ``with much of what Justice Ginsburg has written''
but said that the prosecutor's remarks, while troubling, did not
rise to the level of constitutional error.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the eve of climactic primaries in 16 states, the
two Democratic presidential candidates seemed to look past each
other as they stumped through New York City on Monday: Vice
President Al Gore toward the general election and former Sen. Bill
Bradley toward his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   As he dived into boisterous crowds throughout the city and gave
interview after interview on Monday, there was a valedictory
quality to Bradley's events. In a morning television interview and
then at an afternoon rally, Bradley and his wife, Ernestine, spoke
of the candidate's contributions to the campaign in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I'm most proud of is we put some issues on the
agenda that weren't there before, in terms of health care, in terms
of gun control, in terms of making sure people understand how
important campaign finance reform is in this country,'' Bradley
said on CBS' ``Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Democratic Party has moved in the direction that
I've pushed it over the last year,'' he continued. ``I'm pleased
about that. But, of course, having the party move in the direction
is not the same as leading the party as the candidate and president
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made a quick tour of key Democratic constituency groups,
speaking before Jewish voters, a gay and lesbian group and hospital
workers in Manhattan. Looking confident and relaxed, the vice
president spoke as much of the general election as the primary but
insisted he was not ``taking a single vote for granted'' in today's
contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am working hard,'' Gore said at the offices of United Jewish
Appeal. ``I am focused. I would like to ask for your help.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen states, including New York, California, Ohio, Georgia
and most of New England hold Democratic primaries or caucuses on
Tuesday that will select nearly a third of the delegates to this
summer's Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bradley trailing by wide margins in almost all those
states. Bradley said on Monday that he must win ``several''
contests on Tuesday to justify continuing his insurgent campaign, a
feat most Democrats, including many of Bradley's senior aides, say
is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Even in trying to give the impression that their campaign was
gaining momentum, Bradley's aides managed to underscore the
difficulty of their situation. Eric Hauser, Bradley's press
secretary, called a news conference on Monday morning to say that
Bradley had finished a close second in Sunday's Democratic caucuses
in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The caucuses picked delegates. The number of delegates each
candidate will get will be determined by the primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a piece of good news,'' Hauser told the assembled corps
of reporters. ``In Maine, we almost beat the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   At events in the Bronx, Westchester County and Manhattan,
Bradley preached his message of expanding health care, ending
poverty and regulating guns, then invoked the comeback image of a
fellow Missourian, President Harry S. Truman, who stormed back to
victory in 1948 after being declared a loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to you in the same spirit of Harry Truman, don't listen
to the polls and pundits,'' Bradley said under cloudless skies to
more than 400 supporters in White Plains. ``Vote your convictions,
vote your heart, vote for the future of this country. If you share
my dream, make it your dream and help me make it our dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates' schedules on Monday suggested the stark
differences in their campaign styles. Gore gave sharp political
speeches targeted to important Democratic constituency groups. And
Bradley, on possibly his last full day of campaigning, delivered
general, inspirational sermons, the kind he clearly would have
liked to have given all year had the campaign not turned nasty
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Bradley told parables about the importance of
discipline and respect to 200 students at the High School for Law,
Government and Justice in the South Bronx. Almost none of the
students were old enough to vote, so Bradley concluded by urging
them to ask their parents to cast ballots for him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley seemed to strike a chord with his audience when he
mentioned the shooting of Amadou Diallo, the West African immigrant
mistakenly killed in a barrage of 41 police bullets, and spoke
about the need to end racial profiling by police. ``I would
challenge white America to stop denying the indignities that
African Americans experience every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his talk was so devoid of political points that he seemed
almost relieved when one student asked him what he would do about
health care. ``I'm so glad you asked that question, since that is
the main aim of my campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In White Plains, Bradley called for universal health care,
tougher gun regulations, better schools and a ``new politics'' that
would ``honor our past but see the future clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the one thing that can prevent us from doing all these
things?'' Bradley asked the crowd. ``George Bush,'' a man yelled
back. To which Bradley replied, ``There's only one thing. And
that's politics as usual. As well as George Bush. And John McCain,
for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bradley was speaking, a large blue banner emblazoned with his
campaign motto, ``It will happen, March 7,'' collapsed behind the
podium after flapping in the chill wind. Bradley's aides quietly
rolled it up and stuck it under a park bench, where it remained
after Bradley left.
</P>
<P>
   Gore waded into comfortable territory on Monday morning,
speaking in Manhattan to about 200 of the country's most prominent
Jewish leaders assembled at the offices of United Jewish Appeal.
Gore has long been popular in the Jewish community, given his
pro-Israel voting record while in Congress, as well as his
relatively consistent defense of Israeli interests during his seven
years as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you entrust me with the presidency, in the Gore
administration there will be one constant during any negotiations
that we may facilitate,'' the vice president said. ``The United
States must have an absolute and uncompromising commitment to
Israel's security and an absolute conviction that Israel alone must
decide the steps necessary to ensure that security. Whatever Israel
decides can never, not ever, alter our fundamental commitment to
her security.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in Greenwich
Village, the vice president toned down his speaking style and in
hushed tones told more than 200 supporters that he understood the
discrimination that many homosexual citizens faced and vowed that
this was the year to begin ending discrimination against gays and
lesbians. ``We have the duty in our time to create that kind of
future,'' he said.

 &HT;    Applewhite keeps busy with rehab, coaching
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There is the tendency to do too much and try to
go too fast, and Major Applewhite, almost nine weeks after knee
surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his knee, is
finding this out.
</P>
<P>
   As he diligently rehabs for what he hopes will be his job in
upcoming falls, the junior Texas Longhorns quarterback has learned
the value of patience.
</P>
<P>
   With the other, younger, quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite, his left leg still only about 60 percent as strong
as the healthy one, wants to someday be a college football coach,
and is using his forced stint as a bystander to coach the
quarterbacks pushing for his job, sophomore Chris Simms and
redshirt freshman Adam Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I've learned is you can't do too much coaching on
the field, because their heads are swimming,'' he said. ``When they
get some water, have a little time, you give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with Applewhite's surgically repaired knee. As can
be expected, he has turned the rehab process since his Jan. 14
surgery into a competition. As a player, Applewhite has always
tried to know more and understand more than his opponents to get
the edge.
</P>
<P>
   He has taken the same approach with his rehab. He knows where
the graft came from to repair his torn ligament (the middle third
of his patellar tendon) and he knows why (it's the strongest part,
and the two outside sections will eventually grow together, making
it whole again). He knew what to hope for during his surgery _ no
other cartilage or ligament damage, because he saw what a near
total knee reconstruction cost linebacker Anthony Hicks last year.
He describes the surgery as if he were an active participant or as
if he has at least watched a videotape (he hasn't).
</P>
<P>
   And most important, Applewhite says, is that he knows not to do
any more or any less than what physical therapist Allen Hardin
tells him to do. Applewhite's father, Larry, had the same surgery
about seven years ago, 21 years after he tore his ACL in a church
softball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that if they want you to do three sets of 50, don't
cut it short and don't do any more,'' Major said. ``Just make it
the best set you can do. If you work too hard, tendinitis can set
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite is careful to elevate the leg when he's supposed to
elevate it, ice it when he's supposed to ice it. He's already
taking a three-step drop and throwing, though he's not planting
hard, and he's been doing some jumping and cutting and movement
drills, all while Hardin pulls on him with a bungee cord to improve
his balance and build the supporting muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a test,'' Applewhite said. ``The reward might come this
summer, or next summer, or the summer after that. The Lord puts
certain circumstances in your life to prepare you.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that he should be healthy by the time the
Longhorns begin fall camp in August. He'll need to be, because
he'll get no special treatment as the incumbent starter, just as
Richard Walton didn't draw any favors when he returned from a
broken finger, four weeks after Applewhite took his job.
Applewhite, elected to University of Texas student government as an
at-large representative last month, takes a politician's approach
when asked how it affects him that there's a faction of Longhorns
fans who fully expect Simms to take over the starting spot in the
fall, even though Applewhite set school single-season records for
passing yards, touchdowns and total offense and was named the Big
12 offensive player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure I put on myself is the greatest that can be put
on me,'' Applewhite said. ``Sure, you'd like everybody to be a
Major Applewhite fan _ if you're Major Applewhite. But if you're
mature, not worry about it, you can just deal with it.''

 &HT;    Braves' first for catcher tandem
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNEDIN, Fla. _ From the cozy quarters of one position, a most
unlikely friendship has blossomed between Javy Lopez and Eddie
Perez.
</P>
<P>
   From the time they met in spring training with the Braves in
1988, became minor-league teammates for the first time in Durham,
N.C., in 1991 and then reunited in Atlanta in 1995, the two
catchers not only have stayed close but have become best friends in
a climate that easily could have driven them apart.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez was the can't-miss prospect who became a star. He entered
the system a year later than Perez and moved to the majors three
years earlier. Perez was the often underappreciated defensive
specialist. But his value to the team as a backup catcher became
evident last season when Lopez was lost to a season-ending knee
injury. And Lopez knew it better than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to myself, `If there's somebody who's going to take my
job, I'd rather it be him,''' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   With encouragement from Lopez, who talked to Perez before and
after every game, whether in person or by cellular phone, Perez
went from catching Greg Maddux every fifth day to catching every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Perez wasn't expected to provide the offense that Lopez would
have, but he did his best Lopez imitation by winning the National
League Championship Series MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   Perez started all six games against the Mets and hit .500. He
hit game-winning home runs in Games 1 and 2, inspiring Braves fans
to chant ``Ed-die, Ed-die,'' which sounded an awful lot like
``Ja-vee, Ja-vee'' of three years before when Lopez led the Braves
to the World Series by pounding the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed every moment of it,'' Lopez said about watching
Perez in last year's NLCS. ``Besides his wife, I was the happiest
person.''
</P>
<P>
   And the feeling has been mutual for Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get jealous of anybody playing in front of me,'' said
Perez, who played behind top draft pick Tyler Houston and Lopez in
the minors. ``I worry about my chances. It wasn't their fault. I
just waited for my chance.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of attitude makes it easy on manager Bobby Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's such a quality person,'' Cox said. ``He knows Javy's
the guy.... Eddie could be catching for somebody else. We certainly
didn't want to lose Eddie in the expansion draft (in December
1997). I don't think we've ever talked about trading Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, a 31-year-old Venezuelan, and Lopez, a 29-year-old Puerto
Rican, got to know each other well in Durham. And now, they are
connected by so much more.
</P>
<P>
   Following Lopez's lead, Perez kept his family in Atlanta in the
offseason this year for the first time. The families live a five
minute walk apart. At least once a week their families eat dinner
together and pray together.
</P>
<P>
   The two worked out together in the offseason while
rehabilitating from surgery _ Lopez from his knee injury and Perez
from shoulder and knee surgery. And they goof around together, too.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody gave Perez more grief for the beating he took behind the
plate last year from foul balls and stray pitches than Lopez. Perez
also got grief for being locked out of the Braves' clubhouse
following an ESPN interview on the field after a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too big; he's too wide. He's like a wall,'' Lopez said
when describing why he thought Perez was so good at blocking
pitches. And what made Perez a good friend?
</P>
<P>
   ``He lies too much,'' Lopez said. ``Other than that, he's the
best you can find out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, a deadpan kidder who keeps his teammates in stitches,
will give Lopez that. And he came back with a ``wider is better.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly turned serious in explaining how he and Lopez
have remained so close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We care about the team,'' Perez said. ``We care about
winning.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the local alternative rock station listed the 300 top songs
of the millennium in December, Adam Campbell, a freshman at the
University of Oregon, decided it would be nice to own the entire
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, using the fast Internet connection in his dorm
room and a new online service called Napster, Campbell had
retrieved 275 of the tunes _free. They sit nestled on his computer
hard drive along with 800 or so other songs he has accumulated the
same way. ``That's three days of continuous music,'' he notes with
pride.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry is already disturbed about how easy it is to
copy music via the Internet without paying for it. But in recent
months Napster has greatly magnified the threat. Acting like a
music search engine, the software makes it easier to find and copy
a far wider array of music. It also makes it easier for individuals
to offer their own music collections to others.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, created last year by a 19-year-old college dropout, has
spread so quickly among college students, traditionally the most
avid consumers of recorded music, that the resulting glut of
digital traffic has overloaded university networks. Dozens of
campuses have banned students from using the service _ not because
of copyright issues but to protect their networks.
</P>
<P>
   But Napster is by no means just a college fad. Every day, about
a million otherwise law-abiding adult citizens are demonstrating no
compunction about using the service to get free what they would
have to pay for in a record store. And their numbers are growing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Recording Industry Association of America filed
a lawsuit against Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif.,
seeking damages and an injunction that would effectively shut down
the service. Napster argues that it is not liable for music piracy
since the service does not keep any of the music files on its own
servers. The company says that its software simply allows people to
share information. And many of the songs that are traded have been
authorized for copying by the copyright holders.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry says it has no plans to prosecute
individual users of Napster, although copyright experts say the
industry would have a very strong case. The ``fair use'' doctrine
of copyright law gives consumers the right to make copies of CDs
they own for their personal use, and plenty of music fans make
tapes or even create a duplicate CD for friends without punishment.
But Napster complicates matters because it makes copying possible
at a much greater order of magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of that case, the popular embrace of
Napster has sharpened fears among record industry executives and
some artists that the Internet will undermine the control of
copyright holders over the distribution of their music.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the case is being closely watched by television
and movie executives, who see it as a glimpse into the future of
their own industries. While high-quality video files are currently
too large to be sent quickly over most Internet connections,
high-speed, or broadband, services will soon expose other media to
the opportunities and threats posed by digital distribution.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, a technology known as MP3 has allowed
computer users to compress music into files that are close to CD
quality yet small enough to travel quickly over the Internet. But
there has not been an easy way to find such music and then make it
available to others.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of people use free or inexpensive ``ripping''
software to convert their CDs to MP3 format so they can trade music
with friends or listen to their own music on their computers.
Partly because it is probably illegal and partly because it
requires some technical expertise, few take the trouble to make
those MP3 files available for others to download.
</P>
<P>
   Napster essentially gives everyone who uses the software access
to all the MP3 files on everyone's computers that they are willing
to share. Napster's own servers simply compile a giant, constantly
updated index of all the music available from its users. Users
simply type in the song title or name of the artist they are
looking for, and Napster generates a list of other users who
already have it. (A search Monday for Korn, Santana, and the
Beatles song ''Hey Jude,'' for instance, each yielded more than 100
results). Clicking on one of the selections automatically copies
the file from one user's hard drive to the other's. By linking
thousands of personal computers into a kind of pirates'
cooperative, Napster creates an enormous and continually expanding
library of song titles from which its users can pick and choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got Napster, it was just crazy,'' said Campbell of the
University of Oregon, who had previously sought MP3 files on Web
sites or from friends by e-mail. ``It's much more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster's supporters argue that the music industry needs to
adapt to the digital world and must accept that it cannot continue
making huge profits from traditional retail sales of CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's to say that because the music business is structured the
way it is structured, that's the way it should always be
structured?'' said Stewart Alsop, a well-known venture capitalist
in Silicon Valley who is considering investing in the company
recently formed by Napster's developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I believe the new model is a better way for artists to
operate, that is a moral justification for feeling good about
investing in Napster,'' Alsop said, ``even though technically what
they're doing is facilitating illegal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The record industry counters that if copyrights are not
protected on the Internet, artists will have no incentive to create
new work. Moreover, the Recording Industry Association of America
sees a crucial distinction between Napster and previous copying
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between you sharing a CD with a friend
versus opening up your entire CD collection to everybody in the
world to take whatever they want,'' said Carey Sherman, the
industry association's senior executive vice president and general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But within the music industry there is also a growing
recognition of a cultural battle that cannot be won in the courts.
If today's teen-agers are growing up with the perception that music
is something that can be had free, the industry fears, copyright
laws will become effectively unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an incredible disconnect out there between what is
normal behavior in the physical world versus the online world,''
Sherman said. ``There are people who think nothing of downloading
entire CD collections on Napster who wouldn't dream of shoplifting
from Tower Records. There's just a massive education program that's
needed here for people to understand what goes into the creation of
music.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Napster users argue that slashing CD prices might be a
better defense than lawsuits and consumer education efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't think the record companies need the money,''
said Raquel Poy, 18, a freshman at the State University of New York
at Albany. She was using Napster to download James Brown's ``Play
That Funky Music, White Boy'' while conducting a telephone
interview last week. ``If I were to go out and buy a CD every
single time I wanted to listen to something, I would go completely
broke. They charge so much for CDs that something like this is a
godsend. They should either lower the price of CDs or make this
legal.''

</P>
<P>
   The industry recognizes that suing consumers for copyright
violations would be counterproductive, which is why the recording
industry aims at services like Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the fastest ways to turn potential customers off is to
say they're all a bunch of thieves,'' said Pam Samuelson, a
copyright law expert at the University of California, Berkeley.
``You start hating your customers and your customers are going to
start hating you back, and that doesn't bode well for your ability
to attract them to buy more stuff from you. It makes them more
inclined to infringe rather than buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Napster makes no money at this point, interested
investors say there is potentially significant value in the large
base of music fans the service has already attracted. For example,
Napster could collect subscription fees from its users or persuade
record labels to use the service as a marketing vehicle, or it
could become an e-commerce outlet for CDs and other merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   As a computer science student at Northeastern University in
Boston last year, Shawn Fanning conceived of Napster as a way to
get his roommate to stop complaining about how hard it was to find
the MP3 files he was looking for on the Internet. His solution was
a cooperative model.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster software, which is downloaded free from the
service's Web site, automates the whole process of cataloging,
indexing and enabling the transfer of music files, even though its
own computers hold no music files at all.
</P>
<P>
   Fanning, who was nicknamed Napster in junior high school because
of his ``nappy hair,'' is trying to turn the service into a
business, financed with money from his uncle and other investors,
including Eileen Richardson, a veteran venture capitalist who is
acting as the company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Napster prevails in the association's lawsuit, its
business model is vague. Paradoxically, its potentially most
valuable product would be the data it aggregates on consumers'
musical tastes and listening habits _ a potential marketing gold
mine for the very record industry that is suing the company.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson argues that Napster actually spurs CD sales by
enabling users to sample artists with whom they might not otherwise
be familiar, often resulting in the purchase of a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Napster has declared a desire to work with the industry to
promote new artists, but that may not be likely at a time when many
record executives liken the service to the getaway car at thousands
of crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The motley crew of staff members at Napster's headquarters in
San Mateo prefer to compare the program to the early days of the
VCR. When the movie industry tried to prevent Sony from selling its
Betamax machine because it could be used to make illegal copies of
videocassettes, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Sony, because
the machine could be used for a legitimate purpose. In the end, the
spread of VCRs resulted in enormous extra profits for the movie
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a few of the MP3 files traded with Napster's
assistance have the blessing of their copyright holders. But the
overwhelming majority of Napster's users would appear to be acting
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Napster is supposed to remove the accounts of those
it knows to be distributing copyrighted material. But the company
argues that it is not responsible for what its users do with its
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are going to do what consumers are going to do,''
said Elizabeth Brooks, the company's vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto investors. Several high-profile Silicon Valley venture
capital firms have expressed serious interest in the company.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons, most Napster users say they simply do
not believe they are doing anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Werner, 37, of Oxford, Conn., says he uses Napster to get
digital files of the records that he bought in the 1970s but can no
longer play for lack of a turntable. ``I bought the right to listen
to King Crimson 15 years ago,'' Werner said. ``I'm just making a
digital copy of what I have in my closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff, a 43-year-old Napster user from Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.,
asked that only his first name be used because he knew that, say,
listening to the Grammy-winning Santana single ``Smooth'' on MP3
instead of paying $5 for it might be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But how illegal is it, really?'' wondered Jeff, who owns a
small office-cleaning business. ``Is it illegal if you go three
miles over the speed limit? We used to have a road here and the
speed limit was 55, and that was crazy. There was never any
traffic, and everybody went 70, and finally they just changed the
speed limit. So yeah, you're breaking the law, but how big a law is
it?''

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKS BEGIN TO NOTICE TOUCH OF GRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTER HAVEN, Fla. _ Wherever they go, the fans push as close as
they can and they call out to them by their first names. David Cone
says he has been struck by this more than ever, here in the
intimacy of spring training, 2000. The Yankees go by Derek and
David, Paulie and Bernie, as if they were more rock band than ball
club, as if they were Michael and Scottie's Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation, obviously, is a continuity of core players,
with reinforcements picked up at stations along the express track
to three World Series titles and five straight playoff runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a rarity in sports to see teams stay together five
years,'' Cone said. ``This must have been the way it was years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone wasn't campaigning to turn back the clock, good union man
that he is. In no particular order, he was just thanking his
resourceful arm and George Steinbrenner's redoubtable wallet for
another shot, another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's just one more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Cone began his sixth season with the Yankees
here Monday, pitching two and two-thirds innings against the
Cleveland Indians. He pitched ``free and easy'' but surrendered a
two-run homer to Roberto Alomar and the Yankees rewarded
Steinbrenner for making the drive from Tampa with their fifth
straight defeat, a 15-1 horror show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the numbers we're losing by,'' Steinbrenner
huffed, referring to the composite Florida score of Their Guys 48,
Our Guys 16.
</P>
<P>
   These are the symptoms of a young spring and an aging staff. At
37, Cone has looked stiffer, puffier, than ever before. He said he
didn't pick a ball up all winter, cognizant of the need to let his
arm retool for the long haul to October. More than anyone, though,
Cone characterizes a starting rotation that is watching the
hourglass and a team that is graying at the temples.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens is also 37, and Orlando Hernandez, at last report,
34. Paul O'Neill is 37 and Tino Martinez is possibly in his last
go-round as the Yankees groom Nick Johnson to move in at first
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some age,'' Cone agreed. ``I look at Paul O'Neill and
I can identify with him. We're kind of going at it year to year.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to enter the age of higher risk and quite
another to suffer cardiac arrest, which is what happened to the
Bulls' dynasty the day Michael Jordan quit. Baseball is a more
complex game with a radically different financial structure. The
only true, indispensable Yankees are Derek Jeter at shortstop,
Bernie Williams in center field and Mariano Rivera coming out of
the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more of a mixture of age and youth, and the Yankees do
have prospects coming, so it's hard to see this as a Chicago Bulls'
situation, a last hurrah,'' Cone said. ``But when you're part of a
nucleus like this one, when you've done what we've done, that's
incentive enough to come back and keep doing it again.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the Yankees are not unlike Jordan's Bulls in
their final years, the old gang having to justify the enormous
expenditure of its ownership by, more or less, winning it all.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner reminded the Yankees of that as he made his exit
during the seventh inning Monday, the score 13-1. ``It's too
early,'' he said; but as Yogi once said, it gets late around here
early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let you know,'' Steinbrenner said, on when not too early
might be. ``I'll let the whole club know, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, an insufferable exercise, always has been,
gauging the quality of the Yankees by Steinbrenner's preseason
standards. Yet this spring marks the first since their mid-1990s
rise that the Yankees came South without one significant addition,
no expensive new toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Joe Torre tells me he's happy with this team, there
probably won't be anything,'' Steinbrenner had said the other day,
in a better mood and forgetting for the moment the need for a lefty
designated hitter. ``When a team that's done what this one has, it
deserves the benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath, he admitted that some benefits run out much
faster than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the year we made the trade for Bucky Dent on the
last day of spring training,'' he said. ``So nothing is guaranteed,
except death and taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   And one other thing: these Yankees are being judged by their own
degree of dominance, just as Jordan's Bulls were at the end.
Anything less means the end of the old gang, or at least the core
gang and perhaps the classiest gang of championship Yankees there
has been.

JOHN P. KEITH, 78, PRESIDENT OF NEW YORK REGIONAL PLANNING
ASSOCIATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., N.J., Nev., Mich., Ariz., N.J., Canada)  (dw) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John P. Keith, a former president of the Regional
Plan Association, a nonprofit planning agency for the New York City
metropolitan area, died Thursday at a hospital in Manhattan. He was
78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was congestive heart failure, said his wife,
Doris.
</P>
<P>
   Keith was president of the association from 1969 to 1989.
Previously, he spent 10 years in the No. 2 job, as executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   In his years at the association, Keith broadened its base of
support, bringing in corporate backers and making it one of the
most influential nonprofit planning groups in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major issues that the organization influenced in
Keith's years there was the decade-long effort, starting in 1963,
to prevent Breezy Point, New York City's last open strip of
oceanfront, from becoming a high-rise home to 60,000 people.
Instead, most of it became a public park and later part of the
first national park in an urban area, Gateway National Recreation
Area.
</P>
<P>
   Keith was also instrumental in preserving commuter rail service
in the region by urging the establishment of the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and New Jersey Transit.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped stop the construction of a fourth regional
airport, near Flemington, N.J., and stimulated the development of
downtown Stamford, Conn., and Metrotech, a multibuilding office
complex, in downtown Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not only the author of research reports, but he was the
kind of leader who got things implemented,'' said Peter W. Herman,
the current chairman of the Regional Plan Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``He also helped create a regional consciousness in the area
through relentless speeches, articles and taking positions. He made
people realize that what you do in New Jersey will affect New York,
and what you do in New York will affect Connecticut. He was one of
the true regionalists.''
</P>
<P>
   John Pirie Keith was born on May 17, 1921, in Windsor, Ontario.
He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Arizona, a
master's in public administration from Wayne State University and a
doctorate from the Institute of Public Administration, where, from
1989 until his death, he worked as a senior associate. From 1956 to
1959, he was an assistant director for the American Society for
Public Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Keith is survived by a daughter, Janet Keith,
of New York; a son, Alexander Keith, of Elko, Nev.; and one
grandchild.

   Capt. Chester M. Lee, who survived the kamikaze sinking of a
destroyer and later helped NASA send all manner of spacecraft into
the heavens, died on Feb. 23 at a hospital in Washington, D.C. He
was 80 and lived in McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   He died after heart surgery, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee worked until the day of his death, most recently as a
special adviser to Spacehab, a Washington company that provides
services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and
that he helped build after leaving the space agency in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He had earlier spent 23 years at NASA, where he played important
roles in the Apollo moon landings, in the first joint space venture
between the United States and the Soviet Union and in the
development of the shuttle program.
</P>
<P>
   As mission director for the last six Apollo launchings _
including the white-knuckle Apollo 13 mission, which limped back to
Earth after an oxygen tank exploded in midflight _ Lee had the
uneasy task of straddling two worlds: the bureaucratic, often
political milieu of NASA headquarters in Washington, and the
no-frills environment in which astronauts and their craft were
prepared for voyages.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Eugene A. Cernan, who in 1972 became the last astronaut to
walk on the moon, recalled on Monday that Chet Lee, as he was
known, spent a lot of time with the astronauts in flight simulators
and walked the lava fields of Hawaii, which were used as a training
field for lunar excursions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike most of the folks in Washington, he just took a lot of
personal interest,'' said Cernan, now chairman of Johnson
Engineering, a subsidiary of Spacehab outside Houston. ``He just
wanted to get down and dirty with us, and better understand the
problems we were encountering.''
</P>
<P>
   Chester Maurice Lee arrived at NASA by an indirect route. He was
born on April 6, 1919, in Derry, Pa., the son of Joseph and Mary
Lee, who had emigrated from Mercenesco, Italy. He graduated in 1942
from the U.S. Naval Academy; the Navy then sent him to MIT for
radar training.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he was a gunnery officer on the destroyer
Drexler when, on May 28, 1945, it was attacked by Japanese kamikaze
pilots off Okinawa. The ship sank in less than two minutes, killing
158; Lee was among the 52 who survived.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Lee began training intensively in missile
systems. He was active in the Navy's development of the Polaris
missile, which was designed to be launched from submerged
submarines. He then commanded the destroyer Gyatt and, from 1963 to
1964, a destroyer group.
</P>
<P>
   The missile training caught the attention of NASA, and in 1965,
when the agency was trying to meet President John Kennedy's goal of
putting a man on the moon, Lee became an assistant mission director
for the early Apollo missions.
</P>
<P>
   His career at NASA gave him a firsthand look at some of the
agency's finest moments and its most desolate. On Jan. 27, 1967, he
was present in the blockhouse at Cape Canaveral during a simulated
countdown for Apollo 1. When a fire broke out on board, three
astronauts were killed. Lee had been monitoring activities in the
cabin through headphones, his daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as director of shuttle operations, the NASA official
briefed a group of candidates for the ``teacher in space'' program
about the risks they were facing. Among those in the group was
Christa McAuliffe, who was killed when the shuttle Challenger blew
up shortly after liftoff in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But there were successes as well. Apart from the moon landings,
Lee oversaw the Apollo-Soyuz mission, in which Soviet and American
astronauts docked in space in 1975. In an interview with a NASA
historian during that period, Lee recalled the difficulties, and in
the end, the satisfactions of that effort, made as the Cold War was
still thawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the thing that impressed me also,'' he said, ``in
spite of the language barrier and the obvious dual standoffish _
suspicion, or whatever you want to call it, that dealing in the
technical field was a heck of a lot easier. You could cut right to
the mustard, right to the meat of the problem, and say, `Hey, it's
this way or that way.' You know, it's an engineering solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee also strongly defended the scientific and political
usefulness of the program, which some critics derided as a waste of
money.
</P>
<P>
   After the project ended, Lee began working in NASA's shuttle
operations, overseeing development of its payload program, which
was expanded to include foreign governments and corporations. At
Space-hab, he helped develop the pressurized modules used by
shuttle astronauts to conduct experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was recently nominated for a ``distinguished graduate''
award from the Naval Academy, from which his son, David J. Lee, of
Springfield, Va., a retired lieutenant-colonel in the Marines, also
graduated. David Lee's son Michael also graduated from the academy
and is a helicopter pilot in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is survived by his wife, Rose M. Lee; a son, David J.; two
daughters, Virginia A. Lee and Nancy Lee Cusher, both of McLean;
and a sister, Mary H. Lee, of Latrobe, Pa. Another daughter,
Suzanne Nosik, died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's enthusiasm for working with astronauts may have had a
simple explanation: he would gladly have gone along on any of the
missions he helped direct, those who knew him said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' said his daughter Virginia, ``if he had been
give the opportunity, he would have done it. Absolutely.''

 &HT;    Demand for Coke's documents called 'frivolous'
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Days after plaintiffs' attorneys in a racial
discrimination case asked a federal judge to punish Coca-Cola for
withholding documents, the company wants the attorneys reprimanded
for filing ``frivolous'' motions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Coca-Cola responded Monday to plaintiffs' efforts to
obtain documents on the company's current restructuring, in which
6,000 jobs are being cut. The plaintiffs say they need the material
to determine whether African-Americans who could become members of
a class action are being unfairly targeted for layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola says the plaintiffs' latest motion and other
recent ``spurious pleadings'' are simply maneuvers to undermine the
legal process and gain media attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coca-Cola has persuasively demonstrated the absurdity of
plaintiffs' claims,'' the company says in its motion filed in U.S.
District Court in Atlanta. ``Unfortunately, however, much of the
damage of what plaintiffs are trying to achieve occur when the
spurious pleadings are filed and simultaneously provided to the
press. This is an established pattern ... and will continue until
the court makes it clear it will not be tolerated,'' the motion
says.
</P>
<P>
   But plaintiffs' attorney Cyrus Mehri disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are legitimate, unanswered questions because of the
company's ongoing shell game of hiding the facts about the
layoffs,'' Mehri said.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the attorneys' latest tactic was to use the
layoff of former human resources benefits manager Larry Jones, an
African-American who has since held rallies against Coca-Cola, as a
way to get material on the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   In a Feb. 22 motion, the plaintiffs said Jones was included in
the layoffs after informing President Jack Stahl that he had held a
meeting with other black employees to discuss the signing of
severance waivers. By signing the releases, blacks were giving up
their right to sue the company in exchange for enhanced severance
benefits. They would also relinquish their right to be prospective
members of a class action.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' attorneys asked U.S. District Judge Richard
Story to order Coca-Cola to hand over documents on its corporate
restructuring so the attorneys could determine if African-Americans
who have complained about discrimination or the severance waivers
were being retaliated against with layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also asked the judge to invalidate the company's
severance policy, which Coca-Cola did on its own last week.
African-Americans now can receive enhanced severance benefits and
become members of a class action.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola says the incident involving Jones was just the latest
maneuver by the plaintiffs to obtain company documents that so far
have been sanctioned as off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiffs' counsel, defeated three times in their effort to
persuade the Court to provide discovery regarding the (company's)
realignment purportedly to use it in challenging the (severance)
releases, have now turned to Jones to trumpet their cause to the
media and other prospective class members.''
</P>
<P>
   While the plaintiffs contend that Jones, who held another rally
criticizing the company this past weekend at St. Philip A.M.E.
Church, was terminated after informing Stahl of his actions, the
company says Jones had known since Jan. 26 that he was in a pool of
employees who could lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola also says the plaintiffs' attorneys are using Jones'
meetings with former and current black employees to lay the
groundwork for getting more African-Americans to join the suit, in
violation of court procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola acknowledges the attorneys are allowed to speak with
prospective class members if black employees contact the attorneys
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, while plaintiffs' counsel may have been previously
contacted by some of the prospective class members in attendance at
the meeting, plaintiffs' counsel's participation in the meeting was
a communication with the prospective class not authorized'' by the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola wants Story to order the plaintiffs to pay the
attorneys' fees and other costs it has had to incur to respond to
the ``frivolous'' motion and order the attorneys not to attend
meetings with prospective class members.

 &HT;    Mardi Gras revels build toward blowout
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ A few things seen around the city this Mardi Gras
season:
</P>
<P>
   A cow playing golf. A besotted Grim Reaper. A cross-dressing
cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   Today is Fat Tuesday, the final and wildest day of a Carnival
season that, for residents, began in January, on the 12th night
after Christmas. It's not just the tourists and college kids who
whoop it up in the last week before Lent, the Christian season of
prayer and self-denial that begins Wednesday. With parades rolling
every day and every evening, followed by society balls and backyard
crawfish boils every night, New Orleanians are claiming their
annual right to leave inhibitions at home and party hearty.
</P>
<P>
   Mardi Gras does to New Orleans what a snowstorm does to New
York: It makes residents cheerful and friendlier, except for the
few grumps who are undone by traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone wants to be in costume. All the time. Residents
have entire closets dedicated to jester suits, superhero capes,
wigs, hats and masks.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the cow suit was a member of the Krewe of Tucks, one
of the clubs that host Mardi Gras parades. He was squeezing in a
few holes of golf Saturday before climbing on a parade float.
</P>
<P>
   The Grim Reaper weaved and bobbed his way through the Krewe of
Hermes parade Friday night. A seriously intoxicated krewe member
dressed in a creepy death costume that rose at least 10 feet above
his head, he needed several friends to hold him as he stumbled down
St. Charles Avenue. The crowd nicknamed him the ``Gin Reaper.''
</P>
<P>
   The cross-dressing cheerleader is a member of the Booker T.
Washington High School squad. Last week, during the Ancient Druids
parade, the young man, dressed in the same tights and sequined
outfit as the girls, strutted and wiggled and kicked with the best
of the girls, and attracted a lot of attention along the way.
Parade watchers shouted and cheered him on. This is Mardi Gras.
Pretending to be something you're not is normal.
</P>
<P>
   I called the high school to find out who the student is, but
they were tight-lipped on the subject. An official would only say
he is a ``super senior,'' which means he has finished all his
classes but needs to take a final state test to graduate. Last week
was his last parade, because he can no longer participate in
extra-curricular activities.
</P>
<P>
   `THE REAL WORLD'?
</P>
<P>
   American ingenuity at work: Some revelers from the New Orleans
suburbs created a homemade john in the bed of their pickup. It
consisted of a bucket surrounded by a stall made of blue plastic
sheets tacked to a flimsy frame. Better in the bucket than the
street.
</P>
<P>
   I won't have to wash glasses for days: I caught about 20 plastic
cups from a Krewe d'Etat float Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just got yourself a whole set of Cajun china,'' said Sean
Arrillaga, a parade watcher and New Orleans resident.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest spots in New Orleans this Mardi Gras has got
to be the intersection of St. Charles Avenue and Third Street in
the Garden District. On one corner, Anne Rice's house. On another,
the house where Rex, the king of Carnival, stops his float and
makes a toast today. And across the street is the Belfort Mansion,
home of the moment to the cast of MTV's ``The Real World.'' The
seven handsome twenty-somethings who live there and are filmed 24
hours a day have been the talk of Mardi Gras. ``Real World''
sightings are as cherished as a good set of beads.
</P>
<P>
   But be careful if you want to take pictures of the television
stars-to-be. I took out my camera and started snapping as the
entourage left the mansion Friday night, camera crews trailing. A
bleached blond producer put his hand in front of the lens and said
I should respect their ``privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, but aren't you on a public street in the middle of
the biggest party in the country?'' I asked, ever so politely.
Click. Click. Flash. Flash. The ``Real World'' New Orleans episodes
will air in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   100 MARCHING ELVISES
</P>
<P>
   A bit of advice to potential Romeos: Don't try to shimmy up a
pole to reach a balcony whilst in the French Quarter during Mardi
Gras. They have been slicked down with petroleum jelly to prevent
climbing. No Juliet is worth a bad fall to the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   A little Mardi Gras trivia from Carnival guru Arthur Hardy,
publisher of the ``Mardi Gras Guide'': The first krewe was Comus, a
secret society formed in 1857. Comus began the tradition of themed
parades. Rex, the king of Carnival, first appeared in 1872. The
Krewe of Rex came up with the three colors that symbolize the
season: Purple for justice, green for faith and gold for power. Who
thought these colors looked good together is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   There are lesser-known, ``underground'' krewes as well, like the
Krewe of the Box of Wine, the Krewe of Nutria, Le Gran Cru De
Mentia, and the Krewe of Bra. A personal favorite is the Krewe of
Elvis, started by a man from Conway, Ark. The Krewe has grown to
more than 100 people from around the country, who will be marching
today through the French Quarter. They'll be easy to spot: 100
Elvises, throwing donut necklaces to the crowds.

THE ELECTORATE: AS A REGION'S ECONOMY BOOMS, SO DOES INTEREST IN
THE RACE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COVINGTON, Ga. _ In the old orange cotton fields of Newton
County's past, bright automated factories now turn out an unending
stream of Honey Nut Cheerios and flawless polyester sheeting. And
with each truck that heads out from here on Interstate 20, the
transformed local economy also produces what might be called the
opposite of complacency, an engagement with the world of prosperity
and politics that has surprised even those who planned for this
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Here in north central Georgia, Newton County and its neighbors
are practically reverberating with the economic success that has
enveloped the once rural region. With the unemployment rate below 3
percent, good jobs are piling up in the classified ads. There are
no longer any vacant stores facing the historic town square, which
served for years as the backdrop to the television series ``In the
Heat of the Night.''
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly, national politics does not seem to be so distant
an exercise. People with health benefits and retirement portfolios
talk about the presidential race as if they were company
shareholders examining a slate of directors, thoughtfully
dissecting the candidates and their inner lives. When talk at
restaurants around the square turns to the presidential primary on
Tuesday, there is a sense of absorption in people's voices, as if
they know these candidates well, and as if that knowledge matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been listening to Bush during this campaign, and it's
like he's becoming stronger because he had to figure out McCain,''
said Dan Corder, a builder of subdivision homes, who was sitting in
Smiley's Restaurant on the square. ``I think he's learned something
about the country from this campaign. Maybe he's figured out that
we don't want the old party politics anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Butler, who works at Bell's Discount Groceries west of
town, is delighted with the county's growth and the number of her
friends who are no longer unemployed, and plans to thank Vice
President Al Gore with her vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way he tells people what he's going to do on
education and the economy,'' she said. ``He comes across like he
really means it. And he doesn't spend all his time chopping on
people, like the Republicans do.''
</P>
<P>
   If previous election campaigns seemed to people here a blur of
headlines and angry demands, this year's is more like an
interesting but leisurely novel. The plot, played out by wildly
contrasting characters, is one of national prosperity, and the
people of Newton County have a big stake in its outcome. Like many
voters in earlier primary states, those here say economic growth is
a chief issue driving them to the polls on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hinkle, a mechanical maintenance supervisor at the huge
new Korean-owned SKC factory, which makes enormous rolls of
high-quality plastic film, said he, too, was planning to vote for
Gov. George W. Bush, but was enjoying the competition from Sen.
John McCain, which has produced high turnouts in several primary
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Bush person, but I'm sure curious about McCain,'' said
Hinkle, who moved here from central Alabama to take his high-tech
job. ``I want to do some research and find out what he stands for
and why people are attracted to him.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not much doubt who will win in Georgia on Tuesday. Both
Bush and Gore are enormously popular here, and none of the four
major candidates have even bothered to campaign regularly in the
state. But inevitability does not seem to have dimmed Newton
County's interest in this election. No one here has seen a single
political advertisement or shaken a candidate's hand, and yet
voters are planning to show up at the polls, without making
decisions in last-minute frustration. Republican officials are
predicting a record turnout for the state, and the Democratic
primary may draw large crowds as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are spending more time looking at the intangible things
that they never got to before,'' said Denny Dobbs, an environmental
engineer and former state legislator whose family has lived in the
county for four generations. ``They want truth, they want
sincerity, but mostly they want to take the time to find someone
who can give them a normal presidency. Someone who will do what
they say and not disappoint them.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton County, in fact, is full of people who are in no mind to
be disappointed. The county spent years at a comfortable distance
from Atlanta's chaotic boom, hoping to nibble at growth while
avoiding the strip malls and tract homes. The invasion could not be
held off, but now the benefits of good times have also arrived here
with full force.
</P>
<P>
   Every week seems to bring another announcement of a new employer
or subdivision taking advantage of the 45-minute drive to Atlanta's
airport, Hartsfield International. When the SKC plant, where
machine operators are paid between $14 and $22 an hour, expands to
full size in seven or eight years, it will employ more than 1,000
people and, at $1.5 billion, amount to the largest industrial
investment in the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they have begun to taste the good life, many of the
county's 59,000 people want to hear precisely what each candidate
would do to keep it going. They want to know details of education
planks and economic blueprints. People who work at SKC, or
Michelin's tread-pressing factory, or Nisshinbo Automotive's
brake-pad assembly plant, are far more interested in trade policy
than they would have been a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really broadened people's horizons, and I don't think any
of us fully anticipated that,'' said Samuel B. Hay III, chief
executive of Main Street Bank, one of the largest retail banks
here. ``We've got a large Asian contingent here now, a French glass
maker, people moving here from all over the world. There might be
some political friction, but I think over all it's better for the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like most rural Southern counties, Newton retains a large number
of ardent Democrats, many of them the blacks who make up about 26
percent of the population and descendants of the liberal Methodists
who founded the original Emory College, in the town of Oxford, just
north of Covington. Many well-educated natives of the county who
once assumed that they would have to leave to find a good job, like
Michael Davis, the plant scheduler at SKC, now say they are
thrilled to be able to work where they grew up.
</P>
<P>
   But Newton's location about 50 miles east of downtown Atlanta
has made it increasingly attractive too for a growing number of
newcomers, many of them commuters who tend to settle in suburban
developments on the western edge of the county and vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Newton is fairly evenly split between Republicans
and Democrats, and has been a swing county for several elections.
In 1992, Bill Clinton won the county by just 7 votes, of 13,613
cast; he lost it to Bob Dole by 515 votes four years later. In
1998, Roy Barnes, a Democrat elected governor that year, lost the
county to Guy Millner by just 73 votes. Many people suspect that
the tiny but detectable trend toward a Republican majority may
deepen as county incomes rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new people coming in are more conservative, more
Republican, pushing things to the right,'' said one Democrat, Don
Ballard, a lawyer who has long been politically active in the area
and whose son, Tommy, is running as a Republican for chairman of
the county commission. ``I suspect that the county will go for
Bush'' in the general election, the elder Ballard said, ``although
we've got the economy as our ace in the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, though, that fervent partisanship of either stripe
does not appeal to most residents here, new or old. Considerable
interest in McCain is expressed by many of the county's voters,
including Democrats, who expect him to do well in a region where
personality and policy now often outweigh party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Covington's mayor, Sam Ramsey, who owns a large furniture store
just off the square, is a longtime Democrat who occasionally finds
himself voting Republican and has seen the tendency in others. The
movement away from party loyalty, he says, is inevitable as income
and education rise, but in no way reflects a disengagement from the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people enjoy making up their own minds, forming their
own opinions about the candidates,'' he said amid the clutter of
his busy store. ``You might think that in a good economy people
might not be as concerned, but in a smaller community like this, we
don't see that. It's not the big city, where people think they're
not important. Here they know they've got a role to play.''

STUDIES DOUBT EFFECTIVENESS OF DRUG PLAN BY PRESIDENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Half of all Medicare beneficiaries already have
prescription drug coverage at least as generous as the benefits
proposed by President Clinton, the Congressional Budget Office said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these beneficiaries are retirees who get drug coverage
through former employers, and ``retiree plans usually provide much
more generous coverage'' than Clinton has proposed, the budget
office said.
</P>
<P>
   The finding helped explain why many members of Congress have
expressed reservations about Clinton's proposal to expand Medicare
to offer drug coverage to all beneficiaries. The president's plan
would offer federal subsidies to employers to encourage them to
continue providing drug benefits to retirees.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has repeatedly said that under Clinton's
proposal, the government would pay half of the drug costs incurred
by a Medicare beneficiary, with the maximum federal payment
starting at $1,000 a year in 2003 and rising to $2,500 in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at the budget office said that when premiums and
co-payments required under the Clinton plan are included, Medicare
beneficiaries would actually pay at least 75 percent of the cost of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by Sandra Christensen and Judith Wagner of the budget
office, is one of many on prescription drugs published Monday in
the journal Health Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the studies suggested that Clinton was right to
identify prescription drug costs as a major burden for the elderly,
but that his proposal was not necessarily the most effective way to
deliver those benefits and control costs.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, Vice
President Al Gore often praises the Clinton administration proposal
and says the Republican candidates have offered no real
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate study, Dr. Earl P. Steinberg, a health policy
consultant, found that a small number of Medicare beneficiaries
accounted for a large amount of drug spending. Overall, he said,
spending on drugs for an elderly person averaged $1,100 a year. But
18 percent of the elderly did not buy any prescription drugs in
1998, and among those who filled at least one prescription, 5
percent used more than $4,100 in drugs, and 1 percent used more
than $6,600.
</P>
<P>
   A third study, by the Health Care Financing Administration,
which runs Medicare, said Medicare beneficiaries who do not have
drug coverage filled fewer prescriptions and spent more of their
own money on medications than people who have such insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries with drug coverage filled an average of
21 prescriptions a year compared with only 16 for those without
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hash, deputy administrator of the Health Care Financing
Administration, said: ``This study shows that insurance makes a
difference. The absence of drug coverage results in fewer
prescriptions and higher costs to beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Another study in Health Affairs said that while drug spending
had soared, drug prices accounted for only a small share of the
increase. Most of the increase in spending, it said, resulted from
rapid growth in the number of prescriptions written, the number of
patients receiving drugs and the number of days of therapy for each
prescription.
</P>
<P>
   For example, spending on hormone replacement therapy more than
tripled from 1995 to 1998, mainly because of a big increase in the
number of women who received such drugs to relieve symptoms of
menopause or to reduce the risk of osteoporosis or heart disease.
Spending on drugs to treat asthma and diabetes nearly doubled in
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the study, Dr. Robert W. Dubois, chief executive
of Protocare Sciences, a consulting concern in Santa Monica,
Calif., said the greater use of prescription drugs _ getting people
into treatment or providing more intensive treatment _ often
benefited patients with high cholesterol, diabetes, asthma and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, the government would hire companies to
manage drug benefits for the elderly. When such companies arrange
benefits for large employers and health maintenance organizations,
they typically get discounts of 14 percent to 30 percent, Steinberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the budget office said the discounts under Clinton's plan
would be smaller _ 12.5 percent off the retail price charged to
uninsured retail customers _ because the private companies would
not have as much freedom or incentive to use cost-cutting
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   John K. Iglehart, the editor of Health Affairs, said the studies
suggested that the government should focus its assistance on
Medicare beneficiaries with the greatest need for drug coverage,
those who are poor and those who have chronic illnesses.

<P>
   Mirage Resorts Inc. agreed Monday to be acquired by MGM Grand
Inc. for $4.4 billion in cash, creating a casino industry
powerhouse but probably ending the reign of Stephen A. Wynn, the
founder and chairman of Mirage, as the unofficial king of Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the deal made no mention of what role, if
any, Wynn would play in the combined company. But people close to
MGM said Wynn, while he might have a seat on the board of
directors, is not expected to have a day-to-day role in operations.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Baron, chairman of Baron Funds, which is a major Mirage
shareholder, said that Wynn told him Monday that he intended to
quit and ``start over.'' A person close to the acquisition talks
also said that Wynn had ``other plans.'' A Mirage spokesman said
Wynn would not be commenting.
</P>
<P>
   MGM Grand, which is controlled by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian,
will pay $21 a share in cash. That is $4 a share, or about $1
billion, higher than the $17 a share that MGM Grand offered for
Mirage two weeks ago and nearly double the $10.875 price of Mirage
stock before the offer was made. MGM Grand will also assume about
$2 billion of Mirage debt.
</P>
<P>
   Mirage had rejected the initial offer last Tuesday but had left
the door open to a higher price. Talks began almost immediately
after that, continued through the weekend and concluded about 6
a.m. Monday, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives and analysts said the deal could presage
further consolidation in the casino industry. With few new states
opening to gambling, casino companies will increasingly try to grow
through acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   J. Terrence Lanni, the chairman of MGM Grand, called the
transaction ``a dream combination of assets and people.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined company is expected to be the second-largest casino
company in revenue after Park Place Entertainment, which itself
recently completed its acquisition of the Caesars World casinos.
</P>
<P>
   MGM Grand will own 14 casinos, including five of the splashiest
resorts on the Las Vegas Strip _ its own 5,000-room MGM Grand,
which is the largest hotel in the nation, and New York-New York as
well as Mirage's Mirage, Treasure Island and the $1.6 billion
Bellagio.
</P>
<P>
   It will also have a half-interest in the Monte Carlo on the Las
Vegas Strip and own casinos elsewhere in Nevada as well as in
Mississippi, Detroit and Australia. The company is expected to
control about half the market for gambling by high rollers.
</P>
<P>
   MGM and Mirage each plan to develop a casino in Atlantic City,
N.J., so it is now possible that only one of those projects will go
forward or that one will be delayed, dealing a blow to the city's
development plans but helping some existing competitors. ``You had
two major companies building two major facilities. Now you have one
very major company building one facility,'' said Donald Trump, who
fought Wynn's plans in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   But a person close to MGM said it had not been decided how many
projects would go ahead in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   The swiftness with which the Mirage deal was consummated
surprised analysts. They thought that Wynn, who parlayed a Maryland
bingo parlor that he inherited from his father into a chain of the
world's splashiest theme hotels, would fight to escape Kerkorian,
who is also a self-made man and every bit as powerful as Wynn,
though he tends to remain behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week ago I was on record as saying it was over Stephen
Wynn's dead body he would sell his company,'' said Harry Curtis, an
analyst with Robertson, Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   But Wynn was under pressure from investors because Mirage shares
had fallen so far from the recent peak of $26 a share last May as
earnings fell short. Mirage's new Beau Rivage casino in Mississippi
proved too fancy for the market there, and the Bellagio in Las
Vegas, with an impressionist art collection worth several hundred
million dollars, stole customers from the Mirage. And there seemed
to be little prospect that the shares would recover on their own in
the near term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a fair price for the current environment,'' said
Baron, whose funds own about 6 percent of Mirage shares. Wynn,
meanwhile, said in a statement that the transaction ``fully
embraces the value of the franchise created by each of the Mirage
properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Mirage rose $3.125, to $19, while MGM Grand shares
rose 50 cents, to $19.50.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   People close to the matter say that Wynn, 58, was growing tired
of dealing with Wall Street. And Wynn, whose eyesight is gradually
failing from a hereditary disease, might believe that now is the
time to take the money _ his 11.8 percent stake in Mirage will net
him about $500 million in the sale _ and pursue other ventures or
devote more time to his passion of collecting art.
</P>
<P>
   But some people who know him say Wynn has not shown any loss of
enthusiasm for the casino business and might plunge back in,
perhaps by buying the Desert Inn in Las Vegas, which is for sale by
Starwood Hotels &AMP; Resorts Worldwide Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he feels everything he built is not the ultimate
building,'' Baron said. He also said it is possible that Kerkorian,
who is 82 and might be looking for a successor, will yet find a
role for Wynn.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that the industry and the state of Nevada would suffer
if Wynn left gambling. He is credited with creating the boom in Las
Vegas over the last decade by pushing to offer entertainment other
than gambling.
</P>
<P>
   MGM Grand officials said the acquisition, expected to be
completed by the end of the year, would immediately add to its
earnings per share. The company anticipates significant cost
savings, some of which could come from having to pay less to lure
the high rollers.
</P>
<P>
   MGM Grand is also likely to sell assets, such as Mirage's
airplanes and some homes or apartments used by Wynn or other
executives. It is not clear yet what will happen to the art
collection, one person close to the situation said.

BP AMOCO TO CUT SULFUR LEVELS IN GASOLINE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ BP Amoco, the world's second-largest oil company,
announced on Monday that it planned to reduce sharply by the end of
2002 the level of sulfur contamination in virtually all of the
premium gasoline that it sells in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Motor Co. said the step would cut air pollution by up
to half for cars burning the fuel, and said those models needing
premium gasoline would receive a tankful of the new fuel before
leaving the assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced new rules in December to require oil
companies to reduce sulfur in all types of gasoline from 2004 to
2006. Most oil companies strongly opposed the rules during the
drafting process, contending that they would impose a considerable
and unnecessary expense that they would have to pass on to
consumers by raising gasoline prices by six cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   But BP Amoco did not fight the regulations, and has been trying
to market itself as more environmentally responsible than other oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that while it would need to make some changes
at its refineries, it would not charge extra for its premium
brands, Crystal Clear Amoco Ultimate and BP Super 93.
</P>
<P>
   The two premium brands, which will have less than a third of the
sulfur of other premium brands and a tenth of the sulfur of regular
gasoline, account for nearly 3 percent of the gasoline sold in the
United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   Sulfur, which occurs naturally in crude oil, clogs cars'
catalytic converters, making them less effective in cleaning
exhaust.

POLLUTION BY CRUISE SHIPS STILL A PROBLEM, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A report by congressional investigators being released Tuesday
shows that officials from the Coast Guard and the Justice
Department are expressing concern about the effect on sensitive
marine life of the millions of gallons of waste water being
discharged legally by cruise ships at sea and in port.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns persist despite progress by ship owners in
disposing of waste, the report says. The findings are part of an
analysis of the industry's pollution record by the General
Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress. The report was
commissioned by Democratic Reps. John Dingell of Michigan and Henry
Waxman of California.
</P>
<P>
   Most cruise ships using American ports fly foreign flags, and
the report said there were 87 confirmed cases of foreign-registered
cruise ships illegally discharging waste, oil, garbage and
hazardous material from 1993 to 1998, the latest year for which
figures are available. The number of cases declined to eight in
1997 and nine in 1998 from a high of 24 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise companies were credited with helping to reduce the
numbers through improved technology and a stronger commitment to
eliminating illegal discharges, the report said. Public attention
was focused on cruise ship pollution in 1998 and last year when
Royal Caribbean Cruises International pleaded guilty to a fleetwide
conspiracy to discharge waste illegally over several years.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials cautioned that the decline might also be
the result of fewer resources allocated by the Coast Guard, the
primary regulatory agency, to detecting pollution. The decline has
occurred as the number of cruise ships has grown dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has the highest concentration of cruise ships in the
country, but the Coast Guard district there reduced the time spent
monitoring environmental compliance by more than 50 percent from
1993 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report said that Coast Guard inspectors were
hampered by the size and complexity of the cruise ships. Ships
using American ports are inspected four times a year, but the
typical inspection lasts only four to six hours and must cover fire
drills, life-boat launchings and record checks along with
examination of anti-pollution equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials told investigators that they were more worried
about the millions of gallons of untreated ``gray water'' dumped
legally by cruise ships each year.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal and international regulations, ships can discharge
gray water from sinks, showers, kitchens, laundries and other
facilities anywhere, including in ports. Justice Department
officials said a new definition of gray water might be necessary to
reflect the growth of the industry since the regulations were
written more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Coast Guard began examining whether standards for
dumping the untreated water needed to be tightened after complaints
by environmental groups and Alaskans that discharges might threaten
endangered whales and other marine life in Alaska's Inside Passage.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report dealt only with ocean pollution, but air
pollution is also a growing concern. Last week, the Environmental
Protection Agency said that all six major cruise lines that sail to
Alaska violated state and federal air pollution laws last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged violations involved 13 ships and could lead to fines
of up to $27,500 per ship per day. The companies have said they do
not believe laws were broken.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. agencies are playing a larger role in enforcing pollution
laws because of what the report called a breakdown in regulation by
the countries of registry, like Liberia and Panama. Cruise lines
register ships in those countries to avoid American taxes and other
rules. ``While I'm encouraged that the industry is apparently more
sensitive to environmental concerns, it is clear that self-policing
and self-regulation have limits,'' said Dingell, the senior
Democrat on the House Commerce Committee. ``The Coast Guard is
stretched thin and it may be that we will need to look at ways to
increase their resources to guard against environmental abuses in
the future.''

GREENSPAN REPEATS HIS ANTI-INFLATIONARY MESSAGE AND INVESTORS HEAR
IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just in case investors had chosen not to heed his previous
warnings, Alan Greenspan gave them a reminder Monday that the
Federal Reserve intends to raise interest rates until it is sure it
has squeezed any inflationary imbalances out of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to a conference on the ``new economy'' at Boston
College, Greenspan, the Fed chairman, repeated his message that the
wealth being created in the stock market is creating more demand
than the economy can satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   Investors took notice. They sent the Dow Jones industrial
average down 196.70 points, to 10,170.50. Greenspan even took some
air out of high-flying technology stocks, helping send the Nasdaq
index down 9.94 points, to 4,904.85.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Greenspan talked about how the most encouraging
development of recent years, the upturn in the growth rate of
productivity, was creating problems as well as benefits by leading
investors to bid stock prices up in expectation of rising profits.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ``many analysts are now projecting that the rate of
increase in stock market wealth may soon begin to slow,'' Greenspan
was vague about how much higher interest rates would have to go
before the market cooled down to his satisfaction and the economy
returned to a noninflationary growth path.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that interest rates set in the financial markets have
already risen significantly over the last two years but said as
clearly as he ever does that the Fed would help the process along
with more rate increases of its own, starting at the central bank's
next policy meeting on March 21. The Fed is expected to raise its
federal funds target rate, on overnight loans between banks, by a
quarter of a point, to 6 percent, at that meeting. That would come
after four quarter-point increases over the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until market forces, assisted by a vigilant Federal Reserve,
effect the necessary alignment of the growth of aggregate demand
with the growth of potential aggregate supply,'' Greenspan said,
``the full benefits of innovative productivity acceleration are at
risk of being undermined by financial and economic instability.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy has not overheated so far, he said, because it has
blown off steam through two safety valves. One is imports, which
have met the demand that domestic producers have been unable to
supply. The other is a reduction in the unemployment rate, which
has fallen as employers have dipped deeper into the employment pool
to find the workers they need.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the nation could not afford any further widening
in its trade deficit. Despite some tentative signs that the economy
might be cooling _ most notably a dropoff in the pace of job
creation last month _ Greenspan made clear Monday that he remained
as concerned as ever that the economy was running out of workers,
leaving it vulnerable to an upward spiral in wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the pool of available workers continues to
decline, ``wage increases must rise above even impressive gains in
productivity,'' Greenspan said. ``This would intensify inflationary
pressures or squeeze profit margins, with either outcome capable of
bringing our growing prosperity to an end.'' &QL;

   Greenspan Warns Again On Rates, and Stocks Fall

squeezed any inflationary imbalances out of the economy. In a

   Qwest Is Daunted by Its Own Deal

   If Qwest Communications International had not agreed to acquire
U S West, Qwest probably would have announced a deal to be acquired
by Deutsche Telekom of Germany by now, and at a healthy premium to
its stock price of $57.25 a share. For Qwest's top executives, that
has to hurt. Not only have they failed so far to grasp a highly
lucrative opportunity, but more important, the hurdles standing in
their way are strictly of their own making.

   The music industry was already disturbed about how easy it is to
copy music online without paying for it. But in recent months an
online service called Napster has greatly magnified the threat by
making it easier to find and copy music. Last month, the Recording
Industry Association of America sued Napster, seeking damages and
an injunction that would effectively end the service.

THE GREENS: THIS TIME, NADER PROMISES A SERIOUS RUN FOR PRESIDENT

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ralph Nader did not exactly run for president
four years ago. It was rather like he took a stroll.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign spent $5,000, less than the cost of one 10-second
prime time television commercial, appeared on the ballot in 22
states and pinched only 1 percent of the vote from the major
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Nader, the 66-year-old consumer advocate, vowed that
his candidacy was for real.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Nader said at a rally here for the California Green
Party, he is going to raise ``millions of dollars'' and use
thousands of volunteers who will spend ``millions of hours''
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he plans to spread the Green Party message in
earnest, espousing environmental protection, an end to corporate
welfare, and health care and social justice for all.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the campaign, with a full-time manager, hopes to be
on the ballot in 45 states, get 5 percent of the vote nationwide,
qualify for federal matching funds and gain enough leverage to make
the other candidates take notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would run for political office,'' said
Nader, the founder of Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy
organization, who is still best known for his 1960s exposes on the
corners American car companies cut on safety to maximize profits.
``But it is time to stand up to the rich and powerful corporate
interests that dictate policy in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   His message went over well with the more than 400 people who
attended a rally at a middle school auditorium. More than half of
the crowd were members of the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who else is talking about people before profits?'' said Joe
Mann, a 20-year-old student at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Mirkarimi, a member of the California Green Party, said the
party had raised more money during the rally than Nader had raised
during his entire 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``A serious Nader candidacy means a serious money operation,''
Mirkarimi said, ``and I firmly believe the Green Party will bolster
his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Well established in Europe, the Green Party was started in this
country in 1984 and ran only write-in candidates until 1992, when
it gained recognition in California and a spot on the state ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The party has 11,000 members in San Francisco, 110,000 members
statewide and a total of 250,000 in the half-dozen or so states
where it is well organized.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Audie Bock of Oakland became the first Green Party
member to win a statewide race in the United States when she was
elected to the California Assembly. Within months, Bock had left
the party to become an independent. The Green Party had also
dominated the city council in Arcata, a logging town in Northern
California, with four members, but lost that majority last
November.
</P>
<P>
   Green Party members say their priority is fielding candidates in
state and municipal elections where there is a real chance of
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 30 members hold elected office in California,'' said Greg
Jan, California coordinator for the Nader campaign. ``And Greens on
the local level will be energized by having Nader run a real
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party is also fielding a candidate in the U.S. Senate
race in California. Medea Benjamin, the founder of Global Exchange,
a human rights organization based in San Francisco, is challenging
the incumbent Democrat, Diane Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are disgusted by Democrats and Republicans who take
their marching orders from corporate bosses who fill their campaign
coffers,'' Benjamin said. ``That's why I'm running.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader seemed buoyed by the crowd. He was also tickled by the
response to his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's www.votenader.com,'' he offered. ``We've gotten a great
deal of response to it. The message of giving people power is not a
marginalized message.''

CHINA TRIES TO DEFLECT CRITICISM ON RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With the Clinton administration determined to
have China's record on human rights condemned by the U.N. Human
Rights Commission in Geneva, the Chinese are relying on intensive
diplomacy and procedural ploys to escape criticism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a system that has worked well in the past for would-be
targets of condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.S. administration decides to sponsor the anti-China
resolution, we believe, like in previous situations, the majority
of the commission will be on China's side,'' Shen Guofang, China's
deputy representative at the United Nations said in an interview.
``They don't want to see a confrontation in the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Shen predicted that the United States would not get the solid
support of Europe. Some Western diplomats here say the Chinese have
been able to play American and European commercial interests
against one other with considerable success.
</P>
<P>
   China has had ``dialogues'' with European countries to explain
its record, Shen said, adding that there should be more talks with
the United States, whose main irritant may really be China's
socialist system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we have some room for improvement,'' Shen said. But
since the 1970s, when China began to open its economy and begin
other reforms, there have been big changes, he said. ``China now
has the best human rights situation in its history.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and human rights officials, who point to steps China
has begun taking to cooperate with rights monitors, say that public
criticism is anathema to Beijing. When the U.N. high commissioner
for human rights, Mary Robinson, said in China that the rights
situation had declined, officials warned her not to raise the issue
of Falun Gong, the banned religious sect, or other problems that
she has highlighted.
</P>
<P>
   For a powerful and determined country like China _ or Russia,
when Chechnya is at issue, or at times the United States _ the U.N.
system can offer many ways to avoid public scrutiny and
embarrassing moments, from the Security Council all the way down to
subcommittees meeting in basement rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Official functions are not the only focus. Film screenings, art
exhibitions, journalists' briefings and even ecumenical religious
services can be blocked by pressure from various nations. China is
considered one of the most active in denying a platform for
critics, including the Dalai Lama, who is effectively barred from
U.N. events.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the annual commission meeting in Geneva, which this
year runs from March 20 until the end of April, China has been
running a two-track defense, diplomats and human rights advocates
say.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, the Chinese are expected to try to keep an
American-sponsored resolution on its human rights record off the
full commission's agenda by using a pre-emptive parliamentary
technique, a ``no action'' motion. With support of other Asian,
African and some Latin American countries, China has managed to
have the resolution struck in advance nearly every year; once it
was discussed and defeated.
</P>
<P>
   India, whose rights record the State Department last week
characterized as rife with ``significant abuses,'' backs China, as
does Iran.
</P>
<P>
   On a second track, China works to bar organizations of Chinese
or Tibetan exiles from getting a hearing there. This year it has
already succeeded in excluding Human Rights in China, a New
York-based group led by prominent exiles.
</P>
<P>
   Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist now teaching in the United States,
is co-chairman with Robert Bernstein of Human Rights in China; Xiao
Qiang, another scientist in exile who has worked closely with
Chinese grass-roots groups, particularly the mothers of victims at
Tiananmen Square in 1989, is executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and U.N. officials say that in the past the
commission meeting in Geneva had been unique within the U.N. system
in its openness to nongovernmental organizations. But they say that
may be changing.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Weschler, Human Rights Watch's representative at the
United Nations, said that tolerance for nongovernmental
organizations, known as NGO's, has generally been shrinking under
the current composition of a 19-member committee that is able to
grant or deny ``consultative status'' to independent groups.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Huang, Asia program director for the Robert F. Kennedy
Memorial Center for Human Rights in Washington, said the committee
was ``not very NGO-friendly now.'' Some Western diplomats agree.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Center made Xiao a member of its delegation last
year, and was criticized for giving back-door access. ``This year I
feel for the first time I may not be able to speak,'' Xiao said.
``If we're not going and don't speak, Chinese issues are gone from
the commission.''

Worth Star-Telegram

<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Jerry Narron carried the first lineup card of
the spring to the plate at Hammond Stadium, where the Rangers
opened the exhibition season against the Twins last week, just as
he has for each of his six springs as manager Johnny Oates'
right-hand man. This time, there was one significant difference:
Narron's mom went with him.
</P>
<P>
   He carried her close to his heart, where she will have a special
place for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Narron kissed his mother goodbye for the last time on Nov. 30 as
she lay in a coma in a hospital bed at Duke University Medical
Center in Durham, N.C. Vileigh Narron died a few moments later, the
lowest point of a tragic off-season for the stoic and very private
Rangers third-base coach.
</P>
<P>
   Narron's marriage of 16 years was in its final, painful months
after a long two years of trying desperately to hold it together
for his five children when the phone rang late on the night of Oct.
30. By then, Jerry and wife Linda had been separated for almost a
year, a prerequisite to divorce in the state of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as things had been since January of 1997, when
Linda, out of the blue, told him she wanted to end their marriage,
nothing had prepared Narron for what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   His brother was calling to tell him that their parents, driving
home to Goldsboro, N.C., after attending a 50th-wedding-anniversary
party in Raleigh, had been hit head-on by a drunk driver. They were
both in bad shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact knocked them into an 18-wheeler, and the 18-wheeler
flipped them over into the median,'' Narron said. ``It took about
45 minutes to cut them out of their Suburban. If they'd been in a
regular-size car, they'd have been killed on impact.''
</P>
<P>
   It was John Narron's injuries that most concerned paramedics
initially. His right leg was almost completely severed in the
crash. His left foot was crushed. He had fractures of the wrist and
collarbone. As soon as he'd been cut out of the vehicle, he was
airlifted to Duke Medical Center, where doctors tried
unsuccessfully to save his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Vileigh Narron, diagnosed with broken ribs and a fractured
pelvis, was taken to the little hospital in Smithfield. That's
where Jerry Narron went first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to her, and she seemed like she was going to be OK,''
he said. ``On the day after the accident, if you'd told me I was
going to lose one of them, I'd have thought it would be my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   What doctors didn't know was that 80-year-old Vileigh Narron had
suffered internal injuries that would prove fatal. Five days after
the accident her stomach began to swell and emergency surgery was
performed. Her intestines ruptured, essentially poisoning her
system. She died exactly one month after the accident, having never
regained consciousness after the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   By then, she, too, had been transferred to Duke Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rolled my dad into her room in a wheelchair on the day
she died,'' Narron said. ``He held her hand and prayed with her.
But he can't remember anything that happened now between the night
of the accident and Dec. 15.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin, who has been close friends
with Narron since the two played minor-league ball together,
vividly remembers the phone call he received from the Rangers'
coach informing him of the accident. It came on Nov. 2, half an
hour before Melvin was due at a news conference to announce the
trade of two-time American League MVP Juan Gonzalez to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in my office, and there were several people there, Jim
Lites and Dan O'Brien and Chuck McMichael, and when I hung up from
talking to Jerry, I was emotional and I was crying,'' Melvin
recalled. ``I just broke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hey guys, I'm not crying because I just traded Juan
Gonzalez.' I told them I just needed a few minutes by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It was almost, Melvin said, as if his own parents had been in
the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``His parents always came to visit us in the summers,'' Melvin
said. ``I can still see his father _ we called him `Big Daddy'
because he was a huge man _ sitting up in the stands with Jerry's
mom, watching batting practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Narrons were a fixture in Baltimore, always driving in to
catch the games whenever the Rangers were in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just great people,'' Melvin said. ``When I went to
his mom's funeral and saw his father with his leg amputated, it was
tough. They were a part of me, too. We've known each other's family
for such a long time. At our parents' ages, we know they're
eventually going to leave us, but the way it happened was so
sudden.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Vileigh Narron were still vibrant, active people. She
was a retired high school math teacher who had played college
soccer and basketball at East Carolina, a great cook who still
baked biscuits from scratch twice a day. John, 72, had retired from
the retail-furniture business 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The week before the accident, they'd gone out with friends
doing something almost every night, and I'd asked my mom if they
were ever going to slow down,'' Narron said. ``She said, `Well,
we're going to go as long as we can because at some point we might
not be able to.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The tragic consequences of that fateful night haven't ended yet.
Although John Narron made a remarkable turnaround from mid-December
to mid-January, the injuries to his left foot were horrendous and
went virtually ignored while doctors fought to save his life and
his right leg, which had become infected. Now his left foot is also
infected and it is increasingly likely that he will lose it, too.
</P>
<P>
   And the intoxicated driver of the other car? Also seriously
injured, he was airlifted to a medical center in Chapel Hill.
Police theorize that he entered the divided, four-lane highway by
driving up an offramp the wrong way. His blood-alcohol content was
almost twice the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he was released from the hospital in mid-December, he
was arrested and jailed, but Jerry Narron hasn't even bothered to
find out what charges have been filed against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really thought a lot about him,'' Narron admitted.
``He has a family that loves him, and it must be very, very
difficult on him, but as far as them throwing him in jail, I
haven't thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate for him to do this to someone else, but this
might have been the first time he's ever been drinking and driving.
I do know that no matter what the DWI laws are, they're not
stringent enough. It only takes one time.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents' accident, coming on top of the painful divorce, has
been devastating, but Narron remains incredibly upbeat and
positive. refusing to give in to the loneliness and pain that haunt
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been easy, but I have been blessed all through my
life with outstanding parents,'' Narron said. ``I was given an
outstanding advantage with the parents I've had. I don't know why
it happened. One day, I think we'll know, but it's just that right
now, things happen in life that we just don't understand why they
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know that through times of suffering it gives us a chance
to grow closer in our relationship with God, and I believe if I do
anything other than that, my mom and dad's accident will have been
in vain. I just won't allow that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   To do anything less, Narron feels, would dishonor his mom's
memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it that I had 44 years with as good a mom as anybody
could ever have. I just try to focus on the 44 years of blessing
that I had instead of dwelling on the tragedy of it in losing her
in an accident like that. I just feel so fortunate that I had her
as long as I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going through my personal problems with my wife strengthened
my faith, and I think that helped me get through this. God graces
us, and it is sufficient. Just through what has happened with my
mom and dad, I've grown stronger by it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning of the Rangers' exhibition opener, rookie
sensation Ruben Mateo hooked a low line drive that Narron, standing
in the third-base coaching box, could not avoid. It smacked hard
into his right ankle and caromed away.
</P>
<P>
   Narron looked down and kicked the dirt. He didn't rub it. He
didn't limp. Whatever pain he must have felt, he kept it locked
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Close to his heart.

LINING UP, WHITE, THEN BLACK, FOR MARDI GRAS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAFAYETTE, La. _ Decades after the halt of the separate but
equal system of racial segregation, Mardi Gras remains an event
where black and white revelers come together in the streets here
but party with their own.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike New Orleans, a two-hour drive east, where social clubs,
or krewes, that participate in parades must sign
anti-discrimination statements in what is at least a nod to
integration, Lafayette has no such requirements.
</P>
<P>
   When more than 400,000 people gather along the parade route for
this week's Fat Tuesday celebration here, the two biggest events
will be an all-white parade and an all-black one. ``It's a tale of
two cities,'' said Chris Williams, one of two black city-parish
councilors here.
</P>
<P>
   The first parade, called the King's Parade, is the larger and
older. Participants are from the city's south side and have been
invited to join the Krewe of Gabriel. About 400 white, wealthy
businessmen and civic leaders participate, wearing masks and
tossing beads amid marching bands and flag bearers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lafayette Mardi Gras Association's parade follows minutes
later. Like the King's Parade, the association's parade has royalty
and bead-throwing by the Krewe de Caribbeans. Many people join the
celebration dressed in elaborately beaded outfits with African,
Caribbean and Spanish themes as a way to demonstrate the diverse
background of the black residents of Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Although no rules ban krewe membership by race, officials from
both krewes said the organizations remained entirely black and
white. Tagg Catalon, president of the Lafayette Mardi Gras
Association, said the first black krewes formed 42 years ago, and
waited five years to be able to march the same parade route as the
white krewes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came together,'' Catalon said, ``but we held our
identities.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Allen Mouton, a former member of the Krewe of Gabriel and a
member of the Greater Southwest Mardi Gras Association, said that
black or white, a person needed money and ``social standing'' to
belong to a krewe. The king of the King's Parade must have the
money to sponsor a ball for more than 800 people the night of the
parade, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a way of life,'' Mouton said. ``Socially, you always
have your barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tradition of separate parades, tensions simmer
beneath the merriment.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Caillier, an organizer for the black parade, said the shared
seven-mile route was expensive for some groups. A krewe can easily
spend as much as $50,000 on beads, Caillier said, and still be
empty-handed by the end of the parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven miles is a long way, and it's just an expensive
operation,'' Caillier said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the black parade have struggled to raise money. This
year, they received $10,000 from the local government and $5,000
from the area's tourism bureau. Crewe leaders keep their costs
private.
</P>
<P>
   JeNelle Chargois, a local radio talk show host, said some black
marchers had not walked the final leg of the parade route in past
years because it ended at Cajun Field, the sports home of the
University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Chargois said some residents
felt slighted by a state commission's decision in 1984 to name the
university's sports complex after the local French Cajun culture
rather than the African and Creole populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a building in this city named after any Hispanic
or black,'' she said. ``It's not right; it's like you don't
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Small bands of outlaw revelers join the black parade as it
passes through the largely black north side of the city but drop
out as the parade enters white neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Mouton, an organizer for the white parade, also believes that
the parades should continue to run the same route primarily because
together they create a multimillion-dollar attraction for the city.
But he also believes that the parades must stay distinct, to
preserve the French Cajun heritage of the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to preserve your race,'' he said. ``You're white men
and you mix it with anything, it will never be white again. You
have to teach your children to stay with what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the city councilor, also believes that the parades can
flourish with their separate racial and cultural identities but
wonders what his son thinks when he sees the two parades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing I can do is explain the history,'' he said, and
hope that ``diversity is there to be celebrated.''

OUTFIELDER COMES FULL CIRCLE AFTER SEVERE INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ David Hulse could have, perhaps should
have, quit baseball a long time ago. Perhaps after the first
surgery on his shoulder. Or the second. Certainly the third.
Perhaps after the first surgery on his elbow. Or the second.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps in 1998, when the only job he could get was with
Nashua of the independent Atlantic League.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hulse stills plays baseball. The Rangers' 1993 rookie
of the year is back with the team, in camp trying to win a job as
an extra outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows you how wonderful this profession is that people
will do so much to stay in it,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
``You go through a lot pain and frustration and disappointment to
stay alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulse loves the game, to be sure. But that's not his only
purpose for being here instead of back home in Colleyville.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reason for being here is to be in the big leagues, but also
to prove that there is divine healing,'' Hulse said. ``I want to
prove to everyone that with God, all things are possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In strictly a baseball sense, it might take a miracle for Hulse
to make the team. He hasn't played in the majors since Sept. 7,
1996, with the Milwaukee Brewers, when he mangled his left shoulder
sliding into home against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have one outfield job open behind Rusty Greer, Ruben
Mateo, Gabe Kapler and Chad Curtis. Hulse, who flied out to left in
his only at-bat in a 13-6 victory against the Boston Red Sox
yesterday, is 0-for-4 this spring. He is currently behind Mike
Simms, Jason McDonald and Scarborough Green in the pecking order
for the fifth outfielder's spot.
</P>
<P>
   But in a spiritual sense, Hulse is convinced it's a miracle that
he's still playing baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my injury in '96, I saw four or five team doctors that
weren't giving me a chance,'' Hulse said. ``Then I went to see Dr.
\RJames\S Andrews, and he said I'm going to do all I can, but I
just want you to be able to throw with your son one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulse had carved out a decent career until that injury, using
his speed to make himself a useful player. He batted .290 and stole
29 bases in 114 games with the Rangers in '93, his first full
season in the majors. He hit .255 with 18 steals in the
strike-shortened '94 season and was traded to the Brewers in '95
</P>
<P>
   The next season, his career almost came to an end when he messed
up his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I tried to get up that something was wrong,'' he
said. ``I got this burning feeling like I was going to pass out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulse had severely dislocated his shoulder, and completely
crushed a nerve. The round of surgeries started, as did constant
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I either slept in the bathtub, because the water made it feel
better, or in a recliner,'' he said. ``I couldn't lay down. And I
was throwing up at night because of the medicine. It felt like it
was dislocating again every time I threw up. Not playing in all of
'97, and averaging a surgery every two months, the pain factor
alone was enough to make me want to hang it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulse persevered, though. He signed with Nashua in '98 and hit
.352 in 62 games. That led to a job with Pawtucket, the Boston Red
Sox' Triple-A club, where he hit .329 in 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   He landed a job in the St. Louis Cardinals' organization last
season and batted .335 in 74 games at Triple-A Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best I've hit my whole career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he doesn't throw as well as he used to, and he didn't
have a strong arm to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of making the team are long. Hulse, though, figures he
has beaten longer ones just to get this far.

LAMB SAYS HE'S IN GOOD SHAPE AT THIRD BASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Mike Lamb is not concerned that he might
be falling behind Tom Evans in the third-base battle. Lamb went
1-for-7 in the first three exhibition games, while Evans went
4-for-6 with three home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put too much emphasis on at-bats right now,'' Lamb
said. ``The timing's not there for anyone, except for Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb said he got off to poor start in the Arizona Fall League
last year, batting under .250 after the first couple of weeks. By
the end of the season, however, he was up to .343.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a slow starter,'' Lamb said. ``This is
nothing new to me. I'm sure by next week I'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb dropped to 1-for-8 after flying out to shallow left field
in his first at-bat yesterday, but then singled on a sharp liner to
right field. However, he also made an error on a slow one-hopper.
</P>
<P>
   Evans continued to swing a hot bat, lining an opposite-field
single to right and also drawing a walk.
Mateo keeps playing Players assured of regular playing time usually
get plenty of time off this early in the spring, but not center
fielder Ruben Mateo. He started his fourth consecutive exhibition
game yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo, though, is not complaining. Two stints on the disabled
list last year limited him to 122 at-bats in the majors, and he
only got 88 at-bats in winter ball because of a stomach ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play a lot in winter ball, so I need a lot of
at-bats,'' said Mateo, who went 0-for-3 yesterday and is batting
.182 this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates said he wants to get all the young players,
including right fielder Gabe Kapler and third basemen Mike Lamb and
Tom Evans, plenty of at-bats in exhibition games, as well as Mike
Simms, who was out almost all of last year because of a torn left
Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want the young hitters to learn,'' Oates said. ``They play
a lot in spring training. That's the way it is. When you've been
around for a while, you get to play your four innings and go to the
beach.''
Well-armed Gabe Kapler showed off his strong right arm in the third
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Speedy Red Sox shortstop Donnie Sadler was at first when Jose
Offerman singled to right. Sadler tried to go to third, but Kapler
threw a bullet to the base to get him by about 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   With Kapler in right and Ruben Mateo, who has one of the best
arms in baseball, in center, opposing teams might think twice about
taking the extra base this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both throw pretty good,'' Johnny Oates said. ``They've
got a chance to throw some people out. In the past against us,
runners just kept going.''
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Justin Thompson increased his throwing program from 25 pitches
to 35, still all fastballs at about 60 percent velocity. ``He
looked good,'' pitching coach Dick Bosman said. ``He looked crisp.
He put something on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Luis Alicea had a two-home-run game. First
baseman Rafael Palmeiro had his first of the spring, a two-run shot
off former Ranger Jeff Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Darren Oliver took some ribbing from his teammates for
being identified as ``Diaz'' during highlights on ESPN's
``SportsCenter'' on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   One day after being accused by Johnny Oates of being a
front-runner for jumping on the Cincinnati Reds' bandwagon,
basketball analyst Dick Vitale showed up in camp yesterday wearing
a Rangers cap. ``I shamed him into it,'' Oates said. / nn

NOT MANY PEOPLE CAN CALL HOGAN AN EX-CADDIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As a charter member of Colonial Country Club
and a lifelong golf lover, Marie Goodfellow could not think of a
more appropriate place than ``Hogan's Alley'' to celebrate her
100th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what she'll do Sunday during a birthday tea at
the club made famous by one of her former caddies. Goodfellow, who
turns 100 on Thursday, began playing golf in 1923 as a member of
Glen Garden Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   A competitive amateur golfer during that era, Goodfellow said
her game began improving after she turned to a teen-ager at Glen
Garden for some advice: a caddie named Ben Hogan, who went on to
win nine major championships and five Colonial titles during a
legendary PGA Tour career. Hogan died in 1997 at age 84.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben was a good caddie,'' she said. ``He always helped us. When
I started playing, I didn't know much. I'd shoot around 80. Ben
taught me how to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, another future Hall of Famer carried
Goodfellow's clubs. Byron Nelson also caddied at Glen Garden during
the 1920s. But Goodfellow said Nelson, now an 88-year-old Roanoke
resident, spent most of his time in the pro shop during the years
she was a course regular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Byron caddied for me once in a while, if my regular caddie was
off,'' she said. ``But he mostly ran the pro shop. He was selling
clubs and checking in players. Byron was an awfully fine fellow ...
very loyal. Both he and Ben really made something of themselves. It
makes me proud to say that I knew them. To this day, if Byron sees
me at Colonial \Rduring tournament week\S, he always makes it a
point to come and speak to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Goodfellow began playing golf, Colonial was not an option.
The course did not open until 1936. But she and her husband, Jack,
were among the first to pay the $50 initiation fee to join Marvin
Leonard's creation when Colonial opened its doors.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow members will be among Sunday's guests. So will former
co-workers from Cook Children's Hospital, where Goodfellow served
as a volunteer for 37 years.
</P>
<P>
   Her playing days are over, but Goodfellow remains connected to
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still her passion,'' said Mae Ryon, a cousin who is
organizing the birthday tea. ``She loves to talk about golf and she
watches it every Saturday and Sunday. It puts her age into
perspective when you think about the fact that Ben Hogan and Byron
Nelson caddied for her. Not many people can say that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A former senior engineer at TRW, a top military contractor, has
charged the company with faking tests and evaluations of a key
component for the proposed $27 billion antimissile system and then
firing her when she protested.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer, Dr. Nira Schwartz, was on the company's
antimissile team in 1995 and 1996 helping design computer programs
meant to enable interceptors to distinguish between incoming
warheads and decoys. In test after test, the interceptors failed,
she has alleged, but her superiors insisted that the weapon
performed adequately, refused her appeals to tell industrial
partners and federal patrons of its shortcomings, and then fired
her.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz has made her charges in interviews and in newly
unsealed documents filed with a federal district court in Los
Angeles, where nearly four years ago she sued TRW. She seeks to
recover for the government more than a half-billion dollars, some
fraction of which a judge could award her as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and court filings, TRW has vigorously denied
Schwartz's charges. But citing the pending litigation, it has
refused to address many details of her accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, the investigations surrounding her claims are
shedding light on a contentious and secretive program. The Clinton
administration has said it will decide this summer whether to
proceed with a modest antimissile system meant to defend against
warheads from so-called rogue states, at an estimated cost of $27
billion. Russia and other countries have warned that such a
decision could undermine a treaty limiting antimissile defenses
that has served as a pillar of arms control.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the Pentagon rejected the TRW interceptor as the leading
antimissile candidate in favor of a rival design by Raytheon.
However, it is still a backup and could win the lead role since the
Raytheon design has stumbled in recent flights.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's charges have split the Defense Department. Some top
officials defend TRW as innocent, and the Justice Department has so
far declined to join her lawsuit. But a three-year inquiry by the
Pentagon's Defense Criminal Investigative Service, which ended last
August with no action, cited in its final report ``numerous
technical discrepancies'' that ``appear to warrant further
review.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, former TRW employees back Schwartz. In an affidavit
filed in connection with her suit, Roy Danchick, a retired senior
engineer at TRW, said he had firsthand knowledge of TRW's
``impermissibly manipulating'' a study of the antimissile
technology and ``censoring the test data'' so it appeared more
successful than it actually was.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's allegations center on TRW's certifying to the
government that interceptors using its computer programs would
succeed more than 95 percent of the time in picking out enemy
warheads, even if they were hidden in a confusing blur of decoys in
space. In fact, Schwartz said in court documents, the interceptors
could do so only 5 to 15 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Her charges are coming to light now because many secret court
filings have been unsealed at her request and she is seeking public
support for her case.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, 53, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Israel, has a
Ph.D. in engineering from Tel Aviv University and holds 18 U.S.
patents, including ones involving computerized image analysis and
pattern recognition.
</P>
<P>
   TRW hired her to help develop computerized algorithms that are
meant to enable an interceptor to differentiate between real and
fake warheads by matching memories of threatening images against a
rush of incoming sensor data.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said in an interview that in time she had concluded
that all the current discrimination technologies were too feeble to
work and that at some level the Pentagon and its contractors were
in collusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a defense of the United States,'' she said, her eyes
flashing. ``It's a conspiracy to allow them to milk the government.
They are creating for themselves a job for life.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, Schwartz was hired as a senior
engineer by TRW on Sept. 5, 1995, joining the company's space group
in Redondo Beach, Calif. TRW was allied with Rockwell (later bought
by Boeing amid defense consolidations) in a competition to build a
``kill vehicle,'' which would zoom into space atop rockets and
smash enemy warheads to pieces by force of impact.
</P>
<P>
   The work for which Schwartz was hired, enabling the kill vehicle
to spot enemy targets, represented the soul of the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is almost uniquely qualified to strengthen the interplay''
among TRW specialists pursuing image analysis and object
recognition, her boss wrote personnel officials after she was
hired.

 NIEUWENDYK'S RETURN AWAITED (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) By JENNIFER FLOYD c.2000 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When center Joe Nieuwendyk's return from a
separated right shoulder came up yesterday, Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock was cautious in his selection of a date.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely not tomorrow, maybe Friday and more likely Sunday.
But Hitchcock is rarely cautious, which probably says as much about
the importance of Nieuwendyk's return as anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to be effective, we have to have a second line, which
he's always been responsible for, that can score, that is a threat
to score every shift,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars haven't had that since Jan. 19, when Nieuwendyk went
down against Anaheim. He said he was sitting there driving himself
crazy as he watched the Stars' 5-3 loss to Detroit. He's ready to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not naive either,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``I know what is
ahead. I know there is going to be some high-emotion times down the
road. I can't get too worked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will be on Nieuwendyk's line?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, on the right wing will be \RJamie\S Langenbrunner
or \RBrett\S Hull,'' Hitchcock said. ``The left side is still a
gray area.''
</P>
<P>
   The choices are more plentiful than before Nieuwendyk got
injured. There's Brenden Morrow, Kirk Muller, Aaron Gavey, Scott
Thornton and Jere Lehtinen, when he returns from his ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know since I've been here they've kind of played musical
wingers, and now I think you have two really solid guys up there,''
Nieuwendyk said. Nieuwendyk played with Morrow before he got hurt.
Now, the rookie has been playing on the top line with Mike Modano.
</P>
<P>
   So have Nieuwendyk and Modano been bartering about who gets to
play with him?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, Nieuwendyk says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the consolation prize? Lehtinen,'' Nieuwendyk said.
``That's a nice luxury to have.''
Carbonneau update
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ken Hitchcock said the Stars wouldn't know the extent of
center Guy Carbonneau's right wrist injury until they get results
from his magnetic-resonance-imaging examination this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll kind of know then the kind of situation we have to deal
with,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau exited midway through Sunday's loss to Detroit. He
didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   If Carbonneau isn't able to play against Vancouver tomorrow,
Kirk Muller will take Carbonneau's spot on the checking line,
Hitchcock said. The line already was missing winger Blake Sloan,
who has been out since Feb. 21 with a hairline fracture of his left
fibula. Hitchcock said he expects Sloan to begin skating sometime
this week.
About last week
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock still had trouble evaluating the Stars' past week,
in which they went 2-1-1 against Colorado, Philadelphia, Phoenix
and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think looking at the week I'd say that we're right there
with all of the top teams,'' Hitchcock said. ``But we aren't any
better than any of those teams. ... I think it just shows you there
is a lot of teams in this battle right now, a lot of teams that
obviously think the same way we do, that they've got as good of
teams as we do or better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars didn't lose any of their seven-point lead in the
Pacific Division with Sunday's loss because Phoenix lost, too. And
the Stars are set to get back Joe Nieuwendyk, Jere Lehtinen and
Blake Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, we have to be pleased where we are at right
now considering the number of injuries this year,'' Nieuwendyk
said. ``If we go on all of our cylinders, we'll be a tough team to
beat. I think our game is pretty solid all the way through right
now.'' / nn

 UNDATED: was hired.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among her jobs was to help assess a kill-vehicle program called
the Kalman Feature Extractor. From incoming sensor data, the
extractor was to find critical characteristics of scanned objects,
teasing out familiar ``signatures'' that could separate decoys from
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   TRW executives believed the extractor offered a competitive edge
over the rival industrial team (then Hughes, later bought by
Raytheon), and they told the government it was a potential
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar with the extractor from previous research, including
that for her patents of 1983 and 1989, Schartz proceeded to test it
against nearly 200 types of enemy decoys and warheads in computer
simulations, using secret intelligence data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment I analyzed the signatures,'' she said in an
interview, ``I saw there was a problem.'' Most of the time, she
said, the kill vehicle's extractor program failed to distinguish
between warheads and decoys because their identifying signatures
differed wildly depending on variables like spin, attitude,
temperature, wobble, deployment angle and time of day and year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every RV there was a decoy'' that produced an identical
signature, Schwartz said, referring to a warhead as a re-entry
vehicle, or RV.
</P>
<P>
   The variations she used in the tests, she added, were not
arbitrary but spelled out in the Pentagon's antimissile bible, the
1993 ``Technical Requirements Document.''
</P>
<P>
   The results were roughly the same, Schwartz said, with the math
tool failing about 90 percent of the time, when she tested TRW's
less sophisticated method for separating wheat from chaff, known as
the baseline algorithm.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and court documents, Schwartz said she told her
boss and colleagues of her discoveries. ``They said not to worry,''
she recalled. Flight tests of mock objects, she said she was told,
would always be arranged so discrimination would be relatively
easy.
</P>
<P>
   When she pressed her superiors to tell industrial partners and
the military of the shortcomings, especially of the extractor, the
purported star of the show, they refused, according to court
documents. Days later, in late February 1996, she was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you will not notify the U.S. Government,'' she warned TRW
in a furious letter after the firing, ``then I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Hughes, her former boss, expressed no regrets. In
company documents, he told colleagues that Schwartz had been
completely off target, quick with her diatribes yet misreading her
own tests and TRW's process of product development. The extractor
was not finished but evolving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stating that there is a `defect' that we should immediately
report to the customer makes no sense,'' Hughes told his boss in a
March 1, 1996, letter. ``We continually improve and verify system
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes added that the extractor ``appears to perform properly
under all conditions that have been specified to us'' by the
government and fails only when flight environments are ``highly
improbable'' and ``appear not to be within our requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz contacted federal investigators, and on April 29, 1996,
filed in federal district court in Los Angeles a lawsuit under the
false claims act that sought to recover damages for the government.
The suit was kept under seal. It alleged that TRW had ``knowingly
and falsely certified'' discrimination technology that was
``incapable of performing its intended purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   By June, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service had opened
an inquiry out of its field office in Mission Viejo, Calif. The
investigative service, an arm of the Pentagon's inspector general,
is a federal law enforcement agency that can make arrests and
subpoena documents.
</P>
<P>
   The lead investigator, Samuel W. Reed Jr., interviewed Schwartz,
military experts, TRW officials and a network of informers. The
Justice Department monitored the case. Under the law, it could
choose to join Schwartz's lawsuit, which would raise her chances of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a $100 million test was nearing; it would help
determine whether Schwartz's charges were plausible. For the first
time, a kill vehicle under development in the program would be shot
into space to see if it could discriminate between a warhead and
decoys.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the long work on the extractor and the high hopes for
it, TRW decided to abandon it for the test and rely on the backup,
the baseline algorithm. TRW told the military that the extractor
was simply too big for the kill vehicle's computer, but court
documents suggest that by then it was widely regarded as a failure.
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, 1997, the mock enemy missile _ containing the
cone-shaped target warhead, six balloons and three decoy warheads _
was launched from California and sped southwest. Twenty minutes
later, the interceptor was fired from an atoll in the central
Pacific, its computer brain ready to try to discern the target
warhead. The test was to be a simple flyby, with no effort at
interception.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon hailed the test publicly as an outstanding success,
but privately, analysts were dismayed. Even with all the coaching,
the computer brain of the kill vehicle had selected a decoy
balloon, Schwartz and other experts said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, TRW found good news, as Danchick, the former senior
TRW engineer, later told Pentagon investigators, when data beamed
back from the kill vehicle was later reworked. In a postflight
analysis meant to mimic the real thing, TRW managers interrupted
the analysis to select a more favorable stream of data for the
baseline algorithm to digest, Danchick told the investigators.
Then, finally, the program zeroed in on the warhead _ a point
hammered home in a vivid company graphic.

NIEUWENDYK'S RETURN AWAITED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When center Joe Nieuwendyk's return from a
separated right shoulder came up yesterday, Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock was cautious in his selection of a date.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely not tomorrow, maybe Friday and more likely Sunday.
But Hitchcock is rarely cautious, which probably says as much about
the importance of Nieuwendyk's return as anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to be effective, we have to have a second line, which
he's always been responsible for, that can score, that is a threat
to score every shift,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars haven't had that since Jan. 19, when Nieuwendyk went
down against Anaheim. He said he was sitting there driving himself
crazy as he watched the Stars' 5-3 loss to Detroit. He's ready to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not naive either,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``I know what is
ahead. I know there is going to be some high-emotion times down the
road. I can't get too worked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will be on Nieuwendyk's line?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, on the right wing will be \RJamie\S Langenbrunner
or \RBrett\S Hull,'' Hitchcock said. ``The left side is still a
gray area.''
</P>
<P>
   The choices are more plentiful than before Nieuwendyk got
injured. There's Brenden Morrow, Kirk Muller, Aaron Gavey, Scott
Thornton and Jere Lehtinen, when he returns from his ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know since I've been here they've kind of played musical
wingers, and now I think you have two really solid guys up there,''
Nieuwendyk said. Nieuwendyk played with Morrow before he got hurt.
Now, the rookie has been playing on the top line with Mike Modano.
</P>
<P>
   So have Nieuwendyk and Modano been bartering about who gets to
play with him?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, Nieuwendyk says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the consolation prize? Lehtinen,'' Nieuwendyk said.
``That's a nice luxury to have.''
Carbonneau update
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ken Hitchcock said the Stars wouldn't know the extent of
center Guy Carbonneau's right wrist injury until they get results
from his magnetic-resonance-imaging examination this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll kind of know then the kind of situation we have to deal
with,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau exited midway through Sunday's loss to Detroit. He
didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   If Carbonneau isn't able to play against Vancouver tomorrow,
Kirk Muller will take Carbonneau's spot on the checking line,
Hitchcock said. The line already was missing winger Blake Sloan,
who has been out since Feb. 21 with a hairline fracture of his left
fibula. Hitchcock said he expects Sloan to begin skating sometime
this week.
About last week
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock still had trouble evaluating the Stars' past week,
in which they went 2-1-1 against Colorado, Philadelphia, Phoenix
and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think looking at the week I'd say that we're right there
with all of the top teams,'' Hitchcock said. ``But we aren't any
better than any of those teams. ... I think it just shows you there
is a lot of teams in this battle right now, a lot of teams that
obviously think the same way we do, that they've got as good of
teams as we do or better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars didn't lose any of their seven-point lead in the
Pacific Division with Sunday's loss because Phoenix lost, too. And
the Stars are set to get back Joe Nieuwendyk, Jere Lehtinen and
Blake Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, we have to be pleased where we are at right
now considering the number of injuries this year,'' Nieuwendyk
said. ``If we go on all of our cylinders, we'll be a tough team to
beat. I think our game is pretty solid all the way through right
now.'' / nn

<P>
   This was what Danchick later called in the affidavit TRW's
``impermissibly manipulating'' test results. Officials at TRW and
in the government will not say if the government back then learned
of these acts, though the company in a recent statement said it
``categorically denies that it misrepresented or improperly
manipulated any flight test data.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, eed, the Pentagon investigator, became convinced
that the matter warranted close scrutiny, as he detailed in more
than a dozen reports and letters later filed in the court case. He
also noted that TRW was the antimissile program's overall system
engineer, with responsibilities to ``analyze and validate results''
of all flight tests, and thus had a potential conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Reed's talks with military officials had produced
a scientific analysis of Schwartz's charges. Nichols Research of
Huntsville, Ala., a regular adviser to the antimissile program,
found in December 1997 that TRW's discrimination work was ``no
Nobel Prize winner'' but met contract requirements. It added that
TRW had failed to answer many questions.
</P>
<P>
   Reed then asked Pentagon officials for a deeper study, which was
done in 1998 and delivered late that year. The five scientists for
the study were drawn from a high-level antimissile advisory board
with Pentagon ties dating back to the Reagan ``Star Wars'' era.
</P>
<P>
   The new study team found the baseline algorithm ``basically
sound'' but questioned some of its purported strengths. For
instance, it showed that small changes in planned sensor data
greatly lowered the odds of selecting the right target.
Importantly, it blessed TRW's manipulating some data from the first
flight test, saying a computer program was being developed that, if
perfected, would do the same in space automatically.
</P>
<P>
   As for the abandoned extractor, TRW's onetime star, the new team
said dismissively that its ``application to discrimination may be
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Though equivocal, that study was enough for the Justice
Department. Three years after Schwartz's initial charge, it
finally, in March 1999, declined to join her false-claims
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   But it hardly ended the story. In a memorandum dated March 15,
Reed asserted that the Army had falsely reported to the Justice
Department that he was against federal intervention. ``This
statement has no factual basis,'' he seethed.
</P>
<P>
   Reed formally closed his investigation of TRW on Aug. 31, 1999,
citing numerous ``irregularities'' and ``discrepancies.'' Shortly
thereafter, colleagues said, he retired from the Pentagon's police
force.
</P>
<P>
   A federal official unconnected to the Pentagon but familiar with
the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, faulted the
military's two scientific studies of Schwartz's charges as biased.
``They don't go biting the hand that feeds them,'' he said of the
antimissile advisory groups.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the studies had enough of the appearance of
impartiality to dissuade the Justice Department from entering her
case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Schwartz has added to her antimissile criticism. Her
investigations had shown that the Pentagon planned to use up to
nine decoys in interception flight tests. But when it actually
performed the tests last October and this January, each flight had
but one decoy balloon. In an interview, she attributed this
simplification to the military's belated discovery of fraud and how
hard the job actually was.
</P>
<P>
   TRW, though spared a federal assault by the Justice Department's
decision, fared poorly in the investigations. In May 1998, its
industrial team lost a bid to become the antimissile system's
``lead system integrator,'' a post worth $1.6 billion over three
years. Simultaneously, the company also lost its system engineer
status. In December 1998, its team lost the competition to built
the kill vehicle. The prize was won by Raytheon, a relative
newcomer to the field that developed its own discrimination
software and is now struggling with problems uncovered in recent
flight tests.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Pentagon hailed the Raytheon test as an
unqualified success. But it later acknowledged that the kill
vehicle had initially drifted off course and picked out a decoy
balloon rather than the warhead.
</P>
<P>
   In a January test, the interceptor missed the target altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz lives with her husband, an aerospace engineer, in a
two-bedroom townhouse in a gated community in Torrence, Calif., and
runs computers for a plastics company. After representing herself
in her case against TRW for years, Dr. Schwartz recently retained
David W. Affeld, a Los Angeles lawyer with a bachelor's degree in
physics. She has filed a wrongful termination action against TRW.
And she still, despite the ups and downs, wants the government to
join her false-claims suit.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Englander, director of system engineering for the
Pentagon's antimissile program, echoing TRW, said the two studies
had discredited Schwartz. Any problems with the company's
discrimination work, he added, were a normal part of the
engineering design process.
</P>
<P>
   He also defended his program against her wider criticisms,
saying flight tests were never rigged and results never doctored.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction on interception tests from numerous decoys to just
one, Englander said, was because the government had cut the
program's goal from trying to knock out advanced warheads from
countries like Russia and China to more primitive ones from rogue
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another objective,'' he added, ``is to walk before we run.
When you start, you don't go to the most stressing environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is sharply divided on such issues. Last month in a
public report, Philip E. Coyle III, the Defense Department's
director of testing and evaluation, faulted the antimissile tests
as insufficiently realistic ``to support acquisition decisions.''

ANALYSIS QUESTIONS NEED FOR SUPERJUMBO JET ANYTIME SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Airbus executives insist they will go ahead with development of
their A3XX superjumbo by the end of this year, but a new
independent market analysis questions the need for such a behemoth
jetliner anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial plane the size of the doubledecker, 550-seat
A3XX-100 will eventually be needed by airlines, but not until 2009,
according to the forecast by the Teal Group, a market research firm
in Fairfax, Va., whose reports are closely watched by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The A3XX is utterly irrelevant in today's market
environment,'' said Richard Aboulafia, the Teal Group's aviation
analyst and author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than launching the A3XX this year, Airbus should wait
until 2004 or 2005, which would push back the jet's service entry
until 2009, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to take a much more realistic view of the timing of
a launch,'' he said of Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   If the A3XX is launched by the end of this year, Airbus has said
the first deliveries to customers would begin in 2005. But there
will not be a market for the A3XX by then, Aboulafia said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of deregulation and more ``open skies'' agreements
between nations, airlines today have more flexibility to haul
passengers directly from one city to another, bypassing the big
airport hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Known as point-to-point service, this fragmentation of routes
has resulted in airlines wanting smaller jets to provide passengers
with more frequency of travel.
</P>
<P>
   David Venz, chief spokesman for Airbus in the United States,
said Airbus is well aware of the trend toward route fragmentation.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also high-density hub routes _ such as Hong Kong
to London _ where bigger planes are needed, Venz said. And as
passenger volume at hub airports continues to increase, so will the
demand for bigger planes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an either or situation,'' he said of the hub vs.
fragmentation debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Teal Group report sees the market differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very simply, here and now, route fragmentation and airline
right-sizing are clear realities,'' Aboulafia wrote in his report.
``Denying these trends looks silly.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways is an example of an airline that is trying to
``right-size'' its fleet. The carrier announced last year it will
replace its 747s with 777s that carry fewer passengers but will
make the airline more money. And British Airways is also replacing
its Boeing 757s with the new 100-seat Airbus A318 now in
development.
</P>
<P>
   The move to the small A318 will allow the airline to focus on
better-paying customers on shorter routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airlines today want to concentrate on high-value passengers,''
Aboulafia said in an interview. ``They are trying to get the
backpackers off their planes. A lot of airlines will be doing
this.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend that spells doom for the A3XX should it be launched
now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are few issues in the industry that have generated more
debate than the A3XX.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Airbus must develop the A3XX if it expects to be
Boeing's commercial airplane equal. Without competition from the
A3XX, Boeing will continue to enjoy its 30-year monopoly with the
747, the only plane today that can carry more than 400 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is watching what Airbus does with great interest. It
plans to build a stretch version of its 420-passenger 747-400 that
would carry as many as 100 more passengers and be much more
efficient to operate.
</P>
<P>
   A derivative jumbo jet would cost far less to develop than an
entirely new plane, and, Boeing believes, effectively counter the
threat from an Airbus superjumbo.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have said they will develop their ``growth''
jumbo regardless of what Airbus does, but they also acknowledge
there has been little interest from customers so far.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus and Boeing have extensively examined and re-examined the
market for big airplanes and reached much different conclusions.
Boeing's latest market forecast puts demand for a superjumbo at
only 360 planes over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus, though, has forecast that market at about 1,500
aircraft, including about 300 freighters.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, top Airbus executives have said they see
no reason why the Airbus supervisory board will not give the go
ahead for development of the A3XX by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the first time Airbus has said it would launch
the A3XX, Aboulafia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a huge file on this,'' he said. ``I can show you
similar statements from previous years. If they go ahead, I can't
think of more than one or two airlines that would be at all
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus consortium has said it needs 30 to 40 total orders
from three to five carriers before going ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In December, however, the Airbus supervisory board put off until
later in 2000 giving the green light to start trying to sell the
plane to customers. The board said it was still working to confirm
financing for the development costs. Those development costs,
according to Airbus, are expected to around $12 billion, a figure
that many analysts believe is several billion dollars too low.
Airbus reportedly has spent about $600 million so far on A3XX
design work.
</P>
<P>
   But in his report, Aboulafia said Airbus has also kept money in
reserve for a possible launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus has already inflicted a few wounds on itself by
constantly keeping money in reserve for the A3XX,'' he wrote. ``The
A318, A340-500/600, and other projects should have gone ahead
before they actually did. And unless Airbus resigns itself to
waiting for a 2004/2005 launch date for the A3XX, other projects,
such as the A330-100, will remain starved for cash while waiting
for the big one.''
</P>
<P>
   The A340-500/600, now is development, are ultra-long-range
planes for Asian airlines. Boeing late last month announced it
would develop two long-range derivatives of its 777 that will
compete against the A340-500/600.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus has not yet launched the A330-100. It would replace older
A300s and A310s and would help Airbus tap into what is seen as an
emerging market _ for new medium-range jets that seat about 250
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which is looking at possibly shrinking its 777 should
this market develop, has benefited from the Airbus ``fixation'' on
the A3XX, Aboulafia said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The A3XX has yet to attract customers, but it has occupied
Airbus' attention and a lot of its money for the last four or five
years,'' he said. ``I can't think of anything better for Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the A3XX will eventually be needed, and that will hurt
Boeing long term, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens, the good old days for the 747 may be over,
though by no means done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors points toward success of the A3XX by 2009, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the thick routes are fragmenting today, requiring
smaller planes, they will eventually thicken and things will be as
flexible as they can get,'' he said. ``And then the equipment will
start getting bigger again because of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition he said, right-sizing will have run its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines will have gotten rid of as many cheapskate
backpacking passengers as they can and will see growth again with
bigger planes.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, airlines by 2009 will be retiring their older 747-400s.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will have to move fast with its new stretch 747 once the
A3XX is launched, Aboulafia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing should wait for now, but be ready to hit the ground
running,'' he said. ``They should be ready to go from a standing
start. Boeing needs to get out there and say they can be just as
good for a whole lost less.''
</P>
<P>
   The 550-seat A3XX-100 is projected to cost about $208 million; a
stretch version that could carry 650 passengers would cost upwards
of $240 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 747-400 goes for around $165 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Boeing,'' Aboulafia said, ``I'd have a fairly witty
ad campaign to make the A3XX look truly unaffordable. I'd be
flippant about it: `For the price of an A3XX we will be sell you a
growth 747 and throw in for free a new 757.''

MARKETPLACE: ENGAGED TO U S WEST, QWEST FALLS FOR DEUTSCHE
TELEKOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Budgeted earlier as QWEST-USWEST) 
(mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Qwest Communications International Inc. had not agreed to
acquire U S West Inc., Qwest probably would have announced a deal
to be acquired by Deutsche Telekom of Germany by now, and at a
healthy premium to Qwest's stock market value.
</P>
<P>
   For Qwest's top executives, that has to hurt. Not only have they
failed so far to grasp a highly lucrative opportunity with the
German company, but more important, the hurdles standing in their
way are strictly of their own making.
</P>
<P>
   It would almost surely take at least a week, but Denver-based
Qwest, the fast-growing long-distance communications carrier, could
still end up striking a deal with Deutsche Telekom. Such a deal
would allow Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest's chairman, to walk away with
hundreds of millions of dollars and Philip P. Anschutz, the
reclusive tycoon who is Qwest's largest shareholder, to expand his
bankroll by billions.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not be easy, and other high-technology companies
whose stock valuations are growing as fast as their dreams will be
left with a lesson in how taking a proverbial bird in the hand can
make it difficult to go after a greater prize later.
</P>
<P>
   For a week or more, executives at Qwest tried to figure out how
they could sell their company to Deutsche Telekom, Europe's biggest
communications carrier, while minimizing any entanglement from U S
West, one of the regional Bell phone companies. That is why they
did not even tell U S West's chairman that they were speaking with
the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here they were, locked into this merger with U S West, so the
Qwest people, those at the top anyway, thought they could make a
lot more money selling out alone, rather than go through the
still-cumbersome merger process with U S West,'' said Steven
Lehman, manager of the Federated Utility Fund in Pittsburgh, which
owns more than $50 million of Qwest and U S West shares.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday night, Qwest gave up that hope. It had become
clear that U S West would not go away quietly. Much more important,
it became clear that U S West would have at least a decent case
that it would be owed billions of dollars in damages, perhaps from
Deutsche Telekom, were Qwest to repudiate U S West in favor of a
deal with the German company. So Qwest announced that any agreement
would have to include offers for both Qwest and U S West.
</P>
<P>
   There is hardly any chance that Deutsche Telekom would be
interested in acquiring U S West on its own. In fact, some analysts
said Monday that institutional investors in Europe were expressing
doubts about the sense of the German company's acquiring U S West
at all. So now Deutsche Telekom must decide whether acquiring U S
West, with all of the regulatory difficulties that is sure to
entail, is worth the price of admission to acquiring Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it is worth asking why or how Qwest ended up in a
deal with U S West that now carries such significant baggage.
</P>
<P>
   It smacks of Monday-morning quarterbacking to point out that the
deep strategic rationale underlying Qwest's bid for U S West was
not crystal clear when it was announced last summer. But it is
true. The conventional wisdom at the time was that the deal was
more about Qwest using its high-flying stock to go after an
undervalued company with concrete assets and customers that had
already put itself on the block_ by agreeing to be acquired by
Global Crossing Ltd. of Bermuda _ rather than about far-reaching
strategic synergies.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the U S West deal stood up on its own merits and
there was little way for Qwest's senior management to know just how
it would constrain them in the future. And most relevant, there was
little way for them to foresee the explosive increase in value of
shares in European communications companies, which allowed Deutsche
Telekom to consider acquiring a company of Qwest's market value,
about $45 billion. Still ensnared in the imploding Global One
venture last summer, Deutsche Telekom may not have even been on
Qwest's radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight does Qwest wish that it didn't have the U S West
issue to deal with? Yeah,'' said Eric Strumingher, a
telecommunications analyst for Paine Webber. ``But it's pretty easy
to second-guess the decision today, now that Deutsche Telekom's
stock has more than doubled. At the time it looked like a great
decision and personally, if I were Joe Nacchio and Phil Anschutz, I
would have done that deal again.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Anschutz in particular is faced with that deal's
consequences. Deutsche Telekom may have already been spooked by the
circus that Nacchio started last week when he publicly suggested
that Qwest was exploring ways out of the U S West deal. If not,
Anschutz now needs to figure out just what it will take to get U S
West on board with a German offer.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there could still be a way for Qwest to extricate
itself from U S West, if Anschutz wants to strike a solo deal with
Deutsche Telekom badly enough. After all, everything has its price.
But any check that would persuade U S West to walk away would have
to bear 10 or even 11 digits.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Georgia voters go to the polls today, they'll
have plenty of company.
</P>
<P>
   Super Tuesday presidential primaries and caucuses in 16 states
and one U.S. territory could virtually decide the nominees in this
year's Democratic and Republican presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia's Republican primary, the main battle is between
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain, with
conservative radio commentator Alan Keyes also vying for Republican
votes.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore faces former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore held sizable leads over their opponents heading
into today's Georgia's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia elections officials expect about 38 percent of the
state's 3.4 million registered voters to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Polls across the state are open from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much harder to predict'' this year, said Chris Riggall a
spokesman for the secretary of state's office. ``The candidates
haven't been here. We've not seen any TV (advertising). We aren't
in the game as we have been in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But a handful of local ballot questions will be decided today
that could help energize voters. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cherokee County _ Continuing a 1 percent sales tax to fund
parks and green space, a new jail and improvements to the old one,
a new animal shelter, three new fire stations, libraries, road and
bridge improvements, and projects in the county's cities. The
special sales tax could bring in up to $125 million over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Newton County _ A proposed five-year sales tax that is
expected to generate $40 million to $42 million. The money would be
used for expanding the jail, enlarging the county's landfill,
renovating the courthouse and constructing a building for the
county's mental health and physical health departments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Henry County _ A 10-year, $32.7 million bond issue that would
pay for school construction, including a proposed $25 million high
school, probably in the Luella community. The rest of the funds
would pay for renovations and additions at several elementary
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Roswell _ A $34.04 million bond issue to pay for parks in the
city, with the remainder allocated for a combined fire and police
station, firefighting equipment, and sidewalk and drainage
improvements.

REPUBLICAN AMBASSADORS FOR BUSH BLANKET OHIO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ This is what it means for Gov. George W. Bush
to have the state's entire Republican organization behind him in
Ohio, the third-largest state with a primary on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   For the last three days, Gov. Bob Taft has been barnstorming for
Bush, flying back and forth, in a private plane rented by the
party, to Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, Toledo and Columbus,
campaigning with all the intensity he would devote to one of his
own races.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George V. Voinovich was on the stump this weekend for Bush
too. So were three prominent congressmen _ Rob Portman, John R.
Kasich and John A. Boehner _ as well as Lt. Gov. Maureen O'Connor,
Attorney General Betty Montgomery and dozens of other elected
officials and party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Ohio campaign manager, Robert Paduchik, on leave from his
regular job as Taft's political director, said on Monday that the
Bush campaign had made 100,000 telephone calls, dropped 250,000
pieces of literature and planted 15,000 yard signs across the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Indications are that all this work is paying off. The
organization is especially important because Bush himself has
campaigned in Ohio for only one day this year, and 69 delegates are
at stake here on Tuesday, third only to California's 162 and New
York's 101.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll released on Monday by the University of Cincinnati's
Institute for Policy Research showed Bush ahead of Sen. John
McCain, 61 percent to 36 percent. The survey, which was conducted
Wednesday through Sunday and involved 407 probable voters in the
Republican primary, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9
percentage points. A poll taken earlier last week for The Cleveland
Plain Dealer by Zogby International of Utica, N.Y., showed Bush
ahead by a similar margin.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, whose own organization in Ohio consists basically of
a loose-knit band of volunteers, has hardly given up in a state
that could be critical to his survival in his race for the
presidency. He drew large and enthusiastic crowds to rallies on
Sunday in a high school gymnasium outside of Cleveland and at an
airport hangar in Wilmington in southwestern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, the only Ohio politician of any note who is
backing McCain, said in an interview on Monday that he had his own
pollster, the Tarrance Group of Alexandria, Va., test the
presidential race in this state last week, and it found Bush ahead
by only 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine said he had spent the weekend knocking on doors in
blue-collar neighborhoods in Northeastern Ohio and had found
considerable support for McCain among independents and conservative
Democrats who, under the rules here, are free to vote in the
Republican primary. DeWine said he figured these voters had been
undercounted by the pollsters showing a large Bush lead.
</P>
<P>
   Similar rules allowing crossover voting led to a surprising
victory by McCain in the Michigan primary two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have been advertising heavily. The Akron Beacon
Journal reported on Sunday that Bush was spending about $800,000
and McCain about $650,000 on television commercials in Ohio,
amounts comparable to what is spent here in competitive races for
governor or the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps have steered clear of negative advertisements. Bush's
commercials mostly promote his record as governor of Texas.
McCain's emphasize his conservative credentials as senator of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   John Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied
Politics at the University of Akron, said he believed that Bush was
ahead but not by anything like the comfortable margin reported on
Monday in the Cincinnati poll.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Taft and the other Bush supporters here, Green said,
``I suspect they're not 25 points ahead in their own polls, or they
wouldn't be working so hard.''

   MOUNT KUMGANG, North Korea _ A few miles north of the
demilitarized zone that has divided the Korean peninsula for nearly
half a century, the largest corporation from the enemy south has
spent hundreds of millions of dollars to install deep-water docks,
build a domed theater and a spa with a glass atrium, pave roads and
string electric cables. It has plans for a 1,000-room seaside
hotel, a 45-hole golf course and a ski slope.
</P>
<P>
   And it has done all this with the approval of North Korea's
reclusive communist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Many years could pass for Hyundai Group to even begin to recoup
its bet on the future of tourism at the base of Mount Kumgang,
where stern-faced soldiers in olive-drab uniforms keep constant
vigil and the only practical mode of transportation is by foot. A
gasoline station, built by Hyundai to accommodate tourist vehicles,
seems oddly premature.
</P>
<P>
   But the investment by Hyundai, which could reach $1 billion or
more, is more than just a bet on tourism _ something the North only
recently sanctified as part of a gradual thawing of relations. It
is the biggest business risk taken so far on the notion that North
and South _ nominally still at war _ will peacefully reunite.
</P>
<P>
   Jang Whan-bin, director of investor relations for Hyundai's Asan
subsidiary, is a positive thinker. ``We believe the mutual trust
that we establish in becoming business partners with North Korea
will not only help improve relations between the two countries but
also lead to lucrative business opportunities in the long term,''
said Jang, whose company oversees the parent's operation in the
North.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the North and South are eventually integrated,'' Jang
added, ``we believe Koreans will remember that Hyundai helped play
a role in reunification, and that memory has broad applications for
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai is now the sole operator of sightseeing tours for South
Koreans, who arrive on its cruise ships at the port of Changjon,
where the company built docking installations. The cruise ships,
which Hyundai has been operating since November 1998, depart from
South Korean ports.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai's effort to develop Mount Kumgang, one of the most
spectacular landscapes on the Korean peninsula, has been welcomed
by South Korean and Western corporate executives. Many of them have
been trying to figure out for years how to develop commercial
relations with the repressive leadership of a country weakened by
prolonged isolation and painful food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyundai has become a de facto ambassador to North Korea, and
everyone is watching with bated breath to see what they can
achieve,'' said James Rooney, chief executive of Templeton
Investments in Seoul, the South Korean capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 50 years of military threats from North Korea, if
Hyundai can be a catalyst for peace, help reunite separated
families, and put rice on the tables of starving people, South
Koreans view that as far more important than investors earning an
extra buck a share,'' Rooney said. Templeton has no investments in
Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many business leaders said economic integration would
help stabilize North Korea and enable it to better feed its more
than 20 million people, who will one day offer a lucrative market
opportunity, just as South Korea did a generation or two ago.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that Hyundai is wise to invest so
heavily in a country where the risks far outweigh the potential
payoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire what Hyundai is doing in North Korea,'' said a Seoul
fund manager whose portfolio has substantial Hyundai stock, ``but
the bottom line is that these projects are highly risky and offer
little hope for significant financial return. Our money would be
better spent on another investment, but so far none of our clients
are complaining, because it's difficult to publicly criticize what
Hyundai is trying to do,'' said the fund manager, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the subject is politically
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai has been the most aggressive company in pursuing the
so-called sunshine policy of South Korea's president, Kim Dae-jung:
actively engaging North Korea as a way of hastening reunification
on the peninsula. Kim lifted restrictions on travel and trade with
the North to encourage liberalization there.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind Hyundai's expansion into North Korea
has been its billionaire founder, Chung Ju-yung, the son of a poor
farmer in Tonchon, in Kangwon province in North Korea. Chung has
made numerous visits to the North and is said to have met with the
country's leader, Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Mount Kumgang tours, Hyundai has announced
plans to build an industrial complex to make consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of on-again, off-again negotiations, North Korea
gave Hyundai permission to begin the tours in November 1998. Under
an agreement, Hyundai estimates that it will pay North Korea a
total of $942 million in royalties to operate the tours through
2005, when the deal is to be renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   The royalty figure is based on a formula under which Hyundai
pays North Korea a fee of $100 a day for each tourist. Since 1998,
about 150,000 people have taken the tour. Hyundai estimates that
over the length of the contract, an average of 500,000 people a
year will visit the mountain region for at least three days.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the royalty fees, Hyundai has spent $110 million
to build tour facilities in North Korea, including the spa,
performance theater and docks, and the company plans to spend $250
million on future attractions like the hotel, golf course and ski
resort. The agreement with North Korea gives Hyundai exclusive
rights to develop tourism in Mount Kumgang for the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said that if the mountain tours attracted
500,000 visitors a year, Hyundai would cover its operating and
royalty costs. The least expensive tour package is about $800,
which includes passage, meals and lodging on a cruise ship and
guided hiking tours to the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The tours were initially restricted to South Koreans. But the
North's government has agreed to open the tours to non-Koreans.
Hyundai is betting that many will jump at the chance to visit one
of the world's last remaining Stalinist countries. And Mount
Kumgang _ with its stunning peaks, waterfalls, gorges and temples _
is known by many Asians for its beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, which colonized Korea during the first half of the 20th
century, is a major target market for the the Mount Kumgang tours.
Hyundai is now negotiating with North Korea to allow the entry of
Japanese citizens on ships departing from Japanese ports.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview aboard the Hyundai cruise ship Pongnae,
Kim Yun-ku, president of Hyundai's Asan subsidiary, said that an
important part of making the venture profitable would be getting
tourists to spend money once they arrive in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists, mainly from South Korea, now spend $12 to visit the
spa, $25 to see the North Korean circus perform in the theater, and
$20 to $30 on souvenirs. Aside from climbing, there is little to do
in the Mount Kumgang area, and the visitors spend their evenings on
the cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said that the golf course and other planned attractions
would increase the appeal of Mount Kumgang and generate more profit
for Hyundai. He said Hyundai was seeking to attract foreign
investment in the project, including retailers and fast-food
restaurants that would establish outlets in a major shopping center
that the company hopes to build on a wharf.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much commercial potential here that Hyundai can't
possibly do it all alone,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion between North and South remains an important
underlying risk, and the tours have not been without problems.
Officials in Seoul suspended the tours for several weeks last year,
after North Korea detained a South Korean housewife whom it accused
of trying to persuade a northern guide to defect.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hyundai officials said that negotiating with North
Korea is extremely difficult because the country has been isolated
for so long that officials there are unaccustomed to modern
business practices. But Hyundai added that the North Koreans are a
very quick study, and that the negotiation process had improved.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists are worried that Hyundai's ambitious
plans to develop Mount Kumgang could damage the natural setting,
which they say is virtually free of contamination because it has
been isolated for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   Southern environmental groups have called for an independent
study to determine what effect the development and increasing
number of tourists would have on Mount Kumgang, a revered place for
many Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In consultation with our business partner, we have taken every
step possible to ensure that the Mount Kumgang environment will not
be polluted by our tours,'' Jang of Hyundai Asan said. ``The North
Koreans are very serious about protecting this national treasure.
Their rules are so strict that we have to purify the waste water
from the spa.''

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China's renewed threat of war against Taiwan
has caused anxiety in the West, but Beijing's military options for
attacking the island remain limited and impractical, a fact often
overlooked in the furor in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Though China's army outnumbers Taiwan's six to one, the country
lacks a transport fleet large enough to ferry a major invasion
force across the narrow Taiwan Strait. And even if it could muster
the ships, China does not have the means to secure control of the
sea or air separating it from the island to carry out such a
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way at this moment that Beijing has the weapons in
its arsenal in sufficient numbers to undertake and sustain a major,
full-scale assault on Taiwan,'' says Jonathan Pollack, a China
specialist at Rand Corp. in California.
</P>
<P>
   China does have nuclear weapons, but using them against avowed
compatriots in Taiwan is highly unlikely. Most Western military
experts say it will be years, if not decades, before the mainland
mounts a credible threat.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's vow to use force, made in a policy paper last month
and repeated in an editorial in a military newspaper on Monday, is
meant to warn Taiwan away from formal independence and push it
toward serious negotiations on reunification with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing still regards Taiwan as its territory, occupied by the
nationalist authorities who fled there during China's civil war in
the 1940s. But forcing the island to the table is a delicate game;
were Taiwan to survive a misguided mainland military campaign, it
would probably declare independence and win widespread diplomatic
support abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing does have alternatives to an invasion, though none of
them seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   The option that experts in Taiwan and the West take most
seriously, because it is the one most available to China today,
would be a short, Kosovo-like missile campaign intended to
devastate Taiwan's economy _ either by direct strikes on sites in
Taiwan or by disrupting shipping lanes. China has hundreds of
short-range ballistic missiles pointed at the island.
</P>
<P>
   Supplemented with information warfare _ using computer viruses
and electromagnetic pulses to knock out Taiwan's communications and
transportation infrastructure, for instance _ and perhaps sabotage
by Beijing's agents on the island, incoming missiles could
demoralize Taiwan's people and undermine support for Taipei from
the island's business elite. Many in that group have investments on
both sides of the strait and might prefer political compromise to
economic ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it didn't work, Beijing may not be greatly harmed by great
loss of forces, as may be the case with other options,'' said Eric
McVadon, a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and a former defense
attache in Beijing. He says this is the option he worries about
most.
</P>
<P>
   But the domestic risks if such a strategy failed would be dire.
McVadon adds that such a dramatically belligerent act could isolate
China diplomatically and halt most exports to the United States and
other major markets.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment might dry up, as it did in the year after
Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen
Square in 1989. China's economic engine, still dependent on export
revenue and foreign investment inflows to keep its people employed,
would probably sputter and slow to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   China's economy is already at low ebb and so in some ways is
more fragile than in 1989. The country has spent billions of
dollars to prop up slowing economic growth in the last two years
and cannot afford to do this indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in China's industrial northeast is especially high
_ 30 percent in some regions _ and the economic shock that would
follow military action against Taiwan would worsen conditions for
many already disgruntled people. If an action against Taiwan
failed, Beijing could face a groundswell of domestic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A defeat would mean the end of the regime,'' says a Hong
Kong-based economist who asked not to be identified. ``The risk to
the party is far more than just more economic stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a brutal approach, meanwhile, would cast China as an
international pariah and reverse decades of diplomatic confidence
building. Beijing is still stinging from the international
condemnation that followed the killings of protesters near
Tiananmen Square. The trade concessions it has offered so that it
can join the World Trade Organization are, in part, an attempt to
erase that legacy. The deal is contingent upon Congress ending its
annual review of China's trade status, an exercise put in place
after the Tiananmen crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   And China would not win much of a prize if it did cripple
Taiwan's economy. It would jeopardize a major source of investment
_ Taiwan has invested more than $30 billion in the mainland _ and
would destroy what little good will it has on the island.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, China is years from being able to actually ``take''
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Any large-scale attempt to cross the strait would be obvious for
weeks ahead of time as China massed men and equipment on its
shores. And once at sea, such a force would be sitting ducks for
Taiwan's air force or even two submarines positioned at either end
of the strait.
</P>
<P>
   China's chief problem is air cover: It has far more planes than
Taiwan, but most are out-of-date blowflies compared with Taiwan's
jets. The 72 SU-27 fighters that China has bought from Russia could
outmaneuver Taiwan's aging F-5s, but probably not the island's 150
F-16s, 60 French Mirage 2000s or air defense batteries, which
include advanced Patriot missiles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Equally daunting are the numerous ground and airborne radar
systems that the United States has supplied to Taiwan to coordinate
air and sea assaults.
</P>
<P>
   China lacks the technology in its offensive forces to cope with
those defenses, military experts say, though it is trying to
acquire such technology from Russia and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   China does have air-defense missiles, but they lack the range
and ability to effectively clear the strait's skies long enough to
permit safe movement of an invasion force.
</P>
<P>
   The best China could hope for would be to disable Taiwan's air
force by pounding its airfields and communications centers with
short-range ballistic missiles and then land enough men to take an
airport or another strategic installation, giving them a base to
build on.
</P>
<P>
   But the chances that such an isolated invasion force could
survive would be slim, while the chances that those soldiers would
end up as prisoners and bargaining chips for Taipei is high enough
to argue against this course of action.
</P>
<P>
   China could seize one or two of Taiwan's outlying islands;
Jinmen and Matsu lie just a few miles off the mainland's coast. But
those islands are heavily fortified with thousands of Taiwanese
troops, and so the cost of taking them would likely be high and the
gain slim.
</P>
<P>
   Or Beijing could attempt a naval blockade, hoping to bring
Taiwan to heel.
</P>
<P>
   China's navy has enough ships to enforce a quarantine. And the
island's economy is almost entirely dependent on trade, including
imported oil. Taipei might buckle to domestic pressure and
negotiate terms of reunification if its factories stopped running.
</P>
<P>
   But coordinating such an action is far more complex than
anything China's navy has attempted before. And blockades are
easier to circumvent than to sustain.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Taiwan might decide to fight rather than negotiate if
backed into a corner, something that could prove disastrous for
Beijing because it is outgunned both at sea and in the air.
</P>
<P>
   For now, China's most likely military action will be more war
games and other training exercises in the coastal provinces facing
Taiwan. China has mounted such maneuvers many times before, most
recently in September. The size and threatening nature of those
exercises could increase, but they are likely to remain games for
now.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, China's is working to remedy its relative impotence
by upgrading its arsenal. It is improving the accuracy and number
of short-range ballistic missiles aimed at the island and is
developing a land-attack cruise missile with accurate ``terminal
homing'' _ in other words, a ``smart'' bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has agreed to supply China kits for 200 more SU-27 jet
fighters, and Beijing reportedly will soon buy even more advanced
SU-30s. And Israel is expected to supply China with an airborne
warning and control system mounted atop Russian IL-76 jets that
could be used for battle management.
</P>
<P>
   But the new weapon systems will not necessarily shift the
balance of power in China's favor anytime soon. Taiwan will also
continue to improve its arsenal and operational skills. And it will
take years before China's military is proficient enough to use the
high-tech weapons effectively in a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troops equipped with weapons produced by various countries are
virtually incapable of integrating them in modern, high-tech
warfare,'' said Wang Weixin, a senior researcher at China's
Military Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, quoted this week in China's armed forces mouthpiece,
Liberation Daily, was talking about Taiwan's troops, but the
judgment applies equally to those of his own country.

 &HT;    Presidential contests today could settle nominations
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Today the cold hand of certainty is scheduled to reach
down and take hold of a race that up to now has had its share of
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Until today's primaries and caucuses, spanning a swath of the
globe from Maine to American Samoa, the twists and turns of the
campaign have been recorded in those imprecise measurements known
as bounce and spin.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday morning, the race to the nomination will be
measured in delegates, and for each of the five contestants left in
the running for the Democratic and Republican nominations, the
campaign will have taken a fateful turn.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate with the least to lose is the one who cares least
about how many delegates he wins: Alan Keyes, the stem-winding
conservative orator making his second run for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With tenacity, and respectable showings in Iowa and New
Hampshire, Keyes has won a spot on the podium for the final
Republican debates. He can continue a low-budget campaign whether
he wins delegates today or not.
</P>
<P>
   For Keyes, the question may be how long he can expect the kind
of exposure he has had up to now, with the race for the Republican
nomination headed toward a speedy conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   After riding so high, the candidate with the most to lose is
Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   With losses last week in Virginia, North Dakota and Washington
state, McCain now trails Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the delegate
race by 208 to 104. With 613 of the 1,034 delegates needed to win
the nomination up for grabs, the former Navy pilot has to pull off
a tough combination to keep his insurgency campaign afloat.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is expected to run strongest in the five New England
states voting today. If he could sweep those states, win in New
York where polls show the Republicans in a very close race, capture
a respectable number of delegates in Ohio and top Tuesday's
``beauty contest'' in California, McCain would have bounced back
handsomely after last week's defeats.
</P>
<P>
   That still cedes Bush the delegate race in California as well as
other delegate-rich states such as Georgia and Maryland. But if
McCain shows good results in the three biggest states, he would at
least force Republicans to take another long look at Bush's
viability as a national candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Skipping to the Democrats, the candidate who has already lost
the most is former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain has to pull off a long shot to stay in the Republican
race, Bradley needs huge upsets all across the electoral map to
climb back into the Democratic competition with Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley began his campaign in better shape financially than
McCain, with whom he has been compared so often. But his narrow
loss in New Hampshire and the media's gallop to cover McCain's
livelier campaign left him in poor position to compete for the
bounty of Democratic delegates in play today.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's best hope may be that a respectable showing today
gives him a way to make a graceful exit.
</P>
<P>
   But for Bush and Gore _ who, it's presumed, can't really lose
today _ a lot is still at stake.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush wins Georgia, Ohio and the California delegates, he
moves to a virtual lock on the nomination, especially with his home
state of Texas and Florida, where his brother Jeb is governor,
among the states voting the next week.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Democratic race nearing an end, every day the
Republican race goes on costs Bush. He'd like to wrap it up
decisively with solid victories in every region of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Already on Monday, Bush was talking about reuniting the
fractured party after the tense competition with McCain. Bush has
repeatedly insisted he was spending so much money because he's
running a national campaign. He wants a national victory today to
spring him into the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Very soon _ maybe Wednesday _ Gore has to begin an effort to win
over independents, who have been cool to him.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Bush wants the GOP primaries decided by true-blue
Republicans, Gore would have no problem with a 100 percent
Democratic electorate at the polls today.
</P>
<P>
   With his nomination nearly secure, Gore also will be looking at
the results today with an eye to the general election. He wants a
good turnout of union members and African-American voters as a dry
run for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Another big primary looms next week, but the front-runners in
both parties hope by then they will have no contest.
</P>
<P>
   The challengers are hoping in the complex chemistry of this
cross-country primary day, there is some combination that can keep
their hopes alive.

FLYING WITH JETBLUE, THE NEW KID IN THE AIR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a promise of stylish economy and attentive service, JetBlue
has started flying out of Terminal 6 at Kennedy International
Airport to Fort Lauderdale and Buffalo, the first of 30 cities it
plans to serve within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Since airline deregulation in 1979, more than 40 new carriers
have come and, mostly, gone. In JetBlue's favor, it is backed by
the deep pockets of the financier George Soros, who is one of three
primary investors, and it is being led by a management team with
solid experience in the tricky business of scheduling, reservations
and quick turnarounds.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue flies new Airbus A320s, a single-aisle aircraft, and
offers one class of service. The airline was scheduled to take
delivery of its third plane last week. As a new one arrives, about
every five weeks for the next few years, a new destination will be
added, said Gareth Edmondson-Jones, the airline spokesman. Tampa
service is set to begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The strengths, and a few weaknesses, of the new carrier were
evident one recent morning on Flight 1 from Buffalo to JFK.
</P>
<P>
   At check-in an agent issued a paper boarding coupon, the first
sign of cost-cutting. The two-week advance fare is $49 each way;
$69 on Friday and Sunday. The walk-up fare is $99, compared to a
$245 walk-up fare on US Airways, which flies to Buffalo from La
Guardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 a.m. the only indication of JetBlue at Gate 10, which is
owned by United Airlines, was a small metal sign, slung over the
gate door. At 8:27, two minutes late, the plane pulled up, its blue
and white fuselage matching the cloudless sky and mantle of snow
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Just seven minutes later all 67 passengers were off, and the
gate agent called for families with small children to start
boarding, along with those in rows 20 through 27.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, when an elderly woman with a walker
appeared, so did the first sign that JetBlue may not be different
from other airlines. While one gate agent accompanied the woman to
her seat, the other stood at the gate desk, never making eye
contact with the tightening semicircle of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   When a passenger came rushing down the concourse and pushed
through the crowd, this gate agent let him board, as well as two
more passengers who followed moments later, without acknowledging
those waiting their turn.
</P>
<P>
   On board, the cabin crew worked every moment. When one man's
struggle to close a packed bin held up the boarding, the lead
flight attendant, in a friendly voice, called out: ``Sir, if you
will just leave that for now I'll get it. That way we won't hold up
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The overhead bins, while large, are not deep enough to allow
roll-aboard luggage to slide in wheels down. Future aircraft will
have deeper bins.
</P>
<P>
   The last passenger stepped through the door at 8:53, but because
the passenger count came up one short at 121 the departure,
scheduled for 8:55, was delayed two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the JetBlue plane looked spacious and spare. The gray
leather seats are designed so that when the back is reclined the
bottom comfortably slides forward.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, a television set with direct feeds from
satellites should be on the back of each seat. A credit-card swipe
to turn on the TV will cost $5, a fee that may be waived on delayed
flights.
</P>
<P>
   The plane also features unusual bulkheads at the first row that
create a sense of spaciousness. One is only five feet high,
allowing passengers to catch a glimpse of the cabin crew in the
galley. On the A-B-C side (seating is six across), there is a
trapezoidal bulkhead window that allows passengers to see two
flight attendants in their jump seats.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers were served robust coffee, orange juice and a package
of color-coordinated blue food. The ``blueberry toast'' baked bread
chips contained 5 grams of fat.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane landed at JFK, two minutes late at 10:07, another
problem arose: getting out of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   By summer, Edmondson-Jones said, JetBlue plans to run a shuttle
bus to and from Jamaica Station so people can catch a train into
the city or out to Long Island. But on this morning there were so
few taxis that some people waited in line to get one for as long as
the flight took.
</P>
<P>
   And one passenger paid $40 with tip and toll, more than the fare
of $30.50, including tax, that JetBlue charged in a promotion in
February.

 &UR; HACKER  &LR; _ In the wake of last month's much-publicized hacker attack
against a slew of prominent Internet Web sites, customers of online
brokerage firms suddenly are feeling vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites temporarily disabled by the so-called
denial-of-service attack was the one maintained by Palo Alto-based
E-Trade Group. The site, at www.etrade.com, was swamped by phony
log-in calls, making it difficult or impossible for E-Trade's real
customers to gain access during a 90-minute period. So, what's a
brokerage customer to do? One preventative measure would be to open
more than one online brokerage account, so if one Web site is down
you can (hopefully) use the other. It also is a good idea to have
at least one account with an online broker that makes it easy for
you to trade securities offline as well _ by telephone, direct
modem hookup or even by visiting a branch. By Arthur M. Louis

 _ SF CHRON  
 Teachers Sue Over Payment Of Union Dues  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A group of eight teachers, including one from San Jose, filed suit
in federal court yesterday against the California Teachers
Association and more than 400 local school districts over
collection of compulsory union dues from their paychecks.
<P>
   The teachers are challenging a practice by which union locals,
in conjunction with school districts, deduct ``agency fees'' for
collective bargaining without first performing a legally mandated
audit of how the funds are used.
</P>
<P>
   They want their suit to receive class-action status so that it
applies to the nearly 15,000 nonunion teachers in the state who may
also object to the use of such fees for political activities.
</P>
<P>
   If a teacher objects to how such funds are used, he or she is
entitled to a refund of politics-related dues _ usually about $200,
or a third of the total amount collected by the union each year.
The audit determines the percentage that can be returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union is not entitled to the fees unless they do the
audit,'' said Stefan Gleason, vice president of the National Right
to Work Foundation, which is providing legal aid to the plaintiffs.
``They've come up with a dodge to avoid the audit.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers' associations in many school districts statewide rely
on a so-called local union presumption _ a presumption that an
audit of how they use funds would be the same as that of a sampling
of districts conducted by the statewide union.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the local associations say they can save time and
money by claiming the union's audit as their own and thus meet
legal requirements for collection of fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the law that allows a local union
presumption,'' insisted Milton Chappell, staff attorney for the
National Right to Work Foundation. ``Every court that has looked at
it has struck it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, a federal judge ruled that the union could not force
eight public-school teachers in Livermore, Fremont, Orinda,
Pleasant Hill, San Jose and Ukiah to pay dues without first
disclosing audited financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Charles Legge said all union locals are
obliged to hire an auditor so that nonunion teachers can see
exactly how their money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   However, Beverly Tucker, chief counsel for the California
Teachers Association, said Legge's ruling applied only to the eight
plaintiffs in that case _ a point that advocates for nonunion
teachers do not dispute.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to comment on yesterday's lawsuit without first
seeing the complaint, but stressed that ``there has been no court
decision that addresses local union presumption.''
</P>
<P>
   The Foundation's Chappell countered that while Legge could only
apply his ruling last year to the eight plaintiffs in that case, he
in fact ruled ``on what the law requires for all school
districts.''
</P>
<P>
   By returning to the issue on a class-action basis, Chappell said
he intends for the court to address local union presumption on a
broader scale, requiring all teachers' associations to perform
financial audits.
</P>
<P>
   The new lawsuit asks that the court declare collection of union
dues without an audit to be a violation of teachers' First
Amendment rights. It demands that such dues no longer be collected
without an audit and that past fees be returned.
</P>
<P>
   The lead plaintiff in the suit is Kim Sheffield, an eighth-grade
teacher at San Jose's Stonegate School. He said he agreed to have
his name on the complaint after being contacted by the Right to
Work Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield said he had objected in the past to the way that about
$680 in union dues were deducted from his paycheck. He said he had
to go through a time-consuming process of filling out firms to
receive a rebate of about $220 that represented the portion of his
dues applied to the union's political activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union is a political organization as far as I'm
concerned,'' Sheffield said. ``I want nothing to do with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he said that most of the union's political
expenditures ``go to Democrats or Democratic causes.'' Sheffield
described himself as a conservative.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is participating in the lawsuit because a sampling of
about a half-dozen locals conducted by the statewide union is not
representative of all school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every local is very different,'' Sheffield said. ``If they
don't do an audited statement, you have to take it at face value
that what they're telling you is true.''
</P>
<P>
   The union local representing about 7,000 San Francisco teachers
and teachers' aides is one of the few that does conduct its own
annual audit, said Kent Mitchell, president of the group.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not know how his group's audit compares with the
sampling done by the California Teachers Association because it
does not use the same methodology.

 &HT;    Fast chip appeals to high-end buyers
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Investors sent Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s
stock to a 52-week high Monday, following the chipmaker's
announcement that it is shipping Athlon microprocessors running at
1 gigahertz, or 1,000 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD's stock rose $6.50, or 15 percent,
in New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, to close at $48, based
on news of the fast, new Austin-designed-and-manufactured chip.
AMD's previous fastest chip ran at 850 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Intel Corp., of Santa Clara, Calif., is expected to make
its own announcement Wednesday that it has begun shipping 1
gigahertz versions of its Pentium III processor.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp. of Round Rock is expected to begin shipping
high-end Pentium III-based gigahertz systems toward the end of the
month. Dell, however, declined Monday to set a firm date,
cautioning that it won't begin offering a consumer desktop computer
until it has the necessary components.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that AMD has kept up easily with Intel's fastest chips
has impressed industry analysts, some of whom had written off AMD
as a strong competitor after a series of production mishaps in the
late 1990s kept the company consistently in the red.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMD's products look the best since I've followed this damned
company,'' said analyst David Wu of ABN AMRO in San Francisco.
``They have finally gotten their act together on manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Intense competition between AMD and Intel is influencing both
companies to make early announcements when they ship
high-performance chips, even if they can only produce limited
quantities. That's because each company wants desperately to be
considered the performance leader in Windows-compatible computing,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are shipping thousands of units rather than hundreds of
thousands of units,'' said Dean McCarron of Mercury Research, a
Scottsdale, Ariz., high-tech market research company.
</P>
<P>
   But as both companies steadily improve their manufacturing
processes, their shipment volumes should increase within a month or
two, McCarron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By mid-summer a gigahertz computer will be an ordinary system
that people will buy,'' McCarron said.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's gigahertz chips are pricey, costing $1,299. Compaq
Computer Corp. said it would begin taking orders for PCs using the
chip with a starting price of $2,499. Gateway Corp. said it has
already begun taking orders for Athlon-based gigahertz computers
with a starting price of $2,999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high prices, analysts said three groups of computer
users will snap up the fast new machines: technical workers,
including engineers who work with graphics-oriented design programs
that demand heavy computer horsepower; high-end computer gamers who
crave cutting-edge performance to give them an edge on the
competition; and ``prestige buyers'' who want to have the fastest
machines available on their desktops, whether or not they need the
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high end of the market, PC enthusiasts, is where most of
the interest will be,'' said Dell spokesman Andy Prince, who
declined to discuss expected prices for the company's 1-gigaherz
machines.

 Concern Over Cell Surfing  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Kevin Manley has no problem giving his name and address to Web
sites like Amazon.com when he needs to buy a book. But Manley, a
Seattle software developer, was stunned to discover recently that
his Sprint PCS cell telephone automatically transmits his phone
number to every Web site he visits using Sprint's new wireless data
service.
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' Manley said. ``If I'm just surfing the Web
without purchasing something, I expect to remain anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Manley isn't alone. It turns out that Sprint PCS, and possibly
some other wireless companies, routinely embed customers' phone
numbers in Web page requests, raising concerns about whether these
companies are doing enough to safeguard users' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to be automatically identified in
cyberspace, any more than they want to wear bar-coded name tags as
they walk down a city street,'' said Jason Catlett, president of
JunkBusters, an anti-marketing group.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates said they worried that Web sites could
potentially forward users' cell phone numbers to their sales
department for follow-up calls. Or dot-com companies could use
databases to match surfers' phone numbers with their name, address
and other personal information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just what we all need, more telemarketers calling us!'' said
Richard Smith, a Massachusetts programmer who first verified that
Manley's problem affects other Sprint PCS customers.
</P>
<P>
   Although relatively few customers now use cell phones to surf
the Web, the issue could become increasingly important as millions
of Americans take advantage of the technology in coming years.
Sprint just started its service in the United States in September
and other major carriers like Bell Atlantic and AirTouch
Communications have since followed suit. AT&AMP;T has been tinkering
with the technology for several years, though it's only recently
targeted the mass market.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprint PCS spokesman Tom Murphy downplayed the privacy
fears. He pointed out that users routinely hand personal
information to online retailers when they buy a book or plane
ticket. Those Web sites can then instantly recognize users when
they return by depositing a small file on users' hard drive called
a ``cookie.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sprint said it notifies customers that their phone
numbers will be sent to Web sites in its service agreement, posted
on its Web site. But Manley complained that the sentence is buried
in the nearly 6,000-word document. He said he only happened upon
the problem while trying to figure out how the cell phone worked,
using it to surf his own Web server and then analyzing Web page
requests.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible that other phone companies' customers are
affected by the privacy hole.
</P>
<P>
   That's because most of Sprint's rivals use the same
microbrowser, developed by Redwood City's Phone.com, which boils
down Web sites so they can be read through a cell phone's tiny
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way the software works, Phone.com requires
wireless companies to use a unique ID number for each user when
they request a Web page. For obvious reasons, the phone number is
the simplest to use.
</P>
<P>
   But Ben Linder, Phone.com's marketing vice president, said it
recommends phone companies alter the phone number in some way so
Web sites can't use the number to call or identify surfers. Indeed,
Bell Atlantic said it does just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did this intentionally to provide a privacy barrier for our
customers,'' said Bell Atlantic spokesman Jim Gerace. ``What you
sacrifice is a little bit of speed, but essentially the user
doesn't recognize that big a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch Communications said it drops customers' phone numbers
altogether, and simply passes along a random number to the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the privacy issues, AirTouch said there is
another reason to safeguard cell phone users' phone numbers. Like
many state-of-the-art pagers, cell phones with browsers are capable
of receiving instant text messages called alerts. But if someone
were able to obtain a list of cell phones with the feature, they
could potentially blanket them with unsolicited ads, similar to
junk e-mail and faxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``By giving out someone's phone number, you open up the door to
alert messages,'' said John Rizzo, an AirTouch software engineer.
Though Rizzo said he doesn't believe spammers have started hitting
cell phones yet, he said ``the potential is there.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T declined to say whether it automatically gives out
customers' phone numbers to the Web sites they browse. Spokesman
Ken Woo would only say that ``it's not an issue'' because the
company hasn't received any complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But Manley, the Seattle software developer, said customers
typically have no way to know when their phone numbers are
transmitted to Web sites. ``The reason nobody (else) complains is
because they don't realize their privacy is being violated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Manley said he will continue to use his Sprint phone to
surf the Web. ``It's an annoyance,'' he said, ``but the convenience
of being able to use the phone to browse is so much.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The leading Republican contenders crisscrossed the
biggest state Monday, with Gov. George W. Bush offering a set
speech on racial and religious tolerance and a quiet olive branch
to gay Republicans, and Sen. John McCain keeping up a stiff attack
on the campaign advertising tactics of Bush and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24-hours before coast-to-coast contests in 13 states,
including New York, Ohio, Georgia and most of New England, Bush and
McCain both spent a full day in California, whose winner-take-all
primary will account for 162 of the 613 Republican delegates at
stake on Tuesday, the biggest voting day of the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In rallies and speeches from Santa Clara to San Diego and from
Los Angeles to Long Beach, Bush sounded an upbeat appeal to
moderates, while McCain sought to stoke a backlash against Bush and
``his sleazy Texas buddies,'' over campaign ads attacking McCain on
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all its flaws, I believe our nation is chosen by God and
commissioned by history to be the model to the world of justice and
inclusion and diversity without division,'' Bush said in brief
remarks at the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Museum of Tolerance
here. ``These are American convictions. Defending them is America's
calling, and they must be passed intact to America's children.''
</P>
<P>
   In his latest apparent effort to address the firestorm of
criticism that grew out of his visit to Bob Jones University in
South Carolina, Bush added: ``A leader must do more than hold this
conviction. He must give it voice, and he must give it force.
That's my commitment to the people of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   A heckler twice interrupted Bush's speech by calling, ``What
about gay people?'' and Bush made no response. But in an interview
published in The San Francisco Chronicle on Monday, Bush softened
his previous opposition to a meeting with the Log Cabin
Republicans, a national gay group. Last fall, Bush said he would
probably not meet with the group because, ``I don't believe in
group thought, pitting one group of people against another, and all
that does is create kind of a huge political, you know, nightmare
for people.''
</P>
<P>
   After the group ran a weekend of radio advertisements attacking
Bush in New York, where he is in a close contest with McCain, the
Texas governor told The Chronicle, ``Yes, I would consider meeting
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain filed a formal complaint with the Federal
Elections Commission on Monday alleging improper campaign
contributions by two of Bush's biggest financial backers in Texas,
Charles and Sam Wyly, who spent $2.5 million for television
advertising in New York, Ohio and California, attacking McCain
under the name ``Republicans for Clean Air.'' Bush has said he had
no knowledge that the Wylys planned to run the ads, but the McCain
campaign took the position that as a major Bush fund-raiser,
Charles Wyly held an official position in the campaign and had
already contributed the maximum amount allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask Governor Bush to do what he refused to do,'' McCain
said at a student rally at Santa Clara University, a Jesuit school
south of San Francisco, ``tell his sleazy Texas buddies to stop
these negative ads and take their money back to Texas where it
belongs and don't try to corrupt American politics with your
money.'' He added: ``Let the people of California decide who will
be the next president of the United States not some billionaires
from Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain camp also filed an emergency complaint with the
Federal Communications Commission, which McCain oversees as
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, asserting that the ads
had violated the Communications Act by failing to properly identify
the true sponsor. But Monday evening, the commission declined to
intervene after its officials concluded that they could do little
more than notify the broadcasters that a potential violation had
been raised, and that television stations had an obligation to
assure that the sponsor of the ad was properly identified. The
agency made no judgment about what that identification should be.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who plans to spend election night here on Tuesday,
acknowledged that even if the ads were taken off the air, it would
be a Pyrrhic victory, since the election is Tuesday. ``We'll at
least feel better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush, wearing a Jewish skullcap, lit a memorial torch in
the garden of the Museum of Tolerance, his chief spokeswoman, Karen
Hughes, reacted bitingly to McCain's charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's irresponsible and it's shameful,'' Hughes said. ``He
should be ashamed. He has not one shred of evidence. The governor
has personally said our campaign did not coordinate, our campaign
knew nothing about the ad until a member of the media asked us
about the ad, and Senator McCain should be ashamed of tossing
around scurrilous accusations like that.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 FDA Approves Alza's Tiny Drug Dispenser  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Alza Corp., the company best known for developing the nicotine
patch, has won government approval to sell a matchstick-size pump
that would be implanted under the skin and deliver a year's worth
of prostate cancer medicine.
<P>
   Alza of said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval will let
it begin selling its time-release drug, Viadur, late this year or
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Viadur will be dispensed by a pump , &LR; implanted under the inner
arm. It will drip out a steady supply of a drug that suppresses the
production of testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors know testosterone fuels prostate cancer growth, and
currently  &LR; prescribe the drugs Leupron or Zoladex to inhibit its
production. Viadur will be a new entry into what financial analysts
fix as a U.S. market for testosterone inhibitors worth more than
$700 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Alza Vice President Sam Saks said current testosterone
inhibitors are given by injection. Each shot lasts last three or
four months, and a year's treatment costs $2,000 to $3,000. He said
Viadur would offer a convenient yearlong treatment. Alza has not
yet set a price.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analyst Sena P. Lund with Mehta Partner in New York
said Alza must now decide whether to sell Viadur itself, or partner
with a larger drug firm, giving up a share of the revenues for a
larger sales effort.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was unimpressed. Alza lost 19 cents yesterday to
close at $37.81. Lund said the company's stock has been depressed
for months, after its unsuccessful bid to merge with Abbott
Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   With the launch of Viadur, Alza will compete with Abbott, which
sells Leupron in a joint venture with the Japanese drug firm
Takeda. Astra Zeneca sells Zoladex.
</P>
<P>
   Alza's first challenge will be convincing patients and
physicians that a yearly dose of testosterone suppressor is worth
the main side effect, the almost complete loss of sexual drive and
erectile function.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Szabo, a urologist with Kaiser-Permanente in San
Francisco, said most patients on testosterone suppressors lose
their sex drive. He said older patients may not mind, but young men
find the loss so demoralizing that physicians are experimenting
with intermittent hormone control _ keeping the men on the drugs
for six to nine months, then giving them free spells, so sexual
drive can return.
</P>
<P>
   Alza's Saks noted that the intermittent therapy is still
experimental. He said even if doctors and patients move toward this
therapy, the pump can still be easily removed if need be.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Alza's development of the pump _ which it
called the Duros technology _ could be more significant than its
first use for prostate cancer. Saks said the company is testing
other potential drugs for delivery through the pump, which is made
of the nonreactive metal titanium.
</P>
<P>
   The Duros pump is 44 millimeters long and 4 four  &LR; millimeters in
diameter. Most of its volume will contain the drug. Bodily water
will flow into one end of the pump, swelling a tiny engine and
driving a piston that will push minute amounts of drug out the
other end.
</P>
<P>
   Alza says the pump will dispense 1/100th of a drop of drug per
day, in a continuous, almost infinitesimal flow.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to developing new uses for the pump itself, Alza has
licensed the Duros technology to a privately - &LR; held startup, Durect
Corp. of Cupertino, which will develop ways to use it to deliver
drugs to specific locations in the body.

LOS ANGELES: like that.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the rally at Santa Clara, and another here at the University
of California Los Angeles, McCain seemed to draw strength from his
enthusiastic student audiences. The senator, who often says he
wants Republicans, Democrats ``libertarians and vegetarians'' to
vote for him, delighted in one sign at Santa Clara proclaiming,
``Carnivores for McCain.'' His aides insisted they were picking up
momentum with the latest barrage on their opponent, and announced
that they had bought $200,000 in new television advertising in
Colorado, which votes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the consensus among both Republican and Democratic
professionals here Monday was that McCain had lost energy in the
last week, and now appeared to be trailing Bush not only among
Republican voters, who will select all of the state's delegates,
but among the overall electorate, too. In California's unusual
``blanket'' primary, the names of all candidates will appear on the
same ballot regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all sort of rushing to a fizzle,'' said Bill Carrick, a
leading Democratic consultant. ``The latest private polling is
certainly showing that unless we get some skewed turnout, or an
unusual number of Democrats decide to cross over, most of the
pollsters in both parties are predicting a 6 to 7 point edge for
Bush overall.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's latest appeals to tolerance seemed clearly aimed at
re-establishing the moderate, inclusive image with which he began
his campaign last year. Touring the Museum of Tolerance on Monday,
he signed ``God Bless This World,'' on the same page of the
Wiesenthal Center's guestbook that his father had signed in 1988,
when the museum was still only a scale-model. And earlier, at a
rally in San Diego, he said his struggle with McCain had been good
for him as a candidate, and had not deeply divided his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the fracture is much of a fracture,'' Bush, who
will await returns Tuesday in Austin, Texas, said. ``I really
don't. Our party is enthused and excited.'' He added: ``John
deserves credit for bringing people into the party and I deserve a
lot of credit for exciting the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, the Bush spokeswoman, insisted that the governor had
been reluctant to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans because some
of the group's national leaders had helped raise money for McCain.
But Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for the group, said that happened only
after Bush said in an interview in November that he would
``probably not'' meet with the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been hearing through a number of channels that the
governor had changed his mind concerning a meeting, and now for the
first time he has made his opinion public,'' Rich Tafel, the
group's executive director said in a statement Monday. ``There are
too many divisions in the Republican Party now. A meeting between
the governor and our national board would mark an important step in
healing our party's divisions.''
</P>
<P>
   After his appearance at the Wiesenthal Center, Bush went to
Burbank to appear as a guest on NBC's ``The Tonight Show with Jay
Leno.'' But unlike an appearance last week on CBS's ``Late Show
with David Letterman'', when in the judgment of most wits, the
governor bombed trying to match Letterman joke for joke, Bush made
no effort to go head to head with Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he gave relaxed, straightforward answers about such
things as his family and how he felt the campaign was going.

 _ SF CHRON  
 MONEYBAG/ARTHUR M. LOUIS  &HT;     Figuring Stock Costs Is Taxing Business 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: How can I determine the current cost basis per share of my stock
for tax purposes, taking into account mergers and splits, and sales
of fractional shares resulting from these actions?
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Let's take a simple example first.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you purchased 100 shares of America Online in 1996. The
stock has since undergone four 2-for-1 splits, so you now have
1,600 shares, assuming that you didn't buy or sell any after the
original purchase. Simply divide the cost per share of the original
shares by 16 and you have the current cost per share.
</P>
<P>
   You can trace any stock's history of splits on the Yahoo
Internet Web site. Go to http://finance.yahoo.com. Enter the ticker
symbol for your stock to the left of the ``Get Quotes'' prompt bar,
then choose ``Charts'' from the list to the right of the bar. Click
on the bar and you will find not only a chart, but also a list of
splits _ if there have been any.
</P>
<P>
   Things become more complicated when you are awarded fractional
shares.
</P>
<P>
   This can happen, for example, if you own an odd number of shares
_ say, 251 _ and your stock is split 3- &LR;  for- &LR;  2. You would be
entitled to receive 125.5 additional shares, but your company will
liquidate the half-share and send you cash instead.
</P>
<P>
   It also will enclose a letter explaining how to account for the
sale of the half-share for tax purposes, and how it will affect the
cost basis of your remaining shares. If you didn't save the letter,
call or write headquarters and direct your query to the
investor-relations department.
</P>
<P>
   A similar situation can arise in a merger.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company that buys yours might exchange 1.073332
shares of its common stock and $3.27 in cash for each share you
own. I'm picking those numbers out of thin air, but mergers often
seem to involve that sort of decimal-laden exchange. Here, too, you
will have to rely on the company for information about the tax
treatment of the fractional share (and the cash).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I need money for a down payment on a house. I can raise it by
selling stock, but someone suggested that I ought to borrow the
money from my broker on margin, using the stock as collateral. I
don't have any experience with margin accounts, but the idea
appeals to me, because I don't really want to sell the stock, a
solid networking company. And if I did sell it, I would have to pay
a substantial capital-gains tax. Are there any risks I should be
aware of in margin accounts?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: The biggest risk is that the stock price might plummet after you
borrow money against your shares. In that case, you could be hit
with a margin call _ a demand to deposit more cash or securities in
your brokerage account. If you can't meet the demand, your broker
would be authorized to sell part or all of your stock to get back
the money you borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, that your stock is worth $100,000, and you
borrow the limit against it _ 50 percent of your equity, or $50,000
_ as a down payment on the house.
</P>
<P>
   Margin rules vary from broker to broker, but at Charles Schwab,
to take a notable example, your margin maintenance rate would be
pegged at 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that if the value of the equity in your
account, minus the amount of your margin debt, falls to less than
35 percent of the value of the equity, you will have to add assets
to the account.
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, if the value of your $100,000 worth of stock
drops below $76,920, you will get a not-so-friendly call from your
broker. ($76,920 minus $50,000 equals $26,920, which is just under
35 percent of $76,920.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm a contract programmer, working for consulting firms at
client sites. I get straight hourly pay, no benefits, and my income
is reported to me at the end of each year on W-2 forms. I pay my
own premium for individual health coverage from Kaiser. Can I
deduct any part of this on my income tax form?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: If you are legally classed as an employee, rather than
self-employed, you can deduct your medical expenses _ including
health insurance _ to the extent that they exceed 7.5 percent of
your adjusted gross income, notes Internal Revenue Service
spokesman Jesse Weller.
</P>
<P>
   If you are self-employed, you can deduct 60 percent of your
health-insurance premiums directly, without regard to the 7.5
percent cutoff.

 SF CHRON  
 When Online Brokers Go Off  
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
In the wake of last month's much-publicized hacker attack against a
slew of prominent Internet Web sites, customers of online brokerage
firms suddenly are feeling vulnerable.
<P>
   Among the sites temporarily disabled by the so-called
denial-of-service attack was the one maintained by Palo Alto-based
E-Trade Group.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at www.etrade.com, was swamped by phony log-in calls,
making it difficult or impossible for E-Trade's real customers to
gain access during a 90-minute period.
</P>
<P>
   Active traders who wanted to use the site to buy or sell
securities found themselves sitting on their hands, hoping the
market wouldn't move against them.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade spokesman Patrick DiChiro says the company was able to
steer some customers _ who called to complain _ to an alternate Web
address so they could trade online. He insists that the number of
people inconvenienced by the hacker attack was ``very small.''
</P>
<P>
   While E-Trade and its customers were the victims that time, the
same sort of thing could happen any time to any online broker.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it doesn't necessarily take a hacker to shut down a
broker's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade, Charles Schwab and just about every other online broker
have been hit from time to time by server problems or other
technical difficulties that have made their sites inaccessible _
sometimes for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's a brokerage customer to do?
</P>
<P>
   One preventative measure would be to open more than one online
brokerage account, so if one Web site is down you can (hopefully)
use the other.
</P>
<P>
   It also is a good idea to have at least one account with an
online broker that makes it easy for you to trade securities
offline as well _ by telephone, direct modem hookup or even by
visiting a branch.
</P>
<P>
   John Payne, an analyst with Cerulli Associates, in Boston, says
that multiple accounts are becoming increasingly common among
online investors. There now are 2.4 accounts per online
account-holder _ up from 1.7 a year ago. ``Many people are hedging
their bets,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   However, that solution has practical limitations.
</P>
<P>
   If you open a second account, you will have to put funds or
securities in it before you can use it. Some brokers require you to
deposit thousands of dollars in cash or securities up front before
they will activate an account.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential limitation: Even if you have two accounts, it
may be that a stock you want to sell is in the wrong account _ the
one that can't be accessed, because of trouble on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you may want to buy a stock, but don't have enough cash on
deposit with the broker whose Web site is functioning.
</P>
<P>
   To get around this, you might divide your holdings down the
middle, putting half your cash and half your shares of each stock
into each of the two accounts. That way, each account will be
equally useful.
</P>
<P>
   But this can prove awkward _ and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you decide to dump all your shares in a
particular stock, you will have to place orders with two different
brokers, incurring two separate commissions.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to buy stock using all your available funds, again
you must place two orders.
</P>
<P>
   And that's assuming both Web sites are functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Stein, executive vice president of Gomez Advisors, a
Massachusetts firm that tracks the performance of online financial
institutions, points out that if you open a brokerage account that
allows you to sell stock short, then you won't have to bother
dividing your share holdings in half.
</P>
<P>
   Selling short is a technique normally practiced by sophisticated
speculators who think a security is about to decline in value.
</P>
<P>
   It involves borrowing stock through a broker, selling it,
collecting the proceeds, then buying the stock back after it has
tumbled. It then is returned to the rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
   But short-selling, Stein says, can be used as a nonspeculative
maneuver in a pinch _ when the shares you want to sell are held in
an account with an online broker whose Web site is inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you own 100 shares of XYZ Co., and they all are
deposited with Broker A, whose Web site is down, you can sell 100
shares short through another broker _ Broker B.
</P>
<P>
   You can later instruct Broker A to transfer the shares you own
to your account with Broker B. That will cover the short sale and
complete the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   There should be time enough to pull this off, because trades do
not have to be settled until three working days after they are
placed.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet trading is normally fast and convenient, you
should also have the means to trade offline as well. That means
holding an account with at least one broker that provides telephone
or direct-modem trading _ which circumvents the Internet _ or even
trading in person at branches.
</P>
<P>
   In the cyber age, it may be difficult to imagine people actually
walking into a branch to place orders.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of such prominent online brokers as E-Trade,
Ameritrade, DLJ Direct, Suretrade and Datek Online, it is not only
difficult to imagine, but impossible. None of them has any
branches.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Schwab, Fidelity, Quick &AMP; Reilly and
Waterhouse _ to name a few _ do have branches. Schwab has 345
nationwide _ approximately one for every 700,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, customers placed all their trades over the
telephone by speaking with real, live brokers.
</P>
<P>
   You still can do that with so-called multiple-access online
brokers such as Schwab and Fidelity Investments. Both started as
conventional brokers, and they still are staffed to handle
telephone transactions.
</P>
<P>
   However, Schwab spokesman Greg Gable concedes that his firm's
telephone lines tend to get impenetrably jammed when there is
trouble on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get through on the phones, Gable says, you can go
to the nearest Schwab branch and place your orders. If you do that,
the company will rebate up to $500 in commissions on the trades you
place there.
</P>
<P>
   Getting through on the telephone to many of the smaller online
brokers is theoretically possible. But don't hold your breath _
particularly during an Internet outage, when just about every
active trader will be calling in.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, of Gomez Advisors, thinks that online brokers that don't
provide their customers with viable telephone access could
eventually fall by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiple access will increasingly be a minimum standard of
service,'' he observes. ``Yes, every broker has a telephone, but
making people hang onto the phone for a long time is not adequate.
A firm that hasn't staffed for substantial telephone trading
doesn't have a true backup.''
</P>
<P>
   Some online brokers let you use the telephone to place trades
automatically, using the touch-tone keypad. Schwab's Telebroker
system and E-Trade's Telemaster are examples.
</P>
<P>
   Both these brokers normally charge more for such trades than for
trades placed over the Internet, but E-Trade will refund the
difference during an Internet crisis. Schwab will not.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade also lets you place trades through your computer via a
direct modem hookup, which bypasses the Internet. E-Trade's
customers have to request proprietary software that makes this
possible, and load it onto their computers.

GOSPER RESIGNS FROM IOC ETHICS COMMISSION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Australia, Utah)   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee moved to further investigate
Kevan Gosper, one of its most powerful members, in regard to the
Salt Lake City bidding scandal Monday. But a pronouncement by an
Olympic official that the committee believed Gosper to be innocent
of wrongdoing raised more questions about the IOC's credibility in
examining possible ethical lapses by its delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper, an Australian, resigned from the IOC's ethics commission
Monday. He stepped down as the commission decided to hire an
independent investigator to explore whether trips that Gosper and
his family made to Salt Lake City violated IOC guidelines on
excessive travel and hospitality during the bid process for the
2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the investigator was named, a member of the
ethics commission said he believed Gosper was not guilty. Javier
Perez de Cuellar, a former secretary-general of the United Nations,
told reporters in Lausanne, Switzerland, that he believed Gosper's
case should be thoroughly reviewed, but also said, ``We have a
feeling Gosper is totally innocent of the allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Such prejudgment calls into question the IOC's interest in
examining possible wrongdoing by its most influential members. It
is Perez de Cuellar, not the independent investigator, who will be
in charge of the Gosper case and who will ultimately issue a report
to the IOC ethics commission regarding the Gosper family trips to
Salt Lake City, an IOC spokesman said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has come under scathing criticism in its Salt Lake City
investigation for forcing out mostly members from developing
nations while giving only warnings to more powerful and popular
members such as Kim Un-yong of South Korea and Phil Coles of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper, 66, has often been mentioned as a possible successor to
Juan Antonio Samaranch as IOC president. This investigation may
have ended those hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC will not whitewash its investigation of Gosper, said
Franklin Servan-Schreiber, a spokesman for the international
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no conspiracy theory anymore,'' he said on a
conference call. ``It is very difficult for this to be quashed
without any repercussions. The world is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation concerns a trip that Gosper's family made to a
Utah ski resort in 1993 and Gosper's official IOC visit in 1995
before Salt Lake City was awarded the 2002 Winter Games. Bid
officials claimed expenses of $31,000 for the trips, but Gosper has
accused bidders of wildly inflating the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, the Canadian IOC delegate who investigated the Salt
Lake City scandal, has said that Gosper was entrapped. Salt Lake
City documents indicate that Gosper insisted on repaying the costs
for the 1993 trip, but no evidence has been made public indicating
that he did. Servan-Schreiber said he had been told that bank
documents existed showing repayment, but he did not say whether the
cost of all or part of the trip was reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   Gosper said he was resigning from the ethics panel to avoid the
appearance of a conflict of interest.

<P>
   This was what Danchick later called in the affidavit TRW's
``impermissibly manipulating'' test results. Officials at TRW and
in the government will not say if the government back then learned
of these acts, though the company in a recent statement said it
``categorically denies that it misrepresented or improperly
manipulated any flight test data.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, eed, the Pentagon investigator, became convinced
that the matter warranted close scrutiny, as he detailed in more
than a dozen reports and letters later filed in the court case. He
also noted that TRW was the antimissile program's overall system
engineer, with responsibilities to ``analyze and validate results''
of all flight tests, and thus had a potential conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Reed's talks with military officials had produced
a scientific analysis of Schwartz's charges. Nichols Research of
Huntsville, Ala., a regular adviser to the antimissile program,
found in December 1997 that TRW's discrimination work was ``no
Nobel Prize winner'' but met contract requirements. It added that
TRW had failed to answer many questions.
</P>
<P>
   Reed then asked Pentagon officials for a deeper study, which was
done in 1998 and delivered late that year. The five scientists for
the study were drawn from a high-level antimissile advisory board
with Pentagon ties dating back to the Reagan ``Star Wars'' era.
</P>
<P>
   The new study team found the baseline algorithm ``basically
sound'' but questioned some of its purported strengths. For
instance, it showed that small changes in planned sensor data
greatly lowered the odds of selecting the right target.
Importantly, it blessed TRW's manipulating some data from the first
flight test, saying a computer program was being developed that, if
perfected, would do the same in space automatically.
</P>
<P>
   As for the abandoned extractor, TRW's onetime star, the new team
said dismissively that its ``application to discrimination may be
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Though equivocal, that study was enough for the Justice
Department. Three years after Schwartz's initial charge, it
finally, in March 1999, declined to join her false-claims
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   But it hardly ended the story. In a memorandum dated March 15,
Reed asserted that the Army had falsely reported to the Justice
Department that he was against federal intervention. ``This
statement has no factual basis,'' he seethed.
</P>
<P>
   Reed formally closed his investigation of TRW on Aug. 31, 1999,
citing numerous ``irregularities'' and ``discrepancies.'' Shortly
thereafter, colleagues said, he retired from the Pentagon's police
force.
</P>
<P>
   A federal official unconnected to the Pentagon but familiar with
the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, faulted the
military's two scientific studies of Schwartz's charges as biased.
``They don't go biting the hand that feeds them,'' he said of the
antimissile advisory groups.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the studies had enough of the appearance of
impartiality to dissuade the Justice Department from entering her
case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Schwartz has added to her antimissile criticism. Her
investigations had shown that the Pentagon planned to use up to
nine decoys in interception flight tests. But when it actually
performed the tests last October and this January, each flight had
but one decoy balloon. In an interview, she attributed this
simplification to the military's belated discovery of fraud and how
hard the job actually was.
</P>
<P>
   TRW, though spared a federal assault by the Justice Department's
decision, fared poorly in the investigations. In May 1998, its
industrial team lost a bid to become the antimissile system's
``lead system integrator,'' a post worth $1.6 billion over three
years. Simultaneously, the company also lost its system engineer
status. In December 1998, its team lost the competition to built
the kill vehicle. The prize was won by Raytheon, a relative
newcomer to the field that developed its own discrimination
software and is now struggling with problems uncovered in recent
flight tests.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Pentagon hailed the Raytheon test as an
unqualified success. But it later acknowledged that the kill
vehicle had initially drifted off course and picked out a decoy
balloon rather than the warhead.
</P>
<P>
   In a January test, the interceptor missed the target altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz lives with her husband, an aerospace engineer, in a
two-bedroom townhouse in a gated community in Torrence, Calif., and
runs computers for a plastics company. After representing herself
in her case against TRW for years, Dr. Schwartz recently retained
David W. Affeld, a Los Angeles lawyer with a bachelor's degree in
physics. She has filed a wrongful termination action against TRW.
And she still, despite the ups and downs, wants the government to
join her false-claims suit.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Englander, director of system engineering for the
Pentagon's antimissile program, echoing TRW, said the two studies
had discredited Schwartz. Any problems with the company's
discrimination work, he added, were a normal part of the
engineering design process.
</P>
<P>
   He also defended his program against her wider criticisms,
saying flight tests were never rigged and results never doctored.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction on interception tests from numerous decoys to just
one, Englander said, was because the government had cut the
program's goal from trying to knock out advanced warheads from
countries like Russia and China to more primitive ones from rogue
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another objective,'' he added, ``is to walk before we run.
When you start, you don't go to the most stressing environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is sharply divided on such issues. Last month in a
public report, Philip E. Coyle III, the Defense Department's
director of testing and evaluation, faulted the antimissile tests
as insufficiently realistic ``to support acquisition decisions.''

 &HT;    Bush backer's ads criticized by McCain camp
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Arizona Sen. John McCain called him a ``sleazy
buddy'' of Texas Gov. George W. Bush's and environmentalists
expressed outrage at what they call his misleading message.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wyly, a longtime Bush family backer, bought his way into the
national political consciousness last week by laying out more than
$2.5 million to run TV ads in three key states _ New York,
California and Ohio _ that are holding presidential primaries
today.
</P>
<P>
   The ads attack McCain's environmental record, tout Bush's and at
the same time boost Wyly's own renewable energy company. The ads
also put Bush, the intended beneficiary, on the defensive: McCain
on Monday filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission,
claiming that the spots are tantamount to an illegal political
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell his sleazy Texas buddies to stop these negative ads ...
Don't try to corrupt American politics with your money,'' McCain
told supporters in California.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly, 65, and his brother Charles oversee a family fortune that
may be worth as much as $1 billion. They made their money in an
array of interests, including Sterling Software, Sterling Commerce,
Bonanza Steakhouses, Michael's craft stores, Maverick Capital and
Earth Resources, an oil and silver company.
</P>
<P>
   Maverick Capital received a lucrative contract in 1998 to invest
$96 million of the University of Texas' endowment funds. The
quasi-public University of Texas Investment Company has been under
fire for allegedly steering such contracts to Bush's top donors.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wyly's current passion is GreenMountain.com, a Vermont
company that offers consumers electricity produced from wind power
and other renewable energy sources. Wyly is chairman of the
company, and his family has invested more than $100 million in it.
</P>
<P>
   The Wylys also have long-standing political interests, and
they've been Bush backers since former President Bush was a
congressman in the 1960s. They donated $210,000 to the younger
Bush's 1994 and 1998 gubernatorial campaigns, trailing only Enron
Corporation and the Bass family, the Fort Worth billionaires, as
Bush's largest contributors in those races.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sam Wyly's involvement with GreenMountain.com and his
close ties to the governor that spurred Tom ``Smitty'' Smith of
Public Citizen to call him in the spring of 1999. Smith wanted the
bill deregulating the state's electric utility industry to include
a provision forcing utilities to reduce emissions from coal and
other fossil fuels _ a measure that would help producers of
renewable energy. But Bush favored a voluntary approach.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wyly spoke to him, that is. Wyly's entreaties, combined
with rumblings of federal sanctions if Texas didn't clean up,
convinced Bush to sign off on the mandatory measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked how he could help, and he made calls and visited the
governor,'' Smith recalled. ``He's certainly an environmentalist _
but he's also a very smart businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyly would like to promote similar legislation at the federal
level, and a second Bush in the White House would be a powerful
ally: Spending $2.5 million to advance that goal, and raise
consciousness about the issue, may be a prudent investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam's goal is to create a permanent organization within the
Republican Party to promote clean air issues, and especially to
oppose the use of coal-burning power,'' said Rob Allyn, who
produced the ads. Wyly did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's decided to spend the rest of his life promoting clean air
issues, and he's decided to put his money where his mouth is by
getting media to talk about clean air issues,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Allyn describes Wyly's effort as ``enlightened self-interest,''
readily acknowledging that federal legislation would benefit Green
Mountain. ``In the Republican Party, free enterprise is not a dirty
word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ads attack McCain for a Senate vote against renewable
energy, then praise Bush for cutting emissions from the
coal-burning electric power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Smith praises the ads for raising the issue of
pollution-generating coal-fired plants. But he and other
environmentalists also say that they include inaccurate statistics
and portray Bush as an environmentalist when his record says
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is no environmentalist _ and the increasingly
browner air in Texas is a clear demonstration of that,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say Texas air has gotten significantly dirtier
since Bush took office in 1995. They note that Houston recently
surpassed Los Angeles as the nation's smoggiest city.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bush eliminated a tough auto emissions inspection
program for Houston and Dallas. In 1999, he backed a voluntary,
rather than a mandatory approach, to cutting emissions from
nonpower producing industrial plants ``grandfathered'' from the
state's 1971 clean air law. McCain on Monday told reporters there
is no question that the ad is a coordinated effort with the Bush
campaign, which would make it illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all Bush people. If it has a longhorn, it walks like a
longhorn it moves like a longhorn, so it's a longhorn,'' he said.
``It's a Texas operation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes called the McCain
allegations ``irresponsible charges based on not one shred of
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain should be ashamed of himself. He is accusing us
of something that would be illegal based on not one shred of
evidence, and it simply is not true,'' she said.

TWO TOP CANADIAN EXECUTIVES QUIT TROUBLED COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The husband-and-wife team who founded and co-ran Cinar
Corp. resigned Monday after the discovery of more irregularities in
the financial affairs of the company, the leading Canadian producer
of children's filmed entertainment, including the popular
television series ``Arthur'' and ``The Busy World of Richard
Scarry.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the resignation of Micheline Charest as chairwoman
and co-chief executive and her husband, Ronald Weinberg, as
president and co-chief executive, the company said it had learned
that $122 million of its money had been invested without board
approval. The company said $86 million of that money had been
pledged to secure other investments.
</P>
<P>
   Charest and Weinberg, who created Cinar 24 years ago and
together control 56 percent of its votes, will remain directors and
``retain leadership roles,'' the company said. Hasanain Panju, who
was Cinar's chief financial officer and a senior executive vice
president, was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second significant piece of news about possible
financial irregularities at the Montreal-based company in the last
five months. In October the company was the subject of media
reports that suggested Cinar had improperly received tax credits
for scripts that were written by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Cinar said that it had not been able to determine the nature of
the unauthorized investments, or their value, but that it would be
taking steps to recover the money.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the investigation that has been undertaken by the
audit committee, the company warned that it might not be able to
deliver its financial results for 1999 by mid-April, as had been
previously expected.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in Cinar shares was halted all day in the Nasdaq stock
market. The shares closed at $18.375 on Friday, 39 percent off
their 52-week high of $30.25 on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Yelin, a senior partner in the Montreal law firm of
Fasken Martineau DuMoulin and a member of Cinar's board, has been
named chairman. Barry Usher, who has worked for Canadian banks and
insurance companies, has become the president and he also joins the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Once a favorite entertainment investment, the shares of Cinar
have tumbled since accusations of tax cheating were first raised by
Stephane Bergeron, a member of the federal Parliament. Canadian
films are given tax credits for domestic content, like writing and
performing. Cinar, Bergeron said in the House of Commons, where he
was protected from any legal action by the company, had put the
names of Canadians on scripts that were written by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Cinar describes itself as an entertainment and education
company, producing nonviolent programming for children and families
that is sold in more than 150 countries. It has been growing fast.
For the first nine months of 1999, it reported a 51 percent
increase in profit to 19.1 million Canadian dollars, or about $13.2
million, on revenue of 134 million Canadian dollars, or about $92.5
million, a 41 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation of tax fraud, which some people in the industry
said could result in repayments of about $10 million Canadian, is
under investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A second
accusation _ that Cinar stole the concept for one of its animated
series _ is under investigation by the Montreal city police.
</P>
<P>
   The company is likely to face class-action suits by investors in
both the United States and Canada. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP;
Lerach, a leading class-action law firm with offices in New York,
California and Florida, said it intended to file a suit on behalf
of U.S. shareholders. Support for a class action in Canada is being
sought by a well-known shareholder rights advocate, Yves Michaud of
Montreal.

LEGISLATORS DENOUNCE TAX SHELTER USED BY INSURERS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of Congress from both parties called Monday
for an inquiry into a tax shelter that makes it possible for
American insurance companies to stop paying income taxes by moving
their headquarters to Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any tax policy that provides incentives for companies to move
offshore and at the same time creates competitive advantage against
American companies needs to be re-examined,'' said Sen. Charles E.
Grassley of Iowa, the second-most senior Republican on the Senate
Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Two Florida Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee
went further, saying the tax shelter must be shut down, in part
because it will encourage other companies to move offshore or to
ask for similar big tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Rep. Mark Foley, said the Bermuda tax shelter ``is
startling because it allows companies to completely avoid all
income taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee who has been
attacking a variety of other tax shelters, Rep. Lloyd Doggett of
Texas, said: ``It's legal, but it shouldn't be. It's a new type of
Bermuda Triangle where revenues disappear, and we need to do
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislators were reacting to a report in The New York Times
on Monday that a half-dozen American insurers have begun exploiting
a loophole in federal tax law simply by moving their headquarters
to Bermuda or by being acquired by a Bermuda insurer. By doing so,
the companies avoid income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If all American property and casualty insurers similarly moved
to Bermuda, they could shelter $40 billion a year based on recent
profits, avoiding $7 billion in taxes annually, the Treasury
Department estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking advantage of the loophole, four of the biggest
American insurers are trying to demolish the tax shelter. The
insurers are Chubb, Hartford, Kemper and Liberty Mutual. The four
big insurers contend that, while legal, the arrangement threatens
to reduce drastically the government's revenues. They also say it
discriminates against any property and casualty insurer that
continues to maintain its headquarters in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest Bermuda insurers, ACE Group of Cos. and X.L.
Capital Ltd., a unit of Exel Insurance, have recently bought
American insurance companies, which are now in a position not to
pay income taxes. They say they are involved in no improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that X.L. Capital said reflected its own
position, ACE said it was abiding by ``longstanding,
well-established international tax rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington legislators said the existence of the loophole
had caught them by surprise. ``This is an unintentional consequence
of the tax code,'' said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., a member of
the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has stirred up a hornets' nest,'' said Foley, who along
with Shaw has sponsored legislation that would make American
companies more competitive with their Bermuda counterparts that pay
no corporate income tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the effect of this issue on the U.S.
domestic tax base,'' said Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., the
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett and other Democrats said they hoped to get bipartisan
agreement on legislation to shut down the Bermuda tax shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bermuda tax shelter differs from those that Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers denounced last week. Summers' attack was
focused on the rapid spread of sham transactions by corporations to
evade taxes, while the Bermuda tax shelter is a legal loophole that
had been unused until last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Maybe Jerry Lewis will volunteer to do a
charity telethon. And in these sad cases, shouldn't the United Way
be notified? Hopefully, the Salvation Army is also prepared to
scramble the canteen wagons.
</P>
<P>
   Our state's richest and largest university is now facing
financial disaster in its athletic department. Brace yourself for
those grim minicam shots of starving young jocks in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, however, there's an emergency plan in place. As of yet,
all hope is not lost. University of Texas athletic director DeLoss
Dodds is a master at working the backroom, or as some will say,
working the backstab. Right, Tom Penders? Right, Steve Hatchell?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, thank goodness for DeLoss. Along with football coach
Mack Brown, a scheme was devised that could provide a financial
rescue for UT's $41 million athletic department budget _ the
largest in the Big 12 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Cancel the long-scheduled football season opener in Hawaii on
Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a desperate measure for desperate times, but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's environment we cannot afford to do something that
is fiscally irresponsible,'' Dodds said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a heartwarming story. The football team willing to dump the
trip to Hawaii in order to save the entire jock kingdom at the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, there are doubters. I know. I know. In
today's jaded world, even this tremendous show of compassion can be
publicly trashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not want to play us, period,'' said June Jones, the
University of Hawaii football coach.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones didn't simply leave his displeasure there. He also
delivered this personal insult:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived in Texas for four or five years, and I've never
known a Texan to back down from a fight before. I guess their coach
isn't from Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   How catty. DeLoss and Mack are worried sick about where Chris
Simms' next meal comes from, and then they are subjected to this
kind of attack.
</P>
<P>
   OK, under Jones, the Hawaii football program did make a giant
leap last season, finishing 8-4 and winning a bowl game against
Oregon State. And when UT was doing its advance scheduling four
years ago, opening the 2000 season against the Rainbows was
probably considered no more than a pleasure trip for players and
fans. Plus, an easy W.
</P>
<P>
   But what coach Jones can't seem to understand is that a $41
million athletic department budget just doesn't have the same
spending power as four years ago. And since Hawaii was the first of
12 games for 2000, the more games the players are asked to play,
the more they will want to eat. It's a nutritional thing.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no money at Texas to pay for that additional food,
does Jones want to be held responsible for starvation in Austin?
</P>
<P>
   The skeptical will also look at the UT 2000 schedule and see 11
consecutive games without a week off, starting with the Hawaii
trip. The grind of that long plane ride, combined with playing the
next week against Louisiana-Lafayette, could mean Brown simply
doesn't want to start the season with an exhausting trip. Then
there's the fact Hawaii is much more dangerous than originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of worrying about starving jocks, or the shrinking
value of $41 million, do you think Brown is simply applying
football sense here?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there's also one other thing. If it's really about budget,
and feeding the young jocks in Austin, why did Texas say it would
come to Hawaii if the game was moved to a Thursday night? Hawaii
nixed that. Apparently the Rainbows sponsor a daylong flea market
at the stadium leading up to the Saturday night kickoff, and
there's nothing worse on the islands than a disrupted flea market.
</P>
<P>
   A neutral observer in all this would be Dennis Franchione, the
TCU football coach. One of those four losses for the Rainbows last
season was to the Frogs. In Hawaii, too. And afterward, there was
some whining by coaches on Jones' staff about dirty play from the
TCUs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that guy \RJones\S spends too much time worrying about
what other coaches are doing,'' Franchione said. ``That trip is a
terrible drain, particularly when you are playing the next week. I
don't think Mack is worried about how tough the game will be, but,
instead, about how that kind of trip can impact your players.''
</P>
<P>
   If it will make a June Jones feel any better, TCU voices say the
school wants to play both Texas and Texas A&AMP;M. The answers have
been ``no'' and ``no.'' Under Franchione, the Frogs are now more a
nonconference threat, both on the field and in recruiting, than
either wants to chance.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is hard to believe the Hawaii trip could cause
financial wreckage at a place like UT. But with all those hungry
mouths to feed, DeLoss and Mack have their story and they're
sticking to it.

 GAUGING THE LIMITS OF QUANTUM COMPUTING  
 (Science Times)  
 (Eds: Please use this version)  
 (af)  
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Six years ago, Dr. Peter Shor, a researcher
at AT&AMP;T Labs, galvanized an obscure area of computer science when
he published a recipe by which a computer based on the principles
of quantum mechanics could break the cryptographic codes protecting
data transmissions over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, top researchers around the world have joined forces
to further explore how the power of the strange rules that prevail
in the submicroscopic realm of the atom can be harnessed in a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Many government and corporate research labs like Microsoft
Research, International Business Machines and AT&AMP;T Labs, either
already have a quantum computing group, or, like NASA's Ames
Research Center and the Hewlett-Packard Corp., are thinking of
starting one.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious group in New York has even begun a quantum
computing start-up, called MagiQ Technologies, with a stated goal
of building a ``quantum Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   At a weeklong quantum computing conference last month at the
Mathematical Sciences Research Institute here, researchers from
universities and corporate labs gathered to discuss advances in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Talks centered on algorithms for quickly solving problems
thought infeasible for ``classical'' computers, understanding the
limits of the computational power of quantum computers, various
approaches to building a practical device and methods for
correcting computational errors.
</P>
<P>
   The week culminated in a series of presentations to the
Information Technology Office of the Defense Department's funding
agency, which is considering a program for financing quantum
computing research.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the participants celebrated the advances in this
technology, which go far beyond speculations of just a few years
ago, they acknowledged that researchers were still far from
understanding either the potential or the limits of the technology
and even further from building a practical device.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some of the researchers said they were lured to the
field, not by the possibility of a quantum computer on every
desktop, but as a gateway to a better understanding of the bizarre
world of quantum physics.
</P>
<P>
   An ordinary or ``classical'' computer stores information in
units called bits (0s or 1s), typically represented by electrical
currents or voltages that are either high or low. A quantum
computer, however, stores information by using the states of
elementary particles.
</P>
<P>
   Classically, the electron in a hydrogen atom, say, can be in a
high or low energy state. But in the weird world of quantum physics
the state of the electron is not just high or low but a weighted
combination of both simultaneously: what physicists call a
``superposition'' of states. As a result, a quantum bit in some
sense contains more information than its classical counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, as the number of quantum bits grows, the
amount of information required to describe it grows exponentially.
Classically, since each electron can be in one of two states, a
system of 200 hydrogen atoms will be in one of 2 to the 200th power
states. Quantum theory, however, says that the system at any moment
is in a superposition of all of those 2 to the 200th power states
possibilities at once.
</P>
<P>
   Because 2 to the 200th power states is a huge number, far larger
than the estimated number of particles in the universe, scientists
question how the universe can manage to even keep track of its own
natural processes. But the fact that it can hints at an enormous
resource for computing power.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a tiny system of 200 atoms, it is as though nature must
keep 2 to the the 200th pieces of scratch paper on the side, each
with a number written on it,'' said Dr. Umesh Vazirani, a professor
of computer science at the University of California at Berkeley and
a co-organizer of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   But this vast storehouse of information is difficult to tap.
According to the theory of quantum mechanics, a scientist cannot
look at an electron without jarring it out of its delicate
superposition and collapsing it into a single one of its two
classical states according to the weights.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of devising quantum algorithms for solving
problems is to harness this vast and hidden information processing
power despite the inability to access all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their potential power, Shor said in his presentation,
quantum computers will not necessarily perform all tasks more
quickly than classical computers. A working quantum computer, he
said, is likely to perform each operation more slowly than a
classical computer.
</P>
<P>
   Only for certain problems where researchers have discovered
methods of exploiting this vast pool of stored information to
extract an answer in far fewer steps _ methods impossible on a
classical computer _ will it be possible to speed up the
computation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Examples of this are Shor's algorithm for factoring numbers into
their prime components, a process that enables the cracking of
codes, and an algorithm by Dr. Lov Grover, a Bell labs researcher,
for searching a very specialized type of database.
</P>
<P>
   Many researchers, including Shor, are trying to find quantum
algorithms for other problems, believed to be beyond the reach of
classical devices. Others are working on quantum cryptographic
schemes to replace existing schemes in case a practical device is
built.
</P>
<P>
   Vazirani's presentation highlighted research on the limits of
quantum computers. For example, Grover's algorithm allows a
database to be searched in the square root of the time required by
a classical computer.
</P>
<P>
   This square root speed-up is the best that can be achieved,
according to work by Vazirani and others. Their result suggests, he
said, that the hardest problems in computing may forever be beyond
the reach of quantum computers.
</P>
<P>
   Vazirani pointed out, however, that such limits might be a
blessing in disguise because it raises hopes that new crytosystems
can be developed that quantum computers cannot break.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Isaac Chuang, a physicist at the IBM Almaden Research Center
in San Jose, Calif., described several competing technologies for a
working computer. In one of those, he reported, researchers have
managed to perform Grover's database search algorithm using as many
as four quantum bits. All the proposals, however, face difficulties
in scaling up to a practical device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main challenge in building a quantum computer,'' Chuang
said, ``is that you want to isolate it from everything in the
external world, yet, at the same time, be able to manipulate it at
high speed.''
</P>
<P>
   A major difficulty with running a quantum computer, the experts
say, is correcting the errors that build up during a calculation.
States stored in memory will get jostled inadvertently, for
example, and operations will be applied to the wrong quantum bit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Gottesman, of Microsoft Research, reviewed techniques
for correcting some of the errors that occurred while computations
were in progress. Beginning with a startling breakthrough by Shor
and colleagues, he said, researchers have outlined how to restore
quantum states that have been stored in memory but have partly
collapsed due to inadvertent observations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, research by Gottesman and others has shown that
errors in the computations themselves can also be corrected, as
long as there are not very many of them. He and others are trying
to develop error correction techniques that are more efficient and
that can accommodate larger numbers of errors.
</P>
<P>
   These researchers seem not to be disheartened by the many
barriers to a desktop quantum computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the value of a newborn baby?'' asked Richard Josza, a
professor of computer science at the University of Bristol in
England. ``Now, it can't do anything. But the potential is
limitless.''

HAIN FOOD TO BUY CELESTIAL SEASONINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hain Food Group, which has been rapidly acquiring companies in
the natural-food business over the last several years, said Monday
that it had agreed to buy Celestial Seasonings Inc., a well-known
maker of herbal teas like Sleepytime and Lemon Zinger.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the deal was about $390 million, with Celestial
Seasonings shareholders receiving 1.265 shares of Hain stock for
every share of their stock. Wall Street greeted the news with
dismay, driving Hain's share price down $4.75, to $27.625.
</P>
<P>
   The merger came about after four months of negotiations, said
Irwin D. Simon, president and chief executive of Hain, who will
become chairman, chief executive and president of the new company,
to be called Hain Celestial Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celestial has a fantastic name and it enhances our brand
portfolio,'' Simon said, adding that he expected the combined
companies to save at least $10 million in manufacturing and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Siegel, the chairman of Celestial Seasonings, which sold $100
million worth of tea last year, will become vice chairman of the
merged companies.
</P>
<P>
   H.J. Heinz Co. owns 19.5 percent of Hain, which bought the
Earth's Best brand of baby food from Heinz last fall in exchange
for the ownership stake.
</P>
<P>
   Hain has acquired companies that make natural foods like Health
Valley cereals, Terra Chips snacks and Westsoy soy milk, sometimes
for prices that analysts felt were too high. ``My objective is to
get us to be a billion-dollar company by 2002,'' Simon said of his
strategy.

U.S. GOVERNMENT LOOSENS UP IN A CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE NEW DOLLAR
COIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Va.)  By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Look out, America. George W. is getting a radical
makeover in a $40 million advertising blitz portraying him as a
cool urbanite whose dry sense of humor is matched only by his
self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not that George W. It's the other George W. associated
with presidential politics: George Washington. A wry, sly and
totally fly version of the first chief executive _ portrayed in
contemporary pursuits from dining on Chinese takeout to surfing to
riding the subway _ is the focus of an atypically offbeat campaign
from the federal government, promoting use of the new dollar coin.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the campaign, which begins this week, is cheeky,
even impertinent. For instance, in one television commercial,
Washington echoes the cult film ``Swingers'' by declaring that the
golden dollar, as the new coin is called, is ``so money.'' Several
ads use the slogan ``Change happens,'' evoking a popular
scatological catch phrase.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the campaign could not be more serious. The goal
is to help prevent the new coin from suffering the same fate as its
predecessor, the Susan B. Anthony dollar. That coin, introduced in
1979, has become as much a symbol of failure in government as the
Edsel or New Coke has in marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wreckage of the Susan B. Anthony still exists,'' said
Philip N. Diehl, director of the U.S. Mint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable there would be skepticism about a brand-new
product,'' he added. ``Who better to reassure the American people
than George Washington himself?''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is composed of the commercials, featuring the actor
Michael Keaton as the voice of Washington; print ads in magazines
like People; transit posters; and Web site banner ads. They show
Washington as completely comfortable with the concept of the golden
dollar being used rather than ``his'' dollar bills for routine
transactions like paying highway tolls, making purchases from
vending machines, buying hot dogs at a ballpark or feeding a bus
fare box.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is also presented as endorsing the decision to use
Sacagawea, the young Indian woman who helped guide Lewis and Clark,
on the obverse of the new coin in place of his visage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a strong, unusual approach,'' said Dan Rosenthal,
president and creative director at the Dan Rosenthal Co. in
Bethesda, Md. His shop was selected by the mint on the
recommendation of Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations agency
owned by the Omnicom Group that was hired to help introduce the
golden dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put two or three creative teams on this, and one said,
`Hey, is George Washington going to be sad about the new dollar?'''
Rosenthal recalled. ``That sparked the idea that since he still has
a job because the paper dollar's not going away, he's happy with
it. And since everybody loves George Washington, if he's happy, we
all should be.''
</P>
<P>
   In lightheartedly poking fun at traditional attitudes against
using coins in place of paper dollars, the campaign represents a
delightful departure from the earnest entreaties associated with
pitches from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   That was ``crucial to our strategy,'' Diehl said, because ``the
ads have to cut through the clutter, especially this dot-com
creative mania, all the edgy campaigns out there using humor.''
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly true because the golden-dollar campaign,
like dot-com ads, is seeking to reach a primary audience of urban
and suburban consumers 18 to 49.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the younger people who use coins a lot accept it,''
Rosenthal said, ``us old folks would, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if George is cool with the idea of the dollar coin coming
out,'' he added, ``we can show him as a devil-may-care kind of
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the creative teams at Rosenthal ``didn't want to overplay
it,'' Rosenthal said. ``There are no cherry tree jokes or coins
thrown across a river.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the mint kept us from pushing the edge too far,'' he
added. ``Once we had George a little too dressed down in street
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Washington's apparel is wide-ranging, including black
tie, a raincoat, scuba gear, a T-shirt and snappy suits. Sometimes,
he is dressed in the tone-on-tone look popularized by Regis Philbin
on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington head from the dollar bill is superimposed atop
the contemporary togs. In the TV spots, the head and mouth are
animated with special effects supplied by Charlex in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar coin campaign is meant to supplement an intensive
13-month promotion and public relations effort that culminated in
February, which included distribution of golden dollars in change
at Wal-Mart stores and as prizes inside boxes of Cheerios cereal,
sold by General Mills.
</P>
<P>
   The new coin can also be ordered on the mint's Web site
(www.usmint.gov). With Madison Avenue flair, the home page shows a
golden dollar overlaid with a star burst proclaiming ``Available
now!''
</P>
<P>
   The mint ``issued 200 million dollar coins during February,
which was equal to four years of demand for the Susan B. Anthony,
and we will make more than a billion this year,'' Diehl said
proudly. ``By comparison, it took 21 years for the Susan B. Anthony
to get to 900 million.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly the kind of success you dream about,'' he added.
``But that's why we're undertaking this air campaign and ground
campaign, to dispel perceptions among bankers and retailers that
the public doesn't want this coin.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words of war were apt. After all, this George W. was a
general, too.

CELLUCCI EYES UNINSURED FUND TO AID AILING CARE PROVIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci, offering his first health-care
initiative since the fiscal crisis at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care
was discovered, wants to take millions of dollars set aside for the
uninsured and lend it to struggling nonprofit hospitals, nursing
homes, and clinics.
</P>
<P>
   According to a memo circulated among Cellucci's staff, a
little-used $125 million fund established by former governor
Michael S. Dukakis as the first step to guaranteeing health
insurance for all state residents has accumulated a large surplus.
</P>
<P>
   With the Harvard Pilgrim situation fresh in the public's mind,
Cellucci's staff filed legislation asking the Legislature to set
aside $90 million of the total for low-interest emergency loans to
health-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This money was essentially set aside for health care, yet the
purpose of it was never realized,'' said John Birtwell, the
governor's spokesman, Monday. ``This is a way to have an immediate
impact on providers who are struggling and need help.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the proposal doesn't dip into the general fund, the
governor's office hopes the plan will be more palatable than asking
the Legislature for a taxpayer bailout of Harvard Pilgrim, which
was forced into state receivership on Jan. 4. The fund, called the
Medical Security Trust Fund, was established in 1988. Large
employers are required to contribute $16.80 per worker annually,
for a total of $48 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   But given the recent economic boom and continued low
unemployment, only $14 million was spent last year on health
insurance for workers who have been laid off or who have fallen
through the cracks because they work part time or on a contract
basis.
</P>
<P>
   The rest sits in a bank account earning interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Dukakis legislation was intended to be the first step toward
universal health insurance for all Massachusetts residents, but the
remainder of his plan was later repealed.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fund was established solely to provide health
insurance for the unemployed who meet certain income requirements,
any change requires legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is proposing a one-time transfer of $90 million to
create the Health Care Access Preservation Fund. Further revenue
would be generated from the interest paid by providers and by
leveraging the money to sell bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said plenty of money would be left over to
provide health insurance to the 10,000 adults and children who
qualify for the program in any given week _ even if the state falls
into another recession.
</P>
<P>
   The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy would establish
criteria for receiving the emergency loans, which would go to
providers that offer services not readily available elsewhere, that
serve a large number of Medicare and Medicaid patients, that are
experiencing financial hardship, and that display strong leadership
and an ability to repay the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Dreyfus, executive vice president of the Massachusetts
Hospital Association, was pleased but cautious about the governor's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will need to examine it closely to make sure there are
sufficient funds remaining for the uninsured,'' he said. ``But we
are pleased that the governor recognizes the urgent financial
problems of many hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus said that he would not want to see the new fund take the
place of ``fundamental reform of the system,'' which legislators
and the governor's office say will be addressed by a special task
force that will be formed in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As a concession to employers, who administration sources said
have mixed views about the loan fund, Cellucci also is asking the
Legislature to reduce the amount that employers contribute to the
fund by 25 percent. A Rate Review Board would be allowed to
increase or decrease the amount of the contributions in the event
of a change in the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first I've heard of it,'' said Jack Hoey, a
spokesman for Bell Atlantic, one of the state's largest employers
with 18,200 workers. ``I don't think we'd be in a position to
comment without looking at it first.''

MARINO CONSIDERS VIKINGS' OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan Marino is considering three alternatives: joining the
Minnesota Vikings as a likely starter, returning to the Dolphins as
a likely backup or retiring.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Marvin Demoff, said Monday that the Vikings have
assured the 38-year-old Marino that he would be the team's starter
for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's interest is twofold _ to gain a star and a proven
starter and to give Daunte Culpepper one more season of grooming.
Culpepper was Minnesota's first-round draft pick last season but in
1999 he did not throw a regular-season pass.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dolphins learned that Marino was being courted by the
Vikings to sign a one-year contract, the Miami president Eddie
Jones said Marino would be welcomed back if he decided to play this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny has been told he can come back,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Marino is expected to talk with the Dolphins' owner, H. Wayne
Huizenga, and to the Dolphins' coaches and then make a decision
later this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 10 Marino voided the final two years of his Miami
contract, which allowed him to become an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings Coach Dennis Green has decided against sticking with
Jeff George, who was 9-3 as the team's starter last season, mainly
because of contract and salary cap reasons. Green is undecided on
the status of Randall Cunningham, who has been both a starter and
backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talked to Dan Marino since he is an unrestricted free
agent, and we have had good success in getting those type of
players,'' Green said. ``We think Dan Marino still has some gas in
the tank. He's had a lot of teams contact him but we have a very
quarterback-friendly system. It comes down to does Dan want the
opportunity to climb that hill one more time? It's an opportunity
to get one of the top two or three quarterbacks to have ever played
the game. Our mind is made up. It's up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Marino says no to the Vikings, Culpepper would start this
season, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Marino has completed 4,967 passes for 61,361 yards and 420
touchdowns, all National Football League career records.
</P>
<P>
   But last season was his worst as a pro. For the first time as a
Dolphin he threw more interceptions (17) than touchdown passes
(12). He ranked 30th leaguewide in quarterback rating (67.4). He
missed five starts last year because of a pinched nerve, spasms and
weakness in his right, throwing shoulder and because of a bulging
disk in his back. Once he returned, the Dolphins finished 2-5. They
won a playoff game at Seattle but then ended their season in
Jacksonville in humiliating fashion, a 62-7 thumping, in which
Marino looked worn and frazzled.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting memories of that game hinted that Marino's career
was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said that about Randall, but he came here and
produced,'' Green said. ``They said that about Jeff George, and he
came here and proved them wrong. We're doing what we always do;
we're going after players who can contribute and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have juggled their coaching staff and lost three
stars to free agency: receiver Jake Reed to New Orleans and
offensive linemen Randall McDaniel and Jeff Christy to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system is part of the National Football League and
whether you are the champion St. Louis Rams or any other team, you
are going to lose players in free agency,'' Green said. ``The key
is what players do you have in the pipeline? We've got young,
developing players that we love. We think they can fill in and make
good on their chance due to the players we have lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we drafted Daunte so high, it was apparent even before he
stepped on the football field for us that he was our quarterback of
the future. We never said that he was the starter for this year,
his second year, but I believe he could be. Dan Marino for us would
be need specific. One year.'' &QL;

THE DOLMENS OF ANTEQUERA  
 TOURS WITH A JEWISH FOCUS 
RUINS OF CENTRAL SICILY 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 12)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
By SUZANNE MacNEILLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am planning a trip to Antequera in Spain, and would like
some information on visiting the dolmens there. Tips on
accommodations would also be helpful. _ Sandy Williams, Pittsburgh
</P>
<P>
   A. The ancient dolmens you are referring to are about a
20-minute walk from the center of Antequera, a market town about 30
miles north of Malaga. The dolmens _ or rock tombs _ predate the
Moors, who built a fortress in Antequera before losing it to the
Christians in 1410.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest dolmen, called Menga, was built around 2500 B.C.,
with a gallery covered with earth and stone. Nearby is a somewhat
smaller dolmen, Viera, dating back to 2000 B.C. The site is open
Sunday and Tuesday from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and Wednesday to
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and closed Monday. Free admission.
The Romeral dolmen, a mile away on the N-334 highway, dates from
1800 B.C. and is considered the most refined of the group, with a
long gallery and two circular chambers. It is open Wednesday to
Sunday 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., closed Monday and Tuesday. Free
admission.
</P>
<P>
   You'll probably want to see some of the other sites of
Antequera, which is famous for its religious buildings. Two
churches have been declared national monuments: the Renaissance
Real Colegiata de Santa Maria La Mayor, built from 1530 to 1550,
and the 17th-century Los Remedios Church, which contains the town's
patron saint, Our Lady of the Remedios. Another important site is
the San Sebastian parish church, on the plaza of the same name,
built from 1540 and 1549, with a handsome brick tower, the tallest
in town, erected from 1701 to 1706.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim Castle, or Alcazaba, on the eastern edge of town, is
also a national monument, and was largely built in the first half
of the 14th century. The site is open Tuesday to Sunday from 10:30
a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4:30 to 6 p.m.; closed Monday. Free admission.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular lodging in town is the three-star Parador
Nacional de Turismo, on the Paseo Garcia del Olmo, telephone (34)
95-284-0261, fax (34) 284-1312. A double costs $79, at the rate of
171 pesetas to the dollar. The two-star Hotel Castilla opened late
last year at 40 Calle Infante D. Fernando, telephone and fax, (34)
95-284-3090. A double costs $32.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact the Tourist Office, at 7 Plaza San
Sebastian, which is open daily. The phone and fax is (34)
95-270-2505. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you give me the names of companies that offer tours
especially for Jewish travelers? There seem to be plenty that go to
Europe or Israel, but we're interested in traveling to Asia or
South America. _ Sam L. Kleiner, Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. Here are two itineraries worth looking into:
</P>
<P>
   Lotus Tours, based in New York, is offering an 18-day kosher
tour to Japan, China and Hong Kong that departs July 2. The trip
includes a four-day cruise down the Yangtze River in China and
visits Kyoto, Kobe, Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. The trip will
be led by Rabbi Marvin Tokayer, who was formerly a rabbi in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Besides visiting well-known sites like the Imperial Palace in
Kobe, and the Forbidden City and the Great Wall in Beijing, the
group will also meet with members of Asian-Jewish organizations
like the Jewish Club of Hong Kong and the Center for Jewish Studies
in Shanghai. In Shanghai, a destination in World War II for Jews
who had no visas, there will also be a tour of the Jewish ghetto
and visits to the former homes of the Kadoories and the Sassoons.
The cost, including round-trip air fare from New York, starts at
$6,390 a person, double occupancy. Information: (212) 267-5415, fax
(212) 608-6007.
</P>
<P>
   Isram World of Travel has several Jewish heritage tours,
including a new 12-day itinerary to Argentina and Brazil.
Departures are on March 22, April 5, May 3, Oct. 25, Nov. 8 and
Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The group will visit Buenos Aires, where it will go to the
Teatro Colon Opera House, Casa Rosada (the president's residence),
the cathedral and tomb of General Jose de San Martin, as well as
attend Sabbath services at the Temple Beth El in the Belgrano
district. In Rio Janeiro, the group will see major sights, like
Sugar Loaf, Copacabana, Ipanema and the Grand Synagogue. Other
stops include Sao Paulo and Iguacu Falls. The cost, based on double
occupancy, is $4,389, including air fare. Information: (800)
223-7460, fax (212) 370-1477. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm going to Palermo, Sicily, this spring and I'm trying to
decide if it would be worthwhile to visit Morgantina and the ruins
near Piazza Armerina. What are the major sites there? _ Rusty
Schraeder, Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A. Many visitors to Sicily bypass the town of Piazza Armerina
and the ancient ruins of nearby Morgantina, about 100 miles
southeast of Palermo. But the impressive remains of their rich
Roman heritage certainly make the area worth visiting.
</P>
<P>
   While Piazza Armerina has numerous Arab-Norman buildings and
Baroque palaces and churches, visitors who don't have a lot of time
might want to head directly for the Roman Villa of Casale, about
four miles southwest of Piazza Armerina. The 37,000-square-foot
villa, which dates from the third or fourth century, has beautiful
mosaic pavements covering most of the building's galleries,
peristyles, courtyards and thermal baths. The tilework _ including
the mosaics of the Labors of Hercules in the banquet hall and the
mosaics illustrating the Roman circus in the baths _ are of the
Roman-African school and date from the fourth century.
</P>
<P>
   Morgantina is about nine miles northeast of Piazza Armerina,
near the village of Aidone. The site, which is still undergoing
excavation, has been identified as an early Sikel settlement from
the ninth-century B.C. that was at one point colonized by the
Greeks. The principal excavations have been conducted in the third
century B.C. agora, or marketplace, and in the residential
buildings on the hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   The agora is a vast rectangle built on two levels and joined by
a trapezoidal staircase with a covered market at the center and the
sanctuary of Demeter and Kore as well as a fourth-century theater
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the Villa Romana del Casale, which is open daily
from 8:30 a.m. to about one hour before sunset, is $4 (at 1,991
lire to the dollar). Information: (39-0935) 680036. Admission to
Morgantina, open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m, is $3. Information:
(39-0935) 87955. &QL;

STOCKS MOVE LOWER AFTER GREENSPAN'S COMMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes ``Boston University'' to ``Boston College'' in 3rd
graf.) 
(lb)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices moved lower Monday after the three most
important guardians of the United States' financial system said
higher interest rates are needed to cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the cautionary comments, which were made by Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Lawrence Summers,
secretary of the Treasury, and Arthur Leavitt, chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, last week's big run-up in stock
prices provided additional incentive to take some profits out of
equities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if Greenspan wrote the speech for all of them,'' said
Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``As the day
wore on and the headlines of what they were saying hit the tape,
the market went down.'' The three officials addressed a conference
held at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 196.70,
or 1.9 percent, to 10,170.50. IBM, Microsoft, American Express and
Wal-Mart led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the Dow gained more than 200 points after February
employment data suggested the economy may be starting to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index slipped 17.89, or 1.3
percent, to 1,391.28, pushed lower by big declines in Exxon-Mobil,
Bristol Myers Squibb and 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks bucked the trend for much of the session, but
late in the day the Nasdaq composite index began to sag and closed
lower. The Nasdaq finished at 4,904.85, down 9.94, or 0.2 percent.
At one point during the day it was up by as much as 65 points.
Trading was brisk.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, volume was 1.03 billion shares.
On the Nasdaq stock market, 1.9 billion shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Stock investors have been worried that instead of cooling the
economy, a further series of interest-rate increases by the Fed
will cause the economy to lapse into recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the big question,'' said David L. Mead, chief
investment officer at Harris Bank in Chicago. ``I think they will
be able to avoid a hard landing, simply because they have done it
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Mead said the prospect of further increases in interest rates
has not caused him to change his investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to make a change, we would shift money out of
large-cap sectors and into small- and mid-cap stocks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of bellwether technology companies had a tough day.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was one of them. The stock fell 5{ to 90 5/8.
Meantime, Intel dropped 1 7/16 to 117 3/8. And Cisco Systems shed 1
5/16, to 136 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard was one of only three Dow stocks to gain ground.
</P>
<P>
   The stock gained 7 1/8, to 145 9/16, after Agilent Technologies,
which is 85 percent owned by Hewlett-Packard, announced a
switching-technology breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent closed at 161, up 53.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone-equipment manufacturers had a good day.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel gained 7, to 128. Lucent Technologies was up 2{, to 73
5/8. And Motorola gained 5 5/16, to 180 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology stocks, which have been among the market's leaders
so far this year, turned in a mixed performance.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen fell 1}, to 64 9/16. Genentech was off 19, to 215{. But
Immunex rose 3 11/16, to 248 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Williams Sonoma fell 12}, to 18 1/8, after the seller of kitchen
equipment said earnings for the quarter ended Jan. 30 may be below
Wall Street estimates.

   PARIS _ The night before his show, Karl Lagerfeld was up in the
kitchen at Chanel working his way through a plate of cheese and
talking, talking, talking, as only he can, about the current state
of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are scared a little,'' he was saying. ``Always they
think that life was better before, so they go back to the past. But
this is not the problem, because, after all, revivalism has always
been part of fashion. Dior's New Look was a revival of the 1916-War
crinoline. No, it is that everything is moving very quickly. Life
was changed by computers, TV and video. And, in a way, it's very
scary. Life became a special effect.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the thought, more than any other, that kept coming up
as the French fall 2000 collections banged to a close. There was
Nicolas Ghesquiere's highly focused show for Balenciaga, with its
blade-thin shoulders and singular silhouette, all played out in
sleek tapestry trousers, raw-edged blouses and jersey tops piled
ingeniously with mop fringe and fabric curls. Ghesquiere is now one
of the bona fide stars of Paris: his influence is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   There was Martin Margiela, who, after herding his guests into
railway boxcars laid out with spindly gold chairs and disco balls,
proceeded to show flagrantly oversize clothes _ think men's size
48. Yet, as disturbing as the boxcar scenario was for some guests,
Margiela is onto something with his voluminous clothes. They are
not only highly personal, with adjustable hooks in the waistbands,
but they are also, if one actually puts on one of the coats,
strangely evocative of the solemn glamour of designers like
Cristobal Balenciaga himself.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was John Galliano's show on Thursday night. One
could have easily hated its childish antics _ the models'
paint-splattered faces, the girlish cotton underpants they wore as
they came staggering out under crazy cardboard animal
superstructures, the purposely oversize shoes and dresses, in size
16. And in fact, a lot of people did seem horrified by Galliano's
schoolyard romp, with only a handful bothering to troop backstage
to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, something in this collection struck a rare nerve, a joy
completely absent from his sour Dior show. ``It's about
innocence,'' Galliano said. Up close, in the showroom, the clothes
conveyed all that. So why not play it straight on the runway?
Because Galliano knows, as Karl Lagerfeld had said only an hour
before, that you can't hope to appeal to people's overstimulated
nerve endings unless you show something that looks radically, even
hatefully, different. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lagerfeld is an expert at bringing things back to
earth while keeping you slightly suspended with exhilaration. To
say that his Chanel show on Friday was about coats is a little like
saying the New Look was about a corset. He added volume to the
clothes, mostly in quilted or pleated skirts, but the brilliance
was all in the controlled mix as the models came stomping out in
tweed coats swinging over loosely belted blouses and skinny
trousers. They wore wigs that playfully evoked Lagerfeld's new
fringed hairdo, and they also had on things like scarves and
strands of pearls the size of Ping-Pong balls. More than 1980's eye
candy, they were reminders that fashion's back in fashion.

   Few designers of Ann Demeulemeester's 30's generation have her
capacity to resist the changes around them so serenely. She is like
a tortoise, taking her home, her self-informed ideals, with her
wherever she goes in whatever season. For fall, she, too, makes
women look chic, but with a rawness that is unfailingly connected
to modern life.
</P>
<P>
   Her show last Wednesday night in Montmartre opened with
distressed motorcycle leather wrapped closely around the body and
falling in asymmetrical points. There were wrap skirts in
lightweight wool pinstripes, and denim and burnt-orange suede
jackets whose crusty texture resembled the surface of a cake right
after it's been turned out of a pan. To these rough effects, she
applied her frosting: sweaters of pink and white yarn spun with
silver and long vests of vanilla hand-sheared fur that were shown
bare-armed and tied twice around the waist with plain cloth tape.
Delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Those who saw Jean Paul Gaultier's haute couture show in January
hoped he would transfer some of that je-ne-sais-quoi French
elegance to his ready-to-wear collection. On Wednesday, he did, and
then some. Before the show, in a musty old theater, white-gloved
hostesses scattered cigarette butts on a wet black runway, thus
signaling that this was Gaultier's street version of that
indefinable something.
</P>
<P>
   That something turned out to be fetching jersey tops and
halter-neck tunics worn with womanly skirts or mannish pinstripe
trousers, and shown with black fishnet leggings and those
spiked-heel shoes that never fail to excite the customers at a
Pigalle bust-and-leg revue. For pure ooh-la-la, there were fluid
jersey pants and cute sweaters knitted in grosgrain ribbon. The
show was strong on separates, reflecting Gaultier's ability not
only to manipulate French chic, but to merchandise it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the speed of change and the effect it has on the
overstimulated brain, it might be a good idea if designers who do
subtle clothes started confining their presentations to showrooms.
Peter Speliopoulos' collection of ladylike tweeds for Cerruti was
pretty, but visually, to use a phrase from Henry Allen of The
Washington Post, it was as irrelevant as a daytime moon. Narciso
Rodriguez also would have been better served if his leather shifts
and separates for Loewe, in the cocoa-and-meringue hues of a Paris
pastry shop, weren't put on the runway, where the hungry eye can
brutally dismiss them as ``nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Scott's show, among those closing out French fashion week
on Friday, felt thin on ideas. Scott kept alive his logo theme from
last season, and cotton leotards printed with bow ties and other
ritzy cliches were fun. But, as Scott should know by now, the Paris
stage is too demanding for white Hollywood goddess gowns. The
collection needed more work, and more of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Then, today, the early-morning sound of taxi doors slamming:
suddenly everyone was gone, and Paris seemed marvelously deserted.
At the flea market, there were vintage Chanels waiting. On the Left
Bank, women were bounding into Yves Saint Laurent's men's store to
look at Hedi Slimane's spring clothes; although for men, they have
a cult status among women.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Marais, Azzedine Alaia was working on his latest
collection. Twenty years ago, when some French editors turned up at
other designers' shows in his curvaceous clothes, the photographer
Bill Cunningham, now on the staff of The New York Times, , whom
Alaia credits with discovering him, wrote that they would influence
the look of fashion for the next decade. He was right. Alaia, who
still stays up most of the night sewing, literally imposed his look
on the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Alaia, who hasn't shown his clothes, in any formal way, since
1992, said, without bitterness: ``The editors used to spend two or
three evenings here during the collections. But now they don't have
time.''
</P>
<P>
   His art, his technique, may be more relevant than ever, and not
because the '80s are being revived. As four workers calmly sewed
clothes, including a coat for Naomi Campbell and a suede tango
skirt embroidered with flowers for the couture patron Mouna Ayoub,
Alaia brought out an outfit in progress: a black taffeta ball
skirt, enormous in its silk folds, and a fitted black wool jacket,
on whose back Alaia was now expertly pinning the complete hide,
tail and all, of a baby crocodile.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't say when it would be finished, but few questions are
more beside the point.

NETWORKS PLAN SWEEPING COVERAGE OF SUPER TUESDAY PRIMARIES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the three broadcast networks and their cable cousins and
competitors, Tuesday's coverage of the most sweeping presidential
primary ever will resemble the coverage of a general election, with
ABC, CBS and NBC updating their evening news broadcasts and
breaking into regular programming with the latest news as polls
close in 16 states across four time zones.
</P>
<P>
   But it will again be the cable news channels that offer nonstop
election news starting at 5 p.m. (CNN) and 6 p.m. (Fox News Channel
and MSNBC), as seen through the eyes of their reporting staff as
well as political barons past and present like former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, who will appear on Fox, and Mike McCurry, the former
spokesman for the Clinton White House, who will appear on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to cover this night all the way through _
we're not going to change,'' said Brit Hume, Fox's Washington
managing editor and senior political correspondent. If the
contest's underdogs, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, falter early, ``some of the suspense
will be lost,'' Hume added. But, he said, in most of the five
Tuesday evening primary marathons to date, Fox's audience has not
diminished throughout the evening, even, as in South Carolina, when
the end result was evident before the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the enviable position of journalists who like
politics appealing to people who also like politics,'' Hume said.
``Not only do people want to know who won and who lost, they want
to hear what the candidate said about the other guy, they want to
hear their least favorite guy eat crow.''
</P>
<P>
   During election evenings this year, Hume said, ``the audience
was up or consistent throughout,'' except during the coverage of
the Michigan primary on Feb. 22. On average, Fox's election-night
coverage this year has been watched in 410,000 households, up about
84 percent over the channel's February prime time average of
223,000 households. The cable channel is received in 45 million
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures, provided by Nielsen Media Research, show that
even though MSNBC is received in 54 million homes, 9 million more
than Fox News Channel, its political coverage has drawn smaller
audiences. But MSNBC's Tuesday evening audiences grew steadily,
from 217,000 households the night of the New Hampshire primary, to
378,000 households for last week's Virginia, Washington State and
North Dakota primaries.
</P>
<P>
   CNN, which has a 20-year franchise in election coverage and is
carried in 76 million households, has seen its prime-time audiences
grow noticeably on primary election evenings, up from about 611,000
households on an average February evening to 826,000 the night of
the New Hampshire primary, more than its two cable news rivals
combined.
</P>
<P>
   The combined audience for network news broadcasts is about 23
million households, but the broadcast networks have tended to leave
prime-time election coverage to cable. Tuesday night, spokesmen
said, the networks will break in with updates all evening. ``We're
going to call the races as the polls close if we can,'' said Bob
Murphy, ABC's senior vice president for news.
</P>
<P>
   Key information that is used to call the elections comes from
the Voter News Service, a survey organization administered by a
consortium of six news organizations: ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, Fox and
The Associated Press. Other news organizations, including The New
York Times, subscribe to the data service.
</P>
<P>
   As the votes were still being cast in New Hampshire and South
Carolina, Slate, the online magazine, posted the overall results of
the news service poll. Sponsoring news organizations, which had
pledged to Congress that the information would remain confidential
until the polls closed, were furious.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Shafer, a Slate columnist, said Monday that after the
service's legal warnings, the magazine's editors had decided to
abandon the exit-poll postings. ``Essentially, we've declared
victory and are leaving the battlefield,'' Shafer said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy of ABC believes that ``Web sites that steal information''
are ``doing a disservice to the process. And they are in violation
of the VNS contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site of the conservative magazine National Review last
Tuesday picked up where Slate left off and posted exit-polling data
for Virginia in midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Richard Lowry, the magazine's editor, said he
received a letter from lawyers for the Voter News Service, saying
that such actions ``constitute an unlawful misappropriation of
VNS's intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowry, who had been ``inclined'' to post exit-polling data
Tuesday afternoon, said he would consult his lawyers before doing
so.

SCIENTIFIC GROUPS COMPLAIN ABOUT TREATMENT OF WEAPONS SCIENTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two major American scientific organizations have written to
Attorney General Janet Reno to protest the conditions under which
Wen Ho Lee, the former Los Alamos scientist charged with improperly
handling nuclear secrets, is being held before trial.
</P>
<P>
   One letter, signed by Dr. James S. Langer, the president of the
American Physical Society, the nation's leading organization of
physicists, says in referring to Lee that group members ``are
deeply disturbed by the inhumane treatment that he has received in
his pretrial incarceration.'' It is dated Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   A second letter from the committee on scientific freedom and
responsibility of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, a large and influential group, is dated the next day and
signed by the committee's chairman, Dr. Irving Lerch.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, Dr. Lee's pretrial treatment appears to
be exceedingly cruel,'' Lerch wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The second letter stated, and a lawyer for Lee confirmed, that
he is held in a cell in a New Mexico jail for 23 hours a day; his
ankles and wrists are shackled when he is moved about the jail,
including during a weekly meeting with his family. The lawyer said
Lee was kept separate from other prisoners during his hourlong
exercise period.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court last week denied Lee's effort to be
released on bail, citing the danger that he might pass information
about nuclear weapons designs to foreign powers. Lee is accused of
illegally copying secret information about the designs onto
unsecure computers at Los Alamos National Laboratory and onto
portable computer tapes. Some of the tapes have not been accounted
for; Lee's lawyers said he destroyed them. He has not been charged
with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, federal officials defended Lee's continued
incarceration. ``This is a case that involves missing computer
tapes containing some of the nation's most sensitive nuclear
secrets,'' said Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman, in
response to the letters. ``The conditions imposed upon him are
either those that would be imposed upon any prisoner placed in
administrative segregation or they are those that are intended to
ensure that he does not communicate the location of any of the
missing tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Plato Cacheris, a Washington lawyer who represented Aldrich
Ames, the CIA agent convicted of spying for Moscow, said that those
conditions sounded more restrictive than the ones under which Ames
was held before trial. For example, Ames was routinely ``in the
company of other prisoners'' until his conviction, said Cacheris,
who has no firsthand knowledge of the Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   Lerch said that some scientists feared that Lee was ``being
intimidated in order to force him into a plea bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Both groups of scientists emphasized that their letters made no
presumption about Lee's guilt or innocence. But members of the
groups, and of two other scientific organizations that composed
protest letters _ the Committee of Concerned Scientists and a human
rights committee at the New York Academy of Sciences _ said that
Lee's case resembled those of dissident Chinese and Russian
scientists, particularly during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would get a letter or somebody would inform us that a
refusenik was blamed for something _ still did not stand trial,
still not convicted _ and was treated like this, we would have
raised hell,'' said Dr. Zafra Lerman, a chemist and a member of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science committee.

 GOVERNOR RELEASES LETTER FROM CRITIC OF McCAIN  
(lb) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a Long Island advocate for breast-cancer
research was quoted as saying she was sorry she made a commercial
criticizing Sen. John McCain's votes on research programs, Gov.
George Pataki's office released a letter Monday night from the
woman defending her involvement in electoral politics.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Newsday reported that the advocate, Geri Barish of
Nassau County, had said of the commercial, for Gov. George W. Bush,
``With all the controversy, I am sorry I did the radio spot and
it's come out the way it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Barish did not answer calls seeking comment. But on Monday
night, the office of Pataki, who is leading the Bush campaign in
New York, released a letter in which Barish says, ``Breast-cancer
activism and politics are joined at the hip.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Advocating for breast cancer on Long Island is like
being in the hottest kitchen on earth. You have to able to take the
heat _ and I can.''
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial, which the Bush campaign paid for, Barish
criticized McCain for voting against financing for some
breast-cancer programs.
</P>
<P>
   After the commercial began running, some other advocates for
breast-cancer research criticized Barish, saying it was
inappropriate to make the topic an issue in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he opposed the programs because they were part of a
spending bill that underwent little scrutiny.

shot from inside his own blue line into an empty net, securing a
3-0 victory . . . Last home goal came Dec. 4 in the first period of
a 9-3 loss to Chicago.

WBA ARGUES TO A DRAW OVER LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The World Boxing Association convened after a six-hour hearing
in Philadelphia Monday without determining whether to strip Lennox
Lewis of its share of the undisputed heavyweight championship of
the world for refusing to fight John Ruiz, the WBA's newly declared
No. 1 contender.
</P>
<P>
   A decision is expected within a few days, said James Binns, the
WBA's legal counsel, who presided over the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing brought together lawyers for Lewis, Evander
Holyfield and Ruiz as well as Don King, the promoter for Holyfield,
to argue the issue. Ruiz was the only boxer present.
</P>
<P>
   The WBA's president, Gilbert Mendoza, was not present at the
hearing, but listened by telephone from time to time from
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a foregone conclusion, but I'm not very
optimistic,'' Lewis' lawyer in the United States, Milton Chwasky,
said on the prospect of the WBA continuing to recognize the British
heavyweight as champion.
</P>
<P>
   If Lewis (35-1-1) is stripped of the WBA title, that means he
will hold only the World Boxing Council and the International
Boxing Federation versions of the title when he meets Michael Grant
(31-0) on April 29 at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   If the WBA strips him of the title, the organization could make
a bout on June 3 between Ruiz (36-3) and Holyfield (36-4-1), the
WBA's No. 2 contender, a match for the vacant championship.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has been the undisputed heavyweight champion for almost
four months. He defeated Holyfield in Las Vegas on Nov. 13 for the
IBF and WBA titles, adding them to his WBC championship. That fight
was the rematch of a bout March 13, 1999, between the two fighters
that ended in a controversial draw, although it appeared Lewis had
beaten Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   After that match, all three organizations called for an
immediate rematch and all three sanctioned it.
</P>
<P>
   But the WBA stipulated that Lewis' first title defense was to be
against its No. 1 contender, who at the time was Henry Akinwande, a
Nigerian heavyweight who fights out of Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   King said that Lewis agreed to the WBA stipulation before he
fought Holyfield in the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis wants his match against Grant to be sanctioned by the WBA.
Ruiz, who has been the WBA's No. 1 heavyweight contender for two
weeks, wants Lewis stripped of the title. And King wants Ruiz and
Holyfield to fight for the vacant WBA title in Las Vegas on June 3.
</P>
<P>
   Akinwande was to have fought Holyfield for the title in June
1998. But that fight was canceled when Akinwande tested positive
for hepatitis B. The effects of that disease lingered, but
Akinwande remained the WBA's No. 1 contender until a few weeks ago
when it was discovered that he had developed a liver ailment and
was taking drugs to combat it. That forced the WBA to find another
No. 1 contender and Ruiz was elevated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems odd that there was a rush for a mandatory for a guy
who has been the No. 1 contender for just 13 days,'' Patrick
English, the lawyer for Main Events, Lewis' promoters in the United
States, said regarding Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' first defense of his undisputed championship was supposed
to be against Akinwande, the WBA mandatory challenger, but when
Akinwande was not available Lewis moved on to Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In November we approached the WBA to resolve this matter,''
English said. ``In December we wrote them a letter with a proposal
for a box-off to get this matter resolved. We got nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   English said that after going to court in Philadelphia and
determining that Akinwande was not healthy enough to challenge for
the title, the WBA offered no solution to the matter. So, Main
Events and Lewis made a fight with Grant, who is No. 2 in the IBF
and the WBC rankings and No. 5 in the WBA.

BRUINS' REBUILDING TO BEGIN ANEW _ WITHOUT BOURQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins today face much the same thing they faced in
the spring of 1997 when that dreadful campaign came to a close.
</P>
<P>
   They will miss the playoffs again.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to rebuild again, as they did three years ago
when they tabbed the No. 1 and No. 8 picks overall (Joe Thornton
and Sergei Samsonov) as stars of the future.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a decidedly different atmosphere surrounding the
team this time, because now they face a future without Ray Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   Many around the club also expect coach Pat Burns, who was
brought in to lead the youngsters to the promised land, to be fired
at the conclusion of the year despite the players' strenuous
objections.
</P>
<P>
   The '97 team was not expected to do anything, but this season
has been an abject disaster for the Bruins, who were picked by
Sports Illustrated to win the Eastern Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   The march to the basement started in the summer when the Bruins
let center Tim Taylor walk away without even making him an offer.
It continued when they walked away from Dmitri Khristich's
arbitration award and got only a second-round pick for him. It
continued with the holdouts of several players, the most pivotal of
which was goalie Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to Jason Allison continued the derailment of the
offense. Add to that the bizarre criticism of Burns by owner Jeremy
Jacobs, followed by the subtraction of Joe Murphy, who was kicked
off the team for insubordination and wound up in Washington. The
Bruins added defenseman Marty McSorley, who was suspended by the
league for the season after hitting Vancouver forward Donald
Brashear in the head with his stick last month. Whatever morale was
left in the already-stressful environment evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear after that Feb. 21 contest that the Bruins would
be lucky to win another game all year. Forget the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The awful deterioration, which led to Bourque asking out after
21 years in Boston, has come as a huge shock to those who believed
this club was building something positive at the start of the
1997-98 season. Right wing Rob DiMaio, for one, signed up for a
long-term deal after assurances by management that the talent would
be kept together. Instead, over time, it's been torn asunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the young guys three years ago and we were going to
build from there, and each year seemed to develop a little more,
now it's like `OK, let's start all over again,' '' said a
distraught DiMaio. ``When's it going to really get to a point where
it's `Let's take a run at this'?
</P>
<P>
   ``For Ray, that's what is unfortunate. He wanted that so bad
here and it didn't happen. I don't know if loyalty is gone in this
game now. Sometimes you learn the hard way by thinking and pretty
much being told one thing and that not happening. I was very
disappointed at the start of the year when certain guys weren't
coming back. I couldn't understand it. I just couldn't understand
it. So, I guess it's more of a business than you want to realize
and that's what sucks about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Count DiMaio as one in a huge group who wish Bourque nothing but
happiness and a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said if this team was competitive and he felt we had a shot
at winning, there is no way he'd go anywhere else,'' said DiMaio.
``He'd love to finish here but the situation is what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think it will be a tarnished Stanley Cup if he were to
win it. There's no guarantee he'd win it, but I don't think it
would be because if you've never got to the end point, you don't
know how exciting that can be. To have a shot at it, that's all he
wants, and all the power to him because he deserves it.''

A SAINT IS TRADED, AN OWNERSHIP IS BLEMISHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Somewhere out there is a female correspondent who
always maintained in her letters that Ray Bourque was a living
saint.
</P>
<P>
   She really meant it. She honestly believed that Raymond Bourque
was more than just an exemplary hockey player. She believed he was
so personally virtuous that he was nothing less than a saint.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if part of being a saint is the capacity to avoid saying
you-know-what if stuffed with a mouthful, then perhaps Ray Bourque
really is a living saint. He has been the good soldier's good
soldier, the teammate's teammate, the company man's company man. He
has borne witness to 20 years of ups, downs, and all sorts of
in-betweens during his distinguished Bruins career, and at no time
has he publicly aired so much as a doily of the organization's
soiled laundry. Whatever Ray thought or believed, if it was
negative, or if it would have reflected poorly on the party of the
second part, it stayed inside his head and heart.
</P>
<P>
   It long ago reached the point where we really did begin to
wonder whether, if pricked, he perhaps wouldn't bleed, at least in
that Shakespearean sense. It seemed that Ray Bourque would simply
accept what the Fates had dealt him, that his record total of 1,518
regular-season games played without winning a Stanley Cup would
casually escalate, game by game and year by year, until he played
his final contest with the Boston Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   But Bourque has had enough. He has decided that there must be
something better out there for him. He wants a shot at the Cup he
was never going to win in Boston. It has been 10 years since he had
a viable opportunity to win it all in Boston. He certainly doesn't
owe anyone in the Bruins organization anything. He has remained
perennially optimistic, and he had always fulfilled his end of the
bargain. The decision to leave rightfully belonged to Ray Bourque,
and Ray Bourque alone.
</P>
<P>
   If Bourque winds up playing on the 2000 Stanley Cup champions,
how satisfying will that really be? He more than likely will have
been a contributor, but he will still be an appendage to a core
group, and it will not be the same as if he had done it with a team
he had bonded with from the first day of training camp in a sport
where mutual body sacrifice is the norm. Other than, say, basking
in the glow of having just scored the winning goal in Game 7 of the
finals, just how satisfying will it be for Ray Bourque to be
skating around whatever arena, hoisting the Cup in some funny
uniform?
</P>
<P>
   That assumes he finds himself on the winning team. There are no
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   We, of course, cannot crawl inside Bourque's head. We don't know
how much seeing his name engraved on that Cup will mean to him. We
don't know how much it hurt to be on the losing side in 1988 and
1990, nor do we know what goes through his mind each spring when he
turns on his TV and sees the annual revelry. He may be looking
enviously at former teammates, or perhaps even contemptuously _ can
a saint be contemptuous and keep his standing? _ at foes for whom
he has no respect, perhaps some cheap-shot guys who have loosened a
tooth or two in the Bourque mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can we underestimate the sheer gravitational pull of the
Stanley Cup to a Canadian-bred hockey maven like Raymond Bourque.
There are professional athletic championships and there is the
Stanley Cup, a vessel that has a cachet not present in the other
major sports. No American has the proper appreciation of the
Stanley Cup mystique. Bourque may have decided that, however
limited his contribution, however tangential his involvement, it is
worth it to him just to be a part of the most hallowed ritual North
American sport has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   All this is Bourque's prerogative. But he should understand that
our growing mania with championships as the validation of the
individual player is nonsense. The inherent nature of his chosen
sport dictates that victory will be very much the result of
collaborative activity, and that if any one man will wield
disproportionate influence, it will be the goaltender, not a
defenseman, and not even one as skilled and dedicated as Bourque.
Wayne Gretzky did not win in a vacuum; neither, for that matter,
did Bobby Orr.
</P>
<P>
   So let it be known that no one with any remote degree of
sensitivity to the matter will think anything less of Bourque if he
does not win a championship. When you are the single most
personally admirable star to have performed in your town for more
than 20 years, which Ray Bourque happens to be, the presence or
absence of a championship ring on your finger is an utter
irrelevancy.
</P>
<P>
   Playing an entire career with one team is an increasingly rare
superstar phenomenon, and it can be argued that for someone in
Bourque's position it has as much to recommend it as does winning a
championship ring. But Bourque has chosen a different path, and
that truly speaks ill of the Bruins as an organization.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who knows him wishes Ray Bourque the most conceivable
happiness. And everyone who cares about the Bruins should now
understand how morally bankrupt its ownership really is when an
athletic saint is so demoralized that he chooses to leave.
</P>

APPEALS COURT RULES IN MARTIN'S FAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Casey Martin won another court decision Monday, and he will
continue to ride his cart on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a federal
magistrate's 1998 ruling that allows Martin to use a cart in Tour
competition. This could be the last legal obstacle for Martin. The
PGA Tour could choose, however, to continue the legal battle,
either by appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court within 90 days or by
asking the 9th Circuit, which sits in San Francisco, to rehear the
case with a full panel of 11 judges rather than the 3 who issued
Monday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome, a rare circulatory
disorder that causes severe pain and swelling in his right leg.
Martin won his original case against the Tour on Feb. 11, 1998,
when U.S. Magistrate Thomas Coffin granted Martin an injunction
that required the Tour to furnish him with a cart.
</P>
<P>
   In Coffin's view, Martin established that he was legally
disabled, and that his use of a cart in competition was a
reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Coffin accepted the Tour's argument that walking is a substantive
part of Tour golf, but he rejected the notion that riding in a cart
would give Martin an advantage over his peers.
</P>
<P>
   That opinion was upheld Monday by the 9th Circuit in a 3-0
ruling. The appeals court ruled that golf tournaments were covered
by the Americans with Disabilities Act and that Martin's cart was a
reasonable accommodation that would not change the ``fundamental
nature'' of a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central competition in shot-making would be unaffected by
Martin's accommodation,'' Judge William Canby wrote. He said there
was ample evidence to support Coffin's finding that fatigue _ the
element in which Martin would presumably have an advantage by
having a cart _ was not a significant factor in golf, compared to
factors like stress and motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was en route to Florida for this week's Honda Classic and
was unavailable for comment, but his representatives expressed
their delight with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled,'' said Mark Freeland, one of Martin's agents
with Imani Sports in Minneapolis. ``It just reaffirms the original
decision. We felt that Thomas Coffin made a sound decision, and the
fact that it was 3-0 reaffirms that feeling. All this does is
permit Casey to engage in professional golf with his disability.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour released a statement Monday saying it has not
decided its next course of action, but that the Tour would announce
its plans sometime after the next policy board meeting March 15.
Even if the Tour asks for a Supreme Court review, there is no
guarantee it would agree to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour must also decide if the case is worth pursuing from
both a legal and public-relations perspective. Many sympathize with
Martin, who made it onto the PGA Tour by finishing in the top 15 on
last year's Nike Tour money list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tour is currently reviewing the 9th Circuit's opinion,''
the Tour said in statement released Monday. ``Additionally, we will
also review the opinion with the PGA Tour policy board at the
regularly scheduled policy board meeting on March 15. We will have
further comment, if appropriate, following next week's policy board
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a 27-year-old native of Eugene, Ore., has played in five
PGA tournaments this year, making the cut in three. He is coming
off his best finish _ last month's Touchstone Energy Tucson Open,
where he tied for 17th place. &QL;

BOURQUE TRADE BRINGS BACK MEMORIES FOR BRAD PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was his first game at the FleetCenter this year.
Brad Park came to see for himself a Bruins franchise on which, in
Park's words, Mother Nature has dumped buckets and buckets of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep thinking the rain has stopped, and it's just cloudy
out,'' said Park, ``but then Mother Nature dumps some more rain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ray Bourque Watch was on for yet another day, yet another
game. Park, of course, is another superlative defenseman who never
had the joy of playing on a Stanley Cup-winning team in his 16
years with New York, Boston, and Detroit. And Park shrugged when
talking about Bourque's rationale, that Bourque wants a chance to
win a Cup, a chance obviously not to be had in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me when people bring that up,'' said Park. ``I know
a whole lot of guys who won the Stanley Cup who couldn't carry my
skates.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Cup is a joy, Park went on, but a player knowing he
gave his all on every shift in his career is perhaps just as much
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the reasons why everything is happening,'' said
Park. ``It's a shame Ray has to leave the team to accomplish his
goal of trying to win everything. But Ray and guys like Steve
Yzerman are two of the few guys who've spent their entire career in
once city. It's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Park was as much the identity of the Rangers as Bourque was of
the Bruins _ even if Park had played with the Rangers for only
seven seasons _ at the time of his trade to Boston. The last thing,
the very last think Park envisioned was that his Rangers would
trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, nearly 25 years later, each detail of the sudden,
unexpected and truly shocking trade is fresh in Park's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't forget mine,'' said Park. ``It really bothered
me.''
</P>
<P>
   For all concerned _ fans, players, coaches, and general managers
_ what happened on Nov. 7, 1975, when the Bruins sent Phil Esposito
and Carol Vadnais to the Rangers for Park, Jean Ratelle, and Joe
Zanussi was the jolt of all jolts.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long did it take me to get over the Rangers' trading me?''
Park said. ``Put it this way: I think it was for three years after
that trade that the Rangers didn't beat us. Jean and I wouldn't let
it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's departure to the Avalanche was less of a surprise
Monday night after the week of speculation. The same cannot be said
of the trade that Bruins general manager Harry Sinden and his New
York counterpart, Emile Francis, pulled off just months after the
Bruins lost a crushing Stanley Cup final series to the Philadelphia
Flyers. None of the players had a clue; neither did fans or media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was captain of the Rangers and I loved the city and I loved
the fans,'' said Park. ``I was very happy there. It was a wonderful
life I had in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Esposito's reaction when the word of the trade reached the team
in Vancouver is part of Bruins lore. Bobby Orr and coach Don Cherry
went up to Esposito's hotel room to tell him that he was traded and
Esposito, standing by a window, said, ``Just don't tell me it's to
the Rangers or I'll jump out this window.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Cashman trashed his hotel room in anger, and many of the
Bruins players cried. But the reaction of Park and Ratelle, the New
Yorkers, was emotional, too. The classy Ratelle, who was
comfortable in New York and worked on Wall Street during the
offseason, was so upset that he didn't report to Boston for three
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very hard,'' recalled Park. He and his wife Gerri
``had established ourselves in New York,'' and Boston, as is in
every sport, was a bitter rival to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil was very emotional when he got to New York, saying he
didn't like the city or the fans,'' Park recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Park, if not as vocal, was just as upset, but soon enough, he
got to like Boston and became an indispensable cog in good Bruins
teams the next eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize I played longer in Boston than New
York,'' said Park. ``Eight years to seven.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1983, Park left for Detroit as a free agent, it is here that
Park offered advice to Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be better if we kept the family in Boston
when I went out to Detroit,'' recalled Park. ``But after only a few
months . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ray is going to find out the same, that it might be OK
for a few months but it would be very hard after that. After only a
few months, we had built ourselves a home in Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, said Park, most likely will learn the same lesson ``if
he stays in another city next season,'' said Park. ``It'll be hard
for Ray being away from his family.''

DERBY JINX CLAIMS GREENWOOD LAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ The Florida Derby and the Kentucky Derby lost
one of their stars Monday when Greenwood Lake limped home from a
morning workout at Hialeah and was immediately booked for a flight
to Kentucky for surgery on a hairline fracture of his left front
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old colt seemed likely to make a full recovery, but
no one could say when that might be, nor could anyone predict
whether he would come back with the same performance level that won
the Champagne and the Remsen last fall and that made him the early
choice to win the Kentucky Derby on May 6 at Churchill Downs in
Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early prognosis is for a full recovery,'' said Nick Zito,
who trains the colt. ``But we'll cross that bridge when we come to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant that the unexpected accident would remove his best
horse from the only Kentucky Derby he could ever enter, and that
the injury might prevent Greenwood Lake from ever returning with
the same brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Zito noticed that Greenwood Lake was laboring when he came back
from a five-furlong breeze, which he ran in 1:00 3/5 at Hialeah,
where he is stabled and where many horsemen keep their racing stars
because of its superior surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back off,'' the trainer reported. ``He is definitely
out of the Florida Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury was the most dramatic to strike this year's
contenders, many of whom were gathered here at Gulfstream Park for
Saturday's Florida Derby, the defining race in Florida on the road
to Kentucky. It also continued a relentless streak of misadventures
to befall Derby candidates in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Derby ``jinx'' struck Wondertross, the favorite
in the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland, who suffered an intestinal
blockage the day after he finished sixth in the Blue Grass. The
year before, Lil's Lad, the early favorite for the Kentucky Derby,
was eliminated with a chipped left front ankle. It was detected
three weeks before the Kentucky Derby. Also, Coronado's Quest was
withdrawn from the Derby because of behavioral problems, and Grand
Slam, winner of the Champagne Stakes, was removed with deep cuts on
his flank sustained during the Breeders' Cup Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   Six years earlier, in one of the more dramatic accidents to
befall a star horse, A.P. Indy was withdrawn on the morning of the
Kentucky Derby when he was found to have a fractured bone. And,
hanging over Derby contenders every year was the fact that no
2-year-old champion since Spectacular Bid in 1979 had gone on to
win the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood Lake joined this casualty list at a time when his
fortunes seemed to be improving. The colt, a son of Meadowlake and
the mare Au Printemps, ran second in the Belmont Futurity last
September in his third start. Then he came back to win the
Champagne in October and the Remsen in November, and closed his
rookie season with three victories in five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Zito chose not to run him in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, which
was won by Anees, the 2-year-old champion who has since strained a
tendon in his leg and has yet to start a race at 3. Then Greenwood
Lake unaccountably ran sixth in the Holy Bull at Gulfstream Park in
January and fourth in the Fountain of Youth in February.
</P>
<P>
   But he closed threateningly in the Fountain, racing from deep in
the pack to finish fourth and making up 30 lengths in the
homestretch. He reminded people of the Zito style of training
speedy closers like Strike the Gold, who won the 1991 Kentucky
Derby. And Joe Cornacchia, one of the owners of Strike the Gold,
was also one of the owners of Greenwood Lake, reviving memories of
Derby glory for the barn.

BOURQUE GOES TO AVALANCHE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Ray Bourque Watch reached a stunning conclusion
Monday night when Bruins president/general manager Harry Sinden
announced after Boston's 4-1 loss to Ottawa at the FleetCenter that
the team's longtime captain had been traded to the Colorado
Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, a Bruin for 21 seasons, was traded along with winger
Dave Andreychuk to Colorado for forward Brian Rolston, defenseman
Martin Grenier, center Sami Pahlsson, and Boston's choice of
Colorado's first-round pick in either 2000 or 2001.
</P>
<P>
   What made the deal so surprising was that the Avalanche, despite
an abundance of talent such as Patrick Roy, Joe Sakic, and Peter
Forsberg, are barely hanging on to a Western Conference playoff
spot and are by no means considered a favorite to win the Stanley
Cup. Bourque had said he wanted to be traded to a viable contender,
and Bruins management had expressed a desire to accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude right now is we will report,'' said Bourque's
agent, Steve Freyer. ``(The Avalanche) have a game in Calgary
(Tuesday). His first game will probably be in Edmonton on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   As of 9:30 p.m. Freyer had not talked to Colorado general
manager Pierre Lacroix about the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be talking to Pierre later,'' said Freyer. ``For the
short term, Ray will report. Then we will see what comes of a new
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Freyer said Bourque would not comment. ``He's home, and he's
tucked in for the night,'' Freyer said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sinden said the Avalanche were chartering a plane to
get Bourque to Calgary on time for Tuesday's game (9 o'clock
Eastern time).
</P>
<P>
   Early in the night, it appeared a deal had been consummated with
Bourque's first choice, the Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   But around 8:15, word came from the Flyers' practice rink in
Voorhees, N.J., that an angry Philadelphia general manager Bob
Clarke emerged from his office after more than an hour and said the
deal had fallen apart.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bruins coach Pat Burns was forced to go with only 19
players against the Senators because Andreychuk had been scratched
in anticipation of a deal. Around the same time Clark was getting
hot under the collar, Andreychuk left the FleetCenter upset that he
hadn't been clued in as to what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heading home now,'' said Andreychuk. ``I can't wait around
here anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night was the weirdest in a very bizarre year for the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was particularly painful for the players, who watched
Bourque collect the puck at the end of a 3-0 loss to the Flyers and
then accompanied him to the dressing room for the very last time.
That was the point at which it really hit them that an era was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Rob Tallas said, ``The rumors were just kind of there in
the air before. Then all of a sudden he grabs the puck and then the
silence in this room. People realized that, `Wow, it really could
be happening.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque didn't give any speech or formal farewell. It was more
subtle, more emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``You came in here tired and you put your head down and thought
about the loss but then, all of a sudden, you realized there was
more to the loss,'' said Tallas. ``Everybody just sat back and had
their breath taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray had a lot of emotion. He's an emotional guy. You could see
it. He clinched his eyes with his fingers. You knew something was
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray's the type of guy that if he tried to start speaking, he
would've lost all that emotion and at that point, I don't think he
wanted to. You could look around at the guys who have been here and
see the sadness in their eyes. You could see it, it was a shock, it
really was. A huge shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gretzky was traded, but it's different because he's been here
for so long and he's been so loyal to the city and the team. It's
sad.''
</P>
<P>
   In a year full of disastrous turns for the Bruins, one more
dramatic and gut-wrenching than the next, Bourque's departure is
the most devastating of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had so many huge knocks,'' said Tallas. ``It's been
headline news what's happened to this team this year. Normally, a
team might get one headline a year and we seem to have five, six,
or seven and it just continues.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Attention all furniture within striking distance: The bald man
has a point to pound home, and he's darn likely to use his fist to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is loyalty in a disloyal town, and James Carville's
diabolical face, one that could be the prototype for every
jack-o'-lantern ever carved, looms large in his dog-dominated
basement office in a quaint Colonial on Alexandria's main drag.
(Somehow Virginia is big enough to hold Carville, the
self-described ``loudmouth'' political consultant and Clinton
defender, and his nemeses, the Rev. Jerry Falwell and Kenneth
Starr.)
</P>
<P>
   Now Carville's down-home voice, one that assaults the average
eardrum like an overtwanged banjo string, traipses the decibels,
loud, louder, loudest. Don't even try extracting the bayou from
this good ole Louisiana boy, oldest and boldest of a brood of eight
born to Lucille Carville, a tough-talking lady better known as
Nippy.
</P>
<P>
   Is Carville, a Machiavelli enthusiast whose Republican enemies
accuse him of exhibiting qualities more cobralike than human,
incensed about anything special? Nope. He's just ranting about the
spirit that moved him to write his latest book, ``Stickin''' (Simon
&AMP; Schuster), in which he plays Boswell to the theme of loyalty,
mainly to President Clinton who, for better and for worse, put him
on the map.
</P>
<P>
   What Carville, 55 and fit but for a little case of runner's
arthritis, is bellowing about now, a tad ahead of schedule he
hopes, is his obituary. And the clause that popped into it the
minute he began defending Clinton and denigrating Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I call my comma: James Carville, comma, Clinton's
sex defender, comma,'' he explains, his hands testing the
horseshoe-shaped bristle of graying hair (``My wife made me shave
it'') behind his ears. ``Ask people who's that guy, and he's not
the guy who wrote four best sellers, not the guy that ran the
successful presidential campaign here or in Israel or wherever,''
says Carville, whose international client list includes presidents
and prime ministers in Israel, Mexico, Brazil and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the guy who defended the guy who got in trouble. I wish
it never happened. But wish in one hand and spit in the other, and
see which one fills up fastest,'' says Carville, whose pithy
colloquialisms don't tend to be G-rated.
</P>
<P>
   Sex _ and lying about sex, he adds _ is not enough of a crime to
provoke him to bail out on Clinton. After all, without him, ``I
wouldn't have an obit! I wouldn't have a comma! I wouldn't have had
anything!'' The observation makes him giddy.
</P>
<P>
   One fist is hammering the coffee table. The other hand is
picking white dog hair from his dark pants leg; the shed hairs are
souvenirs from two Cavalier King Charles spaniels deep in slumber
beside him on the sofa. (His very Republican spouse, the political
analyst Mary Matalin, correctly surmised that a jolly lapdog or two
would help cure the doldrums of her 1994 miscarriage.)
</P>
<P>
   Not that Carville and Matalin's political polemics make for a
family-feud atmosphere at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go home, it's a little bit like if you were a plumber
and the rule of the house was you couldn't fix the toilet'' is
Carville's analogy. ``We sleep with six living things in the bed:
the two of us, two kids, two dogs, so even if we wanted to have a
big fight about capital-gains tax cuts, most nights we're too
exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   In Carville, La., where his father ran a general store, Carville
grew up poor and proud of it. He also grew up intoxicated by
politics, especially once ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' convinced him
that the South was ``all wrong on the race thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He spent summers running errands from a Baton Rouge bank to the
Capitol, where the politicians ``were these hefty characters who
wore cologne and drove black Cadillacs,'' recalls Carville who,
surprise, has a couple of Cadillacs.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint in the Marines, he got his law degree from
Louisiana State University, less because he wanted to be a lawyer
than because people said he talked like one. ``Everybody said,
`You've got a silver tongue.'''
</P>
<P>
   At 38, realizing that if he needed a lawyer he wouldn't hire
himself, he quit to be a political consultant. He says it was the
first thing he had ever done that he was actually good at, says he
took an uncle's advice about training chihuahuas (``You have to
think like the dog'') and applied it to politics. ``It has nothing
to do with IQ. You just have to put yourself to thinking like the
voter would, got to have this sort of razor edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Carville thinks he's lost a bit of the old edge. Sure, he still
does some barking, but he rarely bites anymore. Here it is an
election year, and he's not frothing at the mouth. He's providing
advice, gratis, to Clinton (``Let's just say he seeks it
periodically, but I don't know how much of it he takes''), Hillary
Rodham Clinton (``Giuliani would be a senator that would speak for
the powerful, those who have it made, and she would be a senator
for people trying to make it''), and Al Gore (``This was not good
vs. evil, this was good vs. better,'' he says of his preference for
Gore over Bill Bradley). Still, Carville is having ``a quiet
year.'' ``The wars are all kind of over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Would he ever enlist again?
</P>
<P>
   ``At my age you don't predict your future. You just want a
future.''

A STRANGE ENDING TO A WORTHY CAREER WITH THE BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Twenty-one years after he first suited up for the
Boston Bruins, defenseman Ray Bourque was traded to the Colorado
Avalanche. The man who came to town in the Old Garden the same year
Larry Bird arrived will seek his Stanley Cup in the Rocky
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strange day. Such a strange night.
</P>
<P>
   It's never easy and rarely tidy when we say goodbye to a local
sports legend as he goes off to play for a new team. We could go
back to that cold January day in 1920 when Red Sox owner Harry
Frazee said the New York Yankees were ``taking quite a gamble'' by
paying $100,000 for Boston lefty Babe Ruth. Remember the furious
fan fallout when Bobby Orr signed with the Chicago Black Hawks? And
again when Carlton Fisk blew town after Haywood Sullivan neglected
to mail him a contract in time?
</P>
<P>
   Now beloved Ray Bourque has played his last game for the Black
and Gold and there's a giant crack in the Vault on Causeway Street.
</P>
<P>
   Bruin Black Monday was a study in rumor and speculation. Morning
papers reported that Ray had said farewell to his coaches and
teammates in the locker room after Saturday's matinee loss to the
Flyers. Boston radio stations competed to be first with the news
that Bourque had been traded to . . . Colorado. Or was it Detroit?
Or was it Philadelphia? Or New Jersey? Ray didn't come to the
morning skate, and then it was reported that he cleaned out his
locker at the New Garden in mid-afternoon. The report was
incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the goofiness of this sorry day, the infamous Marty
McSorley showed up in midafternoon to see the Bruins trainers.
Maybe he picked up some fan mail.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, reporters flocked to the New Garden,
hungry for a pregame press conference. There was none. But when
veteran winger Dave Andreychuk was scratched from the lineup,
everybody deduced that a Bourque deal had been struck and
Andreychuk was part of it. Defenseman Brandon Smith was called up
from Providence to skate in Bourque's place.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of emtpy creamsicle seats as the Bruins and
Senators skated their first shifts. There wasn't much noise in the
hollow New Garden. Fans brought signs that said, ``We Love You,
Ray'' (everybody loves Raymond) and ``Trade Harry.'' Many wore No.
77 Bourque sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   A number of reporters never left the press room to watch the
game. It was as if the Red Sox and Twins were playing another one
of those endless Lee County exhibition games. The news was not on
the ice. The news was in the back rooms and on the phone lines
between Boston and Philly. Or was it Detroit? Or Colorado? Or New
Jersey?
</P>
<P>
   Don Sweeney and Rob DiMaio skated with the ``A'' on their
sweaters, signifying their status as alternate captains. Nobody
wore a ``C.'' Captain Ray was gone and the Bruins were playing like
a team of headless gunners.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:15, Andreychuk left the building, saying, ``I'm heading
home now. I can't wait around anymore.'' Minutes later, word came
from Philly that the Flyers were out of the hunt for Bourque.
Philly GM Bobby Clarke was said to be steaming. Speculation moved
toward New Jersey. Or Detroit. On the ice, the Bruins trailed, 1-0,
midway through the second period.
</P>
<P>
   After two periods, Bruins officials were saying that an
announcement would be made after the game. In the third period, no
one's mind was on playing hockey as the Senators scored three goals
in 1:40. Boos rained down on the head of coach Pat Burns and his
sad soldiers. Fans chanted, ``We want Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   No debris on the ice. Only Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   It was ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors flew throughout the third period as the sorry game played
on. Detroit. No, Colorado. A Bruins publicist announced that there
would be a press conference after the game. Harry Sinden and Mike
O'Connell would ``provide an update on the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   At 9:40 p.m., Sinden, O'Connell, and Burns took the stage in a
makeshift press area on the third floor of the building and
announced that the Bruins had traded ``our captain'' Ray Bourque
and Andreychuk to Colorado for Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier, Sami
Pahlsson, and a first-round pick. Sinden said he had just spoken
with Bourque and that ``he was a bit stunned at the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, standing next to Bourque's locker, veteran
Sweeney said, ``I learned from him every day. Despite the fact that
he was the best player in this locker room every night, he treated
everybody the same.''
</P>
<P>
   That's it. After 1,518 games, Ray Bourque is no longer a Bruin.
The unthinkable has become reality. Ray Bourque has been traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great trip for me with Raymond Bourque and a great
trip for everyone in this town,'' said Sinden. ``And I think it's
been a great trip for Raymond Bourque even without the Stanley Cup.
We have our memories.''

GRAVANO INDICTED ON ARIZONA DRUG CHARGES

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ State prosecutors here unveiled a 201-count indictment
against Salvatore Gravano, the former Gambino crime family member
and turncoat; his wife and children, and dozens of others on
Monday, charging them with a wide-ranging racketeering conspiracy
to sell the designer drug Ecstasy throughout Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In two separate court appearances on Monday _ Gravano in the
first, and his son and Michael Papa, accused of being a leader of
the racketeering ring, in the second _ the defendants sought to
have their bail reduced and be released from jail. They cited what
defense lawyers called warrantless arrests and complained that
their repeated requests to speak to their lawyers were denied.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Ronald S. Reinstein of Superior Court rejected the
requests by Papa and Gravano's son, Gerard Gravano, and postponed a
ruling on the elder Gravano's request. All three, who were arrested
on Feb. 24, appeared in black-and-white-striped inmate clothing on
Monday, with ``sheriff's inmate'' emblazoned across the clothing in
capital letters.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury on Friday returned a 47-page list of charges
against Gravano; his wife, Debra; his son and his daughter, Karen,
mostly dealing with possession and attempted distribution of
dangerous narcotics, but also charging the Gravanos with money
laundering and use of telephones in relation to drug crimes. In a
series of raids last month, investigators served search warrants on
an Italian restaurant run by Gravano and a swimming pool
construction business run by Gravano.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting assertions by defense lawyers that there was not
enough judicial oversight of the investigation, government lawyers
revealed Monday afternoon that at least part of the evidence in the
case rests on recordings from 11 wiretaps, conversations heard on a
bugging device planted in a business and material gathered as 14
search warrants were executed during raids last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Gravanos were among 36 people arrested on Feb. 24, after a
months-long investigation by local, state and federal authorities.
The authorities allege that Gravano helped Papa turn his fledgling
operation dealing Ecstasy into one that brought in millions of
dollars a week, growing from selling 1,000 pills a week to up to
25,000. They assert that Gravano, whose son was friendly with Papa,
provided money and expertise to Papa.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Gravano's turncoat testimony helped bring down
John J. Gotti, the boss of the Gambino crime family. An admitted
killer of 19 men whose ferocity gave him the nickname Sammy the
Bull, Gravano went on to testify at nine trials and has been
credited with being the force behind the convictions of 39
organized crime figures and their associates. He moved to Arizona
after entering the federal Witness Protection Program, which he
later quit.
</P>
<P>
   In another case Monday involving the Gambino family, a federal
indictment handed down in Brooklyn charged that Gotti's son-in-law,
Carmine Agnello, and three associates were part of a group that
threatened or used ``force, violence and fear'' through extortion
and arson in a scheme to take over a rival auto wrecking yard in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Agnello, who already faces state charges of arson, extortion and
other crimes in connection with the case, was charged in federal
court with racketeering, extortion, arson and income tax fraud.

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION _ This week at the Big 12 Tournament in Kansas
City, Jerald Brown will play his final game for Texas A&AMP;M,
concluding a puzzling career that began with boundless potential
and will end in melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown was recruited in 1996 by then-coach Tony Barone, he
was one of the hottest properties in the nation. He was a member of
the McDonald's and Parade All-America teams and was named Mr.
Basketball in Texas after his playing days at Aldine High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bar none, I think I was one of the best players in the
country,'' Brown said last week without a trace of braggadocio,
merely recalling the glory days.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who was anybody in college basketball was beating down
Brown's door. The 6-7 forward was recruited by, among others, North
Carolina, Michigan, Temple, Arkansas and Massachusetts. When he
chose to go to Texas A&AMP;M, mainly because he wanted to remain close
to home, the Aggies had their most prized recruit ever.
</P>
<P>
   Brown did not disappoint during his freshman season, averaging
10.1 points and 3.9 rebounds. He started 24 games, scored in double
figures 14 times and was named Big 12 Freshman of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Against Nebraska, Brown scored what proved to be his career high
with 24 points, going 8-of-10 from 3-point range. The Aggies
finished 9-18, but Brown seemed poised to become a big-time player.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the only question seemed to be whether he would stay
four years at A&AMP;M or leave early to go to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, he could play point guard. He could hit
3-pointers or slash to the basket. He could play the post. He could
rebound. As a senior, he averaged 23.9 points and 11.5 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere along the way, Brown lost his shot and, with it,
his confidence. He went into a dismal shooting slump during his
sophomore season, hitting only 29 percent from the field. In one
four-game stretch, he was 3-for-23.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies went 7-20. Barone was fired.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown's average dropped to 7.4 points per game as a
sophomore, even opponents were surprised. Texas' Gabe Muoneke, who
played at Cypress Falls when Brown was at Aldine, was
flabbergasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows how good Jerald Brown is,'' said Muoneke. ``He
wasn't a McDonald's All-American for nothing. In high school there
was nobody that could handle him. Inside out, he had the most
complete game of any high school player in the state when we were
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened last year, but I know he can still
play.''
</P>
<P>
   During Brown's sophomore slump, Barone said publicly that Brown
was putting too much pressure on himself and hinted that Brown
couldn't handle that pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous amount of pressure on Jerald Brown,''
Barone said in January 1998. ``You don't have any choice but to
accept the pressure. He's trying to work himself into a situation
where he is not worrying about what other people think
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brown, who is good-natured and polite, is hesitant
to relive a two-year disagreement with a man who is no longer
coaching. Instead, Brown merely says, ``The coaching change was
great for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he catches himself daydreaming about what it would have
been like to play his entire career under Melvin Watkins, who
replaced Barone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the young guys now come to me and talk about, `Coach
did this, coach did that,''' said Brown. ``I tell them this guy is
great compared to what we had. It's a totally different atmosphere.
Coach Watkins is a terrific guy, the right guy for this program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't push the young guys too hard. You don't want to push
them away, and coach Watkins knows that. He doesn't come in with
the scalpel not knowing where he's going with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a more restricted role last season, Brown averaged only 5.9
points. This year, Watkins was counting on Brown for veteran
leadership on a team that often started three or four freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown suffered a broken orbital bone near his right eye in
preseason practice, starting an injury-slowed season in which he
played only 21 games and averaged 21 minutes a game. He averaged
5.5 points and was just 7-of-28 from 3-point range. As a freshman,
he was 54-of-154 on shots from beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew of Jerald before I came here because every coach knew
of him,'' said Watkins, who was at North Carolina Charlotte before
coming to Texas A&AMP;M. ``I don't know what happened, but I found him
to be as hard a worker as I've been around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we asked him to do, he did. He was a great guy to
have with all of our young kids. He played with a broken hand for
most of the last part of the season, and that says a lot about a
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown missed the first three games with the eye injury, suffered
the hand injury in late January and later suffered cuts on his
forehead and inside his mouth that needed stitches.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy for Brown to mope about ending a career that
wasn't supposed to end this way. However, he chooses to look on the
bright side, pointing to the fact that he intends to receive a
degree in agricultural development in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to look back and wonder what if I would have done
that or what if I had gone to that school,'' said Brown. ``That's
human nature. I've done it. But I came to the conclusion that if
you spend too much time worrying about it, you're just going to get
caught up in it and never move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to look back and learn. I don't regret anything I
did, or anything I went through. I mean, it was a tough road. The
injuries, the on-the-court things I went through after my freshman
year. The off-the-court things, being away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Brown can't put his finger on exactly what happened from
his glorious high school career to his mundane career at A&AMP;M, he
isn't ready to give up on trying to attract attention from an NBA
team.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he won't be drafted, but he wants to see if there is
any interest in a player who once was one of the hottest things
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back and know that something good is going to come out
of all this,'' said Brown. ``Not only am I going to get a degree
from Texas A&AMP;M, but I believe basketball isn't over for me. I'm 23
years old, and I feel like I've got a lot of basketball left in me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be one of those guys who has a rough, tough
four years (in college) and gives up. When I'm 55 years old, I
don't want to look back and wish I would have at least given it a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Jerald Brown's future seemed to have NBA written
all over it. After his star-crossed career at Texas A&AMP;M, that shot
now is a long shot.

   NEW YORK _ Visitors to the new Rose Center for Earth and Space
may have to brush up on their astrophysics. At the start of a
spiral ramp that tracks the 13-billion-year history of the
universe, for example, is a plaque with several scientific
notations under the title ``Pathway Cosmological Parameters Based
on Observational Data and Theoretical Models, 1 January 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from notations for the Hubble parameter, the matter
density parameter and the vacuum energy parameter, there is no
further explanation. Dr. James Sweitzer, director of special
projects for the center, said the plaque sums up the state of human
knowledge, on Jan. 1, about the age of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the Hubble parameter (expressed on the
plaque as H(EQ)70km/s/Mpc), is the expansion rate of the universe:
70 kilometers per second, over a distance of one megaparsec. A
megaparsec is 3.26 million light-years (a light-year is the
distance light can travel in one year, about 5.88 trillion miles.)
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the ramp, pictures of distant galaxies are
accompanied by captions that mention ``red shift.'' Some visitors
have been confused by an explanatory wall panel that says: ``What
is Red Shift? The red shift of a galaxy tells us how much the
universe expanded during the time the galaxy's light has traveled
to us. Red shift is therefore a measure of a galaxy's distance and
of the epoch at which we observe it. The ongoing expansion of space
stretches the galaxy's light and shifts features in its spectrum to
longer and longer wavelengths. For visible light, those features
shift toward the red.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Sweitzer said, light emitted by an object in
space that is traveling away from us shifts toward the red end of
the spectrum. This shift can be measured and used to calculate the
distance to the light source.

3 OFFICERS CONVICTED OF COVER-UP PLOT IN LOUIMA TORTURE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS throughout to recast, add background, quotes; no

 By EDWARD WONG and ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two New York City policemen and one former officer
were convicted Monday of covering up the brutal assault on Abner
Louima, a Haitian immigrant, in an emotional verdict that the
defendants' families vowed through tears to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants _ Charles Schwarz, Thomas Wiese and Thomas
Bruder _ each were found guilty in federal District Court in
Brooklyn of conspiring in dozens of phone calls to obstruct justice
by making up a story for authorities that Schwarz was not involved
in the attack on Louima in the bathroom of a Brooklyn station house
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's verdict, lawyers for the three defendants
continued to say that Justin Volpe, who pleaded guilty at the first
trial in the case last May, had attacked Louima alone. The lawyers
said they would appeal the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   The horrible details of the assault, in which Volpe beat and
sodomized Louima with a broken broomstick, had been fully aired at
a trial last year. Monday's verdicts spoke to the systemic problem
of whether police officers and officials of the policeman's union
lied to protect their brethren rather than the citizens they were
sworn to serve.
</P>
<P>
   At the first trial, which ended in June, Schwarz was found
guilty of helping Volpe torture Louima and then fired from the
force, while Bruder and Wiese were acquitted of beating the
prisoner in a squad car.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged as a central element in both trials was Schwarz's
role. After the first trial, Volpe said Schwarz had not been in the
bathroom during the attack. And in the second trial, Volpe
testified that the second officer in the bathroom was Wiese, not
Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   The trial that ended Monday in federal District Court in
Brooklyn concerned what prosecutors said was a plot to lie about
Schwarz's involvement. The government argued that Schwarz pinned
Louima to the bathroom floor while he was tortured and then, with
the help of Bruder and Wiese, lied about his role. The defense
maintained that there was no conspiracy to free Schwarz from blame
because, from the start, Schwarz was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict came almost two weeks after a jury in Albany
acquitted four police officers in the shooting death of Amadou
Diallo, a 21-year-old Guinean immigrant, a year ago. While the
details of the cases were different, they have become linked in the
public's mind. Since the victims in both cases were black and the
officers white, there has been an angry debate about police conduct
and officers' treatment of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, Bruder and Wiese can be sentenced to a maximum of 5
years in prison on the charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice. No
sentencing date has been scheduled. The jury comprised six white
and six nonwhite panelists, who were granted anonymity by the court
and did not speak to reporters after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   From the Feb. 7 outset of the second trial, Alan Vinegrad, the
chief prosecutor, based his arguments on two categories of
evidence: phone records showing that the defendants spoke with each
other in a series of calls after the attack _ sometimes only
moments apart _ and testimony that they held a closed meeting in
the basement of the 70th Precinct station house with a trustee of
the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   It was during those calls and at that meeting, Vinegrad charged,
that the defendants prepared their stories. He argued that, in the
early days of the inquiry, Wiese lied to the Brooklyn district
attorney's office by saying that, when he walked into the bathroom
moments after the attack, he saw only Volpe and Louima inside, and
not Schwarz. Months later, Vinegrad said, Bruder lied to federal
agents by backing up Wiese's account.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz never gave a statement to the authorities, but he was
charged in the case because the government believed he recruited
his co-defendants and others to construct and then perfect his own
cover story as the investigation pressed on.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was severely disheartened when the judge in the
case, Eugene Nickerson, instructed the jurors that they could
convict the defendants of conspiring to lie about Schwarz even if
the jurors were not sure that he had played the role described by
prosecutors. Federal law holds that a conspiracy may exist even if
the underlying crime never occurred.
</P>
<P>
   After a parade of 23 witnesses and the introduction of more than
100 pieces of evidence, the three officers seemed stunned to the
point of hysteria Monday each time the jury forewoman pronounced
the word ``guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruder, the first to be convicted, grabbed his neck, squinting
in disbelief, before laying his head on the shoulder of his lawyer,
Stuart London, and bursting into tears.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz sat back in shock when his verdict was read, then
glanced angrily around the courtroom, from his lawyers to his
family to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   After Wiese heard his verdict, he and Bruder met in a tearful
embrace, gripping each other's heads. Moments later, outside the
courtroom, Wiese's mother collapsed to the floor and Wiese dropped
to his knees to cradle her in his arms. ``Get a nurse!'' someone
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder paced the hallway amid a crowd of family and friends,
crying openly and calling out: ``You tell the truth and this is
what happens!''
</P>
<P>
   Andra Schwarz, Schwarz's wife, who has been working to appeal
her husband's earlier conviction, promised to fight Monday's
verdict as well. ``The prosecutors were not seeking the truth,''
she said, in a voice stony with fatigue and disbelief. ``They just
want a conviction. I'm fed up. We're not going to let them get away
with this.''
</P>
<P>
   As he was led out of the courtroom, Schwarz cursed and yelled,
``Why did they do this!'' His lawyer, Ronald Fischetti, said the
ex-officer was ``absolutely devastated.'' He added that he had
asked the authorities to place Schwarz on a 24-hour suicide watch.
</P>
<P>
   Louima was not in the courtroom when the verdict was read, but
hours later, his lawyer, Sanford Rubenstein, said: ``Today's
verdict was a further vindication for Abner Louima. I hope this
sends a message to police all over that they will be held
accountable if they obstruct justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein also said he would press forward with Louima's $155
million civil lawsuit against the three defendants, Volpe, the
city, the police department and the police union. The suit is
expected to be heard sometime later this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference outside the courthouse, Loretta E. Lynch,
the U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, praised the jury's decision, saying
it would help close a traumatic chapter in the city's history.
``There's no greater betrayal of the badge and the brotherhood than
to ensnare a fellow officer in a web of lies and deceit.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Puglissi, first vice president of the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association, called the case ``a witch-hunt by federal
prosecutors'' and said Schwarz was an innocent man and that Bruder
and Wiese had been wrongly convicted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Countless times in tones of bereavement and contempt, the union
officials and the defendants' relatives said Monday that in five
weeks of arguments the prosecution never introduced tapes of the
phone conversations or produced a witness who testified that a
cover-up plot was actually discussed at the station house meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of such concrete evidence, the jury was left with
a case of inferences: Were the defendants discussing ways of
getting their stories straight? Or were they seeking moral support
from each other and discussing his hospitalization and the chance
that they might face repercussions for having injured their
prisoner during the arrest, as the they maintained?
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Vinegrad said the jury's decision proved that
the officers were liars. He said the testimony of Schwarz, in
particular _ the only defendant to take the witness stand _ was
``incredible on its face'' and ``essentially a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Louima, one officer _ the prosecution said it was
Schwarz _ held him down as Volpe rammed the 2-foot-long segment of
the broomstick into his rectum.
</P>
<P>
   But Volpe, who is now serving 30 years in prison for the
assault, testified in the second trial in plaintive, emotional
tones that Schwarz was never in the bathroom and that he alone
tortured Louima as Wiese stood by but did nothing to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   For his own part, Schwarz said he had absolutely no knowledge of
the attack while it occurred because he was outside the station
house searching his patrol car.

EDITORIAL: PROTECTION FOR THE WETLANDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 7:
</P>
<P>
   Two successive presidents, George Bush and Bill Clinton, have
promised to stop the steady erosion of the nation's wetlands _ the
100 million or so acres of swamps, marshes and fens that help
prevent floods, filter harmful pollutants, provide habitat for
endangered species and nourish tiny organisms essential to the food
chain. They have succeeded in beating back the big threats,
including efforts by former Vice President Dan Quayle and, later,
the Contract With America Republicans to transfer millions of these
valuable acres to private interests almost overnight. But they have
been less successful in persuading the Army Corps of Engineers,
which actually regulates wetlands, to take a harder line on
developers and others who covet wetlands for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, however, the Corps announced new and stricter
regulations that will make it much harder for developers to keep
chewing up the country's wetlands in small bites. The rules would
require developers to secure a permit from the Corps for all
projects affecting a half-acre of wetlands or more, down from the
current minimum of three acres. This change could make a big
difference. Though precise figures are elusive, wetlands are
disappearing at a rate of about 70,000 to 100,000 acres a year,
many of them lost to development on small parcels. Regionally, the
rules should benefit New York City's watershed, where thousands of
acres essential to the purity of the city's water supply are
threatened by small-scale development.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules reflect steady pressure from the Clinton
administration and from the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental group that took the Corps to court. The rules also
represent the Corps' second effort to soften the impact of an
arcane but ecologically destructive rule known as Nationwide Permit
26. Until three years ago, in the interests of administrative
efficiency, Permit 26 had allowed the Corps to grant automatic
permits to construction projects that affected less than 10 acres
of wetlands. In December 1996 the Corps dropped that limit to three
acres. But even these stricter standards have allowed the
disappearance of 20,000 or more acres a year.
</P>
<P>
   Several important steps remain. Developers and contractors have
denounced the new rules, and the administration must be ready to
resist legislative attempts to overturn them.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Corps itself is under a heavy obligation to enforce
the new rules in a fair-minded but hard-nosed way. This will
require careful scrutiny of thousands of individual development
proposals that the Corps could ignore under the old rules. The
administration should make sure the Corps gets the money it needs
for these additional enforcement responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, anyone who worries about wetlands has reason to
cheer. The Corps of Engineers, which is not known for environmental
stewardship, has acted responsibly.

FRONT ROW: THE DRIVING GLOVE RIDES AGAIN; SWAG FROM EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arnold Nerenberg, a clinical psychologist, declares on his Web
site, Roadrage.com, that 28,000 Americans died in 1996 from
``aggressive driving.'' Nerenberg offers no support for this
statistic, but the fact that there is a therapist who has carved a
specialty out of the unkind things people do on an Interstate
indicates the distance Americans have come from an era when driving
was considered a leisurely good time, like playing croquet.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from the traffic in Paris last week, or any week for
that matter, navigating a Renault around the Place de la Concorde
is no less stressful than navigating a Dodge Caravan around New
York or Silicon Valley. Still, designers in Europe seemed to be
paying tribute to the genteel era of the automobile, resurrecting
the driving glove in countless variations.
</P>
<P>
   Driving gloves _ wrist-high and made of crocheted string or,
more often these days, leather _ turned up on runways in New York,
London and Milan but peaked at the collections in Paris, which
ended on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Lacroix showed orange ones for his fall 2000 show.
Alexander McQueen did variations in olive, black and white at
Givenchy. Alber Elbaz used them to toughen the more feminine looks
at his show for Yves Saint Laurent. At Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs
showed them with square, rather than traditional circular, cutouts
for the knuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Driving gloves ``remind you of people going out for a Sunday
drive, of a time when you drove for fun, not because you were going
somewhere,'' Michelle Kessler, Vogue's accessories director,
observed. ``You see someone with driving gloves and you think, `How
luxurious.'''
</P>
<P>
   Just as aviator glasses and tank watches crossed over as status
symbols from the world of flying, said Caroline Rennolds Millbank,
a fashion historian, so did driving gloves become symbols of the
good life soon after the advent of the automobile. Their original
purpose was to keep the hands clean, because the first cars
generated so much dust.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion's renewed interest in driving gloves is simply an
extension of its obsession with status symbols. Luella Bartley, the
young British designer of the moment, was among the first to show
them for fall in London a few weeks ago. She said she did so
because she wanted to ``pile luxury upon luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not certain, however, that driving gloves will be filling
store shelves this fall. At least one major retailer, who did not
wish to be named, said they have never sold well, because they
don't keep hands warm, which for most people remains the sole
purpose of gloves. Driving gloves, the retailer said, are a
``guaranteed markdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Swag From Europe
</P>
<P>
   Twice a year, as the European collections wind down in Paris,
Americans who've been on the international fashion circuit for
three weeks engage in a communal fret. In Milan, they've bought
Sergio Rossi pumps, Gucci python sandals, certainly Prada bags. In
Paris, perhaps they've bought a Jeremy Scott logoed something or
other. All in all, many have spent far more on foreign merchandise
than their $400 tax-free allowance.
</P>
<P>
   Most editors have tricks to avoid getting into the kind of
trouble that befell Columba Bush, the wife of Gov. Jeb Bush of
Florida, when she returned from Europe last year and was fined
$4,100 for failing to declare $19,000 in new clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Some editors mail home the hard evidence of their sprees, the
receipts. Others ask assistants or friends to help carry the loot
through. Most remove the tags so that, in a pinch, they can tell a
customs officer they've had those Jil Sander sweaters for years.
One editor admitted to rubbing the soles of new shoes against a
rough surface to make them look abraded and old.
</P>
<P>
   For failing to declare goods, they are all risking fines as much
as eight times the normal duty. Christine Pitz, a public affairs
officer at the Customs Service in New York, said that last year 637
people were fined for bringing in undeclared merchandise worth $4
million at Kennedy International Airport alone. They paid $418,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Schiebel, a deputy chief inspector of customs at Kennedy,
said that no one on his staff was trained to distinguish a $5,000
Hermes bag from a $200 imitation, but that they watch for travelers
on ``high profile'' flights like the Concorde or first class on Air
France and Alitalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spot these people,'' he said, alluding to possible
luxury-goods smugglers. ``They're not in dungarees. They've got
their Louis Vuitton bags.''

 &HT;    Anti-affirmative action proposal goes to court
 &HT;    By S.V. Date
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The man behind Florida's recent tumult in
race relations had his day in court Monday, with his lawyers
explaining to seven judges why the question of whether to end
affirmative action should be permitted to go to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Even as protesters arrived in Tallahassee for today's march on
the Capitol against Gov. Jeb Bush's response to California activist
Ward Connerly, Florida Supreme Court justices picked at the wording
of the ballot question, and wondered whether voters could
reasonably be expected to know that while the proposals appear to
ban discrimination, they would actually ban preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a wolf dressed up in sheep's clothing?'' asked Justice
Harry Lee Anstead.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ervin, lawyer for the Florida Civil Rights Initiative, told
the court that reverse discrimination was indeed a form of
discrimination, and that voters would know exactly what the ballot
questions are about. ``I don't think they're misled for a minute,''
Ervin said.
</P>
<P>
   With an audience that included black U.S. Reps. Alcee Hastings
(D-Miramar) and Corrine Brown (D-Jacksonville), as well as Rhea
Chiles, widow of former Gov. Lawton Chiles, Attorney General Bob
Butterworth made his first personal appearance before the high
court in his 13 years in office.
</P>
<P>
   'A GREAT EMBARRASSMENT'
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is put on the ballot, it would be a disaster, a great
embarrassment to the state,'' Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other opponents of the initiatives, modeled on those that
have already passed in California and Washington, seemed to hang
many of their legal arguments on the requirement that each ballot
question must have a clear title and ballot summary to explain to
voters exactly what each constitutional amendment would do.
</P>
<P>
   And they argued that the proposals' titles _ each starting with:
``Amendment to bar Government from Treating People Differently
Based on Race'' _ make them sound as though they end discrimination
against blacks and other minorities, when in fact they would end
the remedies created to make up for centuries of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   H.T. Smith, a lawyer who served on the recent Constitutional
Revision Commission, said that upon reading those words, ``I wanted
to rush to the ballot box and be the first to vote against
discrimination. ... That's how it's advertised. But it's false
advertisement. This is a cruel hoax.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerly's ballot initiatives would end consideration of race,
national origin, color, or ethnicity by all governments in Florida
in the areas of employment, contracting and public education. One
of the four initiatives under the court's consideration addresses
all three areas. The other three each address one area, in the
event justices conclude that wrapping up all three in one ballot
question violates the constitutional ``single-subject''
restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Harmon, Connerly's Florida director, said he hopes the
court rules in time for the group to continue gathering signatures
in time to put the questions on the November ballot. BUSH HAD HOPED
TO AVOID THIS
</P>
<P>
   It was just that possibility of a controversial voter initiative
on the same ballot as his brother's bid for United States president
that Bush had hoped to avoid when he announced his One Florida plan
last autumn that eliminates by executive decree preferences in
education, employment and contracting within the state agencies
under his control.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the political backlash to that plan now threatens to
bring exactly that kind of energized black voter turnout come
November, regardless of whether the Connerly initiatives make the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon said that if the court issues its ruling on the ballot
questions too late to realistically gather the remaining 450,000
petition signatures in time for this November, then organizers
would aim for the November 2002 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, he said contributors _ who thus far have been
predominantly the owners of white contracting firms _ have already
promised to kick in the necessary $1 million or so to pay for the
required signatures to be gathered. ``We have that in pledges,''
Harmon said.

 &HT;    Florida universities' minority enrollment booms
 &HT;    By Stephen Kiehl
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ More blacks and Hispanics applied to the
state's top colleges this year than last year, calming fears among
some educators that Gov. Jeb Bush's One Florida plan would hurt
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Florida and Florida State University used
different methods to attract minority applicants. But admissions
officials said the effect will likely be the same: more minorities
on state university campuses this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears we've been successful in attracting more
minorities,'' said a cautiously optimistic John Barnhill,
admissions director at Florida State. ``But it's a lot harder than
it ever was before.''
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of people descend on the Capitol today to protest
One Florida _ the Bush plan that ends racial preferences in college
admissions _ college officials say FSU has already proven that
race-neutral admissions can work.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, FSU saw a 41 percent increase in minority applications
this year, including a third more applications from blacks. And as
of last week's March 1 application deadline, the school had
admitted 1,034 black students, 140 more than last year. (White
applications were up 18 percent this year. And through last week,
9,142 whites had been accepted, 310 more than last year.)
</P>
<P>
   The FSU admissions numbers are important because the Tallahassee
school has been doing for the past year what One Florida requires
all other universities to do _ give up race as an admissions factor
and reach out to rural and urban students who have long been
neglected.
</P>
<P>
   FSU did this by aggressively wooing minority students with mass
mailings, phone calls and school visits and by looking at the
hometowns and family income of applicants to craft a diverse class.
FSU also increased its admissions and recruiting budget from
$200,000 to $1.2 million in five years.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Daryl Jones (D-Miami) said FSU's positive numbers
should be attributed to hard work from people like Barnhill, not to
any provisions in the Bush plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it means is that a well-meaning person can get the job
done with or without One Florida,'' said Jones, head of the
legislative black caucus. ``But for other people, there will be no
obligation'' to maintain diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The FSU method has been watched closely by other Florida
universities that will soon try to increase minority enrollment
without using affirmative action policies that have been in place
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida State is fast out of the chute in proving that you can
build a diverse class without considering race,'' said Keith
Goldschmidt, spokesman for the Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at UF hope that's true. The school saw a 15 percent
increase in applications from blacks this year _ encouraging news
but still not enough, officials say, for a university with 6.5
percent black enrollment. By contrast, 12 percent of the students
at FSU are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to step up recruiting and take a more
holistic approach to applications,'' said UF admissions director
Bill Kolb. By holistic, he means UF will look at students' essays
and other factors to help identify disadvantaged students.
</P>
<P>
   UF has formed a committee to figure out how to maintain minority
enrollment, and the school has brought in educators from other
states that have already ended affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   FSU's success offers some direction, Kolb said, but he doesn't
have the resources to duplicate FSU's personnel-intensive efforts.
FSU has a phone bank that's staffed five days a week. Admissions
officers visit every major high school in the state and keep track
of every contact they have with potential applicants.
</P>
<P>
   At Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, minority
applications are up just slightly this year. And FAU has admitted
only 199 of the 549 black students who applied. But admissions
director Dick Griffin said many more should be admitted before the
fall. The applications of 309 blacks were deferred because they
were incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the numbers will come up by the first of May,''
Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   For this year, at least, Florida's colleges seem to have avoided
the drop in minority enrollment that has accompanied affirmative
action debates in other states. At the University of Virginia, for
example, the number of black applicants fell 25 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Florida admissions officials are desperate to avoid such a drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we were quite ready to do away with race this
year,'' FSU's Barnhill said. ``But if we had to do it without
recruiting, it would have been impossible.''

EDITORIAL: VOTERS, READ THE BALLOT CAREFULLY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 7,
2000:
</P>
<P>
   For all the excitement about how New Yorkers finally have a
chance to help pick this year's presidential nominees, the act of
voting in Tuesday's primary may prove confusing to many citizens.
The names in big print on the Republican ballot will be candidates
to be delegates to the party's national convention. Voters will
have to look hard to see that tucked under each delegate's name is
the name of the presidential candidate the delegate is pledged to
support at this summer's nominating convention. To know whether
they are voting for Gov. George W. Bush or Sen. John McCain, New
Yorkers, like anybody else worried about being sold a bill of
goods, will have to read the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   This ballot arrangement favors Bush, the candidate of the state
Republican establishment, because his delegate candidates are
better known than McCain's. The ballots, which are slightly
different in each county, are far easier for Democrats who simply
want to vote for either former Sen. Bill Bradley or Vice President
Al Gore. Their names come first, and the votes they receive
determine the number of convention delegates pledged to them.
</P>
<P>
   Voters interested in a simpler ballot or other reforms should
voice their sentiments to Gov. George Pataki and the state
Legislature, including the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno,
and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. The Legislature should change
more than the format of the ballot. It must also rewrite the ballot
access laws, not merely for presidential candidates but for other
elections as well. In a few months the byzantine petitioning
process that makes it unreasonably difficult for candidates like
Steve Forbes or McCain will begin again, this time for candidates
in state races.
</P>
<P>
   New York has gained the reputation as a state that works hard to
make voting difficult. Future New Yorkers should have plenty of
choices, and they should not need a magnifying glass to choose
their favorite candidate.

FIRE DESTROYS SHOPS IN HISTORIC MYSTIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MYSTIC, Conn. _ A fire destroyed a half-block stretch of shops
early Monday morning in this historic maritime center, leaving a
charred wreck in the center of Connecticut's most popular tourist
destination. It was the fourth time since 1863 that fire has struck
the same building on West Main Street, just steps from Mystic's
famous drawbridge.
</P>
<P>
   The building's eight storefront businesses were destroyed in the
blaze, which began shortly after 12:30 a.m. and smoldered almost
until dawn. The structural damage to the wood-frame building is so
severe, officials said, that it will have to be condemned, which
will leave a wide vacant lot at the core of a downtown commercial
district that draws some 2 million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hole right in the heart of downtown Mystic,'' said
Linnea Lindstrom, executive director of the Mystic Chamber of
Commerce, which has called an emergency meeting on Wednesday night
to help relocate the ruined businesses. ``It's had quite an
emotional impact. These stores have a lot of memories for a lot of
people. The store owners are our neighbors and our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The building, built on pylons over the Mystic River, has always
been at the center of town life. For much of the 19th century, it
was filled with stores, offices and a large public meeting space
where traveling performers like Tom Thumb and speakers like
Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison came to find an
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The rear of the wrecked building overlooks historic Mystic
Seaport and its collection of tall ships, schooners and whaling
boats. The building is three blocks east of Mystic Pizza, which
became famous by lending its name to the 1988 movie featuring Julia
Roberts. Firefighters were able to stop the fire from spreading to
adjacent buildings, and no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The ruined stores, at 10-22 W. Main St., were exactly the type
of quirky, independent shops that tourists enjoy poking around on
summer afternoons, including Trade Winds, a gallery of antique maps
and nautical prints; Dexter's handcrafted jewelry and pewterware;
Radio Waves vintage music, and Pepper Grass &AMP; Tulip, which sold
crafts and antiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm unemployed for the first time in my life,'' said Tom
Dexter, whose jewelry shop had been in the building for 22 years.
``It's a disheartening feeling,'' he said, adding that he hoped to
find temporary space and rebuild within six months.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the business owners were away on vacation, residents
said, taking a last break before spring and the onset of the heavy
tourist season. Gov. John G. Rowland toured the fire scene Monday
afternoon and promised that the state would assist in rebuilding.
The owners of the building, Rufus Allyn and Roy N. Bohlander, did
not have casualty insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Allyn, whose family has owned the building for generations, said
he could not estimate its worth. But Celeste and Judi Caracausa,
sisters who run a real estate agency specializing in commercial
properties, said the building could have sold for $1.2 million to
$1.5 million. ``This part of downtown is like a little jewel,''
Judi Caracausa said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said it was too soon to calculate the loss to
each of the eight businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Few people in town were optimistic that a new building could be
constructed in time for this year's high season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mystic fire chief, Fitz Hilbert, said an alarm was first
received at 12:38 a.m. By the time firefighters reached the scene
minutes later, he said, flames had already raced through a loft
that ran the length of the wood-frame building, above all eight
stores. Firefighters immediately set about breaking through the
roof to let the flames escape, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 firefighters from at least a half-dozen
surrounding towns joined in helping to suppress the blaze, Hilbert
said, and it was extinguished about 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Hilbert said that officials had not pinpointed a precise cause,
but that the fire did not appear to be suspicious.

KANSAS LOSES LAWSUIT TO PREVENT CASINO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge in Topeka has dismissed a lawsuit filed by
Kansas that sought to block the Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma from
building a casino in Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   Don Brown, a spokesman for Gov. Bill Graves, said Monday that
Kansas would appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our initial legal action was based on a desire to get some
clarity on these issues,'' Brown said. ``This decision leaves a lot
of questions unanswered.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Leaford Bearskin was buoyed by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the case,'' he said in a telephone interview from
tribal offices near Wyandotte, Okla. ``I don't think there's any
doubt about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we're not held up any longer. We've been waiting a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling made public Monday, Judge Richard D. Rogers
exposed a Catch-22 facing Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he was forced to dismiss the case because the tribe
was not a party to the legal action and the tribe did not waive its
sovereign immunity to be brought into the suit as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Kansas and its four indigenous tribes that operate
casinos sued the U.S. Department of the Interior and other federal
agencies over Interior's decision that year that set the stage for
tribal gambling in Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt agreed to hold in trust for the
tribe the Shriner building in downtown Kansas City, Kan. It sits
adjacent to the tribe's historic Huron Indian Cemetery, which is
across the street from City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Trust status for the Shriner building could enable the tribe to
conduct legalized gambling activities at the site under terms of a
1988 federal law that governs reservation casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas sued to obtain a judicial determination whether Interior
was correct in designating the ``reservation'' cemetery and its
adjacent Shriner site as legal trust land eligible for gambling
activities.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogers found that the tribe and its economic interests were
essential parties to the action, but because the tribe will not
consent to be sued, the case must be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The judge admitted that his decision resolves nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court acknowledges that this holding leaves undecided the
Huron Cemetery issue, which could be critical to the underlying
dispute ... whether there is casino-style gambling on the Shriner
(land),'' Rogers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the tribe is barred by a 1997 federal law that
prohibits it from using the cemetery grounds for gambling. That law
was passed in response to the tribe's plans at the time for a
casino on pillars that would occupy air space over the half-acre
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Another bill is pending before Congress that would allow the
tribe to buy land anywhere else in Wyandotte County for a casino,
as compensation for taking the cemetery land rights away from the
tribe.
</P>
<P>
   That measure, sponsored by Johnson County Democrat Rep. Dennis
Moore, was approved by a House committee last summer and awaits
floor debate. It instructs Babbitt to take into trust for gambling
purposes whatever land the tribe buys in Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   Bearskin said Monday that the tribe's preference was to strike a
deal with The Woodlands to add a casino to the greyhound and horse
racing complex in western Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   Woodlands owners have said they are willing to sell the track to
the tribe and then lease back parts of it to continue racing while
the tribe developed its casino elsewhere on the property.

KC'S ZOO AIDS IN FIRST BIRTH OF AFRICAN ELEPHANT FROM ARTIFICIAL
INSEMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City shares partnership in the world's
first successful birth of an African elephant from artificial
insemination.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy 201-pound female calf was born Monday to a 24-year-old
elephant at the Indianapolis Zoo that had been impregnated with
sperm collected from a bull elephant at the Kansas City Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Staff at both zoos were elated by the pioneering success with
the endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that we can do it,'' said Conrad Schmitt, Kansas
City Zoo curator. ``Hopefully, in the long term this will help with
genetic management, not only in the United States but globally.''
</P>
<P>
   The birth follows the first from artificial insemination of an
Asian elephant at the Springfield zoo in November. Monday's birth
was the result of efforts by zoo staffs at Springfield, Kansas
City, Omaha, Neb., and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has been collecting semen from Dale, a 22-year-old
bull, since 1996. Chilled samples were flown to Indianapolis and
implanted in the female, named Kubwa. It was her first baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a wonderful mom, and so calm,'' said Judy Gagen,
spokeswoman for the Indianapolis Zoo. ``We're so pleased. It's a
wonderful day to have a baby elephant. She is just delightful.''
</P>
<P>
   The baby, as yet unnamed, will remain at the Indianapolis Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials knew from ultrasound tests as early as July 1998 that
Kubwa was pregnant. Elephant gestation takes 22 months. The mother
was in hard labor for about an hour before giving birth at 4:30
a.m. Monday. They baby was on her feet within 20 minutes and was
nursing by 1:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Zoo is among relatively few that have facilities
to handle bull elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are hoping to mate Dale with the six females here, but
programs with other zoos also are important to keep the gene pool
healthy. Artificial insemination makes that simpler because it is
easier to move a bull elephant's sperm around the country than the
actual elephant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things this zoo is striving for, to conserve
species and to be at the top of the game,'' said Kansas City Zoo
veterinarian Kirk Suedmeyer.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinary staff at the Omaha Zoo are working on ways to freeze
elephant semen for longer storage. That could prove useful in the
wild, by enabling genetic diversity among isolated elephant groups
across Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both African and Asian elephants have seen huge drops in their
populations in the wild and reproduction in captivity has been
very, very difficult,'' said Kansas City Zoo Director Mark Wourms.
</P>
<P>
   ``So every time we develop a new technique or solve another
piece of the puzzle, it may mean we're going to be able to keep
this species on Earth that much longer.''

HONORED ROCKERS FIND COMFORT IN THE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rock's softer side was celebrated at the 15th annual
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony Monday night at the Grand
Ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria, as the hall this year recognized
performers whose music is comforting, not confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   The hall's new additions included Eric Clapton, who has already
been named twice to the hall as a member of the Yardbirds and
Cream, and Bonnie Raitt. Both apprenticed in the blues, then moved
toward rock and pop. Also inducted were the positive-thinking 1970s
soul group Earth Wind and Fire; the Lovin' Spoonful, who brought an
amiable, jug-band sensibility to 1960s pop; the mild-voiced
songwriter James Taylor, and the Moonglows, who whispered their
doo-wop harmonies in songs including ``Ten Commandments of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The cool thing about getting this award,'' Raitt said in an
interview, ``is that you could go tomorrow and you've done
everything you have to do. It's from my peers, and I'm getting
respect from them, so in a way I don't have to prove myself
anymore. But actually, at every show on tour I feel like I have to
prove myself, to make sure that I'm even badder than I was last
year. If anything I feel more and more like a pit bull, grabbing
somebody's leg and not letting go.''
</P>
<P>
   Highlights from the ceremony are to be shown on the cable
network VH1 on Wednesday at 9 p.m. and simulcast on the Westwood
One radio network, including Q104 in New York City. The event, with
performances by the hall members and a closing jam session, has
grown more controlled than it was in its early years, with
teleprompters now being used. But the induction has resisted
becoming a standard awards show, as presenters write or improvise
their own speeches. The hall even turned down VH1's suggestion to
use a celebrity host.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the hall added a new category to recognize the backup
musicians who were the backbone of many indelible hits. The first
group of sidemen to join the hall, selected by a committee of 50
producers, includes King Curtis, the archetypal soul-music
saxophonist; Scotty Moore, who put the guitar twang behind Elvis
Presley; Hal Blaine, the drummer on hundreds of hits recorded in
Los Angeles, including ``Be My Baby,'' ``Mr.Tambourine Man,''
``Good Vibrations'' and ``California Dreamin''; Earl Palmer, the
New Orleans drummer behind Fats Domino and Little Richard, and
James Jamerson, the bassist throughout Motown's glory years in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``With James, you did not have to know music,'' said Harvey
Fuqua of the Moonglows, who went on to groom younger stars as
Motown's director of artist development during the 1960s. ``You
could say, hmm, hmm, hmm, and he got it going. And if you came in
with something funny, James Jamerson would make it right.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, musicians paid tribute to their elders. ``I may be
young, but I grooved to Earth Wind and Fire,'' said the rapper Lil'
Kim, adding that the band's greatest-hits album was ``the
soundtrack to more good parties than any one of us can ever
remember.'' The band's nine original members were on stage together
for the first time in 20 years. Maurice White, the band's founder,
stopped touring with the band in 1995; he recently revealed that he
has been suffering from Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Simon praised the Moonglows' 1954 hit ``Sincerely'' as
``perfect,'' adding that it included ``a riff I've stolen on many
occasions.'' The Moonglows' hits came from rock's primordial era
when, Fuqua recalled, singers and musicians performed with a single
microphone. ``If you were too loud, back up,'' he said. ``If you
were too soft, come closer. When you were finished, you had what
you had.'' He said that for ``Sincerely,'' the drummer was tapping
a telephone book to play quietly enough.
</P>
<P>
   A voting body of 1,000 musicians, executives and history-minded
observers chooses the hall's members, who become eligible 25 years
after the release of their first recording. Clive Davis, the
president of Arista Records, followed up his Grammy award this year
for producing Santana's album ``Supernatural'' by joining the hall
in its nonperformer category. The crooner Nat King Cole and the
jazz singer Billie Holiday were inducted as early influences.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in
Cleveland, most of the annual induction ceremonies have been held
in New York City, the home of music-business executives whose
companies can pay $1,500 to $2,500 per seat. The induction has also
been held in Los Angeles, another music-business capital, and once
in Cleveland. A future ceremony may be held in London in a year
when British rockers are inducted, said Suzan Evans, the hall's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the hall of fame followed the lead of the
Rhythm-and-Blues Foundation and the National Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences, which gives the Grammy Awards, by starting a
program for needy musicians. It has earmarked $100,000 for members
of the hall who need help with medical bills or living expenses,
and it hopes to expand the program in future years.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, the museum is working on plans to expand its
scholarly side by building a library and research archive, and is
also considering adding a restaurant. It has been drawing about
500,000 visitors a year.

   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   SHARP WORDS Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York said Monday that
Vice President Al Gore, former Sen. Bill Bradley and Hillary Rodham
Clinton ``seem to be reading from a script'' written by the Rev. Al
Sharpton, and he criticized them for giving Sharpton ``a great deal
of prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday at Riverside Church in New York, Clinton, the mayor's
opponent for U.S. Senate, invoked Amadou Diallo, an African
immigrant who was shot to death by four police officers, to attack
``the leadership in this city'' for its isolation from black
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in the Democratic presidential debate in Harlem,
Gore and Bradley said Diallo's death was evidence of racial
insensitivity in police departments. Sharpton asked the first
question in that debate.
</P>
<P>
   SEGRETTI IS BACK One of Sen. John McCain's hardest-working
volunteers, a man who says McCain's character is needed to clean up
government, is Donald H. Segretti, who went to prison for dirty
tricks in Richard Nixon's 1972 campaign. Segretti, 58, who
practices corporate law in Costa Mesa, Calif., said he had done a
variety of campaign chores. He said he had met McCain but did not
really know him. ``After all the bruises and pain I had, I thought
John McCain was a breath of fresh air,'' he said in an interview.
``We're frankly lucky to get someone of his integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   THE WORD IN UTAH As one of the most heavily Republican states in
the country, Utah has been virtually ignored by all the
presidential candidates. But at least one Republican contender,
Alan Keyes, is planning a campaign visit on Wednesday, two days
before the Utah primary. His presence is not expected to have much
of an impact. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas remains a heavy
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   THE POLLS
</P>
<P>
   3-WAY POLL Sen. John McCain would draw 24 percent of the vote if
he were running for president now against Gov. George W. Bush as
the Republican nominee and Vice President Al Gore as the Democrat,
according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. In such a race, which
McCain has said he will not make if he fails to win the Republican
nomination, Bush got 34 percent in the poll and Gore 33 percent.
The poll, conducted Thursday to Sunday by Hart/Teeter among 1,213
respondents, has a margin of error of plus or minus three
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   THE WEST
</P>
<P>
   HEAT'S ON AGAIN A major scandal has made high visibility a mixed
blessing for District Attorney Gil Garcetti of Los Angeles, just as
it did when he ran for office four years ago. Then it was the O.J.
Simpson murder trial. This year it is a police corruption scandal.
Even Garcetti's staff expect him to get less than 40 percent of the
vote in his re-election bid Tuesday, far short of the majority he
needs to avoid a runoff in November.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   NO COMPETITION Incumbency's rewards were evident this week in
Alabama, where there may be only one contested state race in the
June 6 primary. With only a month left before the filing deadline,
none of the state's seven congressmen are facing primary
challengers, and there may be no primary races for appellate judges
and state education board members. The only contested race so far
is for the Republican nomination for state chief justice, which has
drawn three judges, including Roy Moore, who became well known for
displaying the Ten Commandments in his courtroom in defiance of a
court order.

ELK HERD DODGES RELOCATION _ FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KRISTIN DIZON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANFORD, Wash. _ A battle of wills unfolded between a herd of
animals and a cowboy in a whirlybird Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story: Herding elk is like trying to lasso the
wind.
</P>
<P>
   The largest relocation of elk in Washington history was supposed
to get underway with 50 head herded by helicopter into a holding
pen here. The elk were then to be moved by trailer four hours east
to the Blue and Selkirk mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded simple, but in the crisp dawn hours on the dry,
shrubby steppes just across the road from the nation's largest
nuclear cleanup site, untamed nature took over.
</P>
<P>
   The elk, you see, failed to read the relocation plan.
</P>
<P>
   Chopper pilot Gary Brennan started the round-up in the
Rattlesnake hills, where crescent-shaped fingers of snow nestle in
the crevasses of the taupe and dun-colored mounds. Brennan pushed
several groups of animals together in a moving column of nearly 100
elk.
</P>
<P>
   He drove them three miles, then turned them toward a V-shaped
fence _ a funnel to ease them into a corral. But just when it
looked like the wildlife would run into the snare, they turned tail
and the cat-and-mouse pursuit started over again.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth they went, with Brennan giving chase and
directing them back toward the trap. A few jumped right through the
burlap-covered wire fence; others dashed into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the whirring roar of helicopter blades at their hind
quarters did the trick. At one point Brennan, who skillfully zipped
and dove and looped toward the herd during the three-house chase,
came so close that he said he had to pull up to avoid grazing them
with the helicopter's landing skids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like putting a cat in a bucket of water _ they just don't
want to go,'' said Brennan, of Grey Bull, Wyo. ``I know how to push
these animals and when to give them a break and get their heart
rates down.''
</P>
<P>
   A second, shorter attempt in the afternoon with another group of
elk yielded even worse results. One cow was trampled in the frenzy
and had to be destroyed. The carcass was taken to the Yakama
Indians, who skinned and cleaned it immediately, said Dale
Bambrick, regional director of the Washington Department of Fish
and Wildlife. Officials had expected a mortality rate of as high as
five percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The combined effort of the federal and state Fish and Wildlife
departments, along with volunteer help and tribal input, was
designed to move about 200 Rocky Mountain elk from the Hanford
site's 77,000-acre Arid Lands Ecology reserve. The
trap-and-transfer project is expected to cost about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, wildlife officials hope to move the
animals from their windswept, sagebrush habitat to thickly
forested, snowy mountains. About 100 are headed to the Selkirk
mountains in Pend Oreille County; another 100 will go to the
southeastern corner of the state.
</P>
<P>
   A total of about 500 elk will be relocated in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The herd was first established in 1975, when eight elk began
frequenting the unpolluted buffer area of the Hanford nuclear
complex. Today the herd, which cannot be hunted on the preserve,
numbers more than 800, and experts fear that such a continued
growth rate will overtax the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers and ranchers in the area have long complained about
grazing damage to crops, grassland and fences, resulting in a
number of financial claims that the state is processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it grows, if we did nothing, this site could be on the
verge of ecological collapse,'' said Bambrick. ``Look how much
trouble we had with them today. Imagine we're three years down the
road and there are 2,200 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten percent of the relocated elk will be fitted with radio
collars and tracked to see if they're adapting well to their new
locales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both places are good locations to put elk, but, frankly, it's
an experiment,'' said Madonna Luers, a spokesperson at state Fish
and Wildlife's Spokane office.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty elk were relocated in a test run last week. They appear
to be doing fine and are mingling with the local elk population,
Luers said. But those elk were more easily rounded up with net
guns, which is more expensive, labor-intensive and dangerous than
herding with helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Two elk died last week when their necks snapped while struggling
in the nets. The carcasses were picked up by the nearby Wanapum
Indians, who fed a crowd of 150 at a feast last weekend, said
Clayton Buck, a cultural resources specialist with the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Those 20 elk were tested for radioactive compounds and found to
have lower concentrations of radiation then elk at higher
altitudes, said Kathy Criddle with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. They also were disease-free.
</P>
<P>
   No one was sure why Monday's roundup went wrong. One theory was
that the elk smelled humans and were spooked, another held that the
elk didn't like the 12-foot high fence or thought the entryway into
a walled corral was too small.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, everyone agreed that elk are a sharp bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah. They're pretty smart. You better believe it,'' said
Spike Norton, who volunteered his stock trailer to move the elk to
an area near Usk, where he has a ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Norton, who drove 11 of the test elk to their new home last
week, said people in Pend Oreille County are excited about the
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for elk to view up there is pretty heavy,'' he
said. ``We hope that when those hunters get through with them,
there's something left for us to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, about 50 Fish and Wildlife employees,
volunteers and media made up a herd of its own on a ridge
overlooking the round-up site.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the crowd bet on who would run out of gas first _ the
pilot or the herd. One man remarked, ``We've got the best pilot on
Earth, by God. If he can't get them ... ''
</P>
<P>
   But officials are counseling patience. They widened the corral
gateway late in the afternoon and made other adjustments to the
trap. They'll try again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everything happens the minute you want it to,'' Bambrick
said. ``We're going to re-group and come back.''

THOUSANDS TO CONVERGE ON KC FOR AUTO SHOW, BIG 12 BASKETBALL
TOURNEYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Downtown is going to be a wee bit crowded this week.
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 college basketball fans, auto lovers and thousands of
others will converge in the downtown loop from morning till night
in what has become Kansas City's version of March Madness _ filling
every hotel room and parking spot in sight.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the gridlock, networks of shuttle buses _ some free _
will be plying city streets moving masses at the Country Club
Plaza, the River Market and points between.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great week,'' said Rob Sight, president of the Greater
Kansas City Auto Show. On Wednesday, the auto show at Bartle Hall
kicks off its third consecutive year as a concurrent event with the
Big 12 men's and women's basketball tournaments, with women's games
next door at Municipal Auditorium and men's games at Kemper Arena.
</P>
<P>
   More than 225,000 visitors are expected to troop through Bartle
Hall through Sunday during the auto show's annual five-day run that
features 500 vehicles under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them will be among the nearly 30,000 fans, locals and
out-of-towners alike with tickets for the Big 12 games that start
at noon today and run through Sunday afternoon. Almost half of them
are from out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Music Hall will hold performances by the Kansas
City Symphony on Friday and Saturday; the Quality Hill Playhouse
has daily performances of its new musical, ``Hi Hat Hattie,''
through Sunday; and tonight's Fat Tuesday ``Mardi Gras Blues Club
Crawl'' is expected to draw its own crowd of revelers.
</P>
<P>
   If all of that isn't enough, more than 1,000 conventioneers
begin arriving at downtown hotels starting today through early next
week for annual meetings of the American Concrete Paving
Association and the Salvation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Kansas City Convention and Visitors Bureau estimates
that the basketball crowd alone will leave $20 million behind when
the last of the fans leaves town late Sunday afternoon, said bureau
spokeswoman Maxine Odell.
</P>
<P>
   While most auto show attendees are local residents or basketball
fans killing time between games, Sight said the event also
attracted day trippers from around the Midwest plus hundreds of
manufacturer's representatives and other behind-the-scenes workers
who fill hotel rooms during the run of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really brings a lot of people into the city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them will have trouble finding a place to park anywhere
close to the action.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the crunch, the Downtown Council will run free shuttle
bus service about every five minutes along a route linking several
downtown parking lots to Bartle Hall and Municipal Auditorium on
Thursday afternoon from 3:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. and Saturday from 11
a.m. to 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There are no women's games Friday. Sight says the Auto Show
attracts the bulk of its visitors Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the downtown loop and beyond, specially marked
``Shuttle'' Metro buses will pick up riders at many regular city
bus stops for $1 one-way fares to both game sites.
</P>
<P>
   The buses will run from approximately one hour before the day's
first games to the final buzzer of the day's last game. Shuttles
will also be marked with windshield placards that declare either a
``Municipal'' or ``Kemper'' destination.
</P>
<P>

GROWERS AND WORKER ADVOCATES CLASH OVER MIGRANT LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ore.)  (lb) 
 By CARL HULSE   NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing new high-tech scrutiny from government
authorities, the United States' agricultural employers are
clamoring for changes in federal law governing how they hire
workers to harvest fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Growers say stepped-up electronic verification of the Social
Security numbers provided by migrants has revealed the extent of
the illegal work force, put farmers at risk of fines and criminal
charges, and sent workers packing during the picking season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to your workers and tell them there is a problem with
their numbers, and the next day you have no workers,'' said Sharon
Hughes, executive vice president of the National Council of
Agricultural Employers. ``We want to have a secure, stable, legal
work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers across the country have received letters from the
Social Security Administration informing them of a high percentage
of mismatches between the names and the numbers they provided.
Financial penalties can be imposed for such irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, employers fear that an employment eligibility
verification system being tested by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service will eventually be put in place nationwide,
requiring them to quickly check worker documents against an
electronic database. Illegal workers would have to be rejected or
growers could face charges for knowingly hiring them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that a very large number of illegal
people are picking fruits and vegetables in the United States, and
an aggressive, higher-technology enforcement regime is going to
find them out,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla. He is the chief
sponsor of a controversial measure to revamp the migrant-worker
program.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., proposed an approach that
would enable current undocumented farm workers to earn U.S.
residency in exchange for allowing farmers to more easily tap
foreign labor sources if they cannot find enough legal workers. The
measure would also institute wage and housing guarantees and create
a job registry to match workers with openings.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and farm-worker advocates, however,
say the bill is not needed and is simply a maneuver to provide
agricultural employers with a new crop of easily exploited foreign
workers. More than 180 interest and advocacy groups have sent a
letter opposing it to every member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growers want this because it would give them tremendous
power and control over guest workers,'' said Bruce Goldstein of the
Farmworker Justice Fund.
</P>
<P>
   He and others say farmers' claims of a labor shortage are
unfounded. They point to the fact that demand for workers is not
forcing wages and benefits to rise. Unemployment in some large
agricultural areas is up. In Florida a group of farm workers
recently marched across part of the state to protest working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in the middle of the Florida harvest and there are
certainly lots of unemployed farm workers,'' said Greg Schell,
managing attorney for the Migrant Justice Project in the
agricultural community of Belle Glade, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Congressional Research Service report also disputes the
notion of a labor shortage. ``At the present time, trends in the
farm labor market generally do not suggest the existence of a
nationwide shortage of domestically available farm workers in part
because the government's databases cover legal and illegal
employment,'' said the study issued in December.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that the prevalence of illegal workers gives a
skewed picture of the farm labor market. An ongoing U.S. Department
of Agriculture survey found that more than 50 percent of migrants
interviewed identified themselves as undocumented. Social Security
audits have found farms where 80 percent of the numbers given are
invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that illegal migrants willing to take less in
wages force legal workers to the unemployment line and put farmers
at risk of getting in trouble with the federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier version of Graham's measure twice passed the Senate
but never made it to the White House, where it was threatened with
a veto. To broaden support this year, backers added an opportunity
for illegal workers to become legal.
</P>
<P>
   First, they must show they worked in agriculture 150 days in the
past year. Then if they work at least 180 days annually in
agriculture in five of the next seven years, they could become
permanent residents. In the interim, they could only remain in the
United States for 10 months of each year.
</P>
<P>
   A House version is expected to be introduced soon, and Graham
said a hearing is being scheduled on the proposal in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Farm-worker advocates expect few people to have the evidence to
qualify. ``We don't view it as a realistic amnesty for most
folks,'' Schell said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rick Swartz, an immigration-policy expert who helped craft the
amnesty proposal, said the farm-worker advocacy community is being
shortsighted in fighting the plan. He attributed the opposition to
historic, deep-seated animosity toward growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk to the farm workers about it, they think it is a
ticket to freedom,'' said Swartz.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he is willing to adjust his proposal to answer
critics. But he is frustrated by continued opposition to a measure
that he believes would improve conditions for both legal and
illegal migrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill gives higher wages, better benefits, and it gives to
this large group some legal status and position of respect in our
society,'' he said. ``I am just kind of bewildered as to what the
concerns are.''

SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN STATE'S TANKER RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Monday struck down the tough oil-spill
prevention rules enacted by Washington state after the 1989 Exxon
Valdez disaster in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision has wide import for environmental
protection and states' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said federal laws pre-empt states from setting
their own standards to prevent oil spills from tankers _ except to
address ``peculiar'' conditions in local waterways, the justices
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Washington has enacted legislation in an area
where the federal interest has been manifest since the beginning of
our republic and is now well established,'' Justice Anthony Kennedy
wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The decision reversed a unanimous 1998 Ninth U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals ruling that said states can enforce their own laws. That
ruling upheld an earlier U.S. District Court decision.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's rules, designed to prevent an Exxon Valdez-type
disaster in the state, required additional crew training, a higher
standard of English-language proficiency for crewmembers, increased
navigation-watch requirements and accident reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, siding with the Clinton administration and the oil
shipping industry, said such state rules venture into the field of
foreign affairs, affecting operations outside state waters.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping industry lawyers argued that state rules would upset
international treaties, which require uniform national standards.
</P>
<P>
   In light of ``considerable federal interest at stake,'' the
justices Monday ordered a lower court to decide whether other
federal law pre-empts state rules.
</P>
<P>
   The decision drew immediate fire from Washington Gov. Gary Locke
and state Attorney General Christine Gregoire.
</P>
<P>
   Locke called the ruling ``a major set-back for states that want
to take prudent steps to prevent oil-spill catastrophes. ...
Oil-spill protection for the entire nation will be set at the
lowest-common-denominator, with no recognition that some marine
habitats deserve a higher level of protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also promised to ``press Congress and the (Clinton)
administration to move quickly to compensate for the greater safety
protections state regulation would have offered by substantially
increasing Coast Guard funding and efforts to ensure safe
shipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire called the decision a ``terrible blow to Washington's
Puget Sound protection efforts,'' and requested the Coast Guard
immediately strengthen tanker regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's decision has tied the state's hands from ensuring
tankers will safely transit Washington waters and that there will
be full and adequate protection for Puget Sound,'' Gregoire said.
``We know better than those in Washington, D.C., how to protect
this natural resource gem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this exposes our coastline to more danger,'' added
Bill Collins, a state assistant attorney general who handled the
case since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one states and territories, seven Washington counties,
several fishing groups and environmental organizations nationwide,
as well as a citizens' group from Alaska's Prince William Sound,
filed legal briefs supporting Washington's case.
</P>
<P>
   The tanker industry and the federal government were supported by
15 foreign governments and a variety of shipping and business
groups. Those groups are largely concerned with preventing their
members from having to comply with different regulations in
different states, which they said would be confusing and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, deeply,'' said Fred Felleman, whose
environmental organization, Ocean Advocates, long has supported
permanently stationing a rescue tug for tankers in the Strait of
Juan de Fuca. ``Our waterway is both one of the most traffic laden
and one of the most biologically rich, which the Coast Guard alone
is not equipped to take account of.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the International Association of Independent
Tanker Owners, known as Intertanko, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the state's 1991 regulations were aimed at
minimizing human error in the relatively narrow Straits of Juan de
Fuca and Puget Sound. Human error is accountable for 60 percent to
80 percent of all oil spills, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old court state case that the Supreme Court justices
spent a good deal of time analyzing, Ray v. Atlantic Richfield, was
aimed at minimizing mechanical and technical hazards in tankers
that could lead to oil spills. It led to double-hulled tankers and
tug escorts for them in Washington waters. Washington's late U.S.
Sen. Warren Magnusson, meanwhile, succeeded in getting Congress to
ban supertankers from the Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Tanker industry lawyers argued that the state's rules are
already covered under the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, enacted by
Congress a year after the Exxon Valdez drove onto a charted reef
and dumped 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Washington state adopted additional standards for
training, language, staffing and drug-testing of oil tanker crews.
</P>
<P>
   The state's rules require tanker operators to file
spill-prevention plans and to have three licensed officers on the
bridge _ one more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Intertanko complained in federal court that state's
rules were inconsistent with uniform industry standards that took
20 years to create.
</P>
<P>
   Intertanko, a Norway-based organization representing 75 percent
of the world's tanker companies, lost in U.S. District Court. The
Clinton administration intervened on the organization's behalf in
the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   During arguments before the Supreme Court in December, some
justices expressed consternation at the appeals court's reasoning.
Others, particularly Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, expressed concern about whether federal
regulators could adequately address the peculiarities of local
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist referred to a ``very strong local interest'' in a
requirement such as ``in heavy fog in Seattle harbor, you have to
have a tug. I, for one, would be loath to read some general federal
statute as pre-empting something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the state's legal brief, the waters of Washington
state are more difficult to navigate than those in Prince William
Sound because of persistent fog, heavy fishing traffic and narrow
waterways. State officials argue that an oil spill could be
devastating to fish and wildlife and to the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Monday noted that issue and left the state
with some wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said states can regulate their own ports and waterways
so long as the rules are based on ``the peculiarities of local
waters'' and do not conflict with federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``On remand, Washington may argue that certain of its
regulations, such as its watch requirement in times of restricted
visibility ... are necessary to address the peculiarities of Puget
Sound,'' Kennedy wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The state also has a role in setting regulations where they do
not conflict with the Coast Guard, which is responsible for design,
maintenance, staffing and operation of tankers, Kennedy noted.
</P>
<P>
   And federal law allows states to set their own liability rules
for oil-spill pollution, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   For Locke, that at least left open some state control over its
own environmental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court admitted that the federal standards may not
provide the necessary level of protection _ and we absolutely
agree,'' Locke said.

EDITORIAL: A CASH-STARVED PEACE IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, March 7:
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, the chief U.N. administrator in Kosovo, has a
hard enough job trying to contain ethnic hatreds, establish the
rule of law and provide for the medical, educational and material
needs of a war-battered population. He should not have to beg
European nations to come up with the money they promised for these
purposes or to send the international police officers that are
urgently needed to restrain ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
   After the United Nations took responsibility for running Kosovo
last summer, the European Union agreed to contribute much of the
reconstruction costs, including a major share of the money for
basic government services. Europe has financed traditional projects
like the repair of power grids. But it has been slow to send the
$45 million it pledged for the day-to-day running of the Kosovo
administration.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Kouchner began the year with insufficient funds for
everything from doctors, teachers and local police to garbage
collectors, water and gas workers and road repair crews. For now he
is maintaining minimal services using contributions from other
nations, including the United States, and from new fees and taxes
gradually being assessed in Kosovo itself. The European Union says
the money is now on the way, but it should have been provided
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo also urgently needs more international police officers to
keep situations like the confrontation between ethnic Albanians and
Serbs in the town of Mitrovica from spreading. Kouchner rightly
sought as many as 6,000 police from contributing nations. But only
4,800 were approved and just 2,300 have arrived so far, forcing
NATO troops into police work for which they are poorly suited and
trained. Ironically, one of the most conspicuous laggards in
providing these police officers is France, the country whose troops
have been most deeply involved in the Mitrovica strife.
</P>
<P>
   More international judges and prosecutors are also needed,
because local magistrates have proved vulnerable to political
pressure and intimidation and have inappropriately released
suspected initiators of ethnic violence. The West can be proud of
its role in ending terror and mass expulsions from Kosovo. But it
cannot yet be satisfied with its efforts to help build a
functional, law-abiding society there.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the local alternative rock station listed the 300 top songs
of the millennium in December, Adam Campbell, a freshman at the
University of Oregon, decided it would be nice to own the entire
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, using the fast Internet connection in his dorm
room and a new online service called Napster, Campbell had
retrieved 275 of the tunes _free. They sit nestled on his computer
hard drive along with 800 or so other songs he has accumulated the
same way. ``That's three days of continuous music,'' he notes with
pride.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry is already disturbed about how easy it is to
copy music via the Internet without paying for it. But in recent
months Napster has greatly magnified the threat. Acting like a
music search engine, the software makes it easier to find and copy
a far wider array of music. It also makes it easier for individuals
to offer their own music collections to others.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, created last year by a 19-year-old college dropout, has
spread so quickly among college students, traditionally the most
avid consumers of recorded music, that the resulting glut of
digital traffic has overloaded university networks. Dozens of
schools, including New York University and the University of
California at Berkeley, have banned students from using the service
_ not because of copyright issues but to protect their networks.
</P>
<P>
   But Napster is by no means just a college fad. Every day, about
a million otherwise law-abiding adult citizens are demonstrating no
compunction about using the service to get free what they would
have to pay for in a record store. And their numbers are growing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Recording Industry Association of America filed
a lawsuit against Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif.,
seeking damages and an injunction that would effectively shut down
the service. Napster argues that it is not liable for music piracy
since the service does not keep any of the music files on its own
servers. The company says that its software simply allows people to
share information. And many of the songs that are traded have been
authorized for copying by the copyright holders.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry says it has no plans to prosecute
individual users of Napster, although copyright experts say the
industry would have a very strong case. The ``fair use'' doctrine
of copyright law gives consumers the right to make copies of CDs
they own for their personal use, and plenty of music fans make
tapes or even create a duplicate CD for friends without punishment.
But Napster complicates matters because it makes copying possible
at a much greater order of magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of that case, the popular embrace of
Napster has sharpened fears among record industry executives and
some artists that the Internet will undermine the control of
copyright holders over the distribution of their music.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the case is being closely watched by television
and movie executives, who see it as a glimpse into the future of
their own industries. While high-quality video files are currently
too large to be sent quickly over most Internet connections,
high-speed, or broadband, services will soon expose other media to
the opportunities and threats posed by digital distribution.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, a technology known as MP3 has allowed
computer users to compress music into files that are close to CD
quality yet small enough to travel quickly over the Internet. But
there has not been an easy way to find such music and then make it
available to others.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of people use free or inexpensive ``ripping''
software to convert their CDs to MP3 format so they can trade music
with friends or listen to their own music on their computers.
Partly because it is probably illegal and partly because it
requires some technical expertise, few take the trouble to make
those MP3 files available for others to download.
</P>
<P>
   Napster essentially gives everyone who uses the software access
to all the MP3 files on everyone's computers that they are willing
to share. Napster's own servers simply compile a giant, constantly
updated index of all the music available from its users. Users
simply type in the song title or name of the artist they are
looking for, and Napster generates a list of other users who
already have it. (A search Monday for Korn, Santana, and the
Beatles song ''Hey Jude,'' for instance, each yielded more than 100
results). Clicking on one of the selections automatically copies
the file from one user's hard drive to the other's. By linking
thousands of personal computers into a kind of pirates'
cooperative, Napster creates an enormous and continually expanding
library of song titles from which its users can pick and choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got Napster, it was just crazy,'' said Campbell of the
University of Oregon, who had previously sought MP3 files on Web
sites or from friends by e-mail. ``It's much more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster's supporters argue that the music industry needs to
adapt to the digital world and must accept that it cannot continue
making huge profits from traditional retail sales of CDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's to say that because the music business is structured the
way it is structured, that's the way it should always be
structured?'' said Stewart Alsop, a well-known venture capitalist
in Silicon Valley who is considering investing in the company
recently formed by Napster's developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I believe the new model is a better way for artists to
operate, that is a moral justification for feeling good about
investing in Napster,'' Alsop said, ``even though technically what
they're doing is facilitating illegal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The record industry counters that if copyrights are not
protected on the Internet, artists will have no incentive to create
new work. Moreover, the Recording Industry Association of America
sees a crucial distinction between Napster and previous copying
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between you sharing a CD with a friend
versus opening up your entire CD collection to everybody in the
world to take whatever they want,'' said Carey Sherman, the
industry association's senior executive vice president and general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But within the music industry there is also a growing
recognition of a cultural battle that cannot be won in the courts.
If today's teen-agers are growing up with the perception that music
is something that can be had free, the industry fears, copyright
laws will become effectively unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an incredible disconnect out there between what is
normal behavior in the physical world versus the online world,''
Sherman said. ``There are people who think nothing of downloading
entire CD collections on Napster who wouldn't dream of shoplifting
from Tower Records. There's just a massive education program that's
needed here for people to understand what goes into the creation of
music.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Napster users argue that slashing CD prices might be a
better defense than lawsuits and consumer education efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't think the record companies need the money,''
said Raquel Poy, 18, a freshman at the State University of New York
at Albany. She was using Napster to download James Brown's ``Play
That Funky Music, White Boy'' while conducting a telephone
interview last week. ``If I were to go out and buy a CD every
single time I wanted to listen to something, I would go completely
broke. They charge so much for CDs that something like this is a
godsend. They should either lower the price of CDs or make this
legal.''

</P>
<P>
   The industry recognizes that suing consumers for copyright
violations would be counterproductive, which is why the recording
industry aims at services like Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the fastest ways to turn potential customers off is to
say they're all a bunch of thieves,'' said Pam Samuelson, a
copyright law expert at the University of California, Berkeley.
``You start hating your customers and your customers are going to
start hating you back, and that doesn't bode well for your ability
to attract them to buy more stuff from you. It makes them more
inclined to infringe rather than buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Napster makes no money at this point, interested
investors say there is potentially significant value in the large
base of music fans the service has already attracted. For example,
Napster could collect subscription fees from its users or persuade
record labels to use the service as a marketing vehicle, or it
could become an e-commerce outlet for CDs and other merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   As a computer science student at Northeastern University in
Boston last year, Shawn Fanning conceived of Napster as a way to
get his roommate to stop complaining about how hard it was to find
the MP3 files he was looking for on the Internet. His solution was
a cooperative model.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster software, which is downloaded free from the
service's Web site, automates the whole process of cataloging,
indexing and enabling the transfer of music files, even though its
own computers hold no music files at all.
</P>
<P>
   Fanning, who was nicknamed Napster in junior high school because
of his ``nappy hair,'' is trying to turn the service into a
business, financed with money from his uncle and other investors,
including Eileen Richardson, a veteran venture capitalist who is
acting as the company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Napster prevails in the association's lawsuit, its
business model is vague. Paradoxically, its potentially most
valuable product would be the data it aggregates on consumers'
musical tastes and listening habits _ a potential marketing gold
mine for the very record industry that is suing the company.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson argues that Napster actually spurs CD sales by
enabling users to sample artists with whom they might not otherwise
be familiar, often resulting in the purchase of a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Napster has declared a desire to work with the industry to
promote new artists, but that may not be likely at a time when many
record executives liken the service to the getaway car at thousands
of crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The motley crew of staff members at Napster's headquarters in
San Mateo prefer to compare the program to the early days of the
VCR. When the movie industry tried to prevent Sony from selling its
Betamax machine because it could be used to make illegal copies of
videocassettes, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Sony, because
the machine could be used for a legitimate purpose. In the end, the
spread of VCRs resulted in enormous extra profits for the movie
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a few of the MP3 files traded with Napster's
assistance have the blessing of their copyright holders. But the
overwhelming majority of Napster's users would appear to be acting
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Napster is supposed to remove the accounts of those
it knows to be distributing copyrighted material. But the company
argues that it is not responsible for what its users do with its
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are going to do what consumers are going to do,''
said Elizabeth Brooks, the company's vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto investors. Several high-profile Silicon Valley venture
capital firms have expressed serious interest in the company.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons, most Napster users say they simply do
not believe they are doing anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Werner, 37, of Oxford, Conn., says he uses Napster to get
digital files of the records that he bought in the 1970s but can no
longer play for lack of a turntable. ``I bought the right to listen
to King Crimson 15 years ago,'' Werner said. ``I'm just making a
digital copy of what I have in my closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff, a 43-year-old Napster user from Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.,
asked that only his first name be used because he knew that, say,
listening to the Grammy-winning Santana single ``Smooth'' on MP3
instead of paying $5 for it might be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But how illegal is it, really?'' wondered Jeff, who owns a
small office-cleaning business. ``Is it illegal if you go three
miles over the speed limit? We used to have a road here and the
speed limit was 55, and that was crazy. There was never any
traffic, and everybody went 70, and finally they just changed the
speed limit. So yeah, you're breaking the law, but how big a law is
it?''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ No regrets.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's how Nnadubem Gabe Muoneke feels about his college
basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, there would appear to be plenty for the Texas
senior to lament, what with well-chronicled incidents involving
opponents and referees that are highlights, or maybe lowlights, in
the soap opera that Muoneke's four-year stay with the Longhorns has
been.
</P>
<P>
   But Muoneke is not that type of person.
</P>
<P>
   While he would surely not make the same mistakes if given a
chance to rewind history, Muoneke stops short of wishing he could
exclude the distasteful dishes from his full plate of life's
experiences. Even the ones that may have tarnished his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's one (incident) that I would really
choose to erase,'' Muoneke said. ``I'm not a person of regret.
Everything that happens to me happens for a reason, and I'm
thankful. I always thank God for every experience that I go
through.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an interesting ride for the 6-7, 250-pound forward,
from run-ins with officials that led to his being a target even
when on his best behavior to a couple of punches delivered to
opponents who got under his skin.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke was also among the group of Longhorns who ignited the
Tom Penders fiasco with a visit to the home of athletic director
DeLoss Dodds following the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   But with all of that behind him, Muoneke now prepares to play in
his final Big 12 Tournament in Kansas City, Mo., this week as a
respected teammate on the country's No. 13 team. It's a team he
believes can make it to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Just being here for his fourth and final season is something of
which Muoneke says he is proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many players have been through all I've been through and
hung around for four years,'' said Muoneke, a petroleum engineering
major. ``Under the same circumstances, the number of players that
would have transferred or quit by now would be pretty high.''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers tell almost as much of the Muoneke story during his
first three years at Texas as do words.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman year: 5.9 points, 3.8 rebounds and 15.2 minutes per
game. It took some time for him to contribute to a Sweet 16 team,
but he had his best game in the season finale, scoring 19 points
and grabbing 12 rebounds against Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore year: 10.4 points and 5.7 rebounds per game; 43.1
percent shooting; fouled out six times; ejected once. With
officials watching his every move, Muoneke's anger got the best of
him at times, and he struggled to improve under Penders' wild
offensive system.
</P>
<P>
   Junior year: 16.5 points and 6.6 rebounds per game; 49.5 percent
shooting. He may have been the best player in the Big 12,
flourishing under Rick Barnes' inside-dominated system and leading
the Longhorns to the conference title.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the ups and downs of his first three UT seasons,
Muoneke said the experience he learned from most was an incident at
practice a few weeks ago that resulted in Barnes' pulling him from
the starting lineup for a game.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke's ``bad day to be in a bad mood'' at practice turned
into six games of reserve duty, an experiment Barnes had been
considering anyway because Muoneke would bring him something he
needed off the bench _ consistency.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes might never have pulled the trigger on his experiment
if not for the practice incident. Muoneke said he turned to his
Christian faith to handle the demotion, and that is what helped him
learn from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord teaches you that you have to be humbled to learn the
real meaning of being exalted,'' Muoneke said. ``Being humbled the
way I was this year was definitely a huge thing I learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sophomore year, I knew I shouldn't have been talking to
referees. I knew better than that. (Last year) I knew I shouldn't
have hit anybody. Nobody needs to teach me that. I knew that (was
wrong) when I did it. But this one, I have to deal with real
adversity _ adversity that really can affect you mentally. The
other things didn't affect me mentally that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he expects more from himself than any of his coaches
have ever asked him to deliver and he is a tougher reviewer of his
actions than his harshest critics could ever be, it seems no
outside pressure could have much effect on Muoneke.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the thinker and analyst, he is too hard on himself,
according to Barnes, who only echoes the sentiments of Penders, now
the coach at George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is tougher on Gabe than Gabe,'' Barnes said. ``Gabe
really wants to win. He has a lot of pride and a lot of drive. I
mean he really wants to win. People don't understand that he is a
student of the game. He watches everything and breaks it all down.
But I have to tell him not to put so much pressure on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke understands that, but he thinks that is one way for him
to reach his full potential. And he appreciates the difference
Barnes has made in his game, especially his on-court demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge difference; it's not even close,'' Muoneke said.
``He took the potential I had, and he honed it. He molded it. He
made me understand that it wasn't all about physical talent. You
have to separate yourself somehow. He (helped me do) that by
teaching me how to mentally understand the game, and I'm hoping
that separates me in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that separation means an NBA career remains to be seen,
but Muoneke's drive to achieve is too intense to expect anything
less than success on the next level.
</P>
<P>
   Obstacles? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a survivor,'' Muoneke said. ``God made me that way. He's
pulled me through. In situations that I think I'm pretty much dead
in the water, he's always given me a boat to paddle out with. He's
done it more than once, and he'll do it again.''

 Lawmakers look for ways to pressure oil prices down   
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If it's any consolation, Congress is trying to do
something about those eye-popping prices you are paying for
gasoline and home heating fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the fix probably won't be quick, and there appears
to be little consensus on how to get the United States off the
oil-price roller coaster of recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   Strapped by low production and high prices from OPEC countries,
lawmakers from northeastern states lobbied President Clinton last
week to tap the country's 565 million barrels of emergency oil
reserves in Texas and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need immediate action,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, a New
York Democrat. ``None of the long-term solutions are going to look
like much when May 31st rolls around and gas is $2 a gallon.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he has not ruled out turning to the oil reserves.
But critics said that wouldn't necessarily ease demand enough to
reduce prices and could put the country at risk if some catastrophe
depleted other oil production. The reserves alone would keep the
country running for about three months.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from Kansas and Missouri are among those leading a call
for increased production of domestic oil while telling the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in the strongest
terms that its oil quotas could damage dealings with the United
States on other fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is a very unpredictable place, and we need a better
energy policy for domestic production,'' said Sen. Pat Roberts, a
Kansas Republican. ``We need to become less reliant on OPEC.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and Sen. Sam Brownback, also a Kansas Republican, have
endorsed legislation that would try to increase the production of
oil from Kansas and other states. Currently, the United States
produces about 44 percent of its own oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beating on the administration to say, `We better start
addressing this,' or we could see prices go up further,'' Brownback
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give tax credits to marginal oil and gas
producers and provide further tax relief when prices dip to certain
levels. For oil, tax relief would kick in at $15 a barrel.
Nationally, oil was almost $32 a barrel as of Wednesday, up from
$10.72 on Dec. 10, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Tax relief would help producers stay in business when prices
fall, said Bob Krehbiel, executive vice president of the Kansas
Independent Oil and Gas Association. As it is now, many producers
can't survive price dips, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rigs get stacked, people leave the industry and file for
bankruptcy, and we lose production,'' Krehbiel said. ``A year later
we're supposed to come back? Those dips are designed to drive
people out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   But tax relief for domestic producers failed to gain much
headway in Congress last year and has some opposition again,
despite the sharp rise in fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to see us knuckling under to blackmail, which is what
this does,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat.
```It says, `OK, keep the prices high on domestic as well as
foreign oil.' ''
</P>
<P>
   More domestic oil production also is called for in a resolution
Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican, is circulating for
Senate support.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the resolution, however, is to ask that Clinton
demand OPEC increase oil exports when the 11-country group meets
March 27. OPEC should realize that failure to cooperate could have
trade and foreign-relations consequences, Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want us to be a consistent customer, they should be a
consistent supplier,'' Ashcroft said. ``The United States also is a
valuable ally, but we should be an ally only to our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats said they are not sure the resolution would have
much impact. But they agree that OPEC countries need to hear the
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they dial 911 for America, we send thousands of our young
people to the area to defend those countries,'' Lautenberg said.
``It's quite unrealistic to suppose that that enthusiasm can be
developed again if they take advantage of this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Three major petroleum-exporting countries, including Saudi
Arabia, have recommended raising oil production. But the lack of
details and the timing made it likely that prices will remain high
for some time, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback, Roberts and Ashcroft all propose that the United
States consider easing regulations that have protected some regions
from oil exploration, particularly in the Alaska National Wildlife
Refuge in the arctic.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Don Young, a Republican who is Alaska's only House member,
told colleagues in a letter Wednesday that if they supported a bill
to permanently keep the refuge from being tapped for oil, then they
also support $2 per gallon gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's greatest superpower has no significant plan to
develop new U.S. oil,'' Young wrote. ``Instead, (Energy) Secretary
Bill Richardson is instructed to `beg' other countries for oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said enough oil is under the refuge to match Saudi Arabian
oil for 30 years, an estimate called highly inflated by
environmental groups. The average estimate is a 57-day U.S. supply,
according to the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more oil in Detroit,'' said David Nemtzow,
president of the Alliance to Save Energy in Washington, referring
to untapped ways to improve fuel efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumption is back out of control,'' said Nemtzow, who
believes America is paying the price for indulging in luxuries like
sport-utility and other gas-gobbling vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers agree that cutting consumption is at least as
important as increasing production of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to improve our efficiency, we've got to depend more
on natural gas that we have here in abundant supply, and we have to
develop alternative energy sources,'' said Sen. Joe Lieberman, a
Connecticut Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Another need is renewed public awareness that fuel supplies can
shrink and prices can rise, just as they did so dramatically two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``One in three people was born after the energy crisis,''
Nemtzow said. ``They don't remember how vulnerable we are.''

POLICE GADGETS AIM TO FIGHT CRIME WITH 007 STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What if New York City police officers were routinely
equipped with hand-held weapon detectors that could tell them from
a distance whether a suspect was armed?
</P>
<P>
   What if patrol cars had portable minilabs that analyzed DNA so
fast that officers, using a strand of a suspect's hair, could
determine within minutes whether he was the right, or the wrong,
man?
</P>
<P>
   What if video cameras at Kennedy International Airport could
scan thousands of faces, electronically compare them with a
database of photographs, and alert the authorities when the image
of a traveler matched that of a fugitive or a terrorist?
</P>
<P>
   If these sound like the idle dreams of an Ian Fleming fan, do
not blink. Experts say this assortment of Bond-like gadgets could
transform the way suspects are captured and prosecuted, and might
be ready in just a few years. A face-scanning surveillance system
is already in use in one London neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   And at a campaign appearance in Manhattan on Sunday, Hillary
Rodham Clinton called for increased federal spending on research to
improve police technology, including gun detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Prototypes of some new gadgets were showcased in New York in
January at a breakfast symposium held by the Citizens Crime
Commission. ``We are beginning to see a technological revolution in
law enforcement of such immense dimensions that I don't think
anyone knows really where it will go,'' said Tom Reppetto,
president of the commission, a nonprofit city organization that
reviews issues in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Police Department, the United States' largest,
plays an important role in the field, largely because it is often
the entry point for technological innovations. Compstat, the
computer mapping system that tracks crime patterns, spread across
the country after taking root in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly being approached by companies, vendors who
want to sell us their products or want us to test their products,''
Police Commissioner Howard Safir said in an interview last month.
</P>
<P>
   This month, representatives of a California company, Jaycor, are
coming to New York to demonstrate the PepperBall, a launcher that
uses compressed air to shoot projectiles filled with a disabling
powder similar to pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, federal researchers plan to test with the
police a new type of metal detector in the city's schools. They say
it could speed the scanning of students by distinguishing between
the ferrous metal of a gun and the nonferrous metals often used in
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other agency like the NYPD,'' said Craig Beery,
director of sales for the PepperBall. ``They are the influence
maker in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaycor is also developing a hand-held detector of concealed
weapons that should be available in a few years, said Jeremy
Travis, director of the National Institute of Justice, the research
arm of the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has invested over $300,000 in the weapons
detector. It emits a sonic pulse, and when a knife or gun is
present, the pulse is reflected back, triggering an alarm and a
light. Travis said tests on the device had shown that it worked at
a distance of up to 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks on Sunday, Clinton, who is running against Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani for the Senate, said that under Giuliani's
leadership, aggressive street searches for weapons had sown
mistrust in minority neighborhoods. She proposed increasing federal
spending on research ``so that we can create gun detectors that can
scan city streets and pinpoint guns, reducing the need for
stop-and-frisks.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many new technologies, the detector spawned both excitement
and skepticism at the crime commission's breakfast. One former
police official asked about investment opportunities with the
manufacturer. Another, former Commissioner William Bratton, said
the prototype looked too much like a gun and would only increase
tensions in a street encounter. ``I wouldn't invest 2 cents in that
thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Coakley of Jaycor later said he welcomed the criticisms.
``We could give it a flatter, paddle look to make it less
threatening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when new gadgets work perfectly, they often raise concerns
about invasion of privacy and erosion of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   One innovation that has fostered both high hopes and concern
about privacy is the facial-recognition technology being used in
the Newham section of London. Newham had been plagued with high
crime rates for years, but security officials say crime has dropped
30 percent since November 1998, when the video surveillance system
was installed.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 247 cameras are posted at busy locations, like subway
stops. When a camera is hooked up to the software, faces are
repeatedly captured and matched against a list of Newham's 100 most
troublesome criminals. When there is a match, the police are
alerted, and they either dispatch an officer or record the sighting
so that there is a potential suspect if a crime is later reported.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the system has not led to any arrests, but Bob Lack,
Newham's security manager, said it had been a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   The facial-recognition system was developed by Visionics of
Jersey City, N.J. Joseph J. Atick, the company's president, said
one potential use of the product in New York would be at an
airport, where a camera at the bottom of an escalator could capture
60 to 100 faces a minute and instantly compare them with a list of
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The software works by mapping a face, identifying markers that
make it unique, like the distance between the nose and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   To address privacy concerns, the authorities in Britain say,
they discard all the images that are not true matches.
</P>
<P>
   But such systems still concern people like Marc Rotenberg, the
executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington. He worries that surveillance will become so routine
that it will result in ``the investigation and tracking of people
in public places without any reason to believe they are engaged in
wrongdoing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heightened expectations about what these 007-style
technologies would be able to achieve, the U.S. government does not
spend much on research or development, Travis said. His agency
spent $55 million on such research last fiscal year, while the
federal energy research budget topped $2 billion.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Travis was among the experts who said that new, more efficient
devices often pay for themselves. The portable DNA labs under
development, for example, would make it easier for police officers
to collect and analyze samples without the use of an outside
laboratory, experts said. Each portable lab could cost more than
$20,000, but police officials could reduce outside laboratory fees
sharply, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The portable labs, which could be widely available in three
years, use a DNA analysis chip about the size of a credit card.
Saliva or other biological material from a suspect is fed into a
channel in the chip. It travels past a laser that reads 13 DNA
markers, creating a profile of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The chips can identify the markers in about two minutes,
according to Dan Ehrlich, director of a DNA minilab project at the
Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass.
Comparing them with a central database would then take about 12
minutes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the laws were written in such a way,'' Ehrlich said, ``some
local police officer in some unnamed Southern state may pull over a
suspect for drunk driving or having a headlight out, and he may be
able to extract a DNA sample of saliva and punch it back into the
computer and find that the guy was wanted for something else in the
state of New York.''

   NEW YORK _ As Sydney, the hyperemotional soap opera star in
Nicky Silver's new play, ``The Altruists,'' Veanne Cox gives the
kind of performance that you feel you should watch wearing
sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about Sydney is bright to the point of blinding, from
her electric pink pantsuit to the feverish glow of her face as she
swings between pharmaceutically enhanced extremes. Her trim, sharp
body punctures the air with its angularity; her voice lances the
eardrums. And her self-obsession makes the original Narcissus look
like a shrinking violet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when someone this vital crosses your line of vision, how
can you look away? Too thin, too rich, too selfish to live, Sydney
is nonetheless a life force of sorts, at least as presented by the
invaluable Cox. And as empty as Sydney may be, she is the only
fulfilling element in this surprisingly simple-minded satire from
the author of ``Raised in Captivity'' and ``The Food Chain.''
</P>
<P>
   After bursting with great eclat onto the Off Broadway scene in
the mid-1990s, the prolific Silver has recently been plying his
considerable talent in ways that often feel perfunctory. He always
manages to come up with some sparkling epigrams, suggesting
cyanide-laced Champagne, and he usually provides one juicy female
role that the right actress can run with. But there has been an
increasingly recycled feeling in his work, no matter how much he
varies the surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Altruists,'' directed by David Warren, Silver's
longtime collaborator, the playwright again presents a group of
solipsists who can't see past the ends of their neuroses. Though
three of the work's six characters present themselves as selfless
social benefactors, the altruists of the title, they are as
unlikely as any of Silver's people to utter the phrase ``but enough
about me'' and mean it.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to easy scores off easy targets: the social worker
who can't shut up long enough to find out what anyone else is
thinking; the political agitators who can't remember just what the
rally they're headed for is in support of; the woman who, in the
year 2000, reflexively yells, ``Free Nelson Mandela!'' The
liberalism portrayed here may be knee-jerk, but so is the parody of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, who plays the title heroine of the popular soap
``Montana Beach,'' is the one professed materialist onstage, which
gives her an edge in self-awareness. Her lover, Swallow (Sam
Robards), a womanizing political activist, and her brother, Ronald
(Joey Slotnick), the social worker, are different types of deluded
romantics.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Cybil (Kali Rocha), a self-described lesbian who
tends to forget not only what she is protesting but also her avowed
sexual preference, and Lance (Eddie Cahill), a beautiful, stupid
street hustler who is _ wouldn't you know it? _ the only character
who approaches moral goodness.
</P>
<P>
   Presented in alternating scenes in three Manhattan apartments
(the polished triptych of a set is by Neil Patel), ``The
Altruists'' has the fuguelike structure that is a specialty of
Silver. As usual, his characters speak in monologues even when they
are ostensibly engaged in dialogue. It seems appropriate that much
of the evening's ranting is directed at an anonymous, sheet-covered
and totally unresponsive person in Sydney's bed.
</P>
<P>
   The performers are a likable, energetic lot, and Warren keeps
them moving at a sprightly pace. But except for Cox and Cahill, who
has the advantage of playing a character who has not been written
with contempt, the ensemble members are defeated by their status as
dartboards.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of charming moments of self-conscious
theatricality in which the characters deliver (or try to)
autobiographical soliloquies and several funny coital and
postcoital exchanges. (Slotnick, playing the archetypal Silver
schlemiel, says to Lance the hustler the morning after: ``You're
beautiful. What do you weigh? Do you know?'')
</P>
<P>
   Only Cox, an expert in neurotic intensity (as she demonstrated
in ``The Waiting Room'' and the revival of ``Company''),
consistently breaks through the rote quality that pervades the
evening. It's not that she gets better lines, it's that she
delivers them with such spectacular vehemence.
</P>
<P>
   Silver has written, and no doubt will write, far better works
than ``The Altruists.'' In the meantime, there is the blaze of
energy that is Cox, resourcefully turning theatrical cardboard into
fuel for a one-woman bonfire.

CHINESE MILITARY TAKES AIM AT TAIWAN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>

   BEIJING _ In one of the most strident statements yet on Taiwan,
the Chinese military said on Monday that it would ``spare no effort
in a blood-soaked battle'' to protect China's territorial integrity
and that China would not be tricked into negotiations with Taiwan
leaders who secretly oppose re-joining the motherland.
</P>
<P>
   While it did not mention by name any candidates in Taiwan's
March 18 presidential election, the warning, in an editorial of the
Liberation Army Daily, seemed aimed at Chen Shui-bian, the
candidate of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Chen and his party campaigned for Taiwan's formal
independence from China, which considers the island an integral
part of the nation that was separated by civil war. Chen has
recently moderated this position, saying that a formal declaration
would not be necessary because Taiwan already enjoys de facto
independence. He promises that, if elected, he would seek deeper
economic ties and peace talks with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   But in language clearly intended to describe Chen, Monday's
editorial said that Taiwan leaders who ``consistently pushed for
independence'' have used ``sweet-sounding rhetoric to bluff that
they want to have `benevolent harmony, positive cooperation and
lasting peace' with the mainland _ all to swindle the Taiwan
populace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must on no account be dazzled by the pretty phrases,'' the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial from the military's official mouthpiece was
reprinted in People's Daily and other newspapers, indicating that
the views had been approved at the highest levels of the Communist
Party. And the government also signaled its resolution when the
finance minister, Xiang Huaicheng, announced a 12.7 percent rise in
military spending for this year.
</P>
<P>
   While Chen appeared to be the subject of the editorial, neither
of Taiwan's other leading candidates has unambiguously accepted
what China calls an unshakable precondition for talks: that Taiwan
is legally part of a Beijing-centered ``One China.''
</P>
<P>
   Some creative compromises in language will be needed if the
hopes in Taipei and Beijing for renewed dialogue later this year,
with a new Taiwanese president, are to be realized.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's military editorial was part of an orchestrated barrage
of warnings from senior leaders here as Taiwan's election
approaches, the American Congress debates a proposal for closer
military ties with the island, and the Clinton administration
weighs Taiwan's request for advanced weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It will be many years before China has the military capacity to
mount a blockade of Taiwan, let alone invade it, foreign analysts
say. But the Chinese leaders have clearly decided that they must
pressure the island now to halt a slide toward independence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a policy statement on Feb. 21 that created new worries in
Taipei and Washington, China said more clearly than before that
Taiwan's indefinite foot-dragging in negotiations, as well as
outright independence, could trigger an attack. The report also
stressed China's desire for a peaceful settlement and its
willingness to grant Taiwan extraordinary autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   That report gave no deadline for talks and none of the
subsequent statements indicate changes in the basic
carrot-and-stick policy it outlined. But all the recent
pronouncements have stressed China's desire to secure the return of
Taiwan ``at an early date.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Sunday, while emphasizing the desire for a peaceful
settlement, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who is considered a moderate
on the issue, said China ``will not sit idly by and watch any
serious separatist activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's newspapers featured a speech by President Jiang Zemin
in which he restated China's preference for negotiations but also
the threat of ``drastic measures'' if Taiwan delays indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to legislators on Sunday, Gen. Zhang Wannian, a top
military leader, said: ``The two sides of the strait cannot remain
perpetually divided'' and ``Taiwanese independence means war.''
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan, the three major presidential candidates have all
described themselves as peacemakers, promising to encourage
economic ties and engage in talks with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, none has disowned President Lee Teng-hui's
assertion that Taiwan's dealings with the mainland should be
conducted on a state-to-state basis. Lee's assertive stance has
been popular and it appears to be politically impossible for any
candidate to backtrack too far.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Vice President Lien Chan, the candidate of the
governing Nationalist Party, warned voters that it would be
reckless to elect Chen because of his ``independence platform.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lien also said: ``The so-called state-to-state relationship
is the constant policy of my country and my government,'' repeating
the phrase that so outraged Beijing, when Lee first used it last
summer.

SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN STATE'S TANKER RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Monday struck down the tough oil-spill
prevention rules enacted by Washington state after the 1989 Exxon
Valdez disaster in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision has wide import for environmental
protection and states' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said federal laws pre-empt states from setting
their own standards to prevent oil spills from tankers _ except to
address ``peculiar'' conditions in local waterways, the justices
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of Washington has enacted legislation in an area
where the federal interest has been manifest since the beginning of
our republic and is now well established,'' Justice Anthony Kennedy
wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The decision reversed a unanimous 1998 Ninth U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals ruling that said states can enforce their own laws. That
ruling upheld an earlier U.S. District Court decision.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's rules, designed to prevent an Exxon Valdez-type
disaster in the state, required additional crew training, a higher
standard of English-language proficiency for crewmembers, increased
navigation-watch requirements and accident reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, siding with the Clinton administration and the oil
shipping industry, said such state rules venture into the field of
foreign affairs, affecting operations outside state waters.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping industry lawyers argued that state rules would upset
international treaties, which require uniform national standards.
</P>
<P>
   In light of ``considerable federal interest at stake,'' the
justices Monday ordered a lower court to decide whether other
federal law pre-empts state rules.
</P>
<P>
   The decision drew immediate fire from Washington Gov. Gary Locke
and state Attorney General Christine Gregoire.
</P>
<P>
   Locke called the ruling ``a major set-back for states that want
to take prudent steps to prevent oil-spill catastrophes. ...
Oil-spill protection for the entire nation will be set at the
lowest-common-denominator, with no recognition that some marine
habitats deserve a higher level of protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also promised to ``press Congress and the (Clinton)
administration to move quickly to compensate for the greater safety
protections state regulation would have offered by substantially
increasing Coast Guard funding and efforts to ensure safe
shipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire called the decision a ``terrible blow to Washington's
Puget Sound protection efforts,'' and requested the Coast Guard
immediately strengthen tanker regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's decision has tied the state's hands from ensuring
tankers will safely transit Washington waters and that there will
be full and adequate protection for Puget Sound,'' Gregoire said.
``We know better than those in Washington, D.C., how to protect
this natural resource gem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this exposes our coastline to more danger,'' added
Bill Collins, a state assistant attorney general who handled the
case since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one states and territories, seven Washington counties,
several fishing groups and environmental organizations nationwide,
as well as a citizens' group from Alaska's Prince William Sound,
filed legal briefs supporting Washington's case.
</P>
<P>
   The tanker industry and the federal government were supported by
15 foreign governments and a variety of shipping and business
groups. Those groups are largely concerned with preventing their
members from having to comply with different regulations in
different states, which they said would be confusing and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, deeply,'' said Fred Felleman, whose
environmental organization, Ocean Advocates, long has supported
permanently stationing a rescue tug for tankers in the Strait of
Juan de Fuca. ``Our waterway is both one of the most traffic laden
and one of the most biologically rich, which the Coast Guard alone
is not equipped to take account of.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the International Association of Independent
Tanker Owners, known as Intertanko, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the state's 1991 regulations were aimed at
minimizing human error in the relatively narrow Straits of Juan de
Fuca and Puget Sound. Human error is accountable for 60 percent to
80 percent of all oil spills, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old court state case that the Supreme Court justices
spent a good deal of time analyzing, Ray v. Atlantic Richfield, was
aimed at minimizing mechanical and technical hazards in tankers
that could lead to oil spills. It led to double-hulled tankers and
tug escorts for them in Washington waters. Washington's late U.S.
Sen. Warren Magnusson, meanwhile, succeeded in getting Congress to
ban supertankers from the Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Tanker industry lawyers argued that the state's rules are
already covered under the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, enacted by
Congress a year after the Exxon Valdez drove onto a charted reef
and dumped 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Washington state adopted additional standards for
training, language, staffing and drug-testing of oil tanker crews.
</P>
<P>
   The state's rules require tanker operators to file
spill-prevention plans and to have three licensed officers on the
bridge _ one more than usual.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Intertanko complained in federal court that state's
rules were inconsistent with uniform industry standards that took
20 years to create.
</P>
<P>
   Intertanko, a Norway-based organization representing 75 percent
of the world's tanker companies, lost in U.S. District Court. The
Clinton administration intervened on the organization's behalf in
the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   During arguments before the Supreme Court in December, some
justices expressed consternation at the appeals court's reasoning.
Others, particularly Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, expressed concern about whether federal
regulators could adequately address the peculiarities of local
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist referred to a ``very strong local interest'' in a
requirement such as ``in heavy fog in Seattle harbor, you have to
have a tug. I, for one, would be loath to read some general federal
statute as pre-empting something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the state's legal brief, the waters of Washington
state are more difficult to navigate than those in Prince William
Sound because of persistent fog, heavy fishing traffic and narrow
waterways. State officials argue that an oil spill could be
devastating to fish and wildlife and to the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Monday noted that issue and left the state
with some wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said states can regulate their own ports and waterways
so long as the rules are based on ``the peculiarities of local
waters'' and do not conflict with federal rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``On remand, Washington may argue that certain of its
regulations, such as its watch requirement in times of restricted
visibility ... are necessary to address the peculiarities of Puget
Sound,'' Kennedy wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The state also has a role in setting regulations where they do
not conflict with the Coast Guard, which is responsible for design,
maintenance, staffing and operation of tankers, Kennedy noted.
</P>
<P>
   And federal law allows states to set their own liability rules
for oil-spill pollution, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   For Locke, that at least left open some state control over its
own environmental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court admitted that the federal standards may not
provide the necessary level of protection _ and we absolutely
agree,'' Locke said.

ELK HERD DODGES RELOCATION _ FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KRISTIN DIZON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANFORD, Wash. _ A battle of wills unfolded between a herd of
animals and a cowboy in a whirlybird Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story: Herding elk is like trying to lasso the
wind.
</P>
<P>
   The largest relocation of elk in Washington history was supposed
to get underway with 50 head herded by helicopter into a holding
pen here. The elk were then to be moved by trailer four hours east
to the Blue and Selkirk mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded simple, but in the crisp dawn hours on the dry,
shrubby steppes just across the road from the nation's largest
nuclear cleanup site, untamed nature took over.
</P>
<P>
   The elk, you see, failed to read the relocation plan.
</P>
<P>
   Chopper pilot Gary Brennan started the round-up in the
Rattlesnake hills, where crescent-shaped fingers of snow nestle in
the crevasses of the taupe and dun-colored mounds. Brennan pushed
several groups of animals together in a moving column of nearly 100
elk.
</P>
<P>
   He drove them three miles, then turned them toward a V-shaped
fence _ a funnel to ease them into a corral. But just when it
looked like the wildlife would run into the snare, they turned tail
and the cat-and-mouse pursuit started over again.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth they went, with Brennan giving chase and
directing them back toward the trap. A few jumped right through the
burlap-covered wire fence; others dashed into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the whirring roar of helicopter blades at their hind
quarters did the trick. At one point Brennan, who skillfully zipped
and dove and looped toward the herd during the three-house chase,
came so close that he said he had to pull up to avoid grazing them
with the helicopter's landing skids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like putting a cat in a bucket of water _ they just don't
want to go,'' said Brennan, of Grey Bull, Wyo. ``I know how to push
these animals and when to give them a break and get their heart
rates down.''
</P>
<P>
   A second, shorter attempt in the afternoon with another group of
elk yielded even worse results. One cow was trampled in the frenzy
and had to be destroyed. The carcass was taken to the Yakama
Indians, who skinned and cleaned it immediately, said Dale
Bambrick, regional director of the Washington Department of Fish
and Wildlife. Officials had expected a mortality rate of as high as
five percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The combined effort of the federal and state Fish and Wildlife
departments, along with volunteer help and tribal input, was
designed to move about 200 Rocky Mountain elk from the Hanford
site's 77,000-acre Arid Lands Ecology reserve. The
trap-and-transfer project is expected to cost about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, wildlife officials hope to move the
animals from their windswept, sagebrush habitat to thickly
forested, snowy mountains. About 100 are headed to the Selkirk
mountains in Pend Oreille County; another 100 will go to the
southeastern corner of the state.
</P>
<P>
   A total of about 500 elk will be relocated in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The herd was first established in 1975, when eight elk began
frequenting the unpolluted buffer area of the Hanford nuclear
complex. Today the herd, which cannot be hunted on the preserve,
numbers more than 800, and experts fear that such a continued
growth rate will overtax the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers and ranchers in the area have long complained about
grazing damage to crops, grassland and fences, resulting in a
number of financial claims that the state is processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it grows, if we did nothing, this site could be on the
verge of ecological collapse,'' said Bambrick. ``Look how much
trouble we had with them today. Imagine we're three years down the
road and there are 2,200 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten percent of the relocated elk will be fitted with radio
collars and tracked to see if they're adapting well to their new
locales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both places are good locations to put elk, but, frankly, it's
an experiment,'' said Madonna Luers, a spokesperson at state Fish
and Wildlife's Spokane office.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty elk were relocated in a test run last week. They appear
to be doing fine and are mingling with the local elk population,
Luers said. But those elk were more easily rounded up with net
guns, which is more expensive, labor-intensive and dangerous than
herding with helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Two elk died last week when their necks snapped while struggling
in the nets. The carcasses were picked up by the nearby Wanapum
Indians, who fed a crowd of 150 at a feast last weekend, said
Clayton Buck, a cultural resources specialist with the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Those 20 elk were tested for radioactive compounds and found to
have lower concentrations of radiation then elk at higher
altitudes, said Kathy Criddle with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. They also were disease-free.
</P>
<P>
   No one was sure why Monday's roundup went wrong. One theory was
that the elk smelled humans and were spooked, another held that the
elk didn't like the 12-foot high fence or thought the entryway into
a walled corral was too small.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, everyone agreed that elk are a sharp bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah. They're pretty smart. You better believe it,'' said
Spike Norton, who volunteered his stock trailer to move the elk to
an area near Usk, where he has a ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Norton, who drove 11 of the test elk to their new home last
week, said people in Pend Oreille County are excited about the
transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for elk to view up there is pretty heavy,'' he
said. ``We hope that when those hunters get through with them,
there's something left for us to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, about 50 Fish and Wildlife employees,
volunteers and media made up a herd of its own on a ridge
overlooking the round-up site.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the crowd bet on who would run out of gas first _ the
pilot or the herd. One man remarked, ``We've got the best pilot on
Earth, by God. If he can't get them ... ''
</P>
<P>
   But officials are counseling patience. They widened the corral
gateway late in the afternoon and made other adjustments to the
trap. They'll try again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everything happens the minute you want it to,'' Bambrick
said. ``We're going to re-group and come back.''
